Mr. President, I will make one comment at this point, and \nthat is, this morning I had occasion to see Senator Reid as he was \npassing by my office. We talked a little bit about history and the fact \nthat the very office in the Capitol where I sit was where the House of \nRepresentatives met in 1801 to determine who would be President because \nthere had been a tie in the election. The House of Representatives \nvoted 36 ballots before they determined the winner by 1 vote to be \nThomas Jefferson. He won over Aaron Burr. He went on to be one of the \ngreatest Presidents in the history of our country. I leave that for a \nlittle thought for all concerned, and now worried, about what the \nfuture holds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the leader leaves the floor, it is my \nunderstanding Senator Specter wants to speak for about 10 minutes and \nthen we can use up the rest of the time until 12:30. Is the leader \nexpecting to recess at 12:30 and come back at 2:15 p.m.?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is my intent. While we may not have normal policy \nluncheons, it is my intent to recess at 12:30 so we can have luncheons \nas a group or individually, and we will come back after the luncheons, \nI presume at 2:15. Hopefully, we will close the session by 2:30. I will \nwant to make sure that Senator Daschle has been consulted on that and \nagrees with that.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to the leader that when we do reconvene at 2:15, or \nmaybe even by 12:30, I will be in a position to tell the majority \nleader how many on our side wish to speak. I know Senator Daschle does. \nI know Senator Dorgan perhaps wants to speak. But I will, as soon as I \nlearn, advise the staff and the Senator of how much time we will need.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation which would seek to modernize voting procedures throughout \nthe United States in Federal elections. I do not intend to become \ninvolved in the current controversies but instead have been considering \nwhere we go from here in order to try to prevent the kind of concerns \nand problems which we have at the present time.\n  In Pennsylvania, I have had considerable comment from my constituents \nabout the issue as to, in the electronic age, with computers available \nand with electronic devices available why do we have some sections of \nthe country voting by paper ballot and why do we have a great variety \nof election procedures in voting, so that there is not uniformity and \nthere is not a prompt count.\n  Looking at that issue, it seems to me that we can do much better on \nhow we vote in Federal elections. The thought on my mind is Congress \nshould address this issue at least as to Federal elections, leaving the \nmatters of State and local elections to State officials under our \nFederalist concepts.\n  It is not really practical for someone to lay out an entire bill with \nthe procedures to implement these objectives, but it seems to me--and I \nhave been talking to some of my colleagues about it, and there are a \nnumber of Senators who are thinking in the same direction--that it will \nbe useful to establish a commission which would take up the question of \nhow we have election procedures which take advantage of computers and \nelectronics so that votes may be tabulated accurately and promptly, and \nnot have the kinds of issues which arose in our election on November 7.\n  I do, therefore, submit, Mr. President, the structure of a bill to \nestablish a commission for the comprehensive study of voting procedures \nfor Federal elections, to take a look at not only Federal elections but \nState and local elections as well, but with the purpose of finding a \nway to have accurate reporting, electronic reporting, and speedy \nreporting.\n  This bill is not in concrete. I am now soliciting cosponsors. I think \nwe will have other cosponsors shortly. Since we have an abbreviated \nsession today, with only a limited amount of time, I am introducing the \nbill at this time.\n  Mr. President, I will make just a comment or two about the electoral \ncollege.\n  As we have moved ahead with the concerns under the current contest \nbetween Governor Bush and Vice President Gore, I have found many of my \nconstituents--and have noted comments in the media across the country--\nwho are surprised about the way the electoral college works.\n  Illustratively, in my State of Pennsylvania, with 23 electoral votes, \nand Vice President Gore having received 51 percent of the vote and \nGovernor Bush having received 47 percent, that Vice President Gore got \nall 23 of Pennsylvania's electoral votes.\n  In discussions I have found--candidly, a surprise to me--a fair \namount of concern among my constituents about changing the electoral \ncollege. There is some confusion that any change in the electoral \ncollege may have some impact on the current contest between Governor \nBush and Vice President Gore, which, of course, is not the case. This \ncurrent election is going to be determined under the existing rules of \nthe electoral college as it now stands. It seems to me that \nconsideration ought to be given to a modification.\n  One approach would be to go to the popular election of a President. \nThat appears to be unrealistic because there are so many smaller States \nwhich have only one Member of the House, two Senators, so they get \nthree electoral votes. On a proportionate basis, they would be entitled \nto a 1-435th proportion in relation to the House, there being 435 \nMembers of the House, but they have a 3-535th proportion, taking the \nHouse's 435 Members and the Senate's 100 Members. Since it takes a two-\nthirds vote to pass a constitutional amendment in the Congress, and \nratification by three-fourths of the States, I think it is unrealistic \nto look to the popular election of a President.\n\n  But there is an alternative way where it might be achieved; that is, \nwith a proportional representation. S.J. Res. 51 was introduced in the \n96th Congress by Senator Cannon, cosponsored by Senators Thurmond, \nGoldwater, Harry Byrd and Talmadge, which provided for a constitutional \namendment for proportional representation, which might be the way to \ngo.\n  Illustratively, in a State such as Pennsylvania, with 23 electoral \nvotes, and a vote split of 51 percent and 47 percent, it might be \ndivided as 12 votes for Vice President Gore and 11 votes for Governor \nBush. I think this is going to require further study.\n  I do think it is plain that the purpose of having the electoral \ncollege, as reflected in the Federalist Papers, was to provide a buffer \nbetween the common voter, who was thought at that time not to be \nsufficiently informed to directly elect a President. That, of course, \nwas changed when we had a constitutional amendment providing for the \ndirect election of Senators.\n  In the original Constitution, Senators were elected by the State \nlegislatures, so that the common man did not\n\n[[Page S11513]]\n\nvote directly for a Senator. But that has been changed as we have come \nto understand that in modern times every voter has a full capacity to \nmake the direct election of an elected official with Senators, and I \nthink on the same analogy to the President as well. But because of the \nextra leverage for the smaller States, which I do not contest, the \ndirect election is not realistic. But perhaps a proportional election \nthrough the electoral college might be appropriate, with the smaller \nStates having the additional advantage of having two electors, \naccounting for their two Senators. I think that is going to require \nfurther study. Again, I have been discussing that with my colleagues.\n  I do think people in this country want to know what our plans are for \nthe future. I also think there ought to be an awareness that many of us \nin the Congress are considering whether the electoral college should \nstand as it now is or whether it should be changed.\n  An intermediate ground may be this proportional voting of the \nelectoral college, as reflected in S.J. Res. 51 from the 96th Congress. \nI believe there is no doubt that we need to modernize election \nprocedures, and that the way to go would be a five-person commission \nwith appointments made by the President, the majority leader of the \nSenate, the minority leader of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, \nand the minority leader of the House. These matters ought to be subject \nto consideration to try to eliminate some of the problems which the \ncountry now faces.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3269\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Who seeks recognition?\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand we are in morning business; \nand we can speak for up to how long?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Up to 5 minutes, with each side controlling 10 \nminutes total.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I commend and congratulate my friend and \ncolleague from Pennsylvania for introducing this legislation to set up \na commission. I think it is very timely.\n  I would just say to my friend from Pennsylvania, it seems that one of \nthe things I have picked up in traveling around Iowa is that people are \ndeeply concerned and somewhat unnerved by the fact that we have all \nthese different types of voting machines around the United States. We \nare a mobile society. We move a lot. We go from one jurisdiction to \nanother. You can go from one county to another and have a completely \ndifferent system of voting on machines. Plus, some of these are really \noutdated. We have technology today that really can ensure that your \nvote is as you want it and that there are no mistakes made unless you \nintentionally want to do something such as that. We just have not \nadopted that new technology.\n  I think the proper course would be to set up some type of commission, \ngive them the proper funding, and make sure it is a bipartisan \ncommission that would be evenly divided, that could go out and look at \nthese things and perhaps report back to Congress in due time. I \nunderstand the Senator said he wanted 1 year to report back, if I am \nnot mistaken.\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the distinguished Senator will yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The legislation provides that the commission would have \n1 year to complete a study and then 6 additional months to file a \nreport. It is structured to be bipartisan, with the leadership of the \nHouse and Senate each having one appointee and the President having a \nfifth appointee, so the bipartisanship would be assured.\n  If I may add, it is well known the Senator from Iowa and I worked \nvery closely together on the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education. We just had a brief informal discussion, so I \nmay have picked up a cosponsor here before 12:30.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I think you might. In fact, in my comments I was going to \ntalk about that. Obviously, we are thinking along the same lines. I \nreally do believe there ought to be more uniformity, especially in \nnational elections, on the type of equipment that is used. I must \nadmit, being from Iowa, we don't use punch cards. That went out years \nago. I was quite surprised some States were still using punch cards. \nReally, they are open to all kinds of problems. Some States still use \nthe old lever, the old hand-cranked machines.\n  I don't know; does the Senator know how many different types of \nvoting machines are used in the United States today?\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Senator will yield, I do not. There are even \ndifferent kinds of machines used in Pennsylvania, and there are still \nmany paper ballots which are being used. It is astounding not to have \nrapid, accurate results on election night, with computers being what \nthey are and the possibilities of electronics. This may be a matter on \nwhich the Federal Government will have to do some financing. The study \nought to be made. Congress ought to consider it and try to solve at \nleast a big part of this problem.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the remainder of the \nDemocratic time be allotted to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  I note many Americans have expressed concern about the time it is \ntaking to determine whom the American people elected as President last \nTuesday. We just came out of a meeting. A bunch of reporters stopped me \njust off the floor, talking to me about the crisis and shouldn't we \nhave to get this resolved. I said: Wait a minute, there is no crisis in \nthis country right now. Frankly, I am heartened to see that most \nAmericans' first priority is to ensure the votes are counted with \nprecision, accuracy, and fairness. The American people know how \nimportant is one of the bedrocks of our great democracy, the idea no \nmatter how rich or poor, powerful or weak, no matter what race, creed, \nor sex, the vote of every American counts equally: One person, one \nvote.\n  We can all agree this Presidential election is one of the closest in \nour Nation's history. Now it appears that Vice President Al Gore has \nwon the popular vote. He currently leads by about 223,000 votes. He \nalso, right now, is ahead in the electoral college, but that electoral \ncollege outcome is much less clear. At this point, whichever candidate \nwins Florida probably wins the Presidency, and right now, according to \nthe latest reports, only 388 votes separate the two candidates. To put \nit in context, that is .0067 percent of the votes in Florida.\n  Frankly, I think we can all agree the spirit of ``whatever it takes \nto win and to heck with the will of the voters'' has no place in \nAmerican politics. So I was pleased to see the initial polling shows \nthat these efforts have failed. According to a recent Newsweek poll, 72 \npercent of American adults believe that making certain the count is \nfair and accurate is more important than rushing to judgment to get \nmatters resolved quickly.\n  Yes, democracy is slow. Yes, democracy takes time. But it is worth \nit, and the American people understand that. There is no crisis. We \nshould take our time, and we should determine accurately what the will \nof the voters really is.\n  Much has been said of the hand counting of ballots in Florida, as if \nthat were something strange and new. We do hand counting of ballots all \nthe time for sheriff, for local county commissioner--all the time. This \nis done at every election in the United States, Federal and State and \nlocal, when it is very close. Why is the office of President less \nimportant than local sheriff? It seems to me if hand counting of a \nballot is important for the local sheriff's race, it is equally \nimportant, even more important, for the highest office of the land.\n  It has been said that machines are neither Democratic nor Republican. \nThat is true. But let's keep in mind, the only reason we use voting \nmachines in this country is, No. 1, it is cheaper and, No. 2, it is \nquicker. Still, the most accurate way to determine each person's vote \nis to have that person walk into a voting place, give each a paper \nballot, and have each go in there and mark the boxes with an x, fold \nthe ballot, step out, and put it in a box. Then when the polls close, a \ncommittee looks at these ballots and counts each one. That is clearly \nthe most accurate way of counting votes.\n  Why don't we do that in America? Obviously, you would not know the \noutcome of elections for months afterwards because it would take that \nlong\n\n[[Page S11515]]\n\nto hand count all the ballots. Second, it would be prohibitively \nexpensive. But the idea that somehow machines are more accurate than \nhuman counts is just nonsensical. It is just not true. The human count \nis still the most accurate.\n  When the votes are really close and when the office is at stake \nbecause of the closeness of the votes--.0067 percent of the votes in \nFlorida, as I stand here--it is incumbent upon us to do what we would \ndo in a local sheriff's race or supervisor's race, and that is to hand \ncount these ballots.\n  Again, having said that, I will have more to say about it later on \nthis afternoon. I see the hour is 12:30 so the time has come for our \nrecess. We will be back in at 2:15. At that time, I want to explore a \nlittle further the idea of having a standardized procedure for \nstandardized voting machines for the entire country, one on which \npeople can rely no matter where they live. People move all the time. \nThey should not have to be confronted with different voting machines.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be listed as a cosponsor of \nthe legislation just introduced by Senator Specter of Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Has the hour of 12:30 arrived, Mr. President?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think the resolution we have been waiting \nfor has arrived.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I understand that \nthe Senate will reconvene at 2:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate reconvenes at 2:15 I be recognized for up to 15 minutes to \nfinish my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think we have a previous consent agreement \nthat allows for each of the leaders to present a list of those who wish \nto speak.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I did not hear the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I guess it is not an actual unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Is there objection to the request? Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I had asked for a quorum call for just a \nmoment so that staff could complete certain paperwork. So it may be \nunderstood why I asked for the quorum call and asked that it be \nrescinded so promptly. On behalf of our distinguished majority leader, \nI have been asked to make this unanimous consent request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11515-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I rise to call to the attention of my \ncolleagues and the many people across this Nation the fact that the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration has rushed to judgment \nand published a huge, extremely burdensome ergonomics rule. They had \ntalked about this previously with bipartisan support. We had included \nin the Labor-HHS bill, as well as others, legislative vehicles stating \nthat they should not go forward with this measure because of the \nburdens it imposed. I have in my hand the voluminous computer printout \nof the rule. I chair the small business committee, and I can just see \nthe thrill and excitement with which a small business will view this \nrule coming down on their backs.\n  I hope this body can take action to stop the implementation of this \nrule\n\n[[Page S11516]]\n\nuntil OSHA itself and the scientific evidence can provide real guidance \nto small business and other businesses on how to reduce ergonomics \ninjuries.\n  In the last 7 years, the incidence of ergonomics injuries has gone \ndown by a third--26 percent in carpal tunnel syndrome and 33 percent in \ntendonitis. It is in the interest of employers and employees to reduce \nto the greatest extent possible the very painful, time-consuming and \nprofit-consuming impact of ergonomics injuries.\n  Well, OSHA decided they had been working on this for a long time and \nthey wanted to get something out the door before the Clinton \nadministration left office. Our political friends said we have to have \nan ergonomics rule. This overrules State workers compensation laws and \ntells employees if they have an ergonomics injury, they can collect \nmore workers comp than the State provides them. We are overruling State \nworkers comp laws.\n  It also tells employees that if you get an ergonomics injury--say you \nare in a bowling league on your own time, or you are crocheting in the \nevening and you come up with an ergonomics injury--if that is made \nworse by the job that you are doing, then your employer has had it. \nThis ergonomics rule doesn't give any sound guidelines on how employers \nand employees working together can reduce ergonomics injuries. That is \nwhat we need from OSHA, not a punitive measure which says if somebody \nhas an ergonomics injury, you are dead; your workers comp account is \ngoing to be held hostage and you are going to be subject to lawsuits.\n  All this says is, that if the highway speed limit sign says don't \ndrive too fast and you are driving down the road at what you think is a \nreasonable speed and a State trooper flags you over and says: You know \nwhat, you were going 40 miles an hour, and I think 35 miles an hour is \na reasonable speed, so you are guilty. That is precisely what they \npropose to do with this ergonomics regulation, and it affects \nbusinesses of all sizes.\n  I have talked to soft drink distributors who say: If we don't go out \nof business, we are going to have to buy equipment and get rid of \nemployees to have machines doing the work. You can talk to people in \nthe delivery business--express delivery or any other delivery \nbusiness--and they know that no matter what they try to do, even if \nthey continue to reduce the incidence of ergonomics injuries, any time \nthere is an ergonomics injury, they are going to be held responsible \neven if they didn't initially cause it. Well, we have the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement and Fairness Act and we have lawsuits \nthat are about to be filed by many organizations representing small \nbusiness. I support those lawsuits. I hope this body can act to stop \nthe implementation of this draconian rule.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I said this morning, we can certainly \nall agree that this Presidential election is one of the closest in our \nNation's history. While Al Gore appears to have won the popular vote, \nleading by 223,000 votes, the electoral college outcome is much less \nclear, even though Vice President Gore also leads in the electoral \ncollege vote at this time. At this point, whichever candidate wins \nFlorida will probably win the Presidency. Right now, according to the \nlatest reports, only 388 votes separate the two candidates. That is \n0.0067 percent of the votes in Florida--less than seven-thousandths of \n1 percent.\n  Yet when it appeared that the extremely close vote in Florida would \ndecide the election, rather than waiting for a careful counting of the \nballots as required by Florida law, the Bush campaign pushed for \nacceptance of the current count. The American people disagree. \nAccording to a recent Newsweek poll, 72 percent of American adults \nbelieve that making certain the count is fair and accurate is more \nimportant than rushing to judgment to get matters resolved quickly. \nDemocracy is slow, yes; democracy takes time, yes; but democracy is \nstill the fairest system of all, and the American people understand \nthat.\n  It was very discouraging that just days after the Bush campaign \nsharply criticized our respected former Secretary of State, Warren \nChristopher, for leaving open the possibility of seeking judicial \nreview of highly questionable portions of the process, the Bush lawyers \nthemselves went to Federal court to block a hand recount of \nquestionable ballots--a process that is generally recognized as much \nmore accurate than machine counting.\n  I also find it highly ironic that the Bush lawyers chose to try to \nblock a hand recount when they themselves, according to news reports, \nsupported a hand recount in New Mexico. In fact, in 1997, Governor Bush \nhimself signed a Texas law that seems to encourage hand recounts of \ndisputed votes.\n  Now, as we all know, just a few hours ago, the latest attempt to \nblock a complete and fair count has been upheld by a court in Florida, \nalthough an appeal is expected shortly, if in fact it hasn't happened \nby now.\n  The court ruled that Florida's Secretary of State, who was an active \nBush supporter and traveled around the Nation on his behalf, could cut \noff the county's recount efforts at 5 p.m. this afternoon. She made the \ndecision to end the count at that time, 5 p.m. today, knowing full well \nthat the hand count of the ballots allowed by Florida law cannot \npossibly be completed by that point in time.\n  In America, we are certainly used to getting results of our elections \nfrom the news networks almost immediately after the polls close, \nsometimes 3 or 4 hours later in relatively close elections but almost \ncertainly the next morning. However, we have to realize that what we \nheard from the networks early on election night were not actual \nelection results but exit poll results based on a very few counted \nballots. When the difference between the candidates falls below a \ncouple of points, we have to wait for an actual vote count. When \nthe difference falls below a few tenths of 1 percent, we have to wait \nfor a careful recounting of the votes.\n\n  There are several important reasons for these procedures. First, \nprecinct and county election officials are dealing with many numbers \nquickly on election night. Mistakes are unavoidable. But in this case, \nwhere the difference is not 1 percent or a half percent but less than \nseven one-thousandths of 1 percent, or just over 300 votes out of over \n5 million cast, we cannot allow any room for error.\n  The very machines that we use to count votes are prone to \ninaccuracies. The inaccuracies in some Florida counties occurred \nbecause not all voters marked their ballots to the preset machine \nstandards. In some cases, they were using punch cards. Well, people \ndon't always push the paper dot out of the hole, and sometimes they \ndon't totally fill in the circle with the No. 2 lead pencil; thus, the \nmachines can't always detect these votes. In a typical election, this \nisn't a problem.\n  Election officials know that one out of every so many votes won't be \ncounted by machines. I wonder how many American people know it is a \ngiven fact that one out of so many votes will not be counted by a \nmachine. They are very inaccurate. In an election where one candidate \nwins by 5 percent or 8 percent of the vote, these inaccuracies make \nvery little difference in the final outcome.\n  But in an election as close as this, every single one of these votes \nmatters. We have to count every single last one of them. No American \nshould be disenfranchised because of a mechanical error. That is why I \nbelieve we have to be patient and allow the process to continue.\n  Again, former Secretary of State James Baker keeps saying that we \nhave already counted the votes twice. But what he doesn't mention is \nthat these counts were both done with machines that have error rates \nfar larger than the percentage of votes separating the two candidates. \nMachine error rates are far higher than seven-thousandths of 1 percent. \nMr. Baker says that machines don't have bias, that they are neither \nDemocratic nor Republican. I keep hearing this statement.\n  It is also true that machines are far too inaccurate for the kind of \ncount we\n\n[[Page S11517]]\n\nneed in this election. These machines just cannot count all those \nballots where the hole is not completely punched or the circle is not \ncompletely filled in. Only human beings who can see whether someone \ntried to punch through the paper or make a mark can do that. To those \nwho say that machines are more accurate than human beings counting \nballots I would just ask: Have you ever gotten a phone bill that was \ninaccurate? How about your credit card bill? Machines make mistakes all \nthe time. If you are not careful in catching them, you may be paying a \nlittle too much on your phone bill when you pay it. That is why we \ncarefully look over our bills. The only way to really accurately get a \ncount is through the time tested, old-fashioned way of counting these \nballots.\n  Why do we use voting machines? We do not use voting machines because \nthey are more accurate. We use voting machines because, No. 1, they are \nquicker and, No. 2, they are less expensive. They do not cost as much. \nStill, the most accurate way of determining every person's vote is to \nhave people walk into a voting place; you hand them a paper ballot. \nThey walk into the booth; they take their pencil and they mark the X in \nthe box or circle; they fold the ballot, stick it in the box, and when \nthe polls close those ballots are hand counted by human beings, \nimpartial panels--one from each party, let's say--counting these \nballots.\n  If that is the most accurate way, why don't we do that in America? \nBecause in a national election such as this it would take maybe a \ncouple of months to count all the ballots nationwide, and we want to \nknow before then what the results are. Plus the cost of paying humans \nto sit there and count the ballots would be exorbitant. So we must \ndisabuse ourselves of this false notion that somehow voting machines \nare more accurate. They are not. The most accurate is still hand \ncounting those ballots.\n  We have to remember also that there is nothing exceptional about \nconducting a recount. Both hand recounts and machine recounts are \ncommon in close elections. This happens all over America in every \nelection. We have recounts even in local sheriffs' races. Imagine. \nLet's take the Florida race. Let's bring it home to a county. Let's say \nwe are having a sheriff's race in a county and let's say there were \n4,000 votes cast in the sheriff's race, 2003 for one candidate, 1,997 \nfor the other. The county says it is too close; we are going to have a \nrecount. They start hand recounting it. They hand recount 200 ballots \nout of the 4,000 and the outcome changes by 2 votes. Now, instead of \nbeing separated by 6 votes, the candidates are separated by only 4 \nvotes.\n  Let's say the top ranking election official in the county comes in \nand says: Stop counting. You have counted 200 ballots; you cannot count \nanymore. What do you think the outcry would be like in that county?\n  What, you have counted 200 ballots, the vote has changed by 2, that \ncould be 30 or 40 votes out of 4,000 ballots. That could reverse the \noriginal improperly counted outcome.\n  That is exactly what is happening in Florida on a much larger scale \nthan the local sheriff's race to which I just alluded.\n  Secretary Baker protested that the election officials in control of \nthe Florida counties being recounted are Democrats. I find it \ninteresting he is not protesting that the chief election official in \nFlorida is a Republican, the very official who decided today to suspend \nthe ballot counting at 5 p.m. The Secretary also neglected to mention \nthere are Republicans sitting in the counting rooms, monitoring the \ncount to eliminate even the slightest possibility of partisanship. To \nthis day I have not read or heard a single word in the newspaper or on \nthe media anywhere to suggest that any improprieties in hand recounts \nhave occurred. The American people can be satisfied that hand recounts \nare accurate and fair.\n\n  Again, what has happened today with the Secretary of State saying at \n5 p.m. we have to have all the ballots in and stop counting the hand \nballots--that is like in the local sheriff's race, you have counted 200 \nballots out of 4,000, the votes have changed a couple, and the election \nofficial says: Don't count anymore. I think the American people \nunderstand this. They get it. You cannot just count a few and say we \nare going to stop there.\n  In our democracy, victory is determined by who gets the most votes in \neach State. I see no harm in waiting to make sure each count is fair \nand accurate. The electoral college doesn't vote until December 18, and \ntheir votes are tentatively set to be counted by a joint session of \nCongress on June 6, 2001. So we have plenty of time to make sure the \ntrue winner is named. So I submit the most fair and most accurate way \nof determining who won the electoral votes of Florida, because that is \nwhat is in contest right now, the electoral votes in Florida--the best \nway to determine that is to have a hand recount of all the ballots in \nFlorida. I am told by those knowledgeable of this situation this could \nbe done within probably 10 days to 2 weeks at the most. This could be \ndone and then we would know with a finality and a certainty just who is \nselected to be the next President of the United States. If we do not do \nthis, a cloud is going to hang over whoever is chosen to be the next \nPresident.\n  I think that is the proper way to proceed. It is improper, illogical, \nand not in the best interests of fairness and accuracy to stop the hand \ncounting of ballots when only a few have been hand counted. I \nunderstand about 1 percent of the ballots in a couple of counties have \nbeen counted at this time.\n  With States such as Florida in question and with candidates separated \nby a tiny vote margin, it may take a few weeks to make a clear \ndetermination. I believe that is in our best interests. Slow down. We \nare not in any hurry. What is the rush to judgment? Let's take our \ntime. Whoever is the President, is going to be President for the next 4 \nyears. I submit what is important at this point in time is not whether \nVice President Gore is the President-elect or Governor Bush is the \nPresident-elect. That is not what is important right now. What is \nimportant right now is the sanctity of each person's vote; to make sure \nthat each person's vote is counted properly. That is what is important \nhere. If we know--and we do know--that machines make mistakes, and we \nhave seven-thousandths of a percent dividing these two candidates in \nthe State of Florida, then the most fair way to do it is to hand \nrecount these ballots.\n  For the life of me I do not understand why the Bush campaign is so \nopposed to this. As I said earlier, we have hand recounts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 15 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I said earlier, we have hand recounts every election \nin the United States. Most often they are on more local elections such \nas elections for county supervisor, maybe a State representative. But \nit is not unheard of to have hand recounts for the House of \nRepresentatives or for the U.S. Senate. It is just that we have never \nhad a Presidential election this close. So if it is fair and logical \nand in the best interests of ensuring that every voter's vote is \ncounted accurately, if it is in our best interests to do that in a race \nfor sheriff, is it not even more in our interest to have that kind of \nhand recount in this race for the Presidency of the United States?\n  I believe those who are somehow trying to stop the hand recount in \nFlorida, trying to say let's just take the machine count whatever it is \nand we will live by that, or I guess with some overseas ballots that \nare due in, knowing full well the margin of error in the machines is \nmore than the percentage difference in the two votes--if you are making \nthat argument, what you are basically saying is the most important \nthing is to stop the process right now. That is more important than \ndeciding the fairness and accuracy of each person's vote.\n  There is no crisis in America. Frankly, I disagree with Secretary \nBaker completely. This morning he was saying the markets are now going \nto be upset by this. That is nonsense. That is just nonsense. The \nAmerican people understand this. There is no crisis in America. We are \ngoing about our business. People are getting up and going to work every \nday. Nothing is happening. We can take our time. The President-elect is \nnot sworn in until January 20. We have time to make sure\n\n[[Page S11518]]\n\nthe vote is accurate and fair. There is no need to pull the curtain \ndown and say, no, we have to end it right now, when so much is in \ndoubt, when the race is so close, and when a fair and accurate counting \nof the ballots may move it one way or the other.\n  I do not know; maybe Mr. Bush will win the election. As I have said, \nit is not important right now whether Mr. Bush wins or Mr. Gore wins. \nWhat is important is that every voter's vote in Florida is counted \naccurately and counted fairly, and whether that takes us 10 days or 12 \ndays or 2 weeks, I believe the American people deserve to have those \nvotes counted fairly and accurately.\n  Earlier today my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter, \nintroduced a bill proposing the formation of a commission to examine \nmethods to reduce the miscounting of votes at the polls. I have \ncosponsored that legislation with him because I believe we do need to \nlook at this situation. I think we should carefully examine \nalternatives, given the experience we are now going through. We should \nexamine the electoral college. Maybe it is not perfect, but I happen to \nthink it may be more perfect than a direct election but I am willing to \nlook at it. Perhaps we could allocate the elector's votes by electoral \ndistrict as Nebraska and Maine have decided to do. Perhaps we should \nconsider automatically giving these electoral votes to whoever wins the \nState, rather than electing individual electors who could actually vote \nagainst the will of the voters in their areas. But I am intrigued by \nhaving electoral votes determined by congressional districts as Maine \nand Nebraska do, as I said.\n\n  We ought to consider providing counties and States the necessary \nfunds to assist them in modernizing and standardizing their voting \nmethods. Although it may be somewhat more expensive--we don't know--\nthere is voting technology that exists and is used today, or some of it \nmay be not used, that could reduce voting errors and errors in vote \ntally. No technology will completely eliminate inaccuracies, but this \nelection clearly demonstrates our current methods must be improved. \nThat is why I joined with Senator Specter to cosponsor this \nlegislation. I really do believe we need a more standardized \nmethodology of voting machines in this country.\n  I asked my staff earlier, How many different kinds of voting machines \ndo we have in this country? We have looked at this question and we do \nnot know the answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's additional 5 minutes have \nexpired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We do not know how many different kinds of voting \nmachines there are in this country. Since we are a mobile people, we \nmove from one State to another, one area of a State to another, they \ncan go and be totally confused by a voting machine that is different \nthan what they had used the election before. So I wonder aloud about \nmaybe standardizing voting machines throughout the country so, no \nmatter where you go, you have the same voting machine that you had \nbefore.\n  I also believe we have to look at the latest technology--it exists--\nwhich could reduce to the barest possibility that a person does not \nvote for whom he or she wants to vote. There are interactive devices; I \nhave seen them demonstrated myself, devices that any person with a \ndisability, whether you are blind or deaf or whatever you might be, \ncould use alongside anybody else. It wouldn't differentiate.\n  It would ensure that when you walked out of that booth, you knew \nexactly for whom you voted or for what you voted in terms of some of \nthe resolutions and other items that are on the ballots.\n  If nothing else, we ought to be about this in the next session of \nCongress. I commend my colleague from Pennsylvania for introducing this \nlegislation in this session, and I look forward to cosponsoring it with \nhim when we meet again in January.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11518-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11518-S11521]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ATLANTIC SALMON LISTING DECISION\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, it is with great disappointment that I \nrise today to comment on the decision announced yesterday by the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to \nlist as endangered Atlantic salmon in Maine. The decision represents an \nopportunity lost and reflects a process gone badly astray. It also \nraises serious questions about the mechanics of the Endangered Species \nAct, a law that I support, and how the Services have chosen to \ninterpret and follow its dictates.\n  I rise also out of deep concern for the Atlantic salmon. The rivers \nof Maine once played host to magnificent runs of Atlantic salmon. \nScores of fish returned each year to the streams where they were born \nafter two- or three-year journeys out to sea, venturing thousands of \nmiles off the coast of Maine, as far away as Newfoundland. The question \nis, ``What is the best way to protect and restore these extraordinary \nfish?''\n  Yesterday's announcement is no small matter to my home State. It has \nserious implications for the aquaculture, blueberry, cranberry, and \nforest product industries that form the backbone of the economy in the \nmost economically challenged area of Maine. The cruel irony underlying \nthe decision is that Maine believed it had laid the issue to rest some \nthree years ago when the Services withdrew a proposed listing and \njoined with the State in pursuing the Maine Salmon Conservation Plan. \nOn December 15, 1997, the Services announced they were withdrawing \ntheir proposed listing of Atlantic salmon to pursue a ``cooperative \nrecovery effort spearheaded by the State of Maine.'' At that time \nSecretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt announced:\n\n       We are unlocking the full potential of rivers in Maine and \n     opening a new chapter in conservation history. The governor \n     showed great leadership in forging this collaboration, which \n     will enhance the ecology and economy of the state for years \n     to come. The seven rivers will continue to attract more \n     anglers, boaters and other sportsmen who will help grow and \n     sustain new jobs and revenue as the rivers continue to stand \n     as a model for the nation.\n\n  At the same time, Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and \nAtmosphere and NOAA Deputy Administrator Terry Garcia praised Maine's \nsalmon conservation plan with these words:\n\n       This plan, which was developed by a state-appointed task \n     force with input and advice from federal fisheries \n     scientists, is an innovative effort to resolve the real world \n     conflicts that occur when preserving a species clearly means \n     rethinking traditional uses of a river. Our decision to \n     protect salmon through this plan rather than through a \n     listing under the Endangered Species Act highlights the ESA's \n     flexibility and our willingness to consider state-designed \n     plans.\n\n  Bruce Babbitt's and Terry Garcia's statements purported to highlight \nthe ESA's flexibility and the Services' willingness to consider state-\ndesigned conservation plans. But the decision to list Atlantic salmon \nexposes the statements as hollow rhetoric and reflects a policy of \ninflexibility and of rejecting potentially effective state plans as \nalternatives to listing. In the end, Secretary Babbitt and Mr. Garcia \nreneged on their commitment to work with the state, within the \nframework of the state plan.\n\n  The Services have taken the implicit position that they are under no \nlegally-binding obligation to abide by their earlier commitments to \nwork with the state through the Maine Salmon Conservation Plan. In \nproposing the salmon listing, they abandoned the Plan, which the \nServices relied on to withdraw their 1995 proposal to list Atlantic \nsalmon as threatened. Indeed, in withdrawing the proposed listing three \nyears ago, the Services referred to the Plan as ``a comprehensive \ncollection of measures and protective actions that offer[s] a positive \nbenefit to the species'' and as a substitute for listing. Moreover, at \nthe time, the Services signed a statement of cooperation with the State \nof Maine to support the Plan as the means toward restoring Atlantic \nsalmon in the seven identified rivers.\n\n[[Page S11519]]\n\nIn short, the Services gave every indication that they were committing \nto the Plan as an alternative to listing the salmon under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  And that is precisely how the ESA is meant to operate. Listing \ndeterminations may not be made until the Services take ``into account \nthose efforts, if any, being made by any State * * * to protect such \nspecies.'' As one court recently put it, ``The ESA specifically \nrequires [the Services] to consider conservation efforts taken by a \nstate to protect a species.'' By its own terms, the ESA also encourages \nstates ``to develop and maintain conservation programs.'' This means \nthat the Services can and should rely on a competent state plan to \navoid listing a species as threatened or endangered. In Defenders of \nWildlife v. Babbitt, decided just last year, the court ruled that the \nFish and Wildlife Service properly relied, in part, on a cooperative \nstate/federal conservation plan to withdraw a proposed rule to list the \nflat-tailed horned lizard under the ESA. The court reasoned as follows:\n\n       The ESA was not implemented to discourage states from \n     taking measures to protect a species before it becomes \n     technically or legally ``necessary'' to list the species as \n     threatened or endangered under ESA guidelines. Rather, states \n     are encouraged to work hand in hand with other government \n     agencies and conservation groups to implement evolving \n     policies and strategies to protect wildlife over time. Though \n     the ESA regulations may represent many species' last chance \n     at survival, Congress surely did not intend to make it the \n     only chance at survival.\n\n  The court's decision in the Defenders of Wildlife case hits the nail \non the head. The ESA encourages state/federal cooperative efforts to \nprotect and restore species before listing is required. This goal is \nsupported further by the Services' own regulations, which authorize \nCandidate Conservation Agreements between the Services, states, and \nprivate entities. These agreements are ``designed with the goal of \nprecluding or removing any need to list the covered species,'' a goal \nshared by the Maine Salmon Conservation Plan. The Services' stated \npolicies, too, profess to ``[u]tilize the expertise of State agencies \nin designing and implementing prelisting stabilization actions * * * \nfor species and habitat to remove or alleviate threats so that listing \npriority is reduced or listing as endangered or threatened is not \nwarranted.'' The Services also are working to establish criteria for \nevaluating the certainty of implementation and effectiveness of \nformalized state conservation efforts in order to facilitate the \ndevelopment of such efforts. Again, the goal is to make listing a \nspecies as threatened or endangered unnecessary.\n\n  In short, the Services are well-aware that the ESA encourages \ncooperative, responsible conservation efforts such as Maine's plan. \nThree years ago Commerce Department official Terry Garcia celebrated \nthe Plan as ``highlight[ing] the ESA's flexibility and [the Services'] \nwillingness to consider state-designed plans.'' Today, the Plan has \nbeen rejected as not ``adequately address[ing] the increasing threats \nsalmon are facing from aquaculture, fish disease, habitat modification \nand catch-and-release fishing.'' No compelling record has been \nestablished indicating that the Plan has not met its interim goals. No \nrequest was made to modify the Plan. It was simply abandoned.\n  The Services contend that the proposed rule was the direct result of \na status review that they conducted some time in 1999 and issued in \nOctober of that year. Yet, the Status Review is riddled with logical \nfallacies and unsupportable conclusions. Moreover, its timing presents \ncause for concern.\n  Under the ESA, ``species'' is defined to include any ``distinct \npopulation segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlife which \ninterbreeds when mature.'' In other words, a subpopulation of a given \nspecies can be listed under the ESA if, indeed, it is distinct and \nself-contained. In the current circumstance, the Services rely on a \nsupposed distinct population segment of Atlantic salmon remarkable only \nfor its genealogical diversity. The population segment proposed for \nlisting includes salmon in eight Maine rivers--each of which has long \nbeen under an intensive federal stocking program--and, curiously, does \nnot include Atlantic salmon stocked in the Merrimack and Connecticut \nRivers.\n  As far back as 1979, Congress expressed great concern about the \nServices' misuse of distinct population segments. In the report \naccompanying the bill to re-authorize the Endangered Species Act that \nyear, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, while \nacknowledging there may be some instances where different population \nsegments of a single species are appropriate stated, ``Nevertheless, \nthe committee is aware of the great potential abuse of this authority \nand expects the FWS to use the ability to list populations sparingly \nand only when the biological evidence indicates that such action is \nwarranted.'' In this case, the population distinction proposed by the \nServices fails to meet the standard set by Congress due to both a long-\nrunning stocking effort and the use of a territorial boundary that has \nlittle to do with reproductive isolation.\n  The July 1999 Status Review documents a stocking effort in the \nKennebec, Sheepscot, Ducktrap, Narraguagus, Pleasant, Machias, East \nMachias, and Dennys Rivers that dates back to 1871. Up until 1992, \nthese various stocking efforts took no account of the river-specific \ngenetics that form the basis of this proposed listing. In 1871, 1,500 \nparr from the Canadian province of Ontario were released into the \nSheepscot River. That was the first of many instances of planned \nintroduction of foreign salmon for the purpose of interbreeding into \nwhat the Services now claim to be a genetically distinct population \nsegment. Over eight years in the 1960s, 136,500 parr and 65,700 smolt--\n100 percent of which came from rivers in Canada--were stocked in the \nSheepscot river. As late as 1990 and 1991, 13 percent of a substantial \nstocking effort used fish from New Brunswick.\n\n  In fact, from 1970 to 1992, while many substantial stocking efforts \noccurred putting millions of fry, parr, and smolt in these Maine \nrivers, not a single effort used salmon from the home river. In a \nstocking program 128 years old, only in the last seven years have \nriver-specific salmon been used. For the Services now to try to claim \nthat the fish in the eight rivers constitute a distinct population \nsegment after this massive, century-long effort designed purposefully \nto introduce fish from other rivers and other countries into the eight \nis plainly disingenuous.\n  The Biological Review Team acknowledges that historic stocking \npractices may have had an adverse effect upon the genetic integrity of \nlocal stocks but claims that the limited stocking abilities of these \nearly efforts minimized interference with the genetic purity of these \nriver stocks. This is inconsistent with other assertions in the \nbiological review.\n  The Services claim escaped aquaculture salmon pose a grave threat to \nthe river-specific genetics of the salmon they propose to list. On the \none hand, the Services argue that the enormous stocking of non-river \nspecific species did not change the genetic composition of these stocks \nbecause the 128-year stocking effort was primitive, even in 1991. Yet, \non the other hand, the Services claim an estimated 113 suspected adult \nescapees in the last ten years from aquacultural facilities in the Gulf \nof Maine pose a grave threat to genetic makeup of these river-specific \nsalmon. Simply put, the Services' position defies logic.\n  The ESA requires that a listing decision be made on the basis of \nscientific data relating to the status of the species taking into \naccount state protection and conservation efforts. Nowhere does the ESA \npermit a listing decision to be driven by a national interest group's \nlawsuit meant to force a listing to occur. Yet, it appears this sort of \nmotivation may underlie the Services' decision to abandon the Plan. I \nwrote Secretary Babbitt and then-Secretary Daley requesting documents \nconcerning the listing process and, in particular, the decision to \nconduct the Status Review. The Status Review appears to have commenced \nshortly after a lawsuit was filed to force an emergency listing of the \nsalmon. The documents shed light on the Services' motivations in \nordering the Status Review and, ultimately, deciding to list Maine's \nAtlantic salmon.\n  I would like to take a few minutes today to share with my Senate \ncolleagues what I found when I examined the documents provided to me by \nthe\n\n[[Page S11520]]\n\nServices, some pursuant to subpoena. I do so because the documents \nreflect a listing process that appears to have been badly out of step \nwith the letter and spirit of the ESA.\n  It is important to keep some dates in mind. On December 18, 1997, the \nServices withdrew a proposed rule to list the very same Atlantic salmon \nunder the ESA. Again, the withdrawal was made with much fanfare and was \nbased in large part on the State's adoption of the Maine Salmon \nConservation Plan. On January 27, 1999, Defenders of Wildlife and other \nplaintiffs filed suit against the Services claiming that the withdrawal \nwas an arbitrary and capricious decision and seeking an emergency \nlisting of the Atlantic salmon. Some time thereafter, the Services \nbegan a biological review of the status of Atlantic salmon in Maine. \nAccording to the Services, the review was completed in July 1999, \nthough it was not released until October of the same year. In August \n1999, a second lawsuit was filed against the Services. The two cases \nwere eventually consolidated. Then, on November 17, 1999, the Services \nissued a proposed rule to list the Atlantic salmon as endangered. That \nproposed rule led to the recent listing decision.\n\n  More than anything else, the documents I requested show that concerns \nabout losing the lawsuits influenced the Services ultimately to abandon \nthe Maine Salmon Conservation Plan and to proceed toward an ESA \nlisting. But the decision to abandon the plan was not easily reached. \nThe documents show that, throughout much of 1999, the Services were in \ndisagreement over whether to abandon the State plan. In a March 31, \n1999 e-mail, for example, Department of Interior officials express \ndismay over the position of the Department of Commerce legal team, \nwhich purportedly believed that ``the state should be given every \nopportunity to accomplish the conservation measures accepted under the \n1997 non-listing decision.'' According to this same e-mail, the \nCommerce Department legal team felt that NMFS could ``maintain a more \nproductive relationship with the state if eventually forced to list by \nthe court (as opposed to willingly listing).''\n  For its part, the Interior Department legal team apparently did not \nwant NMFS to give the Maine plan a further chance. In an April 2, 1999 \ne-mail, an Interior Department lawyer wrote to a colleague at the \nCommerce Department that he had heard NOAA's general counsel had, \n``without consulting [the Fish & Wildlife Service], recommended that \nNMFS give the state a list of conservation plan deficiencies and a \ndelay of several months to address them.'' The e-mail continues: \n``Today, I heard that NOAA Assistant Administrator for Oceans & \nAtmosphere Terry Garcia has picked up the idea and is running with \nit.'' The Interior Department lawyer went on to express his concern \nthat giving Maine time to implement and improve the plan ``will appear \npolitical, and will be difficult to defend on scientific grounds.''\n  Another Interior Department attorney expressed her opposition to the \nNMFS proposal more pointedly. She argued that giving the State of Maine \nmore time to conserve and restore Atlantic salmon through its plan \nwould risk a loss in the ongoing salmon litigation. In her words, \n``racking up another loss on conservation agreements'' such as Maine's \nwould ``threaten'' the Service's ability to rely on such plans in the \nfuture in lieu of listing.\n  Yet this view was not shared equally by each Service. It appears that \nthe Commerce Department was more optimistic that the Maine Salmon \nConservation Plan could be relied upon as an effective defense to the \nongoing litigation. Another e-mail, dated March 30, 1999 and between \ntwo Interior Department attorneys, notes a NMFS official's view that \nthe state plan could provide ``a viable defense'' in the ongoing \nlitigation. The Interior Department attorney disagreed, citing \n``serious litigation risks'' and the potential for setting an adverse \nprecedent that could ``extend to future actions in lieu of listing.''\n\n  The Services' differing stances on whether to support or abandon the \nState plan lasted at least into August 1999, mere months before the \nlisting proposal was issued. An e-mail between two Interior Department \nattorneys, and which appears to have been written in August 1999, notes \nthat ``NOAA management apparently still feels ESA listing over state \nopposition is wrong.'' The e-mail goes on to characterize a Commerce \nDepartment attorney's ``best scenario'' as the State of Maine agreeing \nto a ``friendly listing, perhaps as threatened.'' The notion of a \n``friendly\" threatened listing also appears in an August 17, 1999 e-\nmail between the same two Interior Department lawyers. The e-mail \ndiscusses the view of the Commerce Department attorney as follows: \n``The Services could either immediately propose a threatened listing \nand start working on a 4(d) rule, or propose as endangered and back off \nto a threatened listing if the state plays ball for the next few \nmonths.''\n  These documents are disturbing because they show that legal \nconsiderations--and not ``solely . . . the best scientific and \ncommercial data available,'' as required by law--motivated the \nServices' decision to abandon the state plan and list Atlantic salmon \nin the Gulf of Maine as endangered. Granted, there is a clear link \nbetween science and the viability of the Maine Salmon Conservation \nPlan. The plan is either effective in conserving and restoring Atlantic \nsalmon, or it is not. But the fact that the Services differed as to \nwhether the state plan could be relied upon as an effective defense in \nthe salmon suits makes the decision to list appear more like a matter \nof litigation strategy than a matter of science. Indeed, in another e-\nmail, an Interior Department attorney explains the effort to complete \nthe 1999 salmon status review as a means ``to support whatever action \n[the Services] take next.''\n  Ultimately, I believe that the Services should be able to rely on \nappropriate, effective state conservation plans in lieu of listing. At \nthe same time, a state that makes the effort to craft an effective plan \nin cooperation with the Services, should be afforded assurances by the \nServices that the plan will not be abandoned, as Maine's plan was, \nafter only one full year of implementation. A state should be \nencouraged to propose effective conservation plans and should be able \nto count on the Services' consistent support. A listing decision should \nnot be affected by whether or not a state ``plays ball.'' It should be \naffected by the actions a state has made and commits to make to \nconserve and restore a given species.\n  I wanted to speak to my colleagues today in the hope that the \nexperience Maine has undergone will not be repeated. One potential \nsolution was suggested five years ago, by President Clinton. In a 1995 \nwhite paper recommending changes to the Endangered Species Act, this \nadministration wrote the following:\n\n       To encourage states to prevent the need to protect species \n     under the ESA, the ESA should explicitly encourage and \n     recognize agreements to conserve a species within a state \n     among all appropriate jurisdictional state and federal \n     agencies. If a state has approved such a conservation \n     agreement and the Secretary determines that it will remove \n     the threats to the species and promote its recovery within \n     the state, then the Secretary should be required to concur \n     with the agreement and suspend the consequences under the \n     ESA that would otherwise result from a final decision to \n     list a species. The suspension should remain in place as \n     long as the terms or goals of the agreement are met.\n\n  Were such a standard adopted by policy or statute, Maine and other \nstates would have the incentive to devise and fully implement effective \nconservation agreements. The alternative is what has taken place in \nMaine. A plan is announced with great fanfare and a listing proposal is \nwithdrawn. One year and a lawsuit later, the Services reverse course, \ndeeming the plan as unfit to rely upon as a litigation defense. This is \nthe wrong result, and I would hope that during the next Congress, we \ncan change the Services' policy or change the law to encourage \nresponsible, effective state conservation plans.\n  Mr. President, in order to avoid taxpayer expense, I will not ask \nthat the documents I referred to be printed in the Record. Instead, I \nwill post the documents on my Web site. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and, seeing no one seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S11521]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I rise to share for a few moments this \nafternoon, before we adjourn for the day, if not for the week, some \nthoughts on the ongoing events, most obviously, the 2000 Presidential \nelection.\n  I will talk about some of the mechanics of this and some of the \ncomments made earlier in the day by my colleagues from Iowa and \nPennsylvania, and some thoughts that they shared.\n  Before getting to the substance of that, I am a Democrat. Obviously, \nas a Democrat, I am hopeful Al Gore and my colleague from Connecticut, \nJoe Lieberman, will be elected President and Vice President. Certainly, \nI fully understand how colleagues of a different political persuasion \nand other Americans hope that George Bush and Dick Cheney will win the \nelection. I suspect maybe the Presiding Officer may share those views.\n  The most important belief everyone ought to have is that this \nprocess, at the end of it, whenever that comes--whether it is the end \nof this week or sometime over the next several days or weeks--that if \nit takes a little time, that is uncomfortable, but the most important \nconclusion is that it be one the American people support, even those \nwho would have wished a different outcome in the election.\n  I served on the Select Committee on Assassinations 20 years ago in \nwhich we reopened the investigation of the assassinations of John \nKennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King. What possible analogy could those \ntwo events have with this? Well, my colleague from Rhode Island and \nothers may recall that the Warren Commission, which did the initial \ninvestigation into the tragic assassination of President Kennedy, was \nurged at the time to hurry up, to rush to get the job done, and they \ndid. In retrospect, they did as well as they could have under the \ncircumstances. But there was sufficient pressure to get the job done. \nSeveral years later, we had all sorts of questions raised that the \nWarren Commission did not address during the period of its \nconsideration. I don't think we ever would have satisfied some of the \nelements who are always going to be convinced of conspiracy theories. \nBut for an awful lot of other Americans, had the Commission taken a bit \nmore time and gone through the facts a bit more carefully, we could \nhave avoided the problems that ensued thereafter, including a whole new \ninvestigation of the assassination some 13 years after the events \noccurred in 1963.\n  The analogy is this: Obviously, we are not talking about that length \nof time, but while I hear people urging a quick decision, a fast \ndecision, we all understand, while we like clarity and we would like a \ndecision made immediately, we need to place at least as much emphasis, \nif not more, on this decision being the right decision, that the \ndecision is seen as being fair and just and an expression, as close as \nwe can have in an election involving more than 100 million people \nacross the country, of the will of the American people.\n  That is going to be difficult because of the closeness of the race. \nIt is important to get this done quickly, but it is more important to \nget it done correctly.\n  We do not want a substantial percentage of the American public \nquestioning the legitimacy of the 43rd President of the United States--\nwhether that is Al Gore or Gov. George Bush. The American people should \nsupport that choice and have confidence that the choice was the right \none. I hope that, while there are those clamoring for a quick decision, \nwe get the right decision. Utilizing the courts and utilizing manual \ncounting ought not to frighten people. Courts are used in our country \nwhen there is a dispute that can't be resolved, where facts and \ntheories of law are in dispute. If that is the case, you go to court \nand try to get an answer. You would do that if you were talking about \ncounty commissioner or secretary of State. In the State of Florida, we \nshould do no less with the office of the President of the United \nStates. In the final analysis, the new President will look back and be \ngrateful that we took the time to get it right; that we did not rush to \na quick judgment here for the sake of what may appear to be sort of an \nearly way to achieve a win.\n  Having said all of that, there will be much talk in the coming weeks \nabout what went wrong here, what could have been done differently, and \nissues around the electoral college, whether we ought to keep it, \nabandon it, or reform it. Are there things we can do from a Federal \nstandpoint to assist our respective States so we don't have the kind of \nconfusion that has emerged here and regarding some of the ballot \nchoices and equipment used to record people's votes? There will be all \nsorts of ideas shared.\n  My first suggestion and hope would be that people take time to step \nback and examine our current situation. I get nervous when people have \nquick solutions for an immediate problem that has emerged, such as here \nwith this close election. Lets not forget that we have been a republic \nfor 211 years. This will be the fourth such election out of 43 \nPresidential races where there has been a close race, where the popular \nvote and the electoral votes--and we don't know the final outcome of \nthis one--have a different result.\n  Before we decide we want to radically abandon this system, my strong \nsuggestion to my colleagues and others who will be commenting, is to \ntake some time to think it through carefully and not rush out and be \noffering proposals and bills that we may come to regret. There have \nbeen some 200 proposals made to amend the Constitution regarding the \nelectoral college over the last 200 years, many of which have been \nsuggested over the last 40 years. Before we jump to these proposals, I \nsuggest that we think them through.\n  I listened with interest earlier this day to our colleague from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, discuss two issues that are obviously \ntimely and important ones at this moment about reform in the electoral \ncollege. I wish to address those issues for a few minutes. First, let \nme join my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, in congratulating \nSenator Specter for introducing the concept of a bipartisan commission \nto examine whether we might--at least in federal elections--develop \nmore accurate and uniform methods of recording and reporting the votes \ncast by the citizens of our Nation. I know at least one newspaper in \nthe country--the New York Times--has already editorialized on this \ntopic in favor of modernizing what many consider to be a ballot system \nthat is in many respects and in many areas of the country fairly \narchaic in terms of its technological sophistication. I will join \nSenator Specter and others in developing a more thoughtful approach to \nthis dilemma. It is a dilemma because control of elections has been \nleft to the decision of States across the country. The federal role is \nsomewhat limited in this, to put it mildly. It is more a question of \nhow we can work with the States in a cooperative fashion when it comes \nto federal elections--elections beyond mere consideration for the \noffices in the respective States and counties. I think we have a \nlegitimate interest. Certainly, that has been borne out by the events \nof the last week in this country. Certainly, we have seen, as I say, in \nthe last week issues raised that none of us could imagine would have \nbeen brought up prior to the results on Tuesday night.\n\n  I think the events of the past week have shaken many Americans out of \na false sense that our system--or should I say systems--of tabulating \nballots is absolutely error free. It never has been perfect. No one \ndisputes that the hallmark of our system--namely free and fair \nelections--is as strong as it has ever been.\n  Indeed, if we have learned anything over the past week, it is the \ntruth of the maxim that it is as ingrained in our consciousness as the \nPledge of Allegiance or the Preamble of the Declaration of \nIndependence: In America, every citizen counts.\n  That is a mantra we hear over and over again: Every citizen counts. \nEvery citizen has a part to play in choosing how we shall be governed. \nMany of us have said over the last week: Don't ever let me hear anybody \nsay again that every vote doesn't count, or a single vote doesn't \ncount. You have seen\n\n[[Page S11522]]\n\nthat the margins in the State of New Mexico in the Presidential race \nmay be down to 17 or 20 votes. We had a congressional race in my State \na few years ago where out of 200,000 votes cast, 4 ballots determined \nwho the Congressman of the Second Congressional District would be. So \nwe all say every vote counts, every citizen counts.\n  While our system may be the fairest in the world, we have been \nreminded over the past week that it is not infallible. Few areas of \ngovernance are as decentralized as voter administration. According to a \nnews report today, election decisions are made not only by each of the \n50 States but by more than 3,000 counties and towns, where they have \nseparate rules outside of the State rules. So 3,000 different \njurisdictions in this country have something to say about how elections \nare conducted in America. The methods of voting vary widely from \njurisdiction to jurisdiction--from the marking of paper ballots to the \nuse of the Internet, as we have seen.\n  By far the most common form of voting in our Nation remains the \npunching of paper ballots. It is estimated that some 40 percent of \nvoters utilized that method to vote on election day. This is so despite \nthe evidence that paper ballots are more vulnerable, than any other \nvoting system, to voter error.\n  We have all become familiar in the past six days with the variety of \nways a ballot now may be marked--language I never heard before, \nterminology I never heard mentioned. All of a sudden, we have all \nbecome familiar with things called ``chads'' and parts of chads. I \nnever heard of a ballot being ``pregnant,'' but I now know that it can \nbe in this country, which is a startling revelation. So we have heard a \nnew vernacular in our society. People everywhere are learning about the \nvariations of the chad: the ``pregnant'' chad, the ``dimpled'' chad, \nthe ``hinged'' chad, the ``swinging'' chad. These are all words that \nthose who may have been involved in the arcane business of voter issues \nknow, but for most Americans these are new words.\n  Beyond the punching of a paper ballot, some 20 percent of voters use \nmechanical lever machines that are no longer made. Another 25 percent \nfill in a circle, a square, or an arrow next to the candidate or ballot \nquestion of their choice. Only about 10 percent use a computer screen \nor other electronic means to have their votes recorded automatically.\n  One consequence of using a patchwork system where most votes are cast \nby paper ballot is that errors can affect outcomes. That is what the \npeople and officials of Florida are obviously trying to contend with \neven as I speak on the floor of the United States Senate this \nafternoon.\n  Another consequence, however, should be just as much a cause for \nconcern, and that is that in a great many jurisdictions the voting \nprocess might not only be prone to a significant risk of error, but a \nsignificant risk of delay on election day as well. Throughout the \ncountry during the past election, we heard a great many reports of long \nlines at the polls. One hour, two hours, three hours. People were \nwaiting a long, long time in many parts of the Nation to cast their \nballots.\n\n  Certainly, the vast majority of those who did endure these waits did \nso with patience and a deep sense of the importance of the moment. \nHowever, the question we must ask ourselves is what we might try to do \nto shorten those lines. We must recognize that, in an era when we can \npay bills, buy goods and services, and do many other things by \ncomputer, fewer and fewer Americans are waiting in line for anything \nanymore.\n  As long lines continue to become an anachronism in other parts of our \nlives, voters' patience on election day can also diminish. If their \npatience diminishes, then more may choose not to vote, and that will be \nthe worst result of all.\n  We must realize that--much as they might want to--many local \njurisdictions simply lack the resources to modernize their voting \nsystems. One county in a State of the eastern seaboard has records \ndating from the 1800s. Of 890,000 people on that county's voting rolls, \na recent study found that 775,000 were either dead or living someplace \nelse. I will repeat that. In one jurisdiction, of the 890,000 people on \nthe county's voting rolls, 775,000 were either dead or living in \nanother jurisdiction. That fact, and others, underscore that voting \nrecordkeeping and equipment is expensive and also outdated. That is a \nsimple and unavoidable fact for many communities that struggle to find \nresources to meet the daily needs of their people for police, fire \nprotection, trash collection, and other services.\n  So I hope that as we move forward or toward the conclusion of this \nCongress and the commencement of the 107th Congress, and we all wait \nfor January 20th, where a few feet from here a new President will be \nsworn into office as the 43rd President--during this time--and this is \nwhy we should do it now--we give serious consideration to the concept \nof a bipartisan commission to examine how we might encourage more \naccurate methods of recording votes by the citizens of our Nation.\n  I also hope that such a commission would provide guidance as to how \nwe might assist communities in finding the means to do so. This is a \nvaluable role that we can play to assist these counties and local \ncommunities with resources that will enable them to modernize the \nvoting equipment that they lack today. I look forward to working with \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, the Senator from Iowa, and others--I am \nsure there will be many more--who are interested in working on this \nissue and giving it some serious attention.\n  Secondly, let me enter the discussion on the electoral college. My \ncolleagues, Senator Durbin, Senator Harkin, Senator Torricelli, as well \nas Senator Specter and others, have discussed this matter in the last \nfew days. On talk radio, in diners, in taxi cabs, and anywhere you want \nto go, you can now get into a deep conversation about the electoral \ncollege. We have all become familiar in the last few days. Many people \nwere unaware that Presidents have been elected by the electoral college \nsince the first days of the republic. So there has been educational \nvalue to this confusion over who the next President will be.\n  The electoral college is an arcane institution in the minds of many, \nbut it has played a very important and valuable role. Certainly now is \na good time to consider the role of the electoral college in electing \nAmerican Presidents. I hope that we will proceed, as I said at the \noutset--with caution--on this matter.\n  I would be concerned, frankly, about abolishing the electoral \ncollege. Those who have urged us to do so ought to pause, step back, \nand give some thought to what they have suggested. If you think it is \nconfusing in Florida today, imagine the difficulty in deciding a \nPresidential election as close as this, with ballots in contention and \npeople going to court not in one State, but potentially in 50 States? \nSo while I think the electoral college may need serious reform, we \nought to be careful about abandoning it.\n  Notwithstanding the intentions of the Founders, many which remain \nvalid, the electoral college continues to serve, in my view, an \nimportant function in our present day election system. While we elect \none President for the Nation, it reminds us that we do so as a republic \nof States, not as a single political unit. Were we to elect the \nPresident solely on the basis of the popular vote, Presidential \ncandidates would have little incentive, in my view, to visit with the \npeople who live outside the major population centers. State boundaries \nwould, for purposes of a Presidential election, be virtually wiped out, \nand candidates would have little incentive to learn from a State's \nofficials and citizens about the concerns particular to their \njurisdiction or State. So the consequences of abolishing the electoral \ncollege should be considered with grave, grave care. I am aware that \nthere have been numerous proposals to modify the electoral college \nduring the course of history. As I mentioned, the 12th amendment to the \nConstitution was ratified June 15, 1804. It represents one of those \nproposals and, today, the only successful one. One proposal was put \nforward in the 87th Congress, I might point out, by a Senator from \nConnecticut who happened to be my father, I discovered the other day. \nHe offered it in January of 1961 after the Kennedy and Nixon election. \nHe proposed then--and admitted there was nothing unique about his \nideas; they were ones that were incorporated from the various other \nproposals that were suggested. So it was\n\n[[Page S11523]]\n\nnot an original set of ideas coming off that election which was a close \nelection as well--he proposed a system where each State's electors \nwould be apportioned to the candidates in proportion to the candidates' \npercentage share of the State's popular votes.\n\n  Nebraska, Iowa, and Maine do that today. In fact, States could do \nthat on their own initiative. In fact, it would not require a change in \nthe Constitution if the various States wanted to modify how they would \nallocate their electoral votes. Perhaps we should consider that \nproposal or some variation on it.\n  As I said, there were many proposals offered. Perhaps we should also \nconsider the two States that do not apportion the votes on a winner-\ntake-all basis: Maine and Nebraska. Perhaps we should consider--as \nMaine does now--apportioning its votes according to which candidate \nwins which congressional districts in a given State. That has had some \nvalue. In fact, you may recall in the waning days of this election, the \nVice Presidential candidate, Joe Lieberman, my colleague from \nConnecticut, made a special trip to Maine to campaign in one \ncongressional district up there that was close. It turned out that trip \nhe made had some value. It was worth one electoral vote. If you \napportion these either by congressional district or by how many votes \nthe respective candidates received, I could see Democrats going to \nplaces such as Utah, Arizona, Georgia, Mississippi--places in which we \nhave not done very well in Presidential campaigns. I could see \nRepublicans coming to Connecticut, Rhode Island, or Massachusetts where \nthey may not get the winning margin, but they might get 40 percent, 45 \npercent. So it is worth it to go after those electoral votes.\n  Why is that good government? Because it is important that these \ncandidates come to our respective States, learn about the people's \nconcerns. It makes it more competitive, gets people involved; their \nvote means something, not only a popular vote but also an electoral \nvote.\n  So I think reform of the electoral college, and there are a variety \nof other ideas, is worth while. But again, I caution against the idea \nthat somehow abandoning the system would serve the best interests of \nthe country for over two hundred years.\n  These are important matters. They go to the heart of our democratic \nsystem, the electoral college, how we vote, how ballots are counted. I \nhappen to believe we are going to come out of this in good shape. I \nknow there are those calling this a constitutional crisis. It is not a \nconstitutional crisis. The system is working. We are confronted with a \nunique situation, but the Founding Fathers and the framers of the \nConstitution in their wisdom anticipated there would be difficulties \nwith Presidential elections. They set up a series of safeguards. They \nare not perfect. Some need to be changed, but they work. We are now \nconfronting one unique in the two-century history of our Nation, but we \nwill come out of this well. There are good people in Florida, good \ncitizens who care about this, who will do the right thing before this \nprocess is concluded.\n  On January 20, we will gather on the west front of this majestic \nbuilding and we will welcome with good heart and good spirit and great \ncheer the 43rd President of the United States. That President will be a \nvery humbled individual.\n  There will be no announcements of mandates in this election. Maybe \nthe American people showed their infinite wisdom collectively by saying \nby dividing this as evenly as we can, not only in this Chamber and the \nHouse, but the Presidential election, maybe you ought to try to work \nthese things out; get together and resolve some of the outstanding \nproblems we face every day such as a prescription drug benefit, a real \nPatients' Bill of Rights, improving the country's educational system, \nmyriad transit problems, just to name a few. Those are the problems \nAmericans wrestle with every day and they want to see us wrestle with \nthem here and come up with some answers.\n  They may have just sent us the method and means by which we will \nachieve that in this coming Congress by making this election as close \nas it is so no one can claim they have a majority of Americans' \nsolution to this problem. But they did speak with almost one resounding \nsingle voice. We ought to take a look at the electoral process and then \nget about the business of going to work on America's problems. By \nmaking this election as close as they have, I suggest they may have \noffered us the opportunity and means by which we could do in the coming \nCongress what we failed to do in the one we are now winding down.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, last Saturday, I, along with tens of \nthousands of others, gathered along the Mall to observe the \ngroundbreaking ceremony for the World War II memorial. It was a most \nmoving and inspirational moment for all who attended and, indeed, for \nthe untold millions who followed through the medium of television. All \nof the speakers at this ceremony were clearly inspired by the solemnity \nof the occasion.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of all the speakers in \nattendance be printed in today's Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I should now like to list those speakers \nin the order in which they took part in this program.\n  First, World War II Chaplain and retired Archbishop Phillip M. \nHannan, who gave a most inspirational invocation. He is a highly \ndecorated combat veteran of World War II. What a marvelous spirit he \nhas. He set the tone for all others who followed;\n  Gen. Fred Woerner, Chairman, American Battle Monuments Commission;\n  Ohio Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, who launched the effort in Congress \nto authorize the national World War II memorial. Her initial efforts go \nas far back as 1987;\n  Luthur Smith, a World War II Tuskegee Airman;\n  I am privileged to have been associated with the men and women of the \nArmed Forces through much of my life, but his rendition of his last \nmission, and how he was shot down, and how the hand of providence \nliterally extracted him from a flaming aircraft and brought his wounded \nbody to ground--it brought tears to the eyes of all present. That is \nworth the entire statement to be put in the Record today.\n  Tom Hanks, actor, who starred in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' has done so \nmuch work to make this memorial possible.\n  Senator Bob Dole, our beloved former colleague and the National \nChairman, World War II Memorial Campaign, spoke with such moving \neloquence. He, of course, I believe, deserves most special recognition \nfor his efforts.\n  Fredrick W. Smith, founder and CEO, FedEx Corporation and National \nCochairman, World War II Memorial Campaign, also a veteran, not of \nWorld War II but of subsequent campaigns;\n  Ambassador F. Hadyn Williams, Chairman, American Battle Monuments \nCommission, World War II Memorial Committee.\n  William Cohen, our former Senate colleague, and current Secretary of \nDefense; and the concluding remarks, again, a very stirring and \neloquent statement by our President, William Jefferson Clinton.\n  In addition to those great Americans who spoke at the ceremonies, \nthere were others there. I mention just those in Congress: our \ndistinguished President pro tempore, Strom Thurmond; from the House of \nRepresentatives, Representatives John Dingell, Benjamin Gilman, Ralph \nRegula, Bob Stump, Joe Skeen, and, of course, former Representative \nSonny Montgomery, who has done so much through the years for the men \nand women of our Armed Forces.\n  I again wish to give very special recognition and, indeed, it was by \nall present, to Senator Bob Dole for his inspired, relentless, and \nuntiring efforts to make this memorial possible.\n\n[[Page S11524]]\n\n  This memorial will be an educational reminder for future generations \nto the enormous commitment, at home as well as in the uniformed ranks, \nof the people of our great Nation. As Senator Dole often said \nthroughout his efforts on behalf of this memorial: What would our world \nbe today if freedom had not prevailed, had there not been the enormous \ncommitment throughout the United States and, indeed, also, in our \nallies. What if freedom had not prevailed and the war had been lost? \nWhat would the world be today? That will be the question that those who \nvisit for decades to come should ask of themselves as they quietly \nreflect on this magnificent structure and the symbolism of that effort.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n   Addresses Delivered at the National WWII Memorial Groundbreaking \n                      Ceremony, November 11, 2000\n\n\n Remarks of General Fred Woerner, Chairman, American Battle Monuments \n                               Commission\n\n       Mr. President, distinguished guests, honored World War II \n     veterans, ladies and gentlemen: On behalf of the American \n     Battle Monuments Commission, I welcome you to the official \n     groundbreaking ceremony for the National World War II \n     Memorial.\n       There are many here today I want to publicly recognize. \n     First and foremost, our special guests, the members of the GI \n     Generation--whose sacrifice and achievement we will \n     commemorate on this magnificent site.\n       Mr. President, we are honored by your presence.

We, the \n     children of freedom, on this first Veterans' Day of the new \n     century, gather to offer highest tribute, long overdue, and \n     our everlasting respect, gratitude, and love to the Americans \n     of the 20th century whose valor and sacrifice yielded the \n     modern triumph of liberty over tyranny. This is a memorial \n     not to a man but to a time and a people.\n       This is a long-anticipated day. It was 1987 when this \n     Memorial was first conceived. As many have said, it has taken \n     longer to build the Memorial than to fight the war. Today, \n     with the support of Americans from all walks of life, our \n     veterans service organizations and overwhelming, bipartisan \n     support in Congress, the Memorial is a reality.\n       I do not have the time to mention all the Members of \n     Congress who deserve thanks for their contributions to this \n     cause, but certain Members in particular must be recognized. \n     Rep. Sonny Montgomery, now retired, a true champion of \n     veterans in the House, and Senator Strom Thurmond, our \n     unfailing advocate in the Senate, as well as Rep. Bill Clay, \n     of Missouri and two retired Members, Rep. Henry Gonzalez and \n     Senator John Glenn.\n       At the end of World War I, the French poet Guillaume \n     Apollinaire declaring himself ``against forgetting'' wrote of \n     his fallen comrades: ``You asked neither for glory nor for \n     tears.'' Five years ago, at the close of the 50th anniversary \n     ceremonies for World War II, Americans consecrated this \n     ground with soil from the resting places around the world of \n     those who served and died on all fronts. We, too, declared \n     ourselves against forgetting. We pledged then that America \n     would honor and remember their selfless devotion on this Mall \n     that commemorates democracy's march.\n       Apollinaire's words resonated again as E.B. Sledge \n     reflected on the moment the Second World War ended: ``. . . \n     sitting in a stunned silence, we remembered our dead . . . so \n     many dead . . . Except for a few widely scattered shouts of \n     joy, the survivors of the abyss sat hollow-eyed, trying to \n     comprehend a world without war.''\n       Yes. Individual acts by ordinary men and women in an \n     extraordinary time--one exhausting skirmish, one determined \n     attack, one valiant act of heroism, one dogged determination \n     to give your all, one heroic act after another--by the \n     thousands--by the millions--bound our country together as it \n     has not been since, bound the living to the dead in common \n     purpose and in service to freedom, and to life.\n       As a Marine wrote about his company, ``I cannot say too \n     much for the men . . . I have seen a spirit of brotherhood . \n     . . that goes with one foot here amid the friends we see, and \n     the other foot there amid the friends we see no longer, and \n     one foot is as steady as the other.''\n       Today we break ground. It is only fitting that the event \n     that reshaped the modern world in the 20th century and marked \n     our nation's emergency from isolationism to the leader of the \n     free world be commemorated on this site.\n       Our work will not be complete until the light from the \n     central sculpture of the Memorial intersects the shadow cast \n     by the Washington Monument across the Lincoln Memorial \n     Reflecting Pool and the struggles of freedom of the 18th, \n     19th, and 20th centuries converge in one moment. Here freedom \n     will shine. She will shine.\n       This Memorial honors those still living who served abroad \n     and on the home front and also those lost--the nearly 300,000 \n     Americans who died in combat, and those, the millions, who \n     survived the war but who have since passed away.\n       Among that number I count my inspired constituent Roger \n     Durbin of Berkey, Ohio, a letter carrier who fought bravely \n     with the Army's 101st Armored Division in the Battle of the \n     Bulge and who, because he could not forget, asked me in 1987 \n     why there was no memorial in our nation's Capitol to which he \n     could bring his grandchildren. Roger is with us spiritually \n     today. To help us remember him and his contribution to \n     America, we have with us a delegation from his American \n     Legion Post, the Joseph Diehn Post in Sylvania, Ohio, and his \n     beloved family, his widow, Marian, his granddaughter, \n     Melissa, an art historian and member of the World War II \n     Memorial Advisory Board.\n       This is a memorial to heroic sacrifice. It is also a \n     memorial for the living--positioned between the Washington \n     Monument and Lincoln Memorial--to remember how freedom in the \n     20th century was preserved for ensuing generations.\n       Poet Keith Douglas died in foreign combat in 1944 at age \n     24. In predicting his own end,\n\n[[Page S11525]]\n\n     he wrote about what he called time's wrong-way telescope, and \n     how he thought it might simplify him as people looked back at \n     him over the distance of years. ``Through that lens,'' he \n     demanded, ``see if I seem/substance or nothing: of the world/\n     deserving mention, or charitable oblivion . . .'' And then he \n     ended with the request, ``Remember me when I am dead/and \n     simplify me when I'm dead.'' What a strange and striking \n     charge that is!\n       And yet here today we pledge that as the World War II \n     Memorial is built, through the simplifying elements of stone, \n     water, and light, there will be no charitable oblivion. \n     America will not forget. The world will not forget. When we \n     as a people can no longer remember the complicated \n     individuals who walked in freedom's march--a husband, a \n     sister, a friend, a brother, an uncle, a father--when those \n     individuals become simplified in histories and in family \n     stories, still when future generations journey to this holy \n     place, America will not forget. Freedom's children will not \n     forget.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n         REMARKS OF LUTHER SMITH, world war ii tuskegee airman\n\n       Mr. President, Senator Dole, General Woerner, distinguished \n     guests. It's a thrill to be here this afternoon--to be among \n     so many of my fellow World War II veterans.\n       Today's groundbreaking is a long-awaited milestone in the \n     evolution of the National World War II Memorial. For today we \n     celebrate the approval of Friedrich St. Florian's memorial \n     design after a long and spirited public review process.\n       I had the privilege to serve as a member of the Architect-\n     Engineer Evaluation Board that judged the 403 entries in the \n     national design competition. We and the members of the Design \n     Jury set out to select a design architect whose vision for \n     the memorial matched the scale and significance of the event \n     it commemorates as well as the classic beauty and nobility of \n     the national landmarks that soon will be its neighbors.\n       The elegance and sensitivity of the approved design is \n     proof that we selected the right person for this monumental \n     task.\n       Fifty-nine years ago I was in my early twenties, as were \n     many of you. Young, eager, wondering what the future held for \n     me is Des Moines, Iowa. Little did I know that soon I would \n     be flying with a group of men that would become known as the \n     Tuskegee Airmen.\n       What a proud time for a young man in 1940's America. To be \n     allowed to fly and fight for his country. To be part of an \n     effort that united the nation in a way we hadn't seen before \n     and haven't seen since.\n       I flew 133 missions in a combination of fighter aircraft. \n     It was on my final scheduled mission, in October 1944, that \n     my P-51 Mustang was brought down. We were strafing oil tank \n     cars when a ball of fire erupted directly in front of me. I \n     was in and out of the flames in less than a second, but the \n     explosion blew out my cockpit windows, buckled the wing \n     surfaces and destroyed much of the tail assembly. I was \n     uninjured, but 600 miles from home in a crippled aircraft.\n       Flames soon enveloped the engine. I wanted to roll into an \n     inverted position and fall free before opening my parachute, \n     but I went into a spin and fell partially out of the cockpit. \n     My right foot became wedged between the rudder pedal and \n     brake, so I couldn't get into the cockpit or out.\n       The next thing I recall is looking up at a badly torn \n     parachute. Somehow, I had pulled the ripcord while trapped \n     semi-conscious in the aircraft. The opening parachute pulled \n     me free, saving my life but fracturing my right hip.\n       I was falling too fast, head first, connected to the \n     parachute by just one strap attached to my fractured hip. \n     Unconsciousness again, I awoke crashing through trees. My \n     chute caught in the top branches and kept me from smashing \n     into the ground. I spent the last seven months of the war in \n     German hospitals and the Stalag 18A prison camp. My injuries \n     required 18 operations and three years of hospitalization.\n       I was lucky. I lived to tell the story. More than 400,000 \n     Americans never came home to tell their stories. And more \n     than 10 million of the 16 million that served in uniform are \n     no longer with us to tell their stories.\n       I feel blessed to have had the opportunity to serve my \n     country during her time of need, and to have played a small \n     but rewarding role in the effort to establish a memorial to \n     that time.\n       I look forward to the day when I can bring my grandchildren \n     here to our National Mall, to walk among the landmarks of our \n     young democracy, to enter one of the great gathering places \n     in this special city--the World War II Memorial plaza--and \n     share with them our nation's newest symbol of freedom.\n       The members of my generation hold within them thousands of \n     stories like the one I shared with you today--stories of \n     events that unfolded many years ago. The telling of those \n     stories will end all too soon, but the lessons they teach \n     must be remembered for generations to come.\n       The World War II Memorial will keep those lessons alive.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                          remarks of tom hanks\n\n       In December of 1943, the Second World War appeared to have \n     no end. The Invasion of Normandy was half a year away. The \n     landing on Guam, the liberation of Paris and naval victories \n     in the Philippine Sea would not happen until the following \n     summer and fall. Americans at home had yet to hear of the \n     Battle of the Bulge or Iwo Jima. American Soldiers had yet to \n     touch the Siegfried Line or come anywhere near crossing the \n     Rhine River.\n       The final cost of an allied victory was incalculable. The \n     list of those names to be lost forever, not nearly complete.\n       In December of 1943, a war correspondent named Erine Pyle \n     sat in a tent outside of Naples and wrote the following on \n     his typewriter:\n       At the front lines in Italy--in this war I have known a lot \n     of officers who were loved and respected by the soldiers \n     under them. But never have I crossed the trail of any man as \n     beloved as Captain Henry T. Waskow, of Belton, Texas.\n       Captain Waskow was a company commander in the 36th \n     division. He had been in this company since long before he \n     left the States. He was very young, only in his middle 20s, \n     but he carried in him a sincerity and gentleness that made \n     people want to be guided by him.\n       ``After my own father, he comes next,'' a sergeant told me. \n     ``He always looked after us,'' a solder said. ``He'd go to \n     bat for us every time.'' ``I've never known him to do \n     anything unkind,'' another one said. I was at the foot of the \n     mule trail the night they brought Captain Waskow down. The \n     moon was nearly full at the time, and you could see far up \n     the trail, and even part way across the valley. Soldiers made \n     shadows as they walked.\n       Dead men had been coming down the mountain all evening, \n     lashed onto the backs of mules. They came lying belly down \n     across the wooden packsaddle, the heads hanging down on the \n     left side of the mule, their stiffened legs sticking \n     awkwardly from the other side, bobbing up and down as the \n     mule walked.\n       The Italian mule skinners were afraid to walk beside dead \n     men, so Americans had to lead the mules down that night. Even \n     the Americans were reluctant to unlash and lift off the \n     bodies, when they go to the bottom, so an officer had to do \n     it himself and ask others to help.\n       The first one came early in the morning. They slid him down \n     from the mule, and stood him on his feet for a moment. In the \n     half light he might have been merely a sick man standing \n     there leaning on the other. Then they laid him on the ground \n     in the shadow of the stone wall alongside the road.\n       I don't know who that first one was. You feel small in the \n     presence of dead men and ashamed of being alive, and you \n     don't ask silly questions.\n       We left him there beside the road, that first one, and we \n     all went back into the cowshed and sat on watercans or lay on \n     the straw, waiting for the next batch of mules. Somebody said \n     the dead soldier had been dead for four days, and then nobody \n     said anything more about him. We talked for an hour or more; \n     the dead man lay off alone, outside in the shadow of the \n     wall. Then a soldier came into the cowshed and said there \n     were some more bodies outside. We went out into the road. \n     Four mules stood there in the moonlight, in the road where \n     the trail came down off the mountain. The soldiers who led \n     them stood there waiting.\n       ``This one is Captain Waskow,'' one of them said quickly.\n       Two men unlashed his body from the mule and lifted it off \n     and laid it in the shadow beside the stone wall. Other men \n     took the other bodies off. Finally, there were five lying end \n     to end in a long row. You don't cover up dead men in the \n     combat zones. They just lie there in the shadows until \n     somebody else comes after them.\n       The uncertain mules moved off to their olive orchards. The \n     men in the road seemed reluctant to leave. They stood around, \n     and gradually I could sense them moving, one by one, close to \n     Captain Waskow's body. Not so much to look, I think, as to \n     say something in finality to him and to themselves. I stood \n     close by and I could hear.\n       One soldier came and looked down, and he said out loud: \n     ``God damn it!'' That's all he said, and then he walked away. \n     Another one came, and he said, ``God damn it to hell \n     anyway!'' He looked down for a few last moments and then \n     turned and left.\n       Another man came. I think he was an officer. It was hard to \n     tell officers from men in the half light, for everybody was \n     grimy and dirty. The man looked down into the dead captain's \n     face and then spoke directly to him, as though he were alive:\n       ``I'm sorry, old man.''\n       Then a soldier came and stood beside the officer and bent \n     over, and he too spoke to his dead captain, not in a whisper \n     but awfully tenderly, and he said:\n       ``I sure am sorry, sir.''\n       Then the first man squatted down, and reached down and took \n     the captain's hand, and he sat there for a full five minutes \n     holding the dead hand in his own and looking intently into \n     the dead face. And he never uttered a sound all the time he \n     sat there.\n       Finally he put the hand down. He reached up and gently \n     straightened the points of the captain's shirt collar, and \n     then he sort of rearranged the tattered edges of his uniform \n     around the wound and then he got up and walked away down the \n     road in the moonlight, all alone.\n       The rest of us went back into the cowshed, leaving the five \n     dead men lying in the line end to end in the shadow of the \n     low stone wall. We lay down on the straw in the cowshed, and \n     pretty soon we were all asleep.--Ernie Pyle. Italy. December \n     1943.\n\n[[Page S11526]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n remarks of senator bob dole, national chairman, wwii memorial campaign\n\n       Mr. President, Tom, and Fred, and our countless supporters \n     and other guests. I am honored to stand here as a \n     representative of the more than 16 million men and women who \n     served in World War II. God bless you all.\n       It has been said that ``to be young is to sit under the \n     shade of trees you did not plant; to be mature is to plant \n     trees under the shade of which you will not sit.'' Our \n     generation has gone from the shade to the shadows so some \n     ask, why now--55 years after the peace treaty ending World \n     War II was signed aboard the USS Missouri. There is a simple \n     answer: because in another 55 years there won't be anyone \n     around to bear witness to our part in history's greatest \n     conflict.\n       For some, inevitably, this memorial will be a place to \n     mourn. For millions of others, it will be a place to learn, \n     to reflect, and to draw inspiration for whatever tests \n     confront generations yet unborn. As one of many here today \n     who bears battle scars, I can never forget the losses \n     suffered by the greatest generation. But I prefer to dwell on \n     the victories we gained. For ours was more than a war against \n     hated tyrannies that scarred the Twentieth Century with their \n     crimes against humanity. It was, in a very real sense, a \n     crusade for everything that makes life worth living.\n       Over the years I've attended many a reunion, and listened \n     to many a war story--even told a few myself. And we have \n     about reached a time where there are few around to contradict \n     what we say. All the more reason, then, for the war's \n     survivors, and its widows and orphans, to gather here, in \n     democracy's front yard to place the Second World War within \n     the larger story of America. After today it belongs where our \n     dwindling ranks will soon belong--to the history books.\n       Some ask why this memorial should rise in the majestic \n     company of Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln and Roosevelt. They \n     remind us that the Mall is hallowed ground. And so it is. But \n     what makes it hallowed? Is it the monuments that sanctify the \n     vista before us--or is it the democratic faith reflected in \n     those monuments? It is a faith older than America, a love of \n     liberty that each generation must define and sometimes defend \n     in its own way.\n       It was to justify this idea that Washington donned a \n     soldier's uniform and later reluctantly agreed to serve as \n     first president of the nation he conceived. It was to \n     broadcast this idea that Jefferson wrote the Declaration of \n     Independence, and later as president, doubled the size of the \n     United States so that it might become a true empire of \n     liberty. It was to vindicate this idea that Abraham Lincoln \n     came out of Illinois to wage a bloody yet tragically \n     necessary Civil War, purging the stain of slavery from \n     freedom's soil. And it was to defend this idea around the \n     world that Franklin D. Roosevelt led a coalition of \n     conscience against those who would exterminate whole races \n     and put the soul itself in bondage.\n       Today we revere Washington for breathing life into the \n     American experiment--Jefferson for articulating our \n     democratic creed--Lincoln for the high and holy work of \n     abolition--and Roosevelt for upholding popular government at \n     home and abroad. But it isn't only presidents who make \n     history, or help realize the promise of democracy. Unfettered \n     by ancient hatreds, America's founders raised a lofty \n     standard--admittedly too high for their own generation to \n     attain--yet a continuing source of inspiration to their \n     descendants, for whom America is nothing if not a work in \n     progress.\n       If the overriding struggle of the 18th century was to \n     establish popular government in an era of divine right; if \n     the moral imperative of the 19th century was to abolish \n     slavery; then in the 20th century it fell to millions of \n     citizen-soldiers--and millions more on the home front, men \n     and women--to preserve democratic freedoms at a time when \n     murderous dictators threatened their very existence. Their \n     service deserves commemoration here, because they wrote an \n     imperishable chapter in the liberation of mankind--even as \n     their nation accepted the responsibilities that came with \n     global leadership.\n       So I repeat: what makes this hallowed ground? Not the \n     marble columns and bronze statues that frame the Mall. No--\n     what sanctifies this place is the blood of patriots across \n     three centuries, and our own uncompromising insistence that \n     America honor her promises of individual opportunity and \n     universal justice. This is the golden thread that runs \n     throughout the tapestry of our nationhood--the dignity of \n     every life, the possibility of every mind, the divinity of \n     every soul. This is what my generation fought for on distant \n     fields of battle, in the air above and on remote seas. This \n     is the lesson we have to impart. This is the place to impart \n     it. Learn this, and the trees planted by today's old men--\n     let's say mature men and women--will bear precious fruit. And \n     we may yet break ground on the last war memorial.\n       Thank you all and God bless the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n  Remarks of Frederick W. Smith, National Co-Chairman, WWII Memorial \n                                Campaign\n\n       When Senator Dole asked me to be a part of this campaign, \n     my first thoughts were of my own family heroes--my Uncle Sam, \n     my Uncle Bill, my Uncle Arthur and my father, all of whom \n     served in World War II--two in the Army and two in the Navy.\n       Others in my family, including my mother, who is in the \n     audience today, understood the sacrifice necessary to achieve \n     victory and joined the millions of Americans who supported \n     the war effort from the home front. I thought, what a shame \n     that there isn't a memorial to represent the tremendous \n     sacrifice and amazing achievements of their generation.\n       I can't imagine what this country or the world would be \n     like had all of those who served so nobly overseas and at \n     home not prevailed. It was the single most significant event \n     of the last century.\n       Think back to the pre-war depression years. Factories were \n     under-producing and 10 million Americans were unemployed. \n     Countless more had substandard, low paying jobs.\n       Then, between 1941 and 1945, the number of jobless people \n     dropped to one million, the output of manufactured goods \n     increased by more than 300 percent, and average productivity \n     was up 25 percent. America had become the world's arsenal of \n     democracy.\n       Once mobilized, U.S. production lines annually turned out \n     20,000 tanks, 50,000 aircraft, 80,000 artillery pieces, and \n     500,000 trucks.\n       The enemy collapsed under America's superior capability to \n     manufacture and deliver large quantities of equipment and \n     supplies. Industry made an overwhelming contribution to final \n     victory, and this effort transformed the nation forever.\n       But the national war effort extended beyond the factories \n     and shipyards into every home and involved Americans of all \n     ages.\n       Scrap drives for tin, iron, rubber and newspapers linked \n     local neighborhoods to those on the front lines.\n       Victory gardens were planted, promoting pride in ``doing \n     your part'' while reducing dependence on a system working \n     overtime to supply food for our troops.\n       But nothing reflected home front commitment and resolution \n     more than the blue and gold stars hung in the windows of \n     homes across the nation: enduring symbols of service and \n     sacrifice.\n       World War II set the stage for business and industrial \n     growth that helped us rebuild the devastated nations of the \n     world, and fueled a national prosperity that we continue to \n     enjoy today.\n       Over the past three years, we once again witnessed a coming \n     together of the American people in support of a worthy cause, \n     and a willingness to share some of our great wealth to honor \n     those who kept us free to pursue our individual dreams.\n       The funding of the memorial was made possible by \n     corporations, foundations, and veterans organizations; by \n     civic, professional and fraternal groups; by the states; by \n     students in schools across the nation and hundreds of \n     thousands of individual Americans.\n       I can't possibly name all of our contributors--many are \n     listed in your program. But I do want to acknowledge a few \n     whose generosity became the foundation of our success: The \n     associates and customers of Wal-Mart and SAM'S Club stores, \n     and the foundation and employees of SBC Communications, Inc., \n     The Veterans of Foreign Wars and The American Legion, The \n     Lilly Endowment and the State of Pennsylvania.\n       Their gifts led the way, but every bit as important were \n     the grassroots efforts of Community Action Councils and \n     individual volunteers across the country; and the enthusiasm \n     of our young students, who showed their appreciation for \n     their family heroes through a variety of school recognition \n     and fund-raising activities.\n       Senator Dole and I thank all who lent their support to this \n     campaign with their words of encouragement and generous \n     gifts. It has been our pleasure to have played a role in \n     helping America say thank you to our World War II generation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n remarks of ambassador f. haydn williams, chairman, abmc wwii memorial \n                               committee\n\n       President Clinton, WWII Veterans and Ladies and Gentlemen:\n       I am grateful and privileged to have had the opportunity to \n     serve on the American Battle Monuments Commission, and to \n     have been involved in the planning for the World War II \n     Memorial and at the beginning of my remarks, I would like to \n     acknowledge the valuable help I have received from the \n     members of the Battle Monuments Commission and the Memorial \n     Advisory Board, especially the contributions of General \n     Woerner, Dr. Helen Fagin, Rolland Kidder, Jess Hay, and \n     General Pat Foote.\n       I would also like to thank General John Herrling, the \n     Secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission, and \n     his staff for their support.\n       Today marks a special moment in the nation's history as we \n     break ground for the National World War II Memorial here at \n     the Rainbow Pool. No other location in America could possibly \n     pay a higher tribute to the event it will commemorate and to \n     those it honors and memorializes than this awe inspiring \n     site--on the National Mall--the nation's village green. As \n     David Shribman, of the Boston Globe, has written, ``the \n     Memorial, lying on the symbolic centerline of our nation's \n     history, is fully deserving of this singular honor because \n     World War II is central to our history, central to our view \n     of our role in the world, and central to our values.''\n       We are deeply appreciative to those who have made this site \n     possible: the Congress for authorizing the location of the \n     World War II Memorial in Washington's monumental core area; \n     the Secretary of the Interior for endorsing and making the \n     site available; and, finally, The National Commission\n\n[[Page S11527]]\n\n     of Fine Arts and the National Capital Planning Commission. \n     After site visits and open public hearings, both of these \n     commissions have approved and subsequently reaffirmed this \n     magnificent location.\n       The glory of the Memorial is its setting, surrounded by the \n     visual and historic grandeur of the Mall, and the beauty of \n     it's open vistas--which will remain open thanks to Friedrich \n     St. Florian's visionary design concept. The addition of the \n     World War II Memorial to the Mall's great landmarks will \n     represent a continuation of the American story. It will \n     provide a linkage of the democratic ideals of the past. \n     Joining the company of Washington and Lincoln, and the \n     Capitol, the site will encourage reflection on American \n     democratic core values across the span of three centuries. No \n     other site in the nation's Capitol offers such visual and \n     emotional possibilities.\n       At the dedication of this site five years ago today, \n     President Clinton proclaimed that ``from this day forward, \n     this place belongs to the World War II generation and to \n     their families. Let us honor their achievements by upholding \n     always the values they defended and by guarding always the \n     dreams they fought and died for--for our children and our \n     children's children.''\n       To this end, the Memorial will be a legacy, a noble gift to \n     the nation from the American people to future generations. It \n     will be a timeless reminder of the moral strength and the \n     awesome power that can flow when a free people are at once \n     united and bonded together in a just and common cause. World \n     War II was indeed a special moment in time, one which changed \n     forever the face of American life and the direction of world \n     history . . . and, I might add, the lives of many, if not \n     most, of those in the audience this afternoon.\n       When finished, the Memorial will be a new and important \n     gathering place, a place for the joyous celebration of the \n     American spirit and national unity. It will be a place for \n     open democratic discourse, formal ceremonies, sunset parades, \n     band concerts, and other memorial events. It will, in \n     essence, be a living memorial, as well as a sacred shrine \n     honoring the nation, the homefront, the valor and sacrifice \n     of our Armed Forces, our allies, and the victory won in the \n     Second World War.\n       Now is the time to move forward to meet our last and most \n     important goal--the construction of the Memorial and its \n     formal dedication on Memorial Day, 2003, a day that will mark \n     the end of a long and memorable journey.\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n    Remarks of The Honorable William S. Cohen, Secretary of Defense\n\n       President Clinton, Senator Dole, Fred Smith, General \n     Woerner, distinguished guests, honored veterans, ladies and \n     gentlemen.\n       We are gathering to break ground and to raise a memorial of \n     granite and stone, but--as has been said this afternoon--more \n     deeply to honor the lives of those who saved this nation, and \n     this world, in its darkest hour. From Guadalcanal to Omaha \n     Beach, the millions of Americans who changed the course of \n     civilization itself will have their names etched in the book \n     of history in a far more profound and permanent way than even \n     the words to be inscribed on the arches that will rise around \n     us.\n       The great warrior and jurist Justice Oliver Holmes, Jr. \n     once looked into the eyes of his graying fellow veterans and \n     spoke words that ring with vibrancy and relevance to us \n     today, ``The list of ghosts grows long. The roster of men \n     grows short. Only one thing has not changed. As I look into \n     your eyes I feel that a great trial in your youth has made \n     you different. It made you citizens of the world.''\n       We, the heirs of your sacrifice, are citizens of the world \n     you made, and the nation you saved. And we can only stand in \n     awe at your silent courage, at your sense of duty, and at the \n     sacred gift that you have offered to all those who came after \n     you. The honor of this day belongs to you.\n       A veteran of our great war for freedom at home, General \n     Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, who hailed from the great state \n     of Maine, once said of his comrades, ``In great deeds \n     something abides. On great fields something stays. Forms \n     change and pass, bodies disappear, but spirits linger to \n     consecrate ground for the vision place of souls.''\n       The men and women of America's armed forces, those who \n     inherited four spirit, who defend the consecrated ground on \n     which you fought, today carry on your noble work, preserving \n     what you have created, defending the victory you achieved, \n     honoring the great deeds and ideals for which you struggled \n     and sacrificed. All of us, all of us, are truly and deeply in \n     your debt forever.\n       Now, on the 50th anniversary of D-Day, standing on the \n     bluff that overlooks Omaha Beach, President Clinton observed \n     that it is a ``hallowed place that speaks, more than anything \n     else, in silence.'' So many years after the merciless sound \n     of war had dissipated, the quiet and stillness of peace was \n     hypnotically deep and profound.\n       Today, as we break ground on another silent sentry which \n     will stand as a reminder of the long rattle of that now \n     distant war, we are honored to have with us a commander-in-\n     chief who has stood tall and strong for American leadership \n     for peace and democracy, who refused to remain indifferent to \n     the slaughter of innocent civilians, to the barbarity that we \n     all thought that Europe would never see again, who refused to \n     see evil re-ignited--the evil that you fought so hard to \n     stamp out. He led our allies to defeat the final echo of the \n     horrors from the 20th Century, preserving the victory you won \n     so long ago.\n       For nearly four years now, it has been my honor to serve, \n     and is now my great pleasure to introduce, the President of \n     the United States, Bill Clinton.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n     remarks of william j. clinton, president of the united states\n\n       Senator Thurmond once told me that he was the oldest man \n     who took a glider into Normandy. I don't know what that \n     means, 56 years later, but I'm grateful for all of the \n     members of Congress, beginning with Senator Thurmond and all \n     the others who are here, who never stopped serving their \n     country.\n       But most of all I want to say a thank you to Bob Dole, and \n     to Elizabeth, for their service to America. As my tenure as \n     president draws to a close, I have had, as you might imagine, \n     and up-and-down relationship with Senator Dole. But I liked \n     even the bad days. I always admired him. I was always \n     profoundly grateful for his courage and heroism in war, and \n     50 years of service in peace.\n       After a rich and long life, he could well have done \n     something else with his time in these last few years, but he \n     has passionately worked for this day, and I am profoundly \n     grateful.\n       I also want to thank the men and women and boys and girls \n     all across our country who participated in this fund-raising \n     drive, taking this memorial from dream to reality. Their \n     stories are eloquent testimony to its meaning.\n       Senator Dole and I were sitting up here watching the \n     program unfold today. He told me an amazing story. He said, \n     ``You know, one day a man from Easton, Pennsylvania, called \n     our office. He was a 73-year-old Armenian-American named \n     Sarkus Acopious.'' And he said, ``You know, I'd like to make \n     a contribution to this memorial. Where do I mail my \n     check?''--this caller.\n       So he was given the address, and shortly after, this man \n     who was grateful for the opportunities America had given him, \n     a check arrived in the office, a check for $1 million.\n       But there were all the other checks as well, amounting to \n     over $140 million in private contributions. There were \n     contributions from those still too young to serve, indeed, \n     far too young to remember the war. More than 1,100 schools \n     across our nation have raised money for the memorial by \n     collecting cans, holding bake sales, putting on dances.\n       Let me just tell you about one of them: Milwaukie High \n     School in Milwaukie, Oregon. Five years ago, a teacher named \n     Ken Buckles wanted to pay tribute to the World War II \n     veterans. He and his students searched out local veterans and \n     invited them to school for a living history day.\n       Earlier this week, Living History Day 2000 honored more \n     than 3,000 veterans with a retreated USO show that filled a \n     pro basketball arena. Last year's event raised $10,000 for \n     the memorial, and students think that this year they'll raise \n     even more.\n       Now what makes those kids fund raise and organize and \n     practice for weeks on end? Well, many have grandparents and \n     other relatives who fought in the war, but there must be more \n     to it than that. They learned from their families and \n     teachers that the good life they enjoy as Americans was made \n     possible by the sacrifices of others more than a half century \n     ago.\n       And maybe most important, they want us to know something \n     positive about their own generation as well, and their desire \n     to stand for something greater than themselves. They didn't \n     have the money to fly out here today, but let's all of us \n     send a loud thank you to the kids at Milwaukie High School \n     and their teacher, Ken Buckles, and all the other young \n     people who have supported this cause.\n       The ground we break today is not only a timeless tribute to \n     the bravery and honor of one generation, but a challenge to \n     every generation that follows. This memorial is built not \n     only for the children whose grandparents served in the war, \n     but for the children who will visit this place a century from \n     now, asking questions about America's great victory for \n     freedom.\n       With this memorial, we secure the memory of 16 million \n     Americans, men and women who took up arms in the greatest \n     struggle humanity has ever known.\n       We hallow the ground for more than 400,000 who never came \n     home. We acknowledge a debt that can never be repaid. We \n     acknowledge as well the men and women and children of the \n     home front, who tended the factories and nourished the faith \n     that made victory possible; remember those who fought \n     faithfully and bravely for freedom, even as their own full \n     humanity was under assault: African-Americans who had to \n     fight for the right to fight for our country, Japanese-\n     Americans who served bravely under a cloud of unjust \n     suspicion, Native American code-talkers who helped to win the \n     war in the Pacific, women who took on new roles in the \n     military and at home.\n       Remember how, in the heat of battle and the necessity of \n     the moment, all of these folks moved closer to being simply \n     American.\n       And we remember how after World War II, those who won the \n     war on foreign battlefields dug deep and gave even more to \n     win the peace here at home, to give us a new era of \n     prosperity, to lay the foundation for a new\n\n[[Page S11528]]\n\n     global society and economy by turning old adversaries into \n     new allies, by launching a movement for social justice that \n     still lifts millions of Americans into dignity and \n     opportunity.\n       I would like to say once more, before I go, to the veterans \n     here today what I said in Normandy in 1994: Because of you, \n     my generation and those who have followed live at a time of \n     unequaled peace and prosperity. We are the children of your \n     sacrifice and we thank you forever.\n       But now, as then, progress is not inevitable. It requires \n     eternal vigilance and sacrifice. Earlier today, at the \n     Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery, we paid \n     tribute to the fallen heroes of the United States Ship Cole, \n     three of whom have recently been buried at Arlington. The \n     captain of the ship and 20 of the crew members were there \n     today. We honor them.\n       Next week I will go to Vietnam to honor the men and women \n     America lost there, to stand with those still seeking a full \n     accounting of the missing.\n       But at the same time, I want to give support to Vietnamese \n     and Americans who are working together to build a better \n     future, in Vietnam, under the leadership of former \n     congressman and former Vietnam POW, Pete Peterson, who has \n     reminded us that we can do nothing about the past but we can \n     always change the future.\n       That's what all of you did after the war with Germans, \n     Italians and Japanese. You've built the world we love and \n     enjoy today.\n       The wisdom this monument will give us is to learn from the \n     past and look to the future. May the light of freedom that \n     will stand at the center of this memorial inspire every \n     person who sees it to keep the flame of freedom forever \n     burning in the eyes of our children, and to keep the memory \n     of the greatest generation warm in the hearts of every new \n     generation of Americans.\n       Thank you and God bless America.\n\n       \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11528-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF SALISSA WAHLERS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

She was named Woman of the Year by the Women's Studies \nProgram while at Middlebury. While in college, Salissa participated in \nthe semester abroad program by attending Monash University in \nMelbourne, Australia. Additionally, she attended a winter semester at \nBerea College in Kentucky as a part of her college's winter term \nexchange program.\n  Mr. President, Salissa worked for three years during college to \ncomplete her honors thesis, which is very impressive for an \nundergraduate student. Her hard work paid off when she was able to \npresent part of her thesis at the Northeastern Anthropological \nAssociation Conference in Queens, New York, this spring. She is clearly \na model student, and she exemplifies the rewards that individuals and \nsociety as a whole realize when education is a priority.

Mr. President, it has been over a year since the Columbine \ntragedy, but still this Congress refuses to act on sensible gun \nlegislation.\n  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. \nLast Tuesday, on Election Day, voters in Colorado and Oregon fed up \nwith such violence voted overwhelmingly to close the gun-show loophole, \nwhich extends background checks to all prospective purchasers of \nfirearms at gun shows. Voters in those states recognized the need to \npass responsible gun laws that can keep our schools and streets safe. \nNow, Congress should follow their lead.\n  Until Congress acts, those of us in the Senate who are committed to \nenacting responsible gun laws, will read the names of a number of those \nwho have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year. The \nfollowing are the names of some of the people who were killed by \ngunfire one year ago today.\n\n\n                           November 14, 1999\n\n  Kenneth Jeffcoat, 18, Washington, DC;\n  George Jones, 20, Washington, DC;\n  Derrick Rogers, 43, Detroit, MI;\n  Andrian Thomas, 23, Detroit, MI;\n  Unidentified male, 25, Long Beach, CA;\n  Unidentified male, 20, Norfolk, VA; and\n  Unidentified male, San Francisco, CA.\n  Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by \ngunfire one year ago on November 2, 1999, the last day the Senate was \nin session.\n\n\n                            November 2, 1999\n\n  Robert Lee Covington, 51, Memphis, TN;\n  Carey Jackson, 34, Fort Worth, TX;\n  Eddie Kennedy, 28, Atlanta, GA;\n  Victor Killebrew, 36, St. Louis, MO;\n  Dwayne Lemon, 36, Chicago, IL;\n  Douglas Pendleton, 30, Chicago, IL;\n  Joseph Slater, 19, Kansas City, MO;\n  Angel Walker, 20, St. Louis, MO;\n  Charles Watts, 19, Philadelphia, PA;\n  Unidentified female, San Francisco, CA;\n  Unidentified male, 40, Honolulu, HI;\n  Unidentified male, 30, Honolulu, HI;\n  Unidentified male, 58, Honolulu, HI;\n  Unidentified male, 54, Honolulu, HI;\n  Unidentified male, 46, Honolulu, HI;\n  Unidentified male, 36, Honolulu, HI; and\n  Unidentified male, 36, Honolulu, HI.\n  The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that Congress \nmust enact sensible gun legislation now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11528-3", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ON THE RECENT ELECTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate all those who participated \nin our recent Federal and State elections. In Vermont 63 percent of \nregistered voters went to the polls and voted. In other States it was a \nbit more, in some a bit less.\n  The 2000 presidential election reminds us all that every vote counts. \nState electoral votes for President and Vice President may be decided \nin some States by the fewest in history, literally a handful of votes. \nIn New Mexico, the counting continues and the outcome is very close. In \nFlorida, the counting continues and the outcome is very close.\n  Likewise in Washington State, the vote for the Senator from \nWashington is still being counted and is very close. A number of House \ncongressional races remain very close and final results may have to \nawait recounts and the outcome of protests and challenges. The results \nof the Senate and House elections are such that the House and Senate \nthemselves will have equal numbers or almost equal numbers of Democrats \nand Republicans.\n  I want to commend all those who participated. I welcome our newest \nSenators-elect. Many are in town this week. I welcome Jean Carnahan, \nDebbie Stabenow, Tom Carper, Jon Corzine, Mark Dayton, Ben Nelson, Bill \nNelson, and Hillary Rodham Clinton. In addition, we may be joined by \nMaria Cantwell. We will be joined by George Allen, and John Ensign. All \nwill add greatly to our ranks and, I hope, to the Senate's ability to \nfind answers to the problems of the American people.\n  The Congress will be confronted with a number of challenges. We will \nneed to find ways to work together. In the Senate, the possibility of a \nSenate equally divided among Democrats and Republicans has prompted the \nDemocratic Leader to make the suggestion that we consider new and less \nconfrontational organizational principles that would include equal \nmembership ratios on our Committees and equal staffing and equitable \nsharing of resources. Those are suggestions that should be seriously \nconsidered. I look forward to working with all Senators in the coming \ndays: Senators in this Congress as we complete our work before \nadjourning sine die and Senators in the next Congress as we organize \nfor our work in January.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11528-4", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11528-S11529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DEPRESSION, SUICIDE, AND MEDICARE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to new \ndata with respect to older Americans and mental illnesses that support \nswift consideration by the Senate of the Medicare Mental Health \nModernization Act, S. 3233, a bill that I introduced on October 25, \n2000.\n  Throughout my Senate career, I have been concerned about mental \nillness and the unfair discrimination faced by those with this serious \nillness. We now know from Surgeon General David\n\n[[Page S11529]]\n\nSatcher, in his recent report, ``Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon \nGeneral,'' that the rate of major clinical depression and the incidence \nof suicide among senior citizens is alarmingly high. This report cites \nthat about one-half of patients relocated to nursing homes from the \ncommunity are at greater risk for depression. Moreover, up to 37% of \nolder adults treated in primary care settings experience symptoms of \ndepression. At the same time, the Surgeon General emphasizes that \ndepression ``is not well-recognized or treated in primary care \nsettings,'' and calls attention to the alarming fact that older people \nhave the highest rates of suicide in the U.S. population. Contrary to \nwhat is widely believed, suicide rates actually increase with age, and, \nas the Surgeon General points out, ``depression is a foremost risk \nfactor for suicide in older adults.''\n  Clearly, Mr. President, our nation must take steps to ensure that \nmental health care is easily and readily available under the Medicare \nprogram. S. 3233, the Medicare Mental Health Modernization Act, takes \nan important first step in that direction. It is time to take this \npotential fatal illness seriously. I believe we must do everything we \ncan to make effective treatments available in a timely manner for older \nadults and others covered by Medicare, and help prevent relapse and \nrecurrence once mental illness is diagnosed.\n  The mental health community is very aware of the problems in the \nMedicare system and is fighting to improve it. I want to thank those \ngroups that have supported this initial effort to improve mental health \ncare in the Medicare program, particularly the American Mental Health \nCounselors Association (AMHCA) for their leadership role in fighting \nfor improved mental health care coverage for seniors under Medicare. \nTheir support joins that of the other major mental health groups \nmentioned in my earlier statement, as well as the Association for the \nAdvancement of Psychology, the Clinical Social Work Federation, the \nFederation of Families for Children's Mental Health, the International \nAssociation of Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services, and the National \nCouncil for Community Behavioral Healthcare. I want to applaud the \ndetermination of these groups for stepping forward to fight for the \nrights of those with mental illnesses, and their commitment to \nimproving mental health services funded by the Medicare program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11529-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE MARINE CORPS 225TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, On November 10th, we honored the 225th \nbirthday of the United States Marine Corps. For more than two \ncenturies, the United States Marine Corps has exemplified the highest \nvirtues of loyalty, service, and sacrifice. From the Barbary coast to \nthe far reaches of the Pacific, in the jungles of Vietnam and across \nthe vast expanse of the Arabian desert, America's Marines have shown \nthe world the meaning of ``Semper Fi.''\n  Through the long march of our history, few military organizations \nhave been held in such high esteem as the United States Marine Corps. \nOur Marine Corps are men and women of great character. They are smart, \ntough, dedicated, and faithful, truly the best America has to offer. \nFor 225 years, they have stood for all that is great about this nation: \nhonor, courage, and commitment. Their values, sense of courage, and \nquiet, steadfast character remain timeless and valuable commodities for \nan age in which our Nation's interests face considerable new threats.\n  Throughout their great history, Marines protected America's \ninterests, struggled against foes who attempted to do our country harm, \nand remained at the forefront of our Nation's efforts to maintain \nglobal peace and stability. In hundreds of distant lands, from \nNicaragua to Lebanon to Somalia, Marines restored and maintained order, \naided people in distress, provided protection for the weak, and upheld \nthe values that have come to define our country on the world stage. \nMany made the ultimate sacrifice in the service of their country, and \nwe honor their memory.\n  In my hometown of New Orleans, we are fortunate enough to be rich in \nMarine Corps history and tradition. We are the proud home of the Marine \nForces Reserve Headquarters where Major General Mize commands more than \n104,000 Reserve Marines all across the United States. We are also the \nhome of the last Medal of Honor winner in the Vietnam War, General \nJames E. Livingston. Despite the fact that then-Captain Livingston was \nwounded a third time and unable to walk, he steadfastly remained in a \ndangerously exposed area, supervising the evacuation of casualties. \nOnly when assured of the safety of his men did he allow himself to be \nevacuated. His valor on the battlefield epitomizes the spirit of the \nMarine Corps.\n  As we set out in this new century, the importance of our Marine Corps \nhas never been more clear. Tomorrow, as today and for generations past, \nthe razor sharp readiness of the United States Marine Corps serves as a \nbeacon to America's friends and a warning to our enemies, promising \nswift action, great victories and richer traditions yet to come.\n  On this day, I offer warmest regards to all who have worn the eagle, \nglobe and anchor, and to the families who also serve by supporting \nthem. You represent all that is wonderful about our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11529-2", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11529-S11530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HELPING SOUTH DAKOTA COMMUNITIES FIGHT CRIME\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, throughout the past year, I continued \nworking with local and state community leaders and law enforcement \nofficials all across South Dakota in an effort to find solutions to the \nmost pressing problems facing the people of my state. A number of \nissues that Congress can address were brought to my attention through \nthese meetings, and I continue to find this statewide dialog extremely \nvaluable on further developing a community approach to reducing crime. \nI've worked on a bipartisan basis with my colleagues in the United \nStates Senate to help South Dakota communities get the resources they \nneed to address the crime problems they face.\n\n\n                Community Policing and the COPS Program\n\n  Community Policing has proven effective in reducing crime rates \nnationwide, and I am optimistic that such efforts in our small towns \nwill prove equally successful. As you know, the majority of potential \noffenders, both juvenile and adult, in our state are still within reach \nof rehabilitation and support to put them back on track as productive, \nlaw abiding citizens.\n  I believe the Congress must assist state and local efforts to crack \ndown on crime by continuing federal support through funding for \nlocalized programs. One of the most successful programs in South Dakota \nhas been the COPS program. Since 1995, the COPS program has allowed \nSouth Dakota communities to hire 290 new police officers. In addition, \nthe COPS program has expanded recently to help school districts hire \npolice resource officers to deal with youth violence in South Dakota \nschools. The COPS in School's program has committed $1.25 million to \nSouth Dakota communities.\n  Although the COPS program has helped reduce the overall crime rate \nnationwide and has been extremely popular with local law enforcement in \nour state, I find myself once again working to make sure the program is \nadequately funded. I support the Administration's request of $1.3 \nbillion for the COPS program to hire 7,000 new police officers \nnationwide, provide local law enforcement with advanced crime fighting \ntechnology, hire more community prosecutors, expand crime prevention \nprograms, enhance school safety programs, and assist law enforcement on \nIndian Reservations. At this level of funding, South Dakota would \nreceive an estimated $734,000 next year to help fight crime in our \ncommunities and in Indian Country.\n  However, the Senate and House Leadership's inability to pass the \nannual appropriations bills has put COPS funding in jeopardy. I will \ncontinue to work with my colleagues to increase funding for this \ncritical program and am hopeful that common sense will prevail over \npartisan gamesmanship on this crucial issue.\n\n\n       The Kyl-Johnson Federal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act\n\n  Senator Jon Kyl (R-AZ) and I introduced two years ago a bill to \nrequire federal prisoners to pay a nominal fee when they initiate \ncertain visits for medical attention. Fees collected from\n\n[[Page S11530]]\n\nprisoners will either be paid as restitution to victims or be deposited \ninto the Federal Crime Victims' Fund. I am pleased that the President \nrecently signed into law the Kyl-Johnson Federal Prisoner Health Care \nCopayment Act.\n  South Dakota is one of 38 states that have implemented state-wide \nprisoner health care copayment programs. The Department of Justice \nsupported extending this prisoner health care copayment program to \nfederal prisoners in an attempt to reduce unnecessary medical \nprocedures and ensure that adequate health care services are available \nfor prisoners who need them.\n  My interest in the prisoner health care copayment issue came from \ndiscussions I had in South Dakota with a number of law enforcement \nofficials and U.S. Marshal Lyle Swenson about the equitable treatment \nbetween pre-sentencing federal prisoners housed in county jails and \nthe county prisoners residing in those same facilities. Currently, \ncounty prisoners in South Dakota are subject to state and local laws \nallowing the collection of a health care copayment, while Marshals \nService prisoners are not, thereby allowing federal prisoners to abuse \nhealth care resources at great cost to state and local law enforcement.\n\n  As our legislation moved through the Senate Judiciary Committee and \nSenate last year, we had the opportunity to work on specific concerns \nraised by South Dakota law enforcement officials and the U.S. Marshals \nService. Senator Kyl was willing to incorporate my language into the \nFederal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act that allows state and local \nfacilities to collect health care copayment fees when housing pre-\nsentencing federal prisoners.\n\n\n                       Violence Against Women Act\n\n  I am pleased the President recently signed into law a reauthorization \nof the landmark Violence Against Women Act. The legislation is part of \na larger bill that also includes ``Aimee's Law.'' I've supported \nAimee's Law'' in the past and am pleased this provision will help crack \ndown on states that fail to incarcerate criminals convicted of murder, \nrape, and dangerous sexual offenses for long prison terms.\n  I've been involved in the campaign to end domestic violence in our \ncommunities dating back to 1983 when I introduced legislation in the \nSouth Dakota State Legislature to use marriage license fees to help \nfund domestic abuse shelters. In 1994, as a member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, I helped get the original Violence Against Women Act \npassed into law. Since the passage of this important bill, South Dakota \nhas received over $8 million in funding for battered women's shelters \nand family violence prevention and services.\n  In South Dakota alone, approximately 15,000 victims of domestic \nviolence were provided assistance last year, and over 40 domestic \nviolence shelters and outreach centers in the state received funding \nthrough the Violence Against Women Act. Shelters, victims' service \nproviders, and counseling centers in South Dakota rely heavily on these \nfunds to provide assistance to these women and children.\n  The original Violence Against Women Act increased penalties for \nrepeat sex offenders, established mandatory restitution to victims of \ndomestic violence, codified much of our existing laws on rape, and \nstrengthened interstate enforcement of violent crimes against women. I \nam pleased to support efforts this year that strengthen these laws, \nexpand them to include stalking on the internet and via the mail, and \nprovide local law enforcement with additional resources to combat \ndomestic violence in their communities.\n\n\n                            Juvenile Justice\n\n  While I am pleased that Congress continued to debate Juvenile Crime \nlegislation this session, I am disappointed that Senate and House \nLeadership will allow Congress to adjourn without enacting important \njuvenile crime prevention programs into law. The leadership of several \nof America's law enforcement organizations, along with prosecutors and \ncrime survivors, have consistently endorsed quality child care and \nafter-school programs as a primary way to dramatically and immediately \nreduce crime.\n  I will continue to support significant increases in funding for Head \nStart, Early Head Start, after-school programs and the Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant program in large part because of the potential \nthese programs have to reduce juvenile crime and domestic violence \nnationwide.\n\n\n               Combatting Methamphetamine in South Dakota\n\n  A number of South Dakota law enforcement officials and local leaders \nhave told me that meth abuse has become one of their top crime-fighting \npriorities in the past few years. Meth abuse threatens our young \npeople, law enforcement officers, and our environment. Once again, I \nled efforts to enhance punishments of meth operators, mandate \nrestitution for meth lab clean-up, and increase funding for treatment \nand prevention efforts. I also joined Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA) in \nsuccessfully securing emergency funding for meth lab clean-up efforts \nin South Dakota and nationwide.\n  There is much to be done to bring crime rates in our state down, and \nto help every South Dakotan feel safe in their home and community. I \nlook forward to continuing my work with state and local leaders, law \nenforcement agencies in South Dakota, and my Republican and Democratic \nSenate colleagues in Washington. Together, by focusing on community \ncrime prevention and by investing in our kids, I believe we can make \nprogress in addressing the unique needs of our South Dakota \ncommunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11530-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO COL. ROBERT F. SINK\n\n Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, history gives us many examples of \nmen and women who went above and beyond the call of duty to serve our \ngreat country. In our military, there have always been men and women \nwho were not satisfied with maintaining the status quo, but who, \ninstead, strove to make our armed forces the world's finest and the \nmost powerful. One such individual was the late Colonel Robert F. Sink, \ncommander of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment in Toccoa, Georgia.\n  The 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment was constituted on July 1, 1942 \nin the Army of the United States, activated July 20, 1942 at Camp \nGeneral Robert Toombs at Toccoa, Georgia, attached to the 101st \nAirborne Division on June 1, 1943 and assigned to the 101st Airborne \nDivision on March 1, 1945. The camp located at Currahee Mountain in \nToccoa was soon renamed Camp Toccoa and was chosen because of its \nrugged terrain. The 506th Regiment selected the symbol of the Currahee \nMountain as its Coat of Arms and ``Currahee'' became its battle cry.\n  It was here, in Toccoa, that Col. Sink initiated his rigorous \ntraining program called ``Muscle College'' and set many of the \nstandards for the paratrooper basic training program of the 101st \nAirborne Division. Because of Col. Sink's efforts, the 506th Parachute \nInfantry established records never before reached by any military unit \nin the world. Furthermore, Airborne infantrymen around the nation \nrecognized the ``Currahee trained'' men from Camp Toccoa as a cut above \ntheir peers in strength and performance.\n  Col. Sink led his 506th Regiment into combat on D-Day at Normandy, \nthen to Holland, Bastogne, France, Germany, and all the way to Hitler's \n``Eagle Nest.'' By the end of World War II, the 506th had received \nseveral coveted awards and decorations. The courageous service of the \n506th Parachute Infantry Regiment was due, in no small measure, to the \ntireless efforts of Colonel Robert F. Sink, a true American hero. In \nhonor of this great man, the Currahee Mountain Road, which changed the \nboys of the famous ``Currahee'' Regiment into men, will be fittingly \nrenamed the ``Col. Robert F. Sink Memorial Trail.''\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me today in honoring this great \nman and his groundbreaking work on behalf of our nation's security. For \nthose under Colonel Sink's tutelage who will travel back to Toccoa for \nthis important reunion and celebration, I wish you the best and thank \nyou for your service. Finally, special thanks should be extended to \nState Representative Mary Jeanette Jamieson for her work on this \nproject. It was a pleasure to be involved in such a worthy \neffort.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11531-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11531]]\n                    TRIBUTE TO REVEREND WILLIE JAMES\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ngreat work of a civil rights pioneer and chapter president of the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People of \nWillingboro, New Jersey, Reverend Willie James, on the occasion of his \nreceiving the award for exemplary community service.\n  Reverend James began his work for civil rights in 1958 when he \nattempted to buy a house in Willingboro's Levitt community. He was told \nthat houses would not be sold to African-Americans. Reverend James \ndecided to sue. Two years later, the United States Supreme Court \nofficially integrated Willingboro, enabling Reverend James to become \none of the community's first African-American residents.\n  In 1974, work demands forced Reverend James to move to Rhode Island. \nWhile in Rhode Island, Reverend James joined a statewide commission \nthat studied disparities in white and minority prison rates than \nwhites.\n  Eventually Reverend James returned to New Jersey where his level of \nactivism flourished. He became president of the Willingboro chapter of \nthe NAACP. During his time as president, Reverend James made great \nprogress researching the issue of disproportionate African-American \nmale imprisonment.\n  In the recent election, Reverend James and the local chapter of the \nNAACP worked on motivating minorities to vote. Reverend James is a \nrecipient of more than 30 local and national awards for his commitment \nto public service.\n  I am pleased to honor Reverend Willie James on this joyous occasion. \nHis family, his friends, and his community are indebted to him for his \nunyielding service. This honor is richly-deserved. I salute him on yet \nanother great achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11531-2", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN RECOGNITION OF MR.

Woody, president \nand owner of the longest running car dealership in the Nation--Woody \nPontiac Sales, Inc. Mr. Woody, who continued active participation in \nthe business, until he was 92 years old in June 2000, when he \nofficially closed the Pontiac dealership he opened in the city of \nHamtramck, MI in 1940.\n  Mr. Woody has come to be known as the pillar of his industry. In \n1966, his dealership hit its peak year with the sale of 2,200 cars. \nRevered by his peers and the people of Michigan, he was inducted into \nthe Automotive Hall of Fame. Over the 60-year operation of his \ndealership, Woody, as he is called by friends and family, estimates \nthat he sold over 100,000 Pontiacs, one of General Motors' leading \nproducts. He says his success is due to his genuine love of life and \npeople.\n  This immigrant from Lebanon, embodies the ultimate success story of \nthe American dream. Much of why he is being honored is because of his \ndedication and loyalty to the citizens of the city of Hamtramck and his \nbeloved Lebanon. When the economy recessed and auto sales reflected a \ndownturn, Woody never considered moving his dealership from the \ncommunity that supported him through prosperous times. Hailed for his \nphilanthropic activities, he spearheaded a drive to build a new \nfacility for the Hamtramck Public Library. In addition, he has worked \nwith Junior Achievement and the Rotary Club for more than 50 years \naccomplishing projects which support community growth. Woody has also \nbeen just as committed to the people of his homeland, where he has \nbuilt a school and medical clinic.\n  Although Woody promises to continue his work in the community, \ninteracting with various civic and fraternal organizations for the good \nof the community, the industry has lost its senior statesman and he \nwill be sorely missed. We all wish Woody continued health, happiness \nand prosperity in the years ahead. I am sure my colleagues join me in \nthe celebration of the life of Mr. Woodrow W. Woody, extending to him \nthe good will and wishes of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11531-3", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11531-S11533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF BRIAN KAATZ, PHARM.

While his expertise lies in clinical \npharmacy, Brian's interests range from issues involving infectious \ndiseases and use of antibiotics, nutrition, health care ethics, drug \npolicy and roles for pharmacists.\n  Currently a Professor and Department Head of Clinical Pharmacy at the \nSouth Dakota State University, Brian has had a career filled with \naccomplishments. He has been president of the South Dakota Society of \nHospital Pharmacists, a member of the committee that re-wrote the \npharmacy practice act passed by the South Dakota legislature in 1992, \nan official delegate several times to the American Society of Health-\nSystem Pharmacy annual meeting, and served as a consultant to several \nSouth Dakota hospitals and law firms. Additionally, Brian has authored \nor co-authored approximately twenty-five professional articles and is \ncurrently the editor of the South Dakota Journal of Medicine's \nPharmacology Focus column, published monthly in South Dakota's \nPhysician Journal. He has made numerous major presentations both \nregionally and nationally, and received several awards over the years \nfor his notable career.\n  Throughout the past three months, Brian has worked on a number of \nprojects in my office dealing with pharmacy and health care. Brian led \nresearch efforts regarding a comprehensive study comparing prescription \ndrug prices throughout South Dakota and the impact of rising drug costs \non those without insurance. Many millions of Americans, both Medicare \nage and younger have either inadequate or no prescription drug \ninsurance at all. There are roughly 39 million Medicare beneficiaries \nin this country, one third of whom have no prescription drug coverage. \nAt a time, when drug prices are rising at rates far greater than the \nrate of inflation and seniors around this country are forced to choose \nbetween buying food or pills, we have an inadequate Medicare program \nthat provides no coverage for prescription drug costs. The study that \nBrian spearheaded provided me with crucial data and real life stories \ndepicting the impact of this issue for South Dakotans, young and old \nalike. Brian's research furnished my office with up-to-date and \nunbiased information that enabled me to communicate effectively with my \nconstituents, especially pharmacists, during this time. Unfortunately, \nCongress was not able to come to an agreement on how we provide \nMedicare beneficiaries with prescription drug coverage, therefore the \ninformation that Brian compiled for me will be critically important as \nI work on this issue in the 107th Congress next year.\n  Brian also facilitated discussions with the Government Accounting \nOffice, GAO, on two subject matters involving direct-to-consumer \nadvertising of prescription drugs and conflict of interest matters \ninvolving the Food and Drug Administration's Advisory Committee \nmembers. The research Brian conducted in these two areas will provide \nme with the basis for further discussions with GAO and congressional \ncommittees seeking hearings into these matters. Brian previously \nauthored and co-authored two articles specifically on the subject of \ndirect-to-consumer advertising and has completed extensive research in \nthis field.\n  I ask to have the contents of these two articles printed in the \nRecord following completion of my statement.\n  One of the most important tasks as a Senator is to communicate with \nyour constituents back home. Balancing my\n\n[[Page S11532]]\n\nduties in Washington with my schedule in South Dakota is often \nchallenging due to uncertainties of the Senate schedule. Brian's \nestablished relationship with the South Dakota Pharmacist's \nAssociation, South Dakota Board of Pharmacy and several national \npharmacy organizations was extremely crucial to his work with my \noffice. He was able to advance discussions surrounding several issues \nwith these groups which will aid me tremendously in my future work with \nprescription drugs, roles of pharmacists and other health policy \nmatters.\n  Brian can take pride in his career and dedication to health care \nissues. He is a recognized health care expert, an educator, an author, \nan advocate and a friend. I wish to express my deep gratitude to Brian \nfor a job well done. I wish him the very best in his future endeavors.\n  The articles follow.\n\n         [From the South Dakota Journal of Medicine, Dec. 1998]\n\n   Direct-To-Consumer Advertising of Prescription Drugs: An Ethical \n                              Perspective\n\n                            (By Brian Kaatz)\n\n       There is no doubt to anyone who reads this that the \n     detailing and promotion of prescription drugs is big \n     business. Thousands of sales representatives are employed and \n     millions of dollars are spent annually to explain the \n     putative advantages of certain products over others.\n       Notably, the effort by pharmaceutical manufacturers to \n     expand market share of certain targeted prescription drugs \n     has traditionally been directed solely to health \n     professionals. This has changed in a big way.\n       Newspapers, magazines, and television are inundated with \n     prescription drug promotions aimed at attracting the \n     attention and interest of the public. Advertisements are \n     intended to stimulate the individual interest of patients, \n     which then potentially will result in inquiries (or demands) \n     directly to physicians for that product. This approach may \n     seem entirely satisfactory to the general public, but it is \n     potentially problematic from several standpoints.\n       Even under the best of circumstances, most clinicians will \n     admit that their knowledge of new drug products is far from \n     complete. Ideally, a perspective of when or if to use a new \n     product will come from careful surveillance of the primary \n     literature, consultation with a respected and knowledgeable \n     colleague, or from an unbiased, current review of a specific \n     category of drugs. Many physicians pragmatically approach a \n     new drug intending to be ``neither the first nor last'' to \n     use it. This approach could understandably be thwarted if a \n     number of patients persistently request a particular product \n     as a result of the tried-and-true marketing approach of \n     repetitive media encounters and high product visibility.\n       A patient may not be understanding if her physician tells \n     her that he has no experience with a drug when at the same \n     time the patient has seen it advertised maybe 20 times in the \n     last two weeks. What is wrong with my doctor? Doesn't he \n     watch TV?\n       The result may be subtle pressure or even coercion to \n     prescribe the drug in question.\n       Tens of millions of dollars are spent advertising drugs \n     like Claritin, Rezulin, Zocor, and Pravachol. Apparently, \n     this approach has been especially successful since August of \n     1997, when the FDA allowed televised advertisements to be \n     exempt from detailed descriptions of drug risks. This ruling \n     at least relieved the viewing public from the sometimes \n     bizarre, oblique ads that were seen prior to this, when \n     requirements limited drugs to a name but no detail as to its \n     use. Even relatively astute observers were sometimes confused \n     about the intent of these commercials.\n       Now, patients and other interested parties are referred to \n     the Internet or other sources ``for more information,'' \n     though they obviously are already headed down the road of \n     special interest in that drug.\n       Beyond the easy questions that would ask, why can't these \n     tens of millions of dollars be used to lower drug costs, or \n     be put into research for new and safer pharmacologic \n     entities, what of the ethics of direct-to-consumer \n     advertising?\n       Patient autonomy has been argued elsewhere as being the \n     preeminent ethics principle. There is a strong case for \n     patients knowing as much as they can reasonably understand \n     about disease processes and medication risks and advantages. \n     There is also a strong case for patients being actively \n     involved in their own therapeutic journeys and fully \n     participating in these kinds of decisions. But can we relate \n     direct-to-consumer advertising with true patient autonomy? Is \n     advertising valuable in the effort to develop autonomous \n     decision making? There is a case for answering these \n     questions in the negative.\n       It must be remembered that patient autonomy does not begin \n     and end with the simple act of a patient making a decision. \n     To the contrary, autonomous decision-making occurs only when \n     there is a fully informed decision-maker. Autonomy is based \n     upon that important element. Thus, one can readily see that a \n     brief, colorful advertisement by itself offers little in the \n     way of full disclosure and does not contain the complete \n     tools necessary to make an autonomous decision.\n       It perhaps is particularly important in these situations \n     for doctors to maintain a healthy beneficent attitude which \n     could result in a patient receiving a drug with which his \n     physician is familiar and comfortable, rather than the one \n     that is most persistently on prime time. It is not a \n     disservice to attempt to dissuade a patient who is only \n     partially armed with knowledge from committing to long term \n     therapy with a potentially suboptimal drug. And it is not \n     true autonomy that is being exerted when a patient presses \n     for that drug. What might at first glance seem like autonomy \n     lost is actually beneficence gained.\n\n [From the Journal of Medical Humanities and Bioethics, Spring/Summer \n                                 1987]\n\n  The Physician and the Pharmaceutical Detail Man: An Ethical Analysis\n\n                 (By Jerome W. Freeman and Brian Kaatz)\n\n       The principal focus of medical practice should be the \n     patient's interest. The physician's conduct in the clinical \n     realm should consistently reflect this. Arguably, this ideal \n     is not always realized. An example of a circumstance in which \n     the patient's interest does not predominate occurs in the \n     context of the physician's interaction with pharmaceutical \n     companies. These companies have a variety of marketing \n     techniques directed at physicians in order to promote \n     prescription drugs. This essay will explore the ethical \n     implications of one aspect of these marketing programs--\n     namely, the role of pharmaceutical salespersons. These men \n     and women have a variety of titles including ``sales \n     representative,'' ``medical sales liaison,'' and ``detail \n     man.'' The latter term is commonly used, apparently as a \n     reflection of these representatives' efforts to provide \n     physicians with details or data about drugs.\n       Before attempting to assess the ethical implications of \n     pharmaceutical companies' marketing techniques, a specific \n     inquiry into the goals and ideals of medical practice is \n     warranted. Most physicians take for granted the notion that \n     the patient's interest is of primary importance and that \n     moral dilemmas in medicine are appropriately resolved through \n     a patient-centered ethic. Kass reflects this view when he \n     notes that ``loyalty to the patient must be paramount, first, \n     because the mysterious activity of healing depends on trust \n     and confidence, which is lodged by the vulnerable and \n     dependent patient with the physician, in the very act of \n     submitting to his care.''\n       The basis for such a patient-centered ethic derives from, \n     and is consistent with, basic ethical principles. Veatch' \n     characterizes these principles as the ``basic social \n     contract,'' and he points out that diverse ethical systems \n     frequently arrive at a similar core of basic principles and \n     derivative rules. Often such principles include autonomy, \n     nonmaleficence and beneficence. On the basis of such \n     articulated principles, society can proceed to define the \n     nature of relationships between a profession and society. \n     Veatch argues that this process can establish that a contract \n     or covenant exists between the physician and society and \n     between the physician and the individual patient. This \n     covenant arguably mandates a patient-centered ethic in \n     medicine, guided by adherence to those basic ethical \n     principles society has defined and endorsed.\n       Of these major principles, autonomy dictates that the \n     physician treat the patient with dignity and respect and that \n     the patient be allowed to participate in his or her own \n     health care decisions. Nonmaleficence warrants that the \n     physician endeavor to avoid causing the patient harm through \n     his actions. The sense of this principle, thought to derive \n     from the Oath of Hippocrates, is often quoted in the Latin \n     phrase primum non nocere (first, do no harm). Beneficence \n     stipulates that the physician work actively to benefit the \n     patient by contributing to his or her health and welfare.\n       In this ethical framework, it is possible to characterize \n     the impact that pharmaceutical marketing techniques have on \n     the physician-patient relationship. The pharmaceutical detail \n     man promotes his company's products to physicians in a number \n     of ways. He or she frequently calls on physicians in their \n     offices and also meets with them in the hospital. Often in \n     hospitals the representatives from various pharmaceutical \n     companies participate in a rotational schedule for operating \n     a drug display in a prominent location, usually near the \n     physicians' entrance. A detail man frequently has one or two \n     drugs to promote actively, and literature and visual displays \n     which describe these agents. Each salesperson argues why his \n     or her drugs are better than competitors' formulations. In \n     addition to a verbal message and printed information, the \n     detail man often has various ``gifts'' for the physician. \n     Pens or writing pads inscribed with a particular drug name \n     are common. Gifts also include free texts, medical equipment \n     (such as reflex hammers and penlights), and medical bags \n     (typically given to graduating medical students). Drug \n     samples are frequently offered. In addition, the detail man \n     may coordinate more elaborate gratuities such as cocktail \n     parties, refreshments at medical meetings (such as those of \n     state medical association groups) and the sponsorship of \n     medical symposia. Specific examples of such marketing \n     efforts are illustrative.\n       One of our community hospitals was approached by a drug \n     salesperson to participate in a study involving an antibiotic \n     that was on the market. This drug's utilization had been \n     minimal because of increased cost to the patient and the fact \n     that it offered no\n\n[[Page S11533]]\n\n     substantive therapeutic advantage. The proposal extended to \n     the physicians and hospital was to use the drug on a given \n     number of patients, at the patients' expense. Physician \n     participants in the study were to be ``reimbursed'' 125 \n     dollars for each patient enrolled. This sum was designated to \n     cover ``expenses'' associated with the study.\n       A second example of an elaborate gratuity system has \n     recently been utilized in our community. Selected physicians \n     were invited by a pharmaceutical company's detail man to an \n     expense-paid seminar in a popular vacation city. The meeting \n     focused on a new antihypertensive drug (at the time, this \n     drug company had the only formulation of this drug on the \n     market). The educational component of the meeting was judged \n     to be very good by the physician participants. This \n     promotional package included airfare for the physician, \n     lodging for the physician and spouse, meals, a cocktail \n     party, and an evening of dining and dancing on a chartered \n     river boat. In the year following this event, two other \n     pharmaceutical companies have offered similar meeting \n     packages to physicians in the community.\n       Such promotional efforts are clearly expensive. For \n     instance, it has been estimated that each visit by a detail \n     man to a physician costs the pharmaceutical company 75 \n     dollars. Despite the expense, however, drug companies have \n     found that the use of the detail man is the most effective \n     means of promoting their products. These companies often \n     prefer to characterize their detail man as ``service \n     representatives'' purveying information, rather than as \n     salespersons. One company not only requires the detail man to \n     attend four tutorials a year, but also gives pharmacology \n     tests to all its representatives quarterly. But such training \n     does not negate the fact that, in practice, detail men \n     function as aggressive, effective salespeople. Indeed, most \n     of them are at least partially reimbursed on a commission \n     basis. Their success as pharmaceutical representatives is \n     clearly dependent upon their ability to sell drugs. Those \n     drugs which representatives emphasize at any given time \n     reflect corporate decisions based on such factors as \n     competition, quotas and the patent status of the drugs.\n       Given the stated nature of the physician-patient covenant, \n     the type of relationship that frequently exists between the \n     physician and the detail man is ethically troublesome. More \n     specifically, that relationship appears to violate all three \n     of the basic ethical principles previously discussed. By \n     virtue of the principles of autonomy and beneficence, the \n     patient has a right to expect that he or she will be treated \n     with dignity and respect. He or she expects to receive the \n     best possible treatment the physician can generate. The \n     patient has a right to assume that the physician's \n     therapeutic decisions are based solely on scientific medical \n     knowledge, unbiased by extraneous factors or inducements. \n     Thus, the very nature of the physician-patient covenant, and \n     the principles that underlie it, would seem specifically to \n     preclude the physician from basing a drug-prescribing \n     decision on factors other than what is objectively best for \n     the individual patient. To the extent that the physician \n     decides to try out a new drug or opt to prescribe regularly a \n     medication simply because he likes a detail man or because he \n     is consciously or unconsciously affected by his or her \n     various inducements and salesmanship, the physician would \n     seem to be violating the patient's trust. One wonders what a \n     patient's reaction would be if he or she were explicitly \n     aware that such interactions and inducements existed.\n       In addition, the principle of nonmaleficence can be \n     violated by the physician-detail man relationship. Often the \n     new drug formulations which are promoted offer no meaningful \n     advantage over older drugs. Yet, in taking them, the patient \n     risks the possibility of experiencing adverse effects as yet \n     undiscovered or not well publicized (even when the drug has \n     been approved by the Food and Drug Administration). The \n     recent controversy surrounding the drug Oraflex constitutes \n     such an example. This drug was vigorously promoted as a new, \n     very effective agent for arthritic symptoms. Shortly after \n     its release, this agent was removed from the market because \n     it was associated with serious liver toxicity in some \n     patients. Moreover, the patient usually pays considerable \n     financial premium when a new drug formulation is used. \n     Invariably, the newer drugs being marketed are significantly \n     more expensive than older, and sometimes equally effective, \n     drugs whose patents have expired (rendering them much less \n     profitable to the pharmaceutical company). Again, the average \n     patient has no insight into this fact. He or she certainly is \n     not usually afforded the opportunity to decide autonomously \n     whether the drawbacks and risks of a new drug formulation \n     render it less advantageous than other, longer-established \n     drugs. And indeed, even if the typical patient is given some \n     knowledge of drug options, he or she lacks the expertise to \n     participate seriously in the decision of which drug to \n     employ. In fact, it is the physician alone who ordinarily \n     must make the determination of which drug to employ. If this \n     decision is based on sound, scientific data, the choice of a \n     new and more costly drug may clearly be justified. However, \n     to the extent that the physician does not rely on objective \n     medical data (as published in medical journals or \n     discussed at medical meetings), but rather derives his \n     information from the drug companies' own representatives, \n     a potential conflict of interest exists.\n       Pharmaceutical companies might respond to this assertion by \n     observing that in our free enterprise system there is nothing \n     wrong with vigorously marketing one's products. Indeed, in \n     the open marketplace it is, of course, common to offer a \n     variety of inducements, including rebates, coupons, gifts and \n     other types of price reductions. However, this situation is \n     not analogous to the relationship between the detail man and \n     the physician. In the ordinary marketing arena, companies \n     attempt to influence the purchaser and user of various \n     products. This is categorically not the case in the \n     relationship between the physician and the pharmaceutical \n     companies. The patient is the passive, dependent recipient of \n     the physician's practice decisions. By virtue of this fact, \n     as well as the implicit covenant which exists between the \n     physician and the patient, the physician has an obligation to \n     strenuously avoid basing any prescription decisions on \n     factors other than the strict medical indications for those \n     drugs. To the extent that the physician is either \n     unconsciously or manifestly induced to use the drugs of a \n     given detail man or pharmaceutical company, in the absence of \n     strict medical indication, a significant ethical problem \n     exists.\n       The implications of this analysis are clearly troublesome. \n     It would appear that the current standard of medical \n     practice, in terms of the relationship between the physician \n     and the pharmaceutical detail man, may readily promote \n     outcomes not in the patient's best interest. Since the \n     physician-patient covenant and the ethical principles which \n     underlie it warrant that the patient's interests should be \n     the prime focus of medicine, significant changes are \n     warranted in the methods which pharmaceutical companies \n     employ to market their drugs. Currently, pharmaceutical \n     companies, medical organizations and individual physicians \n     are clearly party to, as well as beneficiaries of the present \n     marketing techniques. Thus, there are powerful incentives to \n     maintain this longstanding system. The pharmaceutical \n     companies' profit makes it understandably difficult for them \n     to endorse sweeping changes in their current, successful \n     marketing practices. Many medical organizations and their \n     scientific journals are largely dependent on the advertising \n     which is purchased by the drug companies. And certainly the \n     individual practitioner, too, clearly benefits from the \n     current system of gifts and gratuities.\n       Changes in the present system of drug marketing will \n     doubtless come slowly. Most likely, improvements will evolve \n     only as individual physicians become better educated about \n     these ethical concerns and committed enough to demand \n     alterations in the present marketing practices. The \n     individual physician's role in this process should not be \n     viewed as an optional one. Rather, the physician is ethically \n     mandated to work for change in this realm of drug marketing. \n     This responsibility derives from the physician's clinical \n     covenant with the patient and the moral principles which \n     underlie it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11533-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11533-2", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11533-S11534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  Under authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 1999, the \nSecretary of the Senate on November 3, 2000, during the recess of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the House has passed the following joint resolution, in which it \nrequests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to require increased waste prevention and recycling \nmeasures to be incorporated in the daily operations of Federal \nagencies, and other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                  GREENING THE GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the ``Greening \nthe Government Act of 2000.'' This bill would allow the Federal \nGovernment to use its purchasing power to conserve natural resources, \ncreate markets for the materials that the American people recycle in \ntheir home and office recycling programs, and reduce the toxicity of \nproducts commonly used by establishing an infrastructure for \ncoordinating and expanding Federal recycling and ``green'' purchasing \nactivities.\n  The Federal Government spends $275 billion each year buying goods and \nservices. With this immense purchasing power, and through its research, \ndevelopment and assistance programs, it can influence markets to create \nmore environmentally friendly products. Indeed, I believe that the \nFederal Government should be a leader in demonstrating how \norganizations can meet their mission in a cost-effective and \nenvironmentally protective way.\n  Tomorrow, we will celebrate America Recycles Day. Millions of \nAmericans will re-dedicate themselves to recycling and, more \nimportantly, closing the recycling loop by buying recycled content \nproducts. Hundreds of American companies are also recognizing the \nimportance and cost-effectiveness of ``greening'' their operations. For \ninstance, in my State of New Jersey, Telecordia Technologies has saved \nmore than $3 million by recycling 72 percent of its waste. Telecordia \nsaves $4,000 per week by simply replacing disposable cafeteria trays \nwith recycled content plastic trays. I believe that the Federal \nGovernment can also achieve similar savings by ``greening'' its \noperations and encouraging environmental innovation. Indeed, the \nFederal Government's purchasing decisions can tremendously affect the \nenvironment we leave to future generations.\n  Building on the progress made during the past seven years under \nPresident Clinton's Executive Order 13101, ``Greening the Government \nthrough Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition,'' the \nGreening the Government Act of 2000 will establish a permanent \ninfrastructure for coordinating, promoting, and expanding Federal \nrecycling and ``green'' procurement activities. Under this legislation, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will designate both recycled \ncontent products and environmentally\n\n[[Page S11538]]\n\npreferable products and services for Federal agencies to purchase. The \nU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will also create a list of \nbiobased products for agencies to consider purchasing. Federal agencies \nwill then incorporate procurement of these USDA and EPA-designated \nproducts and services into their acquisition processes. Finally, \nFederal research and development monies, technology transfer programs, \nand assistance programs will be expanded to facilitate the development \nof greener technologies.\n  In 1994, approximately 12 percent of the copier paper purchased by \nthe Federal Government was recycled content paper, and that contained \nonly ten percent postconsumer (recycled content) fiber. President \nClinton increased the Federal postconsumer content standard to 30 \npercent. Today, 98 percent of the copier paper purchased from the \nGovernment Printing Office and General Services Administration contains \n30 percent postconsumer fiber. The Greening the Government Act of 2000 \nraises the Federal content standard to 40 percent postconsumer fiber \nand, for the first time, requires agencies both to consider purchasing \noffice papers bleached without chlorine and to purchase wood products \nmade with sustainably grown wood.\n  We all know that it is not easy to buy ``green'' products. It is my \nintention that the ``Greening of the Government Act'' will encourage \nmanufacturers to identify their products as ``green,'' making it easier \nfor all Americans to buy these products. It is time that the Federal \nGovernment truly live up to the resource conservation goals first \nestablished by Congress in 1976 within the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act and become a true role model in our nation's conservation \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11538-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 876\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dorgan, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n876, a bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 of require that the \nbroadcast of violent video programming be limited to hours when \nchildren are not reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion of \nthe audience.\n\n\n                                S. 3254\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the names of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. L.

Mr. President, Senators Kyl and Feinstein introduced S. \n3205, the Counterterrorism Act of 2000, on October 12, 2000. They base \ntheir bill on recommendations made in a report called ``Countering the \nChanging Threat of International Terrorism,'' issued on June 5, 2000 by \nthe National Commission on Terrorism chaired by former Ambassador L. \nPaul Bremer III and Maurice Sonnenberg. The sponsors seek to have the \nSenate consider and pass the bill unanimously without hearings on its \nlegislative language, without Committee consideration, without Senate \ndebate and without amendment. In my efforts to be supportive of them I \nhave shared with them concerns I have had about earlier versions of \nthis legislation. In light of the improvements and corrections that the \nsponsors have now made, I am pleased to remove my objection to passage \nof the bill. I commend the sponsors for heeding constructive comments \nto improve the bill.\n  At the outset, I note that I have worked to help Senator Kyl clear a \nnumber of matters of importance to him in this Congress. Most recently, \nthe Senate passed on November 19, 1999, S. 692, the Internet Gambling \nProhibition Act, and on September 28, 2000, repassed S. 704, the \nFederal Prisoner Health Care Copayment Act. Moreover, in the past few \nmonths, we have worked together to confirm three more judges for \nArizona.\n  In past Congresses, I have also worked closely with Senator Kyl. For \nexample, in the 104th Congress, Senators Kyl, Grassley and I worked \ntogether to enact the National Information Infrastructure Protection \nAct. This law increased protection under federal criminal law for both \ngovernment and private computers, and addressed the emerging problem of \ncomputer-age blackmail in which a criminal threatens to harm or shut \ndown a computer system unless certain extortion demands are met.\n  The NII Protection Act that I worked on with Senator Kyl was intended \nto help law enforcement better address the problem of computer crime, \nin which cyber attacks are an important component. The Bremer-\nSonnenberg Commission noted that, ``[r]easonable experts have published \nsobering scenarios about the potential impact of a successful cyber \nattack on the United States. Already, hackers and criminals have \nexploited some of our vulnerabilities.'' In short, the Commission found \nthat, ``cyber security is a matter of grave importance.''\n  As technology advances, the Congress must remain vigilant to ensure \nthat our laws remain up to date and our local, State and federal law \nenforcement resources are up to the job posed by new technological \nchallenges. That is why I have continued to work over this Congress \nwith the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and Senator Schumer on S. \n2448, which the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported \nfavorably on October 5th for consideration by the Senate as the \nInternet Security Act amendment on another bill. This legislation would \nmake changes to the federal Computer Fraud and Abuse statute and \nprovide significant new resources to federal law enforcement for \nforensic computer crime work.\n  I have also been pleased to work with Senator DeWine on S. 1314, the \nComputer Crime Enforcement Act, to help provide the necessary funding \nfor training and equipment for state and local law enforcement to deal \nwith computer crimes. The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously \nreported this bill favorably to the Senate on September 21, 2000. \nAlthough he is not a cosponsor of these bills, I appreciate Senator \nKyl's support for both S. 2448 and S. 1314 as those bills moved through \nCommittee. These complementary pieces of legislation reflect twin-track \nprogress against computer crime: More tools at the federal level and \nmore resources for local computer crime enforcement.\n  In addition, the Senate Judiciary Committee has considered and \nreported unanimously on May 18, 2000, S. 2089, the Counterintelligence \nReform Act, which I was pleased to cosponsor with Senators Specter, \nTorricelli, and others. Senator Kyl did not cosponsor this bill.\n  The Counterintelligence Reform Act is intended to improve the \ncoordination within and among federal agencies investigating and \nprosecuting espionage cases and other cases affecting national \nsecurity. Specifically, this legislation amends the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act to state explicitly that past activities \nof a target may be considered in determining whether there is probable \ncause to believe that the target of electronic surveillance is an \n``agent of a foreign power.'' This particular provision appears to \naddress a criticism subsequently raised in the Bremer-Sonnenberg \nCommission report that the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review, \nwhich is the Justice Department unit responsible for preparing and \npresenting FISA applications to the FISA court, ``does not generally \nconsider the past activities of the surveillance target relevant in \ndetermining whether the FISA probable cause test is met.''\n  The Bremer-Sonnenberg Commission report recommended that ``the \nAttorney General should substantially expand'' OIPR in order ``[t]o \nensure timely review of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \napplications.'' I concur with this recommendation. In fact, even before \nthe Commission report was released and during Judiciary Committee \nconsideration of S. 2089, I offered an amendment to S. 2089, which was \napproved by the Judiciary Committee, that would authorize an increase \nin the budget for OIPR from its current funding level of $4,084,000 to \n$7,000,000 for FY 2001, with increases up to $8,000,000 over the \nfollowing two years, for expanded personnel and technology resources. \nThe Select Committee on Intelligence also approved this budget increase \nfor OIPR upon consideration of S. 2089, which subsequently was passed \nby the Congress as part of the Intelligence Authorization Act, S. 2507.\n  Recently, the Congress passed as part of the conference report on the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act, H.R. 3244, the Justice for Victims \nof Terrorism Act with an amendment that Senator Feinstein and I \nauthored dealing with support for victims of international terrorism. \nSenator Kyl did not cosponsor this amendment. This amendment is \nintended to enable the Office for Victims of Crime to provide more \nimmediate and effective assistance to Americans who are victims of \nterrorism abroad--Americans like those killed or injured in the embassy \nbombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and in the Pan Am 103 bombing over \nLockerbie, Scotland. These victims deserve help, and the Leahy-\nFeinstein amendment will permit the Office for Victims of Crime \nto serve these victims better by expanding the types of assistance for \nwhich the VOCA emergency reserve fund may be used, and the range of \norganizations to which assistance may be provided. The amendment allows \nOVC greater flexibility in\n\n[[Page S11540]]\n\nusing existing reserve funds to assist victims of terrorism abroad, \nincluding the victims of the Lockerbie and embassy bombings.\n\n  This provision will also authorize OVC to raise the cap on the VOCA \nemergency reserve fund from $50 million to $100 million, so that the \nfund is large enough to cover the extraordinary costs that would be \nincurred if a terrorist act caused massive casualties, and to replenish \nthe reserve fund with unobligated funds from its other grant programs.\n  At the same time, the provision will simplify the presently-\nauthorized system of using VOCA funds to provide victim compensation to \nAmerican victims of terrorism abroad, by permitting OVC to establish \nand operate an international crime victim compensation program. This \nprogram will, in addition, cover foreign nationals who are employees of \nany American government institution targeted for terrorist attack. The \nsource of funding is the VOCA emergency reserve fund, which we \nauthorized in an amendment I offered to the 1996 Antiterrorism and \nEffective Death Penalty Act.\n  The Leahy-Feinstein provision also clarifies that deposits into the \nCrime Victims Fund remain available for intended uses under VOCA when \nnot expended immediately.\n  As is apparent from the work we have done both in this Congress and \nin prior Congresses, we all share the interest and concern of the \nsponsors of S. 3205 in protecting our national security from the threat \nand risks posed by terrorists determined to harm this country and its \ncitizens and helping victims of terrorist acts. Yet, I have been \nconcerned that earlier versions of this bill posed serious \nconstitutional problems and risks to important civil liberties we hold \ndear. Unlike the secret holds that often stop good bills from passing \noften for no good reason, I have had no secret holds on S. 3205 or \nearlier versions of this legislation. On the contrary, when asked, I \nhave made no secret about the concerns I had with this legislation.\n  An earlier version of this legislation, which Senator Kyl tried to \nmove as part of the Intelligence Authorization bill, S. 2507, prompted \na firestorm of controversy from civil liberties and human rights \norganizations, as well as the Department of Justice. For example, the \nDepartment of Justice opposed the amendment on myriad grounds, \nincluding that (1) the provision amending the wiretap statute to permit \nlaw enforcement officers to share foreign intelligence or \ncounterintelligence information obtained under a title III wiretap with \nthe intelligence community ``could have significant implications for \nprosecutions and the discovery process in litigation''; (2) the \nprovision giving the FBI sixty days to report on the feasibility of \nestablishing a dissemination center within the FBI on international \nterrorism raised sufficiently significant issues that ``do not avail \nthemselves of resolution in this very short time frame''; (3) the \nprovision requiring the creation of a task force to disrupt the \nfundraising activities of international terrorist organizations would \nimpose a ``rigid, statutory mandate\" that ``would interfere with the \nneed for flexibility in tailoring enforcement strategies and mechanisms \nto fit the enforcement needs of the particular moment''; and (4) the \nprovision requiring the Attorney General to make legislative language \nrecommendations on matters relating to biological pathogens were \n``invalid under the Recommendations Clause'' and ``interferes with the \nPresident's efforts to formulate and present his own recommendations \nand proposals and to control the policy agenda of his Administration.''\n  Similarly, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the Center for \nNational Security Studies and the American Civil Liberties Union, \ndescribed in detail their concerns that ``provisions in the Act pose \ngrave threats to constitutional rights.''\n  I shared many of the concerns of those organizations and the Justice \nDepartment, and note that the version of S. 3205 that we consider today \naddresses those concerns with substantial revisions to the original \nlegislation. For example, no longer does the bill require a change in \nthe wiretap statute allowing the permissive disclosure of information \nobtained in a title III wiretap to the intelligence agencies. No longer \ndoes the bill direct the Central Intelligence Agency to make \nlegislative recommendations to enhance the recruitment of terrorist \ninformants, without any countervailing considerations. Instead, the \nbill now requests a more balanced picture of the policy considerations \nthat prompted the 1995 guidelines on the use of terrorists as \ninformants and the limitations that may be necessary to assure that the \nUnited States does not encourage human rights abuse abroad.\n  After the bill was introduced, I first advised the sponsors of the \nbill and then the Senate about the remaining areas of concern that \nshould be fixed in the bill before Senate passage.\n  In this regard, I note that Senator Kyl suggested to the Senate on \nOctober 25th that if the Justice Department was satisfied with his \nlegislation, I or my staff had earlier indicated that I would be \nsatisfied. I respect the expertise of the Department of Justice and the \nmany fine lawyers and public servants who work there and, where \nappropriate, seek out their views, as do many Members. That does not \nmean that I always share the views of the Department of Justice or \nfollow the Department's preferred course and recommendations without \nexercising my own independent judgment. I would never represent that if \nthe Justice Department were satisfied with his bill, I would \nautomatically defer to their view. Furthermore, my staff has advised me \nthat no such representation was ever made.\n  I am pleased that the further corrections to and refinements of this \nbill have now been made and that the version of the bill that the \nSenate is now being asked to consider and pass has been improved. \nFirst, the bill now contains the correct numbers of sailors killed and \ninjured in the sense of the Congress concerning the tragic bombing \nattack on the U.S.S. Cole. I believe that each of the 17 sailors killed \nand 39 sailors injured deserve recognition and that the full scope of \nthe attack should be properly reflected in this Senate bill. I commend \nthe sponsors of the bill for correcting this part of the bill.\n  Second, the sense of the Congress originally urged the United States \nGovernment to ``take immediate actions to investigate rapidly the \nunprovoked attack on the'' U.S.S. Cole, without acknowledging the fact \nthat such immediate action has been taken. In fact, the Navy began \nimmediate investigative steps shortly after the attack occurred, and \nthe FBI established a presence on the ground and began investigating \nwithin 24 hours. The Director himself went to Yemen to guide this \ninvestigation. That investigation is active and ongoing, and no Senate \nbill should reflect differently, as this one originally did. The \ncorrected bill now urges the government ``to continue to take strong \nand effective actions'' to investigate this attack. I commend the \nAdministration for the swift and immediate actions it has taken to \ninvestigate this attack and the strong statements made by the President \nmaking clear that no stone will be left unturned to find the criminals \nwho planned this bloody attack.\n\n  Third, the ``Findings'' section of this bill contained several \nfactual errors or inaccuracies that are now corrected. For example, the \noriginal bill stated that there are ``38 organizations'' designated as \nForeign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) when there are currently 29, \nwhich has been corrected. The original bill stated that ``current \npractice is to update the list of FTOs every two years'' when in fact \nthe statute requires redesignation of FTOs every two years. This \nstatement has been corrected. The original bill stated that current \ncontrols on the transfer and possession of biological pathogens were \n``designed to prevent accidents, not theft,'' which according to the \nJustice Department is simply not accurate. This inaccurate statement \nhas been eliminated.\n  Fourth, the original bill required reports on issues within the \njurisdiction of the Senate Judiciary Committee without any direction \nthat those reports be submitted to that Committee. For example, section \n9 of the bill required the FBI to submit to the Select Committees on \nIntelligence of the Senate and the House a feasibility report on \nestablishing a new capability within the FBI for the dissemination of \nlaw enforcement information to the Intelligence community. My \nsuggestion that these reports also be required to\n\n[[Page S11541]]\n\nbe submitted to the Judiciary Committees has been adopted.\n  Fifth, the bill requires reports, with recommendations for \nappropriate legislative or regulation changes, by the Attorney General \nand the Secretary of Health and Human Services on safeguarding \nbiological pathogens at research labs, pharmaceutical companies and \nother facilities in the United States. No definition of ``biological \npathogen'' is included in the bill and the scope of these reports could \ntherefore cover a vast array of biological materials. To address this \nconcern over the potentially broad focus of this provision, the bill \nhas been amended to include a direction to the Attorney General and the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to define and determine the type \nand classes of pathogens that should be covered by any recommendations.\n  Finally, the bill would require reimbursement for professional \nliability insurance for law enforcement officers performing official \ncounterterrorism duties and for intelligence officials performing such \nduties outside the United States. I scoured the record in vain for \nexplanatory statements by the sponsors of this bill about their views \non the need for this provision. Current law curiously provides for \npayments of only half the costs of professional liability insurance for \nlaw enforcement officers and federal judges to cover the costs of legal \nliability for damages resulting from any tortious act, error of \nomission while in the performance of the employee's duties and the \ncosts of legal representation in connection with any administrative or \njudicial proceeding relating to such act, error or omission. 5 U.S.C. \nSec.  5941 prec. note. The Bremer-Sonnenberg Commission report \nrecommended that the Congress amend current law to mandate full \nreimbursement of the costs of personal liability insurance for FBI and \nCIA counterterrorism agents. In light of this explanation, I am \nprepared to proceed while noting that this is an area that deserves \nmore comprehensive review. The same reasons for providing full \nreimbursement for counterterrorism officers may apply to other law \nenforcement and intelligence officers.\n  The bill has been greatly improved since its first iteration, and I \nam pleased to withdraw my objection.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4358) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time and \npassed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements relating to this bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 3205), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 3205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Counterterrorism Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ATTACK ON THE U.S.S. COLE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On October 12, 2000, the United States naval vessel \n     U.S.S. Cole was attacked in Aden, Yemen.\n       (2) The attack occurred while the U.S.S. Cole was \n     refueling, and was unprovoked.\n       (3) Seventeen United States sailors were killed in the \n     attack, and thirty-nine were injured.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States Government should--\n       (1) continue to take strong and effective actions to \n     investigate rapidly the unprovoked attack on the United \n     States naval vessel U.S.S. Cole;\n       (2) ensure that the perpetrators of this cowardly act are \n     swiftly brought to justice; and\n       (3) take appropriate actions to protect from terrorist \n     attack all other members and units of the United States Armed \n     Forces that are deployed overseas.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Commission on National Security in the 21st \n     Century, chaired by former Senators Hart and Rudman, \n     concluded that ``[s]tates, terrorists, and other disaffected \n     groups will acquire weapons of mass destruction and mass \n     disruption, and some will use them. Americans will likely die \n     on American soil, possibly in large number.''.\n       (2) United States counterterrorism efforts must be improved \n     to meet the evolving threat of international terrorism \n     against United States nationals and interests. The bipartisan \n     National Commission of Terrorism chaired by Ambassador Paul \n     Bremer and Maurice Sonnenberg was mandated by Congress to \n     evaluate current United States policy and make \n     recommendations on improvements. This Act stems from the \n     findings and recommendations of that Commission.\n       (3) The face of terrorism has changed significantly over \n     the last 25 years. With the fall of the Soviet Union, many \n     state-sponsored terrorist groups have been replaced by more \n     loosely knit organizations with varying motives. These \n     transnational terrorist networks are more difficult to track \n     and penetrate than state sponsored terrorist groups, and \n     their actions are more difficult to predict.\n       (4) State support of terrorism has not disappeared. Despite \n     political change in Iran, the country continues to be the \n     foremost state sponsor of terrorism in the world. In April \n     2000, the Department of State issued ``Patterns of Global \n     Terrorism'', which provides a detailed account of Iran's \n     continued support of terrorism.\n       (5) According to the report of the National Commission on \n     Terrorism, there are indications of Iranian involvement in \n     the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers complex in Saudi \n     Arabia, in which 19 United States soldiers were killed and \n     more than 500 injured. In October 1999, President Clinton \n     officially requested cooperation from Iran in the \n     investigation of the bombing. Thus far, Iran has not \n     responded to this request.\n       (6) Terrorist attacks are becoming more lethal. A growing \n     number of terrorist attacks are designed to kill the maximum \n     number of people. Although conventional explosives have \n     remained the weapon of choice, terrorist groups are investing \n     in the acquisition of unconventional weapons such as nuclear, \n     chemical, and biological agents.\n       (7) Syria was placed on the first list of state-sponsors of \n     terrorism by the United States Government in 1979, due to its \n     long history of using terrorism to advance its interests. \n     Syria continues to support terrorist training and logistics.\n       (8) According to the National Commission on Terrorism, the \n     1995 guidelines of the Central Intelligence Agency on the use \n     of terrorists as informants set up complex procedures for \n     seeking approval to recruit as informants terrorists who have \n     been involved in human rights violations. That Commission \n     found that these guidelines have inhibited the recruitment of \n     essential, if sometimes unsavory, terrorist informants. As a \n     result, that Commission concluded that the United States has \n     relied too heavily on foreign intelligence services in \n     attempting to uncover information about terrorist \n     organizations.\n       (9) No other country, much less any subnational \n     organization, can match United States scientific and \n     technological prowess (including quality control) in \n     biotechnology and pharmaceutical production, electronics, \n     computer science, and other pursuits that could help overcome \n     and defeat the technologies used by future terrorists.\n       (10) Currently, the United States focuses its efforts to \n     discourage private financial support to terrorists on \n     prosecutions under the provisions of the Antiterrorism and \n     Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-132) and \n     the amendments made by that Act. Under an amendment made by \n     that Act, section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1189) requires the Secretary of State to designate \n     groups that threaten United States interests and security as \n     Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs). There are currently \n     29 FTOs. The National Commission on Terrorism recommended \n     that the Secretary of State ensure that the list of FTO \n     designations is credible and updated regularly.\n       (11) It is in the interest of the United States that the \n     Federal Government take a broader approach to cutting off the \n     flow of financial support for terrorism from within the \n     United States. Anyone providing to terrorist organizations \n     funds that he or she knows will be used to support terrorist \n     acts should be prosecuted under all relevant statutes, \n     including statutes addressing money laundering, conspiracy, \n     and tax or fraud violations. In addition, Federal agencies \n     such as the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the \n     Internet Revenue Service and the Customs Service should be \n     better utilized to thwart terrorist fundraising. Such \n     activities should not violate constitutional rights and \n     values.\n       (12) Current controls on the transfer and possession of \n     biological pathogens that could be used in biological weapons \n     are inadequate. Controls on the equipment needed to turn such \n     pathogens into weapons are virtually nonexistent. The \n     National Commission on Terrorism concluded that the standards \n     for the storage, transport, and handling of biological \n     pathogens should be as rigorous as the current standards for \n     the physical protection and security of critical nuclear \n     materials.\n\n     SEC. 4. SYRIA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     keep Syria on the list of countries who sponsor terrorism \n     until Syria--\n       (1) shuts down training camps and other terrorist support \n     facilities in Syrian-controlled territory; and\n       (2) prohibits financial or other support of terrorists \n     through Syrian-controlled territory.\n\n[[Page S11542]]\n\n     SEC. 5. IRAN.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     keep Iran on the list of countries who sponsor terrorism, and \n     make no concessions to Iran, until Iran--\n       (1) demonstrates that it has stopped supporting terrorism; \n     and\n       (2) cooperates fully with the United States in the \n     investigation into the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers \n     complex in Saudi Arabia.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. President, today the Senate passed by unanimous \nconsent important legislation Senator Kyl and I sponsored that seeks to \nimprove the United States' ability to prevent and respond to terrorist \nattacks. This bill, S. 3205, the Counterterrorism Act of 2000--together \nwith a Kyl-Feinstein amendment making a few technical changes--\nimplements major recommendations from a bipartisan, blue-ribbon \ncommission on terrorism.\n  Let me describe what the bill would do. First, it urges that the U.S. \ngovernment continue to take strong and effective actions to investigate \nthe recent attack on the U.S.S. Cole and ensure that the perpetrators \nare brought to justice. The assault on the Cole is the worst against \nthe U.S. military since the bombing of an Air Force barracks in Saudi \nArabia killed 19 airmen in 1996. It is also the worst attack on a Navy \nship since an Iraqi missile struck an American guided-missile frigate \nin 1987, killing 37 sailors.\n  Second, the bill requires the Department of Justice to review legal \nauthority of federal agencies responsible for responding to a \ncatastrophic terrorist attack and determine whether additional legal \nauthority is necessary.\n  Third, the bill requires the president to establish a program for \nlong-term research and development to counter catastrophic terrorist \nattacks and submit a report to Congress on this program. It also \nexpresses the sense of Congress that there should be more long-term \nresearch and development in this area.\n  Fourth, the bill mandates that the attorney general issue a report on \nhow to improve U.S. controls on biological pathogens and the equipment \nnecessary to produce biological weapons, and requires the Health & \nHuman Services secretary to issue a report on any appropriate actions \nthat should be taken to protect against unlawful diversion of \npathogens.\n  Fifth, the bill requires that the president establish a joint task \nforce to develop a broad approach toward discouraging the fundraising \nactivities of international terrorist organizations and that the task \nforce issue a report.\n  Sixth, the bill requires the FBI to report on whether it can set up a \ncentral mechanism to distribute intelligence information it gleans \nabout international terrorists to other members of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Seventh, the bill directs the president to review the type of \ninformation shared by U.S. law enforcement agencies and intelligence \nagencies as well as legal limitations on the sharing of this \ninformation. The president shall provide any recommendations regarding \nthe sharing of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information \nbetween such agencies.\n  Eighth, the bill mandates that the CIA shall issue a report \nresponding to the Commission on Terrorism's finding that the CIA should \nscrap a internal classified guideline requiring CIA agents to get \napproval from headquarters before recruiting unsavory individuals to \nact as informants about terrorism.\n  Ninth, the bill expresses the Sense of Congress that Syria and Iran \nshould remain on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism.\n  Finally, the bill would ensure that federal counterintelligence \npersonnel be fully reimbursed for buying insurance they purchase to \nprotect themselves from liability if they are sued for their officially \nauthorized activities. Currently, the government reimburses federal \ncriminal law enforcement officers, supervisors, and management \nofficials for one-half of their insurance expenses. These individuals \npurchase professional liability insurance because government \nrepresentation may not be available to them.\n  However, FBI special agents and CIA officers who do counterterrorism \nwork may not be reimbursed at all when they buy such insurance. This is \nparticularly unfortunate because counterterrorism work is so risky--\nespecially when the work occurs overseas. There can be few more \ndangerous tasks than infiltrating a terrorist cell in, say, Yemen or \nAfghanistan.\n  The Kyl-Feinstein Counterterrorism Act of 2000 is not a panacea for \nthe problem of terrorism. Rather, it seeks to implement a number of \nspecific improvements to our counterterrorism policy unanimously \nsuggested by the Commission on Terrorism, a bipartisan group of \nexperts.\n  The bill also lays the groundwork for a number of further \nimprovements. We will be revisiting many of the issues covered by the \nbill in the next Congress once we receive more detailed information and \nrecommendations from the Executive Branch. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues in Congress and with the next Administration to \nimplement S. 3205.\n  I believe that we need to take strong action to combat terrorism. \nThere is no question that terrorist attacks will\n\n[[Page S11544]]\n\ncontinue and that they will become more deadly. Terrorists today often \nact out of a visceral hatred of the U.S. or the West and seek to wreak \nmaximum destruction and kill as many people as possible.\n  At the same time, I believe that our counterterrorism policy must be \nconducted in a way that remains consistent with our democratic values \nand our commitment to an open, free society.\n  In many ways, the Kyl-Feinstein Counterterrorism Act of 2000 is a \ncounterpart bill to the Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act that \nrecently passed the Senate 95 to 0. That legislation, which I \ncosponsored, will make it easier for American victims of terrorism \nabroad to collect court-awarded compensation and ensure that the state \nsponsors of terrorism pay a price for their crimes.\n  While I strongly support assisting terrorist victims, I also believe \nthat we need to do more to prevent Americans from becoming victims of \nterrorism in the first place. Thus, I am glad that the Senate has acted \nto pass S. 3205 with such dispatch. It is crucial to act now before \nterrorists strike again, killing and injuring more Americans and \nleaving more families grieving. I urge the House to pass S. 3205 before \nwe adjourn.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank my good friend Senator Kyl for his \ntireless efforts to get this bill passed. His work, as always, has been \ninvaluable.\n  I also thank my other colleagues for their assistance in helping us \npass this bill.

Mr. President, although the Senate will not resume work \nin earnest today on the issues remaining before the 106th Congress, we \ncertainly hope that when we do return on the 5th of December we will be \nable to complete action on the appropriations bills, the minimum wage \nincrease, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act, and deal with the \nimmigration issue, as well as a fair and balanced tax relief package.\n  In the 3 weeks until then, I certainly hope that both parties and the \nadministration will redouble their efforts to reach agreement on these \nimportant issues. We do not have to wait until we get back. It is so \ntroubling that we are so close to the end of the calendar year and we \ndo not have as much to show for our efforts over the last 2 years as I \nwould have liked.\n  The lameduck session will give us an opportunity to make progress on \neach of those issues. I hope we will seize that opportunity.\n  I have spoken with the majority leader about this issue, and about \nour desire to complete our work in a positive way. I think we agree: We \nneed to work closely together in the final days of this Congress. He \ncertainly reiterated his desire to do that.\n  When we left before the election, everyone assumed we would return to \na relative certainty. We assumed we would have a President-elect. We \nassumed we would know the balance of power in the next Congress. Of \ncourse, to everyone's surprise, we still do not know either of these \nthings.\n\n  The situation in which we now find ourselves is virtually \nunprecedented. It certainly is unusual. But with the elections this \nclose, a period of uncertainty is certainly unavoidable.\n  While none of us has ever seen such a close Presidential election, \nsome of us have seen this on a smaller scale. I am one of those people.\n  In 1978, in my first race for election to the House of \nRepresentatives, I was behind by 28 votes at the end of election night \nand was declared the loser. The next day, amid much confusion, I was \nactually declared the winner by 14 votes. Talk about a roller coaster \nride. And that was just the first day.\n  Over the next few months, after more recounts, and the discovery of \ncomputational errors, and more confusion, the election went all the way \nto the South Dakota Supreme Court.\n  In August of 1979, the court heard oral arguments and examined every \nballot.\n  Finally, on November 27, 1979--more than a year after the election--\nthe South Dakota Supreme Court issued its decision. It added 5 more \nvotes to the earlier total and declared me the winner by a margin of \n110 votes, which I like to say in South Dakota is about 60 percent.\n  In recounting this story, I am not suggesting that we can afford to \ntake that much time in getting a fair and accurate count in this \nPresidential election. Clearly, because of the surpassing importance of \nthe Presidency, this election must be decided on an expedited basis. I \nam confident that it will be.\n  Instead, I tell this story to illustrate the point that our system \nhas dealt successfully with close elections in the past.\n  My first race for Congress is just one example. There are many \nothers. Even as we speak, votes are still being counted in another too-\nclose-to-call race: the Senate race in Washington State.\n  Since last Tuesday, many colleagues have told me of similar \nexperiences in their own elections. To a person, they all agree that \nthe important thing is to take whatever time is needed to get a\n\n[[Page S11545]]\n\nfair and accurate vote count. That is the only way to maintain public \nconfidence in the outcome of the election. So yes, this is an unusual \nsituation. But it is not a constitutional crisis.\n  In a Newsweek poll taken over the weekend, Americans were asked which \nwas more important: Resolving the uncertainty over the election now so \nwe know who the next President will be Or making certain to remove all \nreasonable doubt that the vote count in Florida is fair and accurate.\n  By a margin of 3 to 1, Americans say it is more important to get the \nresults right than to get them right now.\n  Their response is proof of their faith in our system of government.\n  It is a system of unequaled strength and stability. And it should be \nallowed to work.\n  What we all need right now is patience.\n  What we do not need is ``spin'' from people with vested interests in \nthe outcome.\n  It was particularly disturbing earlier today to see a representative \nof the Bush campaign on national television announce what he called a \n``compromise offer.''\n  In fact, his proposal merely restated his campaign's previous \nposition that ballots counted by hand after 5 o'clock this evening \nshould be ignored.\n  He then went on to cite fluctuations in the stock market as proof \nthat a winner must be declared in the presidential election now--even \nif it means sacrificing a full and fair count.\n  I hope that everyone involved in this critically important matter \nwould refrain from such overheated rhetoric. It is not helpful to this \nprocess. We are all anxious to know who our next President is. We all \nwant finality. But not at the expense of fairness.\n  That is what the Vice President wants.\n  That is what the American people want. That is what I believe \nDemocrats and Republicans want.\n  That is what is needed to reassure voters in Florida and all across \nAmerica that their votes in this election counted.\n  That is what is needed for Americans to reassure Americans that their \nfaith in our election system is well-founded.\n  Regardless of who they voted for as long as Americans have this \nreassurance I believe they will accept the outcome of this election and \ngive our next President their support.\n  It is worth exercising a little patience to get that result.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/11/14/senate-section/article/S11545-1", "month": "11", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECESS UNTIL TUESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
