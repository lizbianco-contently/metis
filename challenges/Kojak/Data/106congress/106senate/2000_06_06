Mr. President, the Federal Government has not executed \na person in the name of people of the United States of America since \n1963. For 37 years, we as a people have not taken that fateful, \nirreversible step. I rise today because all that is apparently about to \nchange.\n  Since January, I have come to the Senate floor several times to urge \nmy colleagues to support a moratorium on executions and a review of the \nadministration of capital punishment. Mr. President, the need for that \nmoratorium has now become more urgent.\n  During the Senate recess just ended, a Federal judge in Texas set a \ndate for the execution of Juan Raul Garza. In only two months, on \nAugust 5, he could become the first prisoner that the Federal \nGovernment has put to death since 1963.\n  In the early hours of a Saturday morning, when most Americans will be \nsleeping, Federal authorities will strap Mr. Garza to a gurney at a new \nFederal facility in Terre Haute, Indiana. They will put the needle in \nhis vein. And they will deliver an injection that will kill him.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to invite my colleagues to consider the \nwisdom of this action.\n  More and more Americans, including prosecutors, police, and those \nfighting on the front lines of the battle against crime, are rethinking \nthe fairness, the efficacy, and the freedom from error of the death \npenalty. Senator Leahy, a former federal prosecutor, has introduced the \nInnocence Protection Act, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. \nCongressman Delahunt and Congressman LaHood have introduced the same \nbill in the House. Congressman Delahunt, also a former prosecutor, is \nconcerned that our current system of administering the death penalty is \nfar from just. He has said: ``If you spent 20 years in the criminal \njustice system, you would be very concerned about what goes on.''\n  In my own home state of Wisconsin, at least eleven active and former \nstate and Federal prosecutors have said that executions do not deter \ncrime and could result in executing the innocent. Michael McCann, the \nwell-respected District Attorney of Milwaukee County, has said that \nprosecution is a human enterprise bound to have mistakes.\n  Mr. President, police--the people on the front lines of the battle \nagainst crime--are coming out against the death penalty. They are \nfinding that it is bad for law enforcement. Recently, when police \nchiefs were asked about the death penalty, they said that it was \ncounterproductive. Capital cases are incredibly resource-intensive. \nThey do not yield a reduction in crime proportional to other, more \nmoderate law-enforcement activities.\n  A former police chief of Madison, Wisconsin, for example, has said \nthat he fears that the death penalty would make police officers' jobs \nmore dangerous, not less so. He expressed concern that a suspect's \nincentive to surrender peacefully is diminished when the government has \nplans to execute.\n  Ours is a system of justice founded on fairness and due process. The \nFramers of our democracy had a healthy distrust for the power of the \nstate when arrayed against the individual. Many of the lawyers in the \nearly United States of America had on their shelf a copy of William \nBlackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England, where it is written: \n``For the law holds, that it is better that ten guilty persons escape, \nthan that one innocent suffer.'' And Benjamin Franklin wrote, ``That it \nis better 100 guilty Persons should escape than that one innocent \nPerson should suffer. . . .''\n  Our Constitution and Bill of Rights reflect this concern for the \nprotection of the individual against the might of the state. The fourth \namendment protects: ``The right of the people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and \nseizures. . . .'' The fifth amendment protects against being ``deprived \nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law. . . .'' The \nsixth amendment guarantees that ``the accused shall enjoy the right . . \n. to have the assistance of counsel for his defense.'' And the eighth \namendment prohibits ``cruel and unusual punishments.''\n  Our system of government is deeply grounded in the defense of the \nindividual against the power of the government. Our Nation has a proud \ntradition of safeguarding the rights of its citizens.\n  But more and more, we are finding that when a person's very life is \nat stake, our system of justice is failing to live up to the standards \nthat the American people demand and expect. More and more, Americans \nare finding reason to believe that we have a justice system that can, \nand does, make mistakes.\n  Americans' sense of justice demands that if new evidence becomes \navailable that could shed light on the guilt or innocence of a \ndefendant, then the defendant should be given the opportunity to \npresent it. Unfortunately, apparently, the people of New York and \nIllinois are the only ones who understand this. They have enacted laws \nallowing convicted offenders access to the biological evidence used at \ntrial and modern DNA testing.\n  If you are on death row in a state other than Illinois or New York, \nyou might be able to show a court evidence of your guilt or innocence \nbased on new DNA tests. But your ability to do so rests on whether \nyou're lucky enough to get a prosecutor to agree to the test or \nconvince a court that it should be done. Or, as we have seen very \nrecently, your ability to show your innocence may rest with the \ndecision of the governor. And that raises the risk of a political \ndecision, not necessarily one that is based solely on fairness or \njustice.\n  Mr. President, I am not surprised that both Texas Governor George \nBush and Virginia Governor James Gilmore are no longer confident that \nevery prisoner on death row in their states is guilty and has had full \naccess to the courts. Allowing death row inmates the benefit of a \nmodern DNA test is the fair and just thing to do. But scores of other \ndeath row inmates, in Texas, in Virginia, and around the country, may \nalso have evidence exonerating them. They may have DNA evidence. Or \nthey may have other exonerating evidence. We must ensure that all \ninmates with meritorious claims of innocence have their day in court. \nBut, among problems in our criminal justice system, the lack of full \naccess to DNA testing is, unfortunately, just the tip of the iceberg.\n\n[[Page S4509]]\n\n  Americans' sense of justice demands fair representation and adequate \ncounsel. In the landmark 1963 case of Gideon v. Wainwright, the Supreme \nCourt held that ``in our adversary system of criminal justice, any \nperson haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be \nassured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him.'' The Court in \nGideon wrote:\n\n       From the very beginning, our state and national \n     constitutions and laws have laid great emphasis on procedural \n     and substantive safeguards designed to assure fair trials \n     before impartial tribunals in which every defendant stands \n     equal before the law. This noble ideal cannot be realized if \n     the poor man charged with crime has to face his accusers \n     without a lawyer to assist him.\n\n  And, in cases since then, for example the 1988 case of McCoy v. Court \nof Appeals, the Supreme Court has ruled that: ``It is . . . settled law \nthat an indigent defendant has the same right to effective \nrepresentation by an active advocate as a defendant who can afford to \nretain counsel of his or her choice.''\n  But, Mr. President, more and more, we are finding counsel that fail \nthe standard of adequacy. Drunk lawyers. Sleeping lawyers. Lawyers who \nnever cross-examined. Lawyers whose first trial is a trial where the \nclient's life is on the line. Lawyers who have been subsequently \ndisbarred.\n  We would never allow a podiatrist to perform heart surgery. And we \nwould never allow a surgeon to perform surgery while drunk, or to fall \nasleep during surgery. But courts, over and over again, have upheld \nconvictions where the defendants' lawyers were not qualified to \nrepresent them, slept through trial, or were drunk in court.\n  Take the case of the lawyer Joe Cannon. In 1979, one Mr. Carl Johnson \nwas convicted of murder and sent to death row by a Texas state court. \nDuring trial, his lead counsel, Joe Cannon, was often asleep. Cannon's \nco-counsel, Philip Scardino, was two years out of law school and \nrecalls the whole experience as ``frightening.'' He said, ``All I could \ndo was nudge him sometimes and try to wake him up.'' Johnson's \nappellate attorney, David Dow, said the trial transcript gives the \nimpression that there was no one in the courtroom defending Johnson. It \n``goes on for pages and pages, and there is not a whisper from anyone \nrepresenting him.'' Mr. Johnson was executed in 1995, the 12th \nexecution under Governor Bush's watch.\n  Now as ``frightening'' as this sounds, the same attorney continued to \nwork capital cases.\n  Like the majority of inmates on Texas' death row, Calvin Burdine \ncould not afford an attorney, so the court paid a lawyer to represent \nhim, and that lawyer again was Joe Cannon. Five years after Johnson's \ntrial, and this time without co-counsel, Cannon represented Burdine, \nand again slept through crucial moments of the trial. The clerk for the \ntrial judge said Cannon ``was asleep for long periods of time during \nthe questioning of witnesses.'' Three jurors noted he did most of his \nnodding off in the afternoon, following lunch. Burdine's appellate \nattorneys contend that highly incriminating hearsay testimony was \nintroduced and reached the jury because the attorney was sleeping. In \n1995, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejected his claim of \nineffective assistance. Burdine's case is now before the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n  As Texas State Senator Rodney Ellis said of the Burdine case on ABC's \nThis Week this past Sunday, ``That is a national embarrassment.'' \nIncredulously, Senator Ellis lamented: ``[T]he Texas Court of Criminal \nAppeals ruled apparently that you can be Rip Van Winkle and still be a \npretty good attorney.''\n  Two years after his death, lawyer Joe Cannon remains a courthouse \nlegend. In a span of about 10 years, twelve of his indigent clients \nwent to death row.\n  Americans' sense of justice demands that the poor, as well as the \nrich, should get their day in court. Even death penalty supporters like \nReverend Pat Robertson recognize that this ultimate punishment appears \nreserved for the poor.\n  The machinery of death is badly broken. Since the 1970s, 87 people \nsitting on death row were later proven innocent. That means that for \nevery seven executions, we've found one person innocent. But remember, \nthis is after they were on death row. Eight of the 87 people later \nproven innocent relied on modern DNA testing to prove their innocence. \nBut access to DNA testing plainly tells only a small part of the story \nof the mistakes in our criminal justice system. The remaining 79 \ninnocent people gained their release based on other kinds of evidence--\nevidence like recanted witness testimony.\n  Sometimes, it is evidence that an ineffective attorney fails to \nintroduce at trial. Take the case of Gregory Wilhoit. In 1987, an \nOklahoma court sentenced Wilhoit to die for the murder of his estranged \nwife. The key evidence for the prosecution was expert testimony that a \nbite mark on the victim matched Wilhoit's. The defense never called an \nexpert to challenge the prosecution's dental expert. The court of \nappeals granted a new trial, recognizing that Wilhoit had ineffective \nlegal representation. The appellate court noted that his counsel was \n``suffering from alcohol dependence and abuse, and brain damage during \nhis representation.'' Wilhoit describes his former attorney as ``a \ndrunk'' and recalls several occasions when the attorney threw up in the \njudge's chambers. After spending six years on death row, Wilhoit was \nexonerated after 11 experts--11 experts--testified that the teeth marks \ndid not match.\n  Mr. President, I hate to say it, but this is the worst of government \ngone amok. People understand that the government can make mistakes in \nother areas. They can only expect as much here. Columnist George Will \nrecently wrote that conservatives, especially, should be concerned. \nGeorge Will wrote: ``Capital punishment, like the rest of the criminal \njustice system, is a government program, so skepticism is in order.''\n  When we do not exercise that skepticism, when we rush to execute with \never growing speed, we contribute to, rather than detract from, a \nculture of violence. It deprives us of the greatness that is America. \nWe are better than this.\n  And so, Mr. President, the time has come to pause. That is why today, \nin the light of the scheduling of the first Federal execution in almost \n40 years, and in light of the growing awareness that there are \nfundamental flaws in our system of justice, I urge my Colleagues to \njoin me in the National Death Penalty Moratorium Act, which I \nintroduced along with Senators Levin and Wellstone.\n  This bill is a common sense, modest proposal. It merely calls a \ntemporary halt to executions while a national, blue ribbon commission \nthoroughly examines the administration of capital punishment. The bill \nsimply calls for a pause and a study. That is not too much to ask, when \nthe lives of innocent people hang in the balance.\n  When an airplane careens off a runway, the Federal government steps \nin to review what went wrong. This Nation's system of capital \npunishment has veered seriously off-course. It is now clear that it is \nreplete with errors.\n  The time has come to pause and study what is wrong. The time has come \nto pause and ensure that our system is fair and just.\n  Our American tradition of fairness and due process demands it. \nReverence for our democracy's protection of the individual against the \nstate compels as much. The American people's love of justice deserves \nno less.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from the State of \nWisconsin. He is a person of principle. He comes to the floor of the \nSenate and reminds Members, whether in support of or in opposition to \nthe death penalty, it is fundamental to the American system of justice \nthat we insist on fairness.\n  In my State of Illinois, some 13 people who were on death row \npreparing to be executed by the State of Illinois were found by \nscientific testing to be innocent and were released. Because of that, \nthe Governor of our State, a Republican, George Ryan, made what I \nconsider to be an important and courageous decision. He suspended the \ndeath penalty in my home State of Illinois.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, reminds Members that the \nexperience in Illinois is not unique. In State after State, we have \nfound people who have been called to justice and have received \nvirtually no representation before the court of law. In the most \nserious possible cases under our system of justice, these men have been \nsentenced to death. In many cases,\n\n[[Page S4510]]\n\nthat sentence was carried out with inadequate defense and \nrepresentation.\n  For example, I think the decision by Governor Bush of Texas to at \nleast suspend the execution of an individual for 30 days while DNA \ntesting is underway is a thoughtful decision. I commend him for that. \nThe State of Texas, I believe, leads the Nation in the number of \nexecutions, and the State of Texas has no public defender system. So in \nthe State of Texas, if you are a criminal defendant facing a capital \ncrime which could result in execution, it is literally a gamble, a \ncrapshoot as to the person who will represent you to defend your life.\n  In cases that have been cited by Senator Feingold, some of the most \nincompetent attorneys in America have been assigned this \nresponsibility. In our State of Illinois, we found these attorneys to \nbe not well versed in law; we found them to be lazy; we found them to \nbe derelict in their duty, and in some cases, a person's life was at \nstake.\n  Again, I commend my colleague from the State of Wisconsin for his \nstatement. It is a reminder to all, whether we support the death \npenalty--as I do--or we oppose it, that we in this country believe in a \nsystem that is based on fairness and justice.\n  I have introduced legislation to give to all Federal prisoners who \nwere subjected to capital punishment the same right for DNA testing \nthat exists in my State of Illinois. There are similar bills introduced \nby my colleagues. I hope that all, conservative and liberals alike, \nDemocrats and Republicans, will at least adhere to the basic standard \nof justice when it comes to cases of this seriousness and this \nmagnitude.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator and take my hat off to him and to \nour neighbor to the south, the State of Illinois. Without the \nleadership of Illinois, which had the courage to admit that it had a \nproblem, this entire issue would not be receiving the kind of \nexamination occurring across the country. That is to the Senator's \ncredit, to that of the Governor, and to all the people of your State.\n\n  The bill I have introduced is modeled exactly after the pattern \nfollowed in Illinois; that is, the calling of a moratorium by a \nGovernor who is, or at least has been, a death penalty supporter, and \nthen the appointing of a very distinguished blue-ribbon commission, \nincluding our former wonderful colleague, Paul Simon, and including \nboth pro- and anti-death penalty people.\n  Under Illinois' leadership, there will be this kind of pause and \nexamination that is open to people of any view on the death penalty, to \nsimply make sure that system is fixed.\n  As the Senator pointed out, Illinois could not possibly be the only \nState that has this problem. In fact, I predict it will not turn out to \nbe the one with the worst problem in this area.\n  The other States need to join it on this, the Federal Government \nneeds to join, and I compliment your State, as I did in my earlier \nremarks, as being one of the only two States to recognize the right to \nhave guaranteed DNA testing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4510-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4510-S4514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           LEGISLATIVE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the time that remains in morning \nbusiness, which I will share with my colleague from California, we will \naddress several of the issues which still remain before this session of \nCongress. Many of us are just returning from a Memorial Day break which \nwe spent with our families back in our States, trying to acquaint \nourselves with the concerns of people and the concerns about issues we \nface here in Washington.\n  One of the concerns in the State of Illinois and in the city of \nChicago continues to be gun violence. This is still a phenomenon which \nis almost uniquely American and which is tragic in its proportion. To \nthink we lose 12 or 13 children every day to gun violence, that is a \nsad reminder of what happened at Columbine High School in Littleton, \nCO, a little over a year ago, when some 13 students were killed at that \nschool. It is merely one instance of a situation which repeats itself \nevery single day.\n  It has been more than a year since that tragedy, but still this \nCongress refuses to act on sensible gun safety legislation. I remind \nthose who are following this debate, the proposal for this gun safety \nlegislation is hardly radical. If people are going to buy a gun from a \ngun dealer in America, they are subjected to a background check. We \nwant to know if they are criminals. We want to know if they have a \nhistory of violent crime or violent mental illness or if they are too \nyoung to buy a gun--basic questions. I understand that, as of last \nyear, over 250,000 would-be purchasers of guns were denied that \nopportunity as a result of a simple background check.\n  Did they turn around and buy a gun on the street? It is possible. But \nwe should not make it easy for them. It should not be automatic. In \nfact, I hope in many instances, having been denied at a gun dealer, \nthey could not find a gun nor should they have been able to. We believe \napplying the same standard of gun safety legislation to gun shows just \nmakes common sense.\n\n  So that is part of the gun safety legislation we passed in the Senate \nby a vote of 49-49, and a tie-breaking vote was cast by Vice President \nAl Gore. That bill left the Senate over 8 months ago, went over to the \nHouse of Representatives where it was emasculated by the gun lobby, \nwhere the National Rifle Association would not accept the basic idea \nthat we should check on the backgrounds of people who buy guns at gun \nshows.\n  The National Rifle Association believes those who go into gun shows \nshould be able to buy a gun with no questions asked. That is just \nfundamentally unfair and ignorant. That position prevailed in the House \nof Representatives. The matter went to a conference committee where it \nhas languished ever since.\n  Since Columbine High School, thousands of Americans have been killed \nby gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will, each day, read \nthe names of some, just some, who lost their lives to gun violence in \nthe past year and will continue to do so every day the Senate is in \nsession.\n  In the names of those who died, we will continue this fight, and in \nthe names of their families who still grieve their losses, we will \ncontinue to remember these victims of gun violence.\n  Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by \ngunfire 1 year ago today, on June 6, 1999, at a time after the Senate \npassed gun safety legislation:\n  Earnest Barnes, 38, Atlanta, GA; Quentin A. Brown, 29, Chicago, IL; \nDexter J. Caruthers, 46, Gary, IN; George Cook, 19, Minneapolis, MN; \nDon Ferguson, 80, Oakland, CA; Juan J. Gonzales, 28, Oklahoma City, OK; \nMark S.

Mr. President, at the National Rifle Association \nconvention, when it was brought up as an issue that so many young \npeople are killed every single day by gunfire in America, in addition \nto those who are not so young, the people at the National Rifle \nAssociation dismissed it and said these are teenage gang bangers and \ndrug criminals and you just have to expect, in the culture in which \nthey live, they are going to kill one another.\n  As I read this list of people ranging in age from 80 years to 18, it \nis clear that the victims of gun violence are not just those who were \ninvolved in crime in the inner city. Frankly, it involved Americans \nacross the board; Americans--black, white, and brown--of virtually \nevery age group. To dismiss this, as the National Rifle Association \ndid, as something we should not care about I think is evidence of their \ninsensitivity to this issue of gun violence.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a couple questions?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Illinois for reading these names \ninto the Record, for putting a human face on what is a national \ntragedy. He experienced this at home, and I did as well in California.\n  People are wondering just exactly what we are doing. Since Columbine, \nwe agreed to five sensible gun amendments, one of them to close the gun \nshow loophole, which would make it very difficult, if not impossible, \nfor criminals and children and people who are mentally unbalanced to \nbuy guns at gun shows; also, for example, to make sure that all \nhandguns are sold with safety locks, so if kids get hold of a gun, \nthere is no discharge of a bullet.\n  I want to engage my friend in a little colloquy. While we were gone \nlast week, there were two horrific stories, just two that made the \nnational news. God knows there were more.\n  One of them involved a student who was acting out on the last day of \nschool. He was throwing water balloons. And the teacher said: Listen, \nyou are just going to have to leave school. You don't belong here. We \ndon't have tolerance for this kind of behavior.\n  The child left school, went home; he told someone he was going to get \na gun. The child who was told this didn't believe it. Sure enough, he \nwent to his grandfather's stash of guns and got one. It had no safety \nlock on it. He returned, and he killed a very wonderful, kind family \nman, a teacher at the prime of his life, in his thirties.\n  Then we had the incident in Queens where a disgruntled employee \nessentially executed people who worked at a Wendy's.\n  What do we do here? Nothing. We do nothing. I am listening for the \nmajority leader. We already passed these amendments in the Senate, and \nthe amendments are languishing in the committee. I say to my friend, \nwhat are the American people to think about this inaction? I would like \nhim to comment on that. Then I have another question about the NRA \nconvention.\n  If my friend could comment, because he feels so strongly about this, \nwhat are the American people thinking about the Senate and Congress, \ncontrolled by Republicans, who do nothing about the issue of the \nkilling of our people at a far greater rate than our soldiers died in \nVietnam? We have a war in our streets. What do you think they should do \nabout it?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I can say to the Senator from California, as people \nacross the Nation refuse to vote in elections and lose respect for \nthose who are elected to public office, it is a clear indication, as \nfar as I am concerned, that they do not believe we are responsive. They \ndo not believe we are listening. They do not believe the problems that \nfamilies face across America are problems we share. They think we are \nsome sort of political elite that really is out of touch with the \nworld.\n  They understand in the cities and the suburbs across Illinois that \ngun violence is an issue that affects so many lives. They wonder how \npeople can be elected to the Senate and not try to do something about \nit.\n  I know the Senator from California agrees with me that even passing \nthis gun safety legislation will not eliminate gun violence, but we \nhope it will reduce it.\n  It is a commonsense approach to reducing the ownership of guns by \npeople who should not own them. I believe--and I am sure the Senator \nfrom California does, too--those who use guns legally and safely, such \nas sportsmen and hunters, should be allowed to do so, but I do not \nagree with the National\n\n[[Page S4512]]\n\nRifle Association of basically giving guns to everyone, no questions \nasked, and hope for the best, and wants to see concealed weapons in \nevery place. Governor Bush decided he wanted concealed weapons to be \ncarried in churches and synagogues in the State of Texas. That strikes \nme as a ridiculous situation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Amusement parks as well.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Amusement parks. Think about the situation and wonder how \nin the world can we have a safer America if we have this proliferation \nof guns that is, obviously, supported by Governor Bush, as well as the \nNational Rifle Association. Democrats and Republicans should be \nlistening to families across this country.\n  To think gun violence has become so commonplace that we have accepted \nit is a sad testament on this great Nation. If one looks at gun \nviolence statistics and says ``that is life,'' no, it is not. That is \nlife in America. That is not life in any other country in the world. \nVirtually every civilized country in the world has basic gun safety \nlaws and gun control laws to keep guns out of the hands of those who \nwould misuse them and out of the hands of children. We live in a \ncountry where a disgruntled 13- or 14-year-old goes home and finds \ngrandpa's gun, goes back to school, and kills a teacher. That is not \ncommonplace anyplace in the world but for the United States, which I do \nnot think we should accept, and our failure to do anything about it \nfeeds into the cynicism of America's voters and citizenry who think we \nare elected to solve problems in this country. When we do not respond, \nit is no wonder they lose faith in the process.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, what is extremely frustrating is the \ntalk we hear: Gee, it does not make any difference who gets elected. I \nwant to make a point straight from the shoulder, and I am known for \nthat. The fact is, every single Democrat voted for these sensible gun \nmeasures, except one, and we had just a few on the other side join us.\n  There is a difference. I ask my friend if he happened to hear the NRA \nconvention speeches that were made or if he read them, and, if so, what \nhe thought. I was, frankly, stunned at the all-out personal attack on \nAl Gore that I heard. I have no objection to people having differences. \nIf they want everyone to carry a concealed weapon, that is their choice \nto make that decision. I do not think we want to see an America that is \na shootout at the OK Corral. I do not think that is going to make our \ncountry great. But if somebody thinks that we all ought to pack a \nweapon, that is their right, but to personally attack the Vice \nPresident because he supports sensible gun control laws--which, by the \nway, are supported by 80 percent of the people--to make this a \npersonal, vicious attack on Al Gore--and I read Wayne LaPierre's speech \nand I read Charlton Heston's speech. They named Al Gore in the most \nvicious way and attacked him in the most personal way.\n\n  I ask my friend if he would like to see this debate elevated above \nthese personalities. It is dangerous to start attacking people in such \na way, and I hope we can keep our disagreements over the issues rather \nthan attack a Vice President who is simply reflecting the views of 80 \npercent of the people.\n  When we hear the NRA executive say: When George Bush is elected, we \nare going to operate out of the White House--that sends chills up and \ndown my spine. No group should operate out of the White House, whether \nit is Sarah and Jim Brady's gun control group or the NRA. For them to \nsay when George Bush is elected they are going to work out of the White \nHouse is a frightening thought to me.\n  I hope the American people will tune in to this and not say all the \ncandidates are alike and not say all of us are alike. They are not \ngoing to find us perfect, that is for sure. No one is perfect. Doesn't \nmy friend believe this is an issue where there are serious differences \nbetween the two parties?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from California that she has \nanswered her own question: Why is the National Rifle Association \nattacking the Democratic candidate for President? They made it clear. \nThe chairman of their organization, a gentleman from Iowa whose name I \ndo not have handy, made this announcement--in fact, it has been \nvideotaped and replayed--where he said: Listen, the choice for the \nNational Rifle Association in this Presidential race is clear. If \nGeorge Bush is elected President of the United States, the National \nRifle Association will have its man in the White House.\n  The Senator from California does not exaggerate. That is exactly what \nhe said.\n  What does it mean to have your person in the White House next to the \nPresident? It means gun safety legislation does not have a chance. Not \na single thing is going to be passed by Congress that will not be \nvetoed by George W. Bush.\n  Secondly, I hope the Senator from California will also reflect on \nthis, and that is, it is likely in the next Presidency two or three \nSupreme Court Justices will be nominated. The National Rifle \nAssociation is going to have its voice in that process if George Bush \nis elected President. They will decide whether or not the Supreme Court \nJustice nominee passes their litmus test, which basically says we \nshould sell guns in this country with no questions asked.\n  That is not a decision for 4 years; it is a decision for decades \nbecause if the Supreme Court has a majority of that point of view, that \nis going to affect the laws that are approved virtually across the \nboard at the State and Federal level.\n  When the National Rifle Association at their convention starts \nranting and raving about their choice for President, it is because they \nare sick and tired of President Clinton, who has stood up for gun \nsafety as long as he has been in the White House. They are frightened \nby the prospect of Vice President Gore becoming President and \ncontinuing that tradition of supporting sensible gun safety \nlegislation. They want George W. Bush. They want their man in the White \nHouse. They want to help pick the Supreme Court. You can bet as an \nAmerican, I am concerned that will increase the incidence of gun \nviolence in our country.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend for raising the issue of the Supreme \nCourt. I should have raised it myself. He is so right on that point. \nThe Supreme Court up to now has, in fact, said it is OK for Congress to \nwork on gun laws that keep guns out of the hands of criminals and \nchildren, and that it is not, in fact, a violation of the second \namendment because we say: Sure, if you are responsible and you need to \nhave a gun and you have a reason to have it--for recreation or to \ndefend your family--and you are a responsible gun owner, that is one \nsituation. But if you are a criminal, you are mentally unbalanced, if \nyou walk in and buy a gun, by the way, when you are high on drugs or \nalcohol, this is not going to be good for this Nation. The Supreme \nCourt up to now has upheld our ability to regulate.\n  There is no question that with the NRA operating out of the George \nBush White House, we are going to see in the Congress not only a lack \nof future progress on controlling these guns and who has these guns, \nbut we are going to see the Supreme Court tilt and say: Congress, you \nhave no business dealing with this issue.\n  I ask my friend this: If we have no other role to play, shouldn't it \nbe that we protect the health and the safety of the people of this \ncountry? I know we are trying to get a Patients' Bill of Rights. This \nis another issue for which we are fighting hard because that is our \nsacred obligation, if nothing else.\n  We can have the greatest economy in the world, the best economy in \nthe world, people can be working and thriving, but if some child goes \nhome and gets his grandpa's gun and shoots a beautiful teacher in the \nhead, if some disgruntled employee who has a criminal record can get a \ngun at a gun show, what good does it do if you have the best job and \nthe best future in the world?\n  My friend has read the names of people shot down in the prime of \ntheir lives. We are supposed to live to our seventies, and a lot of \nthese people are shot down in their teens, in their twenties, or in \ntheir thirties.\n  My friend is so right to raise this issue of the Supreme Court. I \nthank him so much for engaging in this colloquy.\n  I know this talk is hard talk. By the way, it certainly raises our \nnames to the NRA; and that is not easy for us,\n\n[[Page S4513]]\n\neither. But the fact is, I believe in my heart that the NRA gives a lot \nof money to people in Government but there has to be some of us who \nstand up. I am proud to say every single Democrat, many of whom \nabsolutely believe, as we do, in the right to gun ownership, have stood \nstrong and said we must keep guns out of the hands of children, the \nmentally unbalanced, and people with criminal records.\n  I say this to my friend: This is a fight we are going to wage on this \nfloor. We are not going to let George Bush hide behind the fact that he \nsays nice things. I am amazed that the polls don't reflect that people \nknow what he stands for, making it possible to carry a concealed weapon \ninto a church--we had a horrible massacre in a Texas church--or into \nhospitals. Why do you need a gun in a hospital--explain that to me--a \nplace of healing, a place of peaceful recuperation?\n  Why do you need a gun in a church? Why do you need a gun in a \nhospital? What about an amusement park where there are so many kids \naround? This makes no sense. He did it because the NRA wanted it done. \nWe have to speak the truth here if we are worth anything.\n  I thank my friend for speaking the truth, for reading the names of \nthose who died, and for bringing this issue day after day to the floor \nof the Senate. I will be by his side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California. She has made a \npoint, too, that I would like to follow up on. We have addressed this \nissue of the safety of American families, to make sure that we try to \ndo everything that is reasonable to reduce gun violence.\n  There is also an issue of health not only related to gun violence but \nin a larger context. We have several measures that are pending on \nCapitol Hill that have been languishing for months: prescription drug \nbenefits, which we support. We believe that under Medicare the elderly \nand the disabled should have a prescription drug benefit. To accomplish \nthat, it is certainly going to involve bipartisan cooperation. But we \nhave seen no leadership, none whatsoever, in this Congress.\n  What are they waiting for? We are now in the month of June. We are \ntalking about resolving a lot of the major issues before our August \nrecess for the conventions. In this short period of time, can we find \nthe political will to address a prescription drug benefit?\n  Let me add another that has been languishing for months: the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, which basically says that each one of us, as \nindividuals and members of a family, should be able to walk into a \ndoctor's office and listen carefully to that medical professional, \nreceive their diagnosis and their recommendation, and follow it and not \nbe second-guessed by some insurance company.\n  I think that is so fundamental and so basic--that a woman who has an \nobstetrician following her pregnancy, who wants to stay with the person \nin whom she has confidence, will not lose that right because her \ncompany decides to change its health insurance carrier; that someone \nwho wants to be involved in a clinical trial of a new experimental drug \nfor cancer, for example, that might save their life, cannot be denied \nthat opportunity by a health insurance company; that our access to \nemergency rooms will not be denied because of the decisions of health \ninsurance company clerks.\n\n  We had a vote on the floor of the Senate. Overwhelmingly, the \nAmerican people support what I have said. We lost the vote but not \nbecause we did not have support for our position. Three hundred \norganizations supported the Democratic position on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights, every major medical group in America. The nurses supported \nour position. The doctors supported our position. Hospitals supported \nour position. Yet we lost because one special interest group on the \nother side prevailed--the insurance companies. They are the ones that \nare making the profit out of these decisions that take quality care \naway from families, which exalt the bottom line of profits, and ignore \nbasic health care needs.\n  This miserable bill that passed out of the Senate is headed over to \nthe House of Representatives. I am happy to report to you that a \nsubstantial number of House Republicans said they were not going to \nscrape and bow to the insurance industry; that they would stand with \nAmerican families and medical professionals so we have rights, a \nPatients' Bill of Rights for America.\n  They passed a good bill, the Dingell-Norwood bill. John Dingell of \nMichigan is legendary here on Capitol Hill. Congressman Charlie Norwood \nis relatively new but is a Republican who has had the courage to stand \nup and say: I think it is only right to say no to the insurance \ncompanies and yes to American families on a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Let me read to you what Congressman Norwood said a few days ago about \nthe situation that has occurred where the Senate passed the insurance \nindustry bill and the House passed one that will help American \nfamilies; and nothing has happened since. This is what he said on May \n25:\n\n       I'm here today to say time's up on the conference \n     committee. We've waited eight months for this committee to \n     approve a compromise bill. Senate Republicans--\n\n  This is a Congressman who is a Republican who is saying this about \nhis colleagues in the Senate:\n\n       Senate Republicans have yet to even offer a compromise \n     liability proposal--they have only demanded that the House \n     Conferees abandon their position.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       If we don't get a bill, or at least a tentative agreement \n     in writing by the week we come back from Memorial Day, we \n     must move past the conference.\n\n  Congressman Norwood said:\n\n       Starting today, I am working as if that will be the case. I \n     am willing to pass this measure through any means necessary.\n\n  I say congratulations to this Republican Congressman who is standing \nup to the Republican majority in the Senate, who is standing up to the \ninsurance industry, who is standing with the Democrats and with \nAmerican families. As on gun safety legislation, this health \nlegislation, important to families across America, has been stalled and \nblockaded by the Senate Republican leadership. They do not want to even \naddress the issues that families across America care about.\n  You step back and say: Why in the world do men and women run to be \nMembers of this Senate if they are not willing to at least debate the \nmajor issues, if not pass legislation to help families? But time and \ntime and time again, the Senate majority has blockaded, stopped, and \nstalled every effort to deal with issues of health and safety.\n\n  And those are not the only ones. As to an increase in the minimum \nwage, this is one of the most disgraceful things that has happened to \nCongress in the last 10 or 12 years. It used to be when it came time \nfor an increase in the minimum wage--under President Reagan, for \nexample, it was done with little fanfare and little debate. It was done \non a bipartisan basis. We all believed that the men and women who got \nup and went to work every day in America for a basic minimum wage \ndeserved an increase periodically to reflect the cost of living.\n  But the Republican-dominated Congress refuses to allow us to increase \nthis minimum wage. And 350,000 people in my State of Illinois got up \nthis morning and went to work for a minimum wage--$5.15 an hour--with \nvirtually no benefit protection.\n  I agree with Senator Kennedy, Senator Daschle, and so many others, \nthat we should increase this minimum wage as a matter of basic decency \na dollar an hour--50 cents a year for 2 years--so people who are trying \nto keep their families together, trying to maintain their own standard \nof living, have a chance to do it with an increased minimum wage. \nAgain, the Republican leadership in Congress refuses to let us bring up \nthis issue of the minimum wage.\n  Time and time again--gun safety legislation, a prescription drug \nbenefit under Medicare, a Patients' Bill of Rights to protect families \nwhen they have the most basic and fundamental concerns about their \nhealth, and a minimum wage--these issues have been stalled because the \nRepublican leadership refuses to bring them up for a vote. They know \nthe American people support it but there are special interest groups \nthat oppose each and every one of them.\n  The National Rifle Association has told them: Put the bar on the \ndoor. We don't want any gun safety legislation. The insurance companies \nhave told\n\n[[Page S4514]]\n\nthem: We don't want a Patients' Bill of Rights. We are making a lot of \nmoney under the current system. We don't want the doctors and the \nnurses to make medical decisions. We want businesspeople to make them \nbased on profits. The pharmaceutical industry has told them they don't \nwant a prescription drug benefit to help the elderly and the disabled \npay for drugs they need to survive. When it comes to the minimum wage, \nsome people in the business community have said: We don't want to pay \nanything more than $5.15 an hour. And we don't care what impact it has \non the employees.\n  That is the state of play that reflects the values and reflects the \nchoice the American people will have in this coming election as to \nwhether they want to see the Republican majority continue in Congress \nand stop this basic legislation so important to every American family.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield on that point?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Again, I thank my friend for connecting the dots. To \nthose Americans who say there is no difference between the parties, \nthere are no issues in this election, that it is a matter of who has \nthe best smile, I say that is not what it is about.\n  It is about issues that impact millions and millions of Americans; \n30,000 Americans die every year of gunshots. My friend pointed out that \nabout 13 a day of those are children--children. The Democrats are \nsaying we need sensible gun laws, and our Republican friends are saying \nwe don't need anything, just hang it up in the conference committee and \nsay a few words here and let's move on. We will not let that issue die, \nif you will, nor the Patients' Bill of Rights and prescription drugs. \nAgain, it is about millions of people.\n  What always fascinates me is my friends on the Republican side--oh, \nthey are tough on law and order. And I agree with them. I am as tough \nas they come. I will support the death penalty for heinous crimes. But \nwhen an HMO kills a patient because they won't approve the appropriate \ntest--and I have seen it time and time again in my State, where tests \nfor cancer were denied because they were expensive diagnostic tests, \nand HMOs wind up essentially killing a patient because they got \ntreatment too late--they let them off the hook: We don't want the right \nto sue. Let these people just walk away with maybe a slap on their \nwrists.\n  Where is the outrage? Where is the outrage when people die because of \nmedical malpractice or an HMO not willing to invest in our people?\n  Take the issue of minimum wage, where people are actually living in \npoverty. For goodness' sake, some in our military are on food stamps. \nYet our friends on the other side will vote for luxury jets to ferry \naround the generals. I don't know where the shame is. I don't know \nwhere the outrage is. I can only say that this is where it is today. It \nis reflected in the Presidential race, and it is reflected in the \nSenate races and in the congressional races.\n  I only ask the American people to wake up, regardless of what party \nthey are in, because that doesn't matter to me. These are not partisan \nissues. These are issues of right and wrong. These are issues of \nfairness.\n  I really think my friend has connected the dots on several of these \nissues--the gun issue, the Patients' of Bill of Rights, prescription \ndrugs, minimum wage. What do these have in common? They are all issues \nthat matter to America's families, the way we live, and the kind of \nlife we have. They are crucial issues. No matter what happens in the \nSenate when the majority leader brings legislation forward--or \ndoesn't--whether we do nothing or we do something, we are going to come \nhome with these issues and talk about them, and we are going to \norganize around these issues. Otherwise, I don't think we deserve to be \nhere if we are silent in the face of inaction.\n  I thank my friend again for taking this time and for engaging in this \ncolloquy.\n  (Mr. ENZI assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. We have not only addressed the major legislative issues \nbottled up and stalled in this Republican Congress--gun safety \nlegislation, Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drug benefits, \nincreasing the minimum wage. We should listen as well to the rhetoric \ncoming from the Republican candidate for President, George W. Bush, who \nis suggesting a massive tax cut of over $2 trillion over 9 years. He is \nalso now suggesting a change in Social Security that will cost over \n$800 billion over 9 years--$2.8 trillion that he has suggested we spend \nover the next 9 years, when we are told by experts in Washington that \nthe surplus we have to deal with is about $800 billion. What the \nPresidential candidate on the Republican side is suggesting is that he \nwants to return to the era of deficit spending, where we will, over 9 \nyears, go $2 trillion more in debt.\n\n  We can all recall that when President Reagan was elected in 1980, we \nstarted on this course of action which led to increasing our national \ndebt to over $6 trillion. We had more debt accumulated during the \nReagan-George Herbert Walker Bush years than we had in the entire \nprevious history of the United States. Now to carry on this fine \ntradition, Gov. George W. Bush is suggesting we go back to deficit \nspending, $2 trillion more in debt, to give tax breaks to wealthy \npeople, to change Social Security in a risky way.\n  I think that is another fundamental issue. If we are going to deal \nwith America's economy to keep it moving forward, if we are going to \nbring about the changes we need to make America a better place to live, \nwe certainly don't need to return to deficit spending. I think that is \na critical issue that affects everything we do on Capitol Hill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Again, my friend raises a very crucial issue. I have the \npaperwork here, and my friend is right on target. George W. Bush's tax \ncut proposal is $1.7 trillion from 2002 to 2010, and going to his \nprivatized plan for Social Security will cost $1 trillion. My friend \nsaid $800 billion; it is $1 trillion. The projected on-budget surplus, \nif the economy continues to do well--and you never can count on that, \nbut we certainly hope so--is $877 billion, which leaves a $2.7 trillion \ndeficit. We are going to go back into the bad days.\n  So not only are George W. Bush and the Republican Party not wanting \nto act and make life better by moving forward on the issues about which \nwe talked--the gun issue, prescription drugs, the Patients' Bill of \nRights, and the minimum wage. So not only won't they change for the \ngood, they want to go back, and we are going to be facing these \nhorrific deficits, a national debt that will start to soar again, the \nmarkets will react with high interest rates, and we will be back into \nthe deepest trouble. We will be bailing ourselves out.\n  I have to say again that by looking at this entire choice we have in \nthis election, it is very interesting. As I listen to my friend, I \nrealize what we face. We face a situation where either we are going to \ngo forward on certain issues but keep fiscal responsibility, or not \nmove on crucial issues that are really life-and-death issues and go \nback to the days of horrible economic times.\n  We all remember when President Bush went to Japan and threw up his \nhands and said: What are we going to do? We are in deep trouble. Help \nus.\n  That was not a high point in American life. Now, with the Clinton-\nGore team, we are leading the world, but we will only continue if we \ndon't go back to those bad old days of deficits.\n  I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.

In the meantime, while they are coming, let me say I have \nbriefly listened to my friends on the other side of the aisle, \ninterestingly enough, complaining about not getting anywhere. Let me \ntalk a little bit about that.\n  We have been here on the floor now for some time talking about the \nkinds of things people want to do in this country; for instance, \neducation--elementary and secondary education. We had to pull that \nafter a whole week of discussion and debate because our friends on the \nother side of the aisle didn't want to move forward. They wanted to \nbring up the same things\n\n[[Page S4515]]\n\nthey have brought up every time we have come into this Chamber, and \nthey have done it over and over and over again.\n  If you want to talk about getting something done, we ought to talk a \nlittle bit about education, a little bit about Social Security, a \nlittle bit about the military and doing some things for security that \nwe ought to do for this country. Frankly, I think some of us get weary \nof the same litany every day and going back and forth on the same \nthing. We have already talked about gun control; we have gun control \npending. We have talked about Patients' Bill of Rights; it is pending. \nIt is out there in conference committee. What we need to do is address \nourselves to some of the issues that are here.\n  You can see that I get just a little bit excited about this. But we \nhave an opportunity to do some things. We have to do some things on \nthis floor, and we need to move forward and stop this business of \nholding up everything so we can talk about trying to make issues for \nthe election instead of trying to find solutions.\n  I yield to my friend, the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take time today to again talk \nabout what I think is one of the most important issues facing Americans \nthis year, and probably in the next few years; that is, what is the \nfuture of Social Security? How are we going to make sure we have a safe \nand sound retirement system not only for those on retirement today and \nthose about to retire, but also for our children and our grandchildren?\n  I have held around the State of Minnesota more than 50 townhall \nmeetings trying to outline the problems facing Social Security today, \nand a plan I have introduced called the Personal Security and Wealth in \nRetirement Act, which would move from a pay-as-you-go system to a \nfully-funded, market-based personal retirement accounts.\n  When you look back at the last 65 years of Social Security, it has \nbasically done the job we have asked it to do; that is, to provide \nretirement benefits for millions of Americans. But if you look ahead to \nthe next 30 years, the system has problems. It is facing some real \nproblems. It is being strained to the limit. In fact, there will not be \nenough dollars collected in the system to pay the benefits the \nGovernment has promised. If the Congress does nothing, Social Security \nbenefits will have to be reduced as much as one-third or more over the \nnext 25 years.\n  The biggest risk to Social Security is to do nothing. And there are \nthose who are willing to stick their heads in the sand maybe to get by \nanother election and to ignore the problems facing Social Security.\n  Let me go through some of these things very quickly.\n  When Franklin Delano Roosevelt introduced Social Security in 1935, he \nhad concerns that it would only be run by the Government. He wanted \npart of it to be private accounts. In fact, there was many Americans \nwho were allowed to stay outside of Social Security. In fact, there \nhave been a number of state and local governments over the years--as \nlate as 1981--that saw this loophole, opted out of Social Security, and \ncreated their own personal retirement accounts. None of them, by the \nway, has failed; all have been successful. By that I mean they are \npaying better benefits to their retirees than Social Security is paying \nto our retirees today.\n  President Roosevelt also said that there should be a three-legged \nstool for Americans' retirement: personal savings, pension, and Social \nSecurity. Social Security is just one of the legs. It was never meant \nto be the sole source of retirement benefits. But for millions of \nAmericans today--when they are paying an average tax bill of nearly 40 \npercent of their wages in taxes, then they try to raise their family; \nbuy food, clothing, shelter; put a little money away for vacations, and \nfor education for their kids, et cetera--they do not have money left to \nsave for their retirement. If you work for an employer that doesn't \nhave a pension or 401(k), your only source of retirement is Social \nSecurity. Clearly, Social Security has stretched to its limit.\n  Right now, 78 million baby boomers are ready to hit the system by the \nyear 2008. The majority of Americans--nearly 90 percent--retire at the \nage of 62, not at 65. We are going to see baby boomers bumping into the \nsystem beginning as early as 2008. Social Security spending will exceed \ntax revenues by 2015.\n  We hear about all of these surpluses in Social Security and the trust \nfund.\n  But the truth is there is nothing in the trust fund but IOUs. Senator \nFritz Hollings of South Carolina says there is no trust, and there are \nno funds in the Social Security trust funds. He is right.\n  By 2015 there will be no more surpluses. In other words, if we are \ncollecting $100 today and only spending $90, the other $10 is put into \nthis trust fund. Of course, the Government borrows the surplus and \nspends it. By the year 2015, we will be bringing in $90 and paying out \n$100 or more. Where do we get the extra money? We are going to have to \nget it from the taxpayers. By 2015, taxes are going to have to be \nraised to cash in these IOUs in order to pay the benefits at that time.\n  You hear a lot of Senators and others saying the system is solvent \nuntil 2037. That is only if we can raise taxes on workers to pay those \nbenefits. That is the only way it can remain solvent. Congress is going \nto have to take action. The Social Security trust fund is going to be \nbroke in 2037 unless we have the dollars to cash in those IOUs. The \nreason is our pay-as-you-go retirement system cannot meet the challenge \nof the demographic change.\n  In 1940, there were about 100 working for every retiree. Today, there \nare a little over 2.5. By the year 2025, there will be fewer than 2. In \n1940, with 100 people working, you only had to pay $10 a month to pay \nfor a $1,000 benefit. Today, it is over $400. And we are going to ask \nour grandchildren to pay $500 or more in order to meet this obligation \nof retirement benefits.\n  If you look over the next 75 years, it is going down like a rock. \nThere is $21.6 trillion in unfunded liabilities. In other words, the \nbenefits the Government has promised to pay--$21.6 trillion--are short \nof revenues we need to pay those benefits.\n  How are we going to make them up? There are a couple of choices. We \ncan raise taxes and tinker a little bit with the system. But you cannot \ntinker with $21.6 trillion deficit. They can cut benefits by a third of \nwhat retirees can expect to get. Or they can raise the retirement age. \nBut that will not be enough to make up the $21.6 trillion in deficits \nover the next 75 years if we don't do make hard choice to save the \nsystem.\n  My plan, the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act, has a \ntransitional cost as well. But it is the cost we have to pay anyway. It \nwould cost about $13 trillion for us to make the transition to go from \nthe Social Security system we know today to total personal retirement \naccounts. In other words, we are moving to a system where you have \ncontrol over your retirement--not Washington--you decide when to \nretire, how much you want save and where you want to invest and how you \nwant to control over your account.\n  In reality, we have signed our name to a long-term contract that says \nwe are going to guarantee retirement benefits for Americans forever. \nThere is a cost because we have dug ourselves into a hole. Somehow we \nhave to dig ourselves out. There is no free lunch. People around here \ncan ignore it, but there is no free lunch. We are going to have to find \na way to finance ourselves to reach our goals to have a safe, solid, \nand solvent Social Security system.\n\n[[Page S4516]]\n\nThe biggest risk is doing nothing at all.\n  Social Security has a total unfunded liability of $21 trillion-plus. \nThe trust fund has nothing but IOUs. Vice President Gore said let's pay \ndown the debt and let's put the interest we save into the trust fund. \nBut all he is talking about is adding more IOUs, not building assets in \nthe Social Security trust funds. Instead, today, we have over $800 \nbillion of IOUs, but in 15 years, he wants to have $3.5 trillion worth \nof IOUs--no real assets, but IOUs.\n  Again, the only way you can get those IOUs cashed in is to go to the \ntaxpayers and get more taxes from them.\n  To keep paying Social Security benefits, we are going to probably \nhave to look at least at doubling the FICA tax--the withholding tax--\nwithin the near future; not 15.3 percent. By the year of 2025 or 2030, \nwe could see our payroll tax rates increase to 25 percent to 30 percent \nof wages--nearly doubling the FICA tax in order to maintain the current \nbenefits we promised.\n  I ask many of our senior citizens at our town meetings to raise their \nhands if they think they have good retirement benefits from Social \nSecurity. If you talk about a $700 check a month, or a $680 check a \nmonth, or $1,100 a month, this is not good retirement. This is not the \nretirement I want. I don't think this is the retirement we want to \nleave to our children. But in order to maintain even that system, we \nare going to impose taxes on the next generation. If you have 25 \npercent in FICA taxes, then you add on the average Federal Government \ntax of 28 percent or 53 percent, and then add in Minnesota sales tax of \n8.5 percent, you are at 62 percent. Then add in sales taxes, property \nand excise taxes--I mean every tax you can think of--our kids are going \nto be paying taxes that approach 70 percent of their income. Mr. \nPresident, is this the kind of future we want to leave our kids because \nwe stick our head in the sand and do not want to face our problems?\n\n  Why is Social Security a bad investment today? If a taxpayer retired \nin 1960, they probably got back all the money they paid in in 18 \nmonths. It was a tremendous return for the early retirees. Today, an \naverage person retiring will get less than 2 percent return on his or \nher money paid into the system. Our minority population is actually \ngetting a negative rate of return today. They are in fact subsidizing \nthe rest of us. The markets have paid back nearly 11 percent, but when \nwe filter out inflation, it is better than a 7 percent annual return in \nthe market.\n  What would any person rather have? If an investment counselor said: I \ncan up a plan, but it will not pay very good, less than 2 percent, so \nanyone 50 or younger, by the time they retire, it will be a negative; \nor we can put taxpayers in a new plan paying 7, 8, 11, 12 percent, what \nwill you do? There will not be many at the desk signing up for a plan \npaying zero or giving a negative return on the money.\n  Mr. President, there is no Social Security account with your name on \nit. A lot of people don't realize that. After a lifetime of working, \ntaxpayers think there is an account in Washington that has their name \non it. There is not. You don't have one dollar set aside for your \nretirement today. The only thing you can hope, in our pay-as-you-go \nsystem, is that when you retire there are people working so we can \ndeduct money from their check to pay your benefit. It is a pay-as-you-\ngo system. The money we bring in the first of June will be paid out in \nbenefits by the end of June. It is a pay-as-you-go system, with no \naccumulation of wealth, no real assets, no compounding of interest.\n  By the way, we talk about these IOUs in the trust fund that will make \nthe system solvent. In the President's own budget, he included this \nparagraph: These balances are available to finance future benefit \npayments and other trust fund expenditures.\n  The IOUs are there to pay for the funds or payments to other \nexpenditures, ``but only in a bookkeeping sense.''\n  In other words, they are not real. Members on the floor will say: We \nhave the IOUs. That is great, ``but only in a bookkeeping sense.'' \nThere is nothing there.\n  You can place a million-dollar IOU in your checking account and see \nhow many checks your banker allows to be written against the IOU. None, \nuntil you put money in the account.\n  ``They are claims on the Treasury, that, when redeemed, will have to \nbe financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing \nbenefits or other expenditures.''\n  Do we want to reduce Social Security benefits or cut education, \ntransportation, or health care? If we don't make some hard choices now \nwe will be faced with tougher decisions later.\n  We have these IOUs because the government spent all the surplus in \nthe Social Security Trust Funds. The first step to save Social Security \nis to stop the government spending Americans' retirement dollars for \nnothing but their retirement, to keep the dollars outside the hands of \nthe big spenders in Washington and to make sure we set aside the \nsurplus funds today. We have not done it in the past. It needs to be \ndone. I have introduced a second lockbox that says if our estimates are \nwrong--best faith estimates on what we spend and what we bring in--if \nwe are honest and do not want to spend a dime of Social Security, if \nthe estimates are wrong and we overspend, we need to go back and lower \neverybody's budget across the board. Perhaps take a .003-percent \nreduction so we don't have to go into the trust fund, and we will not \nspend a dime of Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I have six principles for saving Social Security. I \nbegan working on this 7 years ago. I introduced this plan 3 years ago. \nI said then it would be a major issue in this Presidential debate. It \nis. I am glad governor George W. Bush has announced his plan to allow \nat least some privatization for improving and saving the system. And \nVice President Al Gore has made a statement--he doesn't want to do \nanything. He wants status quo, he wants to tinker with the system. That \nmeans, again, raise your taxes even more.\n\n  We need to make sure we protect current and future beneficiaries. \nAnyone on Social Security, about to retire, or who wants to stay with \nit, should be able to so do. It is your option; we will guarantee those \nbenefits. Don't be concerned about it. We will hear scare tactics that \nsomehow this plan is not going to work, we are only going to rob the \nelderly, and we will not have a safe Social Security. That is hogwash. \nWe will always guarantee those benefits.\n  Allow freedom of choice. If you want to have a personal retirement \naccount, you should have that option as well. The Government should not \nstand in your way and say, no, we are going to keep you locked up in a \nsystem that will pay you little or nothing on your return.\n  Preserve the safety net. Again, I have heard the scare tactics that \nthere are no safety nets in the PRAs. That is a lie. Under our plan we \nhave the same safety nets as Social Security. We have survivors \nbenefits, disability benefits, built into the program. It is the same \nthing, but our plan pays dividends and higher returns than Social \nSecurity. The bottom line is we have the same safety nets.\n  Make Americans better off, not worse off. Today, nearly 20 percent of \nAmericans, when they retire, retire into poverty, because Social \nSecurity is all they have--or very little else--and it is not enough to \nkeep them off the poverty. Our system says when you retire you will \nhave a minimum of 150 percent of poverty. Right now, the poverty for \nsingle individuals is about $8,400 a year. Our plan says you have to \nhave at least $12,800 a year to retire. We make sure you don't retire \ninto poverty. The people most affected are elderly women and widows. \nThe Social Security system today discriminates against women. Again, we \nwill hear stories that PRAs discriminate against women. That is not \ntrue. The current system is the culprit. Changing the system will \nimprove retirement for millions of Americans today, including our \nelderly ladies.\n  Create a fully funded system. Make sure if you have an option for \nprivate retirement accounts, you can do that. Most importantly, no tax \nincreases, no tinkering with the system.\n  I introduced my plan, the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement \nAct, in the last Congress and the 106th. I will keep introducing this \nplan until we do something on it.\n  How does the plan work for retirement options? Workers may divert 10\n\n[[Page S4517]]\n\npercent of their income into a personal retirement account to be \nmanaged by Government-approved but private investment companies, \nsimilar to 401(k)'s and IRAs and FDIC accounts. We make sure they are \nsafe and sound.\n  Somebody making $30,000 a year now pays $3,720 into Social Security. \nOur plan says $3,000 goes into a personal retirement account. At the \nend of the year, you don't just have a promise, you actually have a \nsavings book that has $3,000 cash, plus interest. The other 2.4 \npercent, $720, goes into the SSA, Social Security Administration, to \nhelp fund part of the financing plan for those who want to stay on \nSocial Security, to guarantee their benefits.\n  Right now in personal retirement accounts, someone earning $36,000 a \nyear pays in the maximum to Social Security, and receives $1,280 a \nmonth as a maximum benefit. Take just 10 percent of that income, put it \ninto an average market account, you will have a benefit of $6,514 a \nmonth. That is a big difference, five times better under the private \nretirement account than what Social Security would pay. In addition, \nthe safety nets are there for survivor and disability benefits. Don't \nlet anybody say that somehow this isn't as good or better.\n  Looking at the returns, people are talking about maybe 2 percent of \nyour Social Security. After 40 years at 2 percent, you will have \n$171,000 in the account, plus reduced benefits from Social Security. So \nat least with partial reform plan, a citizen is better off and would \nhave a little bit of reduced benefit from Social Security but will have \n$171,000 in the bank. Under my plan, you would have $855,000 based on a \n$36,000 income; $855,000 would have been put away for your retirement.\n  The family with median income of $58,000, putting away 2 percent has \n$278,000 in the bank, and a reduced Social Security benefit. Again, \nbetter than what we have now. But you could have $1.4 million in a \nsavings account in your name, cash, estate money, if you could put \naside 10 percent of your salary.\n  It is being done across the country. I discussed people in Galvaston, \nTX, with private retirement accounts who got the OK from Social \nSecurity to have their own retirement accounts in 1981. Social Security \ndeath benefits? My dad died at 61, we got $253. That is what Social \nSecurity offers.\n\n  Galveston County that has their own private retirement accounts, \nreceive an average $75,000 death benefit.\n  Disability benefits for Social Security is $1,280; and Galveston, TX, \nis $2,749.\n  What about retirement benefits? Social Security, a maximum on this \naverage income is $1,280; Galveston County, nearly $4,800.\n  By the way, Galveston has a conservative retirement plan, they invest \nvery conservatively and they still pay those much better returns.\n  One lady, by the way, named Wendy Cohill, her husband died at 44 of a \nheart attack. She was 42. She received $126,000 in death benefits plus \nwhat was in the account plus the survivors benefit that she used to pay \nto finish a college education. She was able to care for her family in \nher own home. If she would have had Social Security, she would have \nbeen under the poverty level. She said: Thank God, some wise men \nprivatized Social Security here. If I had regular Social Security, I \nwould be broke.\n  The city of San Diego also has PRAs, a government employee, 35 years \nold, contributes 6 percent into the PRAs. After 35 years, they would \nreceive a $3,000-per-month retirement benefit.\n  Under Social Security, he would receive only $1,077 a month in \nbenefits.\n  I know the Senator from California said on the floor recently that \npersonal retirement accounts are too risky and we cannot damage the \nfoundation of Social Security. But last year, and I want to read this, \nthe Senator from California--this is Senator Barbara Boxer along with \nSenator Dianne Feinstein and Senator Ted Kennedy, sent a letter to the \nPresident saying:\n  ``Millions of our constituents will receive higher retirement \nbenefits''--They are talking about the city of San Diego--``higher \nbenefits from their current public pensions than they would under \nSocial Security.''\n  In other words, they were telling the President to leave San Diego \nalone because the President's plan for saving Social Security included \ntaking 1 percent, pooling the investments, but he also would take all \nthese with private accounts off the table and put them all into Social \nSecurity. She did not like that. She says:\n\n       Mr. President, millions of our constituents who will \n     receive higher retirement benefits from their current public \n     pensions than they would under Social Security, are appealing \n     to their elected Representatives in Washington and we \n     respectfully urge you to honor the original legislative \n     intent underpinning the Social Security system--\n\n  That was to exclude these people from Social Security, exclude this \nprovision from your reform and leave San Diego alone, they were saying.\n  My question is, if the retirement accounts in San Diego are better \nthan Social Security, why can't you and I enjoy a similar system? But \nif Social Security is better, as Senator Boxer, Senator Feinstein, and \nSenator Kennedy will support, then why don't they want the citizens who \nwork for the city of San Diego to have that same benefit? A good \nquestion.\n  I know I do not have much time left. Mr. President, how much time do \nI have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until the hour of 12 noon is under \nthe control of the Senator from Wyoming. He yielded you the time you \nneeded.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I will go through this quickly. I know we have others \nwanting to speak.\n  As I said, this is not an experiment. This is being done around the \nworld. Eleven countries now have privatized their retirement; 30 others \nare considering it. We like to think we are in the forefront of this. \nBut when it comes to retirement benefits, we are behind the curve.\n\n  Chile, 18 years ago, privatized their system because their system was \nmuch like ours. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the brains in Washington \ndid not create Social Security. It was modeled and copied from \nsomething that Otto Von Bismark put out in 1880. We adopted it almost \nexactly. So did Chile and just about every other country around the \nworld. Chile, had the same problems or worse than what we are facing \ntoday. It went to bankrupt. They had to privatize their plan.\n  By the way, 95 percent of the Chilean workers have opted into the \npersonal retirement accounts. Their return last year was 11.3 percent. \nOurs, again, were less than 2 percent.\n  British workers have chosen to go into PRAs. They have what they call \ntheir second tier Social Security, where they can opt from the Social \nSecurity System, like we have, into personal retirement accounts. In \nBritain, so far two-thirds of all British workers have opted into \npersonal retirement accounts. They have enjoyed, over the past 5 years, \na better than 10 percent return on their money. By the way, the pool of \nretirement in their retirement accounts in Britain exceeds $1.4 \ntrillion. That is how much now they have put away in their accounts. \nThat is more than the total GDP of Britain, and it is more than all \nother private investments in all the other European countries combined. \nSo it shows you the power of private retirement accounts, and the \naccumulation of wealth.\n  Many people say: I have worked for 30 years. I can't give up what I \nhave paid into Social Security.\n  We have a recognition bond. The Government knows exactly how much you \nhave paid in. If you have paid in $20,000, if you paid in $40,000, if \nyou paid in $90,000, we know. We would give you a recognition bond, \nplus interest upon retirement.\n  Mr. President, we must take care of today's Social Security \nrecipients. If an individual chooses to remain in the current system, \nwe must guarantee their benefits. There is no increase in age of \nretirement, no cuts in benefits, no ifs, ands, or buts, and no raising \nof taxes.\n  The plan preserves the safety net, as I said, for survivors benefits \nand disability benefits. Poverty, as I said, recognized that $8,240 a \nyear--you have to have $12,400, so you would not retire into poverty, \nagain, as nearly 20 percent of our Americans do. Funds that manage PRAs \nare required to buy the life and disability insurance to provide the \nsafety nets I have talked about.\n  For those who would come up short--and those would be very few--if \nyou could not get $12,400 a year, we would come in and say we will fill \nyour glass\n\n[[Page S4518]]\n\nfull so when you retire, you would retire with less than that. This is \nthe only entitlement portion of our bill. Again, this is an important \nsafety net of this system.\n  Rules similar to those that apply to IRAs today would apply to PRAs. \nAlso, a Federal personal retirement investment board would oversee it \nfor safety and soundness to make sure your retirement funds are there, \nand are safe. Investment companies that manage PRAs would be required \nto have an insurance plan to pay at least a minimum of 2.5 percent. \nThat would be a floor. Again, that is much better than Social Security, \nbut at least it is a guarantee if something would go wrong you would at \nleast have that as your investment.\n  In addition, you decide when you want to retire. As I said, right now \nthe Government controls your retirement. They tell you exactly how much \nthey are going to take out of your check, they tell you exactly the day \nyou can retire, and then they tell you what they are going to give you \nin benefits.\n  In our plan, you have those controls. You make your retirement \ndecisions. As soon as you can buy an annuity that will keep you 150 \npercent over poverty, you have met your requirement. You are not going \nto be a ward of the state. You ensured your future. You can stop. You \ncan do what you want. You can arrange regular withdrawals, for the \namounts that are above that requirement. To buy this minimum benefit, \nyou would need about $125,000 in your account. If you are an average \nworker with earnings of $30,000, you would have $855,000 in your \naccount, so you can use that other $750,000 any way you want.\n\n  If you have a family, you could have $1.4 million. What are you going \nto do with the other $1.2 million. You can do whatever you want with \nthat money; that is yours. You decide how you withdraw it. If you want \nto go to Europe? Write a check. Buy a new car? You can do it. Give it \nto your kid. You can do it.\n  In divorce cases, PRAs are treated as common property. Upon death, \nPRAs go to heirs without estate taxes; no capital gains, so that at \nleast you have created an estate, and this $1.2 million or $700,000 or \nwhatever you had in your account is your money.\n  Going back to Social Security, when you die, you get a $253 death \nbenefit. Under this, you get a death benefit in our plan, a minimum, \nplus you would get what is left in your estate, whatever it might be. \nYou can pass it on to your heirs, your spouse, your kids, your church--\nwealth that you cannot pass on today because the Government takes all \nthose benefits.\n  Again, the bottom line is, no new taxes for this system. We do have a \nresponsibility to bail ourselves out, but we are not taxing the system. \nRetirement income is going to be there whether you stay with Social \nSecurity, or if you choose to build a personal retirement account. You \ncan decide the options, you decide how you want to invest it, and you \ndecide when you want to retire. Let's make sure we give you choices.\n  Just in concluding, despite our colleagues, our Democratic colleagues \nbashing Governor Bush's reform plan, its popularity is increasing among \nworkers.\n  I heard one say: I don't come out here and bash it. I want to study \neverything and I want to look over all of these plans.\n  He hasn't even seen the Governor's plan. He doesn't really know what \nVice President Al Gore has got. But yet he favors Al Gore over Governor \nBush.\n  Recent polls show most Americans support the idea of personal \nretirement accounts. In fact, if you are under 40 years old, more young \npeople believe in UFOs than that they are going to get Social Security; \n90-some percent of young people under 30 would opt into personal \nretirement accounts.\n  I believe a national consensus can be reached on ways to save and \nstrengthen Social Security. There will always be a retirement system in \nthis country. What kind of system are we going to leave for our \nchildren and grandchildren? For many of us, if we are 50 years old, 55 \nyears old, or older, we might have been condemned to the current system \nwithout time left in our working lives to change or take the option in \nthe personal retirement accounts. We can tell our children and \ngrandchildren we want to leave a 70-percent tax system for them, we \nwant to leave them a plan that might guarantee they will get less \nbenefits, pay more into it, and will have to wait longer to retire, or \nwe can leave them an option for them to invest in their own retirement \nand have personal retirement accounts.\n  The numbers show Americans overwhelmingly say: I am smart enough to \nhandle my future.\n  There are many in Washington who believe you are not smart enough; \nyou may be smart enough to earn your money, but you are not smart \nenough to put it aside for your retirement and only Washington can step \nin and help you out. That's wrong. Our plan empower working Americans \nand offers better options and gives you control over your retirement.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, is there any procedural motion I need \nto make to move forward?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of the Senator \nfrom Wyoming until the hour of 12 noon.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, 56 years ago today, 176,000 allied soldiers landed on \nthe beaches of Normandy in what was the largest invasion in history. \nThe operation was officially known as Operation Overlord, but I have \nnever heard anyone refer to it by that name. It is now known as D-Day.\n  While there have been hundreds of other D-days in other historic \nlocations such as Okinawa, Iwo Jima, and Inchon, the forces that landed \non Normandy Beach 56 years ago today truly changed the course of \nhistory. When we hear the term ``D-Day,'' we reflect on that awful and \nincredible day on Normandy Beach with reverence for what was \naccomplished and for all that was lost, and with respect the people who \nwere there--those who did not survive and those who did.\n  Thousands of young Americans died that day establishing that small \nbeachhead on the continent of Europe. Within a year, the Allied forces \nwent on to crush the Nazi war regime and brought forth on the European \nContinent an unprecedented period of peace.\n  Today, we look back on that time and we remember and respect what was \ndone.\n  When the cold war ended, the Wall came down and the Warsaw Pact \ndisbanded. The United States began to draw down forces from Europe for \nthe first time since we had gone in on D-Day and established a \npresence, and set up the plan to help our vanquished enemy.\n  Military strategists began to talk of new missions for NATO. They \nspoke of the need for NATO to go ``out of area or out of business,'' \nimplying that unless NATO could find a new reason to exist after the \nend of the Cold War, there may be no reason for it to exist at all.\n  That new mission began to come into focus in the Balkans five years \nago when the United States committed peacekeeping forces to Bosnia to \nenforce the provisions of the Dayton Peace Accords.\n  What was conceived by the administration as a one-year mission to \naccomplish specific military objectives is now in its fifth year--with \ngreatly expanded civilian nation-building objectives and no end in \nsight to the deployment.\n  Today we are on the eve of another anniversary in the search for new \nNATO missions. One year ago, on June 10, NATO halted the bombing in \nSerbia and Kosovo. As in Bosnia, we again have deployed thousands of \nAmerican forces to yet another Balkan quagmire with unclear \nobjectives--and there is no end in sight to the Kosovo mission, either. \nThis time the ethnic groups we seek to reconcile have not tired of the \nkilling, apparently, and it continues as our soldiers stand by helpless \nto deter murder.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that the cost of our Balkan \npeacekeeping missions in Bosnia and Kosovo now tops $23 billion. We \nhave become mired in the problem, unable to stand back and assess where \nwe are. Nor are we able to look at the situation and say we must have a \nstrategy.\n\n[[Page S4519]]\n\n  We know what this has cost our country: For the past five years, \nrecruiting and retention problems in the U.S. military services have \nbeen exacerbated by endless peacekeeping missions. Our armed services \ntoday are not up to their congressionally mandated troop strength; they \nare at least 6,000 short.\n  As the world's only superpower, we have a responsibility to lead. \nAmerica led when the parties first came together in Dayton, but the \nDayton Peace Accords simply stopped the fighting. We did not create \nconditions that could actually solve the problem without the presence \nof thousands of outside forces. We ended the hostilities--and we should \nbe respectful of that achievement--but we did not create effective \neconomic and political structures.\n  That must be our goal for a lasting peace. As one American military \npeacekeeper said to me on a recent visit, ``Everyone's job in Bosnia is \nto work on the problems we face, but no one seems to have the \nresponsibility for actually solving those problems.''\n\n  We need to search for ways to solve these problems. Today I am \nintroducing legislation to authorize funds to reconvene the parties to \nthe Dayton Peace Accords that ended the Bosnia conflict, those who were \ninvolved in the Rambouillet talks that failed to avert the conflict in \nKosovo and other regional entities. We must review our progress to \ndate. If we cannot do that, how can we call ourselves leaders?\n  We must look for a long-term settlement based on greater self-\ndetermination for the governed and less by outside powers. That may \ninvolve tailoring current borders to fit the facts on the ground. It \nwill create conditions of genuine stability, reconstruction and \nprosperity. It will allow us, in a responsible way, to set some \ntimetables, some measurements for success, and, hopefully, to begin \nturning over these peacekeeping responsibilities to our European allies \nwithin a reasonable time frame.\n  We must have self-determination that works. The current policy wagers \nAmerica's reputation, prestige and will on a mirage of multicultural \ndemocracy in the Balkans. We are trying to create governments that \nignore history, nationality and ethnicity. Elections have been held in \nwhich refugees were bused into disputed regions to vote for elected \nofficials who cannot serve because they are unable to return to their \nprewar homes.\n  American officers spend their days deciding which vehicles can travel \ndown which roads, and escorting Serb families in hostile Albanian \nterritory to the dentist and back or to the library and back.\n  This effort is diverting the United States from its global \nresponsibilities. We occupy a unique place in the world today, standing \nastride history's path as the most powerful nation that ever may have \nexisted. Our supercharged economic engine certainly reflects the best \nthat mankind has to offer. However, a superpower's core responsibility \nis not to right every wrong, but to preserve its strength for those \nchallenges that only a superpower can address.\n  The United States must know when to encourage capable allies and \nproxies to address contingencies that fall short of that standard. \nInstead, time and again, our military readiness to address potential \nthreats--such as North Korea, mainland China, Iraq--has been diverted \nto contingency provisions on the periphery of our nation's security \nconcerns.\n  America's peacekeeping burden in the 1990s has resulted in two of our \nArmy divisions reporting themselves unfit for combat.\n  We can achieve more in the Balkans than a peace enforced at bayonet \ntip. We ought to tie our continued financial support to a comprehensive \nregional settlement, to substantial military withdrawal from the region \nand to a firm policy of encouraging the Europeans to do more--with our \nsupport, which will always be there.\n  Any NATO member can patrol the Balkans, but only the United States \ncan defend NATO. That is the role of a superpower, and that is the role \nof a strong and reliable ally.\n  As we take up the armed services budget this week, I hope we can take \non the role that is the responsibility of the Senate and try to put \nsome long-term potential peace into play. I am not saying I know what \nthe outcome of any kind of conference should be. But I do know it is \nour responsibility to call such a conference and begin to assess where \nwe are; to look with vision to the future and set the standard that \nmust be set for the lasting peace that we want and hope for and will \nwork for and support in the Balkans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak about the issue of what is \nhappening in Africa, specifically in Sierra Leone. Recently, I have \nbecome involved in this issue because, as chairman of the Commerce, \nJustice, State, and the Judiciary Subcommittee, we have jurisdiction \nover the funds that flow to the U.N. for peacekeeping activity. In \norder to adequately do the job as chairman of that subcommittee, our \njob involves oversight of those funds, to make sure they are being used \neffectively. After all, they are American tax dollars; Congress has \ncontrol of the purse strings; and we have a major role in how those \ndollars are spent.\n  I recognize fully, as all Members of Congress do, that the key \nindividual who sets foreign policy is our President. Even though we may \ndisagree with our President, he does have that priority position. But \nthere are, obviously, issues on which the Congress has a role in \nforeign policy--very significant issues. One of them happens to be the \nfunding of peacekeeping activities and the role the United States \nshould play in that. So I have had very serious concerns about our \npolicies in Sierra Leone specifically--on a number of peacekeeping \nactivities, but specifically our policies in Sierra Leone. This is \nbecause of a number of issues that have been raised there.\n  Last year, the United States, regrettably, played a key role in \nimposing the Lome Accord on a brutalized Sierra Leone. The accord \ngranted a total amnesty to the Revolutionary United Front, RUF, which \nis basically a gang of thugs that murders, rapes, and mutilates people. \nJust about everybody in their path has come under their severe act of \nviolence. In fact, they actually\n\n[[Page S4520]]\n\nempower their soldiers--and they are not really soldiers; many are very \nyoung boys--to cut off the arms of women and children in order to make \na point. This is a very common practice with this alleged military \ngroup called RUF, this gang of thugs. They have been terrorizing the \ncountry of Sierra Leone. There is no question about that. Their leader, \nFoday Sankoh, and his lieutenants, as part of the Lome agreement, as \npart of the understanding of the Lome agreement--and this is why it was \nsuch a horrendous agreement--were given top spots in the ``transition'' \ngovernment and guaranteed RUF control over the Sierra Leone diamond \nmines, which is basically the core of the element of how they generate \ntheir revenues.\n  It is inexcusable that we were party to the Lome agreement and that \nwe therefore empowered these war criminals to take office and to have \ncontrol over basically the only significant economic resource of the \ncountry of Sierra Leone. So I was more than upset about this. I \nbelieved it was essentially a surrender in the face of criminal \nviolence. As a result, I did put a hold --not technically a hold, but I \nactually refused to approve a transfer of peacekeeping funds for the \nSierra Leone initiative. I began exploring alternatives to this, what I \nbelieved was an extraordinarily unjust accord. In response to my \nconcerns, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Holbrooke and his staff took on \nthe difficult task of crafting a better approach to this issue.\n  Since my ``hold'' became news, I have been sharply criticized by \nsome, including some in the U.N. and the State Department, and even--\nnot even, but not surprisingly, really--the Washington Post, which \nrecently accused me of ``playing at foreign policy,'' implying that \nserious students of world affairs would not question U.S. support for \nthe Lome Accord. I simply point out that I think a lot of serious \nstudents of foreign policy question the decision to support that \naccord.\n\n  Meanwhile, in Sierra Leone itself, the RUF, as a result of Lome in \nlarge part, continued to terrorize civilians and even challenge the \nU.N. peacekeepers. By last month, the RUF was marching on Freetown in \ncomplete violation of the Lome Accord. In fact, of course, they have \nhumiliated the U.N. mission in Sierra Leone, which was supposed to \ndisarm them. It actually ended up being disarmed by them, and much of \nthe military equipment that is being used there by the RUF is U.N. \nequipment taken from U.N. advisers. Thus, the mission of the U.N., as a \nresult of being an outgrowth of the Lome Accords, which were so \ndisgraceful, is in disarray. Today, all that stands between the RUF and \ntotal control of Sierra Leone is the British and Nigerian troops who \nhave come in to try to stabilize the situation.\n  And what of the U.S. policy? Following our most recent meeting 2 \nweeks ago, Ambassador Holbrooke has sent me a letter laying out a new \nstrategy for a more just and lasting approach to peace in Sierra Leone \nthat gives me some reason for hope. I would like to read from what his \nletter says because I think it is an important adjustment in American \npolicy in Sierra Leone. I congratulate him for it.\n  First, he notes in his opening paragraph that he has taken this issue \nand walked it through the administration and that he has support for \nhis letter from Secretary Albright, National Security Adviser Berger, \nand the head of the OMB, Jack Lew. Reading paragraphs from his letter:\n\n       You asked for a letter encapsulating our discussion on \n     Sierra Leone and Congo. After close consultation with \n     Secretary Albright, let me review where we stand on each \n     issue:\n       First, Sierra Leone. Let me posit five principles that we \n     will use to govern our policy. First, the United States does \n     not believe that Foday Sankoh should play any role whatsoever \n     in the future political process in Sierra Leone, and we will \n     continue to press this point. He must be held accountable for \n     his actions.\n\n  This is a significant change in policy, in my opinion, and it is a \npositive one.\n\n       Second, we strongly support the British military presence \n     in Sierra Leone, which has played a key role in restoring a \n     measure of stability to Freetown. We are discussing with the \n     British their continuing role, and on May 23 London announced \n     an important training program for Sierra Leone army, \n     something that they will undertake at their own expense \n     outside the U.N. system.\n\n  This, again, is positive news that the British will be a stabilizing \nforce there, which will be armed and know how to defend itself.\n\n       Third, the objective should be to ensure that regional and \n     international forces in Sierra Leone, together with the armed \n     forces of the government of Sierra Leone, have the capacity \n     to disrupt RUF control of Sierra Leone's diamond producing \n     areas, the main source of RUF income. Completely eliminating \n     them as a military force is not likely to be possible as an \n     acceptable cost, but sharply reducing their sources of \n     financial support and restricting their capability to \n     threaten the people or government of Sierra Leone is within \n     reach of sufficient numbers of properly trained, equipped, \n     and well-led troops and is vitally important.\n\n  That is to paraphrase a much more robust mission directive and \nportfolio and is exactly what needs to be done.\n\n       The most likely nations to carry the burden would be \n     Nigeria and Ghana, with the backing of other ECOWAS states. \n     Other nations who are already rushing troops to Sierra Leone \n     include India, Jordan and Bangladesh. Most potential troop \n     contributors from the region are likely to require better \n     equipment and training if they are to contribute \n     meaningfully. Pentagon and EUCOM assessment teams are \n     studying the issue urgently. If our objectives are to be \n     accomplished, the U.S. will need to be ready, with \n     congressional support and funding, to provide our share of \n     international effort to provide equipment and training to \n     those who are willing to do the military job--including the \n     government of Sierra Leone and other countries in the \n     region. Any direct training of contributing country troops \n     by U.S. military personnel would be done outside Sierra \n     Leone and no U.S. combat troops would be deployed to \n     Sierra Leone. We will have to work out the relationships \n     between such an operation and the UN, recognizing that for \n     many countries a UN role is preferable--but we must ensure \n     that the mandate is robust. Fourth, since there is \n     virtually no real government structure left in Sierra \n     Leone, if the security situation can be stabilized a \n     longer term international effort will be needed to help \n     build viable institutions in Sierra Leone. It will take \n     time, but in the long run, the rest of the effort will be \n     unsuccessful if it is not accompanied by this component. \n     However, this cannot start until the situation is \n     stabilized, and there is no present funding request for \n     this function. Fifth (this is a point I failed to mention \n     in our meeting) we must develop a corresponding political \n     strategy for dealing appropriately with Liberia's \n     President, Charles Taylor, and with the illicit diamond \n     trade that fuels conflict and criminality in the region.\n\n  That is a reading of two of the major paragraphs in this letter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Representative of the United States of America to the \n           United Nations,\n                                                     May 30, 2000.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Allow me to thank you again for your \n     courtesy and for our exchange of views on peacekeeping \n     issues. I know the Secretary also appreciates your discussion \n     with her on May 20, and I would like to follow up on both \n     conversations. I have shared our discussions with Secretary \n     Albright, Sandy Berger, and Jack Lew, all of whom expressed \n     their appreciation of your decision to release the funds for \n     Kosovo and for your readiness to meet with the Australian \n     Ambassador to resolve the East Timor peacekeeping ``hold.''\n       You asked for a letter encapsulating our discussion on \n     Sierra Leone and Congo. After close consultation with \n     Secretary Albright, let me review where we stand on each \n     issue:\n       First, Sierra Leone. Let me posit five principles that we \n     will use to govern our policy. First, the United States does \n     not believe that Foday Sankoh should play any role whatsoever \n     in the future political process in Sierra Leone, and we will \n     continue to press this point.

Any direct training of contributing country troops by \n     U.S. military personnel would be done outside Sierra Leone \n     and no U.S. combat troops would be deployed to Sierra Leone. \n     We will have to work out the relationship between such an \n     operation and the UN, recognizing that for many countries a \n     UN role is preferable--but we must ensure that the mandate is \n     robust. Fourth, since there is virtually no real government \n     structure left in Sierra Leone, if the security situation can \n     be stabilized a longer term international effort will be \n     needed to help build viable institutions in Sierra Leone. It \n     will take time, but in the long run, the rest of the effort \n     will be unsuccessful if it is not accompanied by this \n     component. However, this cannot start until the situation is \n     stabilized, and there is no present funding request for this \n     function. Fifth (this is a point I failed to mention in our \n     meeting) we must develop a corresponding political strategy \n     for dealing appropriately with Liberia's President, Charles \n     Taylor, and with the illicit diamond trade that fuels \n     conflict and criminality in the region.\n       On the Congo, the problems are still daunting, but there \n     has been some real movement since I first discussed this \n     issue with you in late February:\n       (A) On May 4, in my presence, the Kabila Government signed \n     the Status of Forces Agreement with the UN--an essential \n     precondition for any UN deployment;\n       (B) Kabila has said he would accept South African troops;\n       (C) The Lusaka parties signed a new cease-fire agreement \n     effective April 14, calming the situation on the ground \n     considerably;\n       (D) The UN Security Council Mission negotiated on May 8 a \n     cease-fire between the Ugandans and Rwandans who were \n     fighting in Kisangani (Congo's third largest, and perhaps \n     most strategic, city); Regional leaders subsequently secured \n     agreement between Rwanda and Uganda on a detailed \n     disengagement plan;\n       (E) The Presidents of Rwanda and Uganda asked for immediate \n     UN assistance in support of demilitarizing Kisangani;\n       (F) All the parties to the war in the Congo have asked for \n     the UN observer mission as soon as possible to implement the \n     Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement;\n       (G) The South Africans sent a high-level military mission \n     in New York to discuss their role in Congo, and the \n     Pakistanis (among others) are about to send troops. The South \n     Africans met with a joint State Pentagon-NSC team to discuss \n     close coordination.\n       Of course, not all the news from Congo is positive. While \n     progressing, the political dialogue called for by Lusaka is \n     off to a slow start; the UN and the OAU military observer \n     missions have not meshed sufficiently; some of the rebels \n     still violate the cease-fire on occasion; and there are many \n     other lesser problems. Still there is a real desire for some \n     resolution to these issues by most parties. What is required \n     next is a step-by-step test of their commitments to implement \n     their own ``African agreement for an African problem.'' This \n     is one of our highest priorities.\n       As we both said to you, neither the Secretary nor I are \n     certain that Lusaka will succeed. But we are certain that \n     Lusaka will fail if the UN does not take the next series of \n     steps to support it, as called for by all parties. The recent \n     progress supports this view, I believe.\n       For the United States, this will require the unblocking of \n     $41 million of reprogrammed peacekeeping funds for the \n     current fiscal year for Congo. We believe that this request \n     does not put our national prestige on the line; it is a UN \n     operation (with no U.S. troops in the UN operation). However, \n     if we do not pay our share, we are concerned that the UN will \n     be unable to bring in adequate and properly equipped troops, \n     and the resulting failure of the mission will be attributed, \n     however unfairly, to the United States.\n       Our arrears on the current operation in Sierra Leone limit \n     our ability to promote effectively the critical policy \n     objectives outlined in this letter. More broadly, failure to \n     pay our share of these missions risks seriously undermining \n     our all-out effort to carry the Helms-Biden reform package, \n     on which we are making real progress. You will note several \n     recent news articles regarding our forward movement on a wide \n     range of issues, including the admission of Israel to a UN \n     regional grouping (after 40 years!), the new GAO report that \n     shows UN progress, and the first debate in 27 years on \n     revising the UN peacekeeping scale. All this forward movement \n     will greatly benefit from your support and I thank you for \n     your thoughtful involvement in this process.\n       I hope this letter is responsive to your request. If I can \n     be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me or my colleagues in the State Department.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Richard C. Holbrooke.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this letter obviously, in my opinion, is a \nvery positive step in the redirection of American policy in Sierra \nLeone. I congratulate Ambassador Holbrooke for organizing the letter.\n  Whereas the Article V and IX of the Lome Accord granted Foday Sankoh \nthe Vice Presidency of Sierra Leone and an ``absolute and free \npardon,'' Ambassador Holbrooke's plan makes it clear that Foday Sankoh \ncan play no role in the politics or government of Sierra Leone and that \n``he must be held accountable for his actions.'' This when as late as a \nmonth ago State Department officials were still being quoted as saying \nthat Sankoh's ``voice was positive'' and that he ``has a chance to play \na positive role.'' Now, we will recognize him for what he is, a war \ncriminal, and treat him as such.\n  Whereas Annex 1 and Articles V and VII of the Lome Accord left Foday \nSankoh and the RUF in control of Sierra Leone's diamonds, Ambassador \nHolbrooke's plan rightly strips Sankoh of his chairmanship of the \ndiamond control board and insists that ``allied'' forces ``have the \ncapacity to disrupt RUF control of Sierra Leone's diamond producing \nareas, the main source of RUF income.'' Under Lome, peacekeepers did no \nmore than oversee the looting of Sierra Leone. Now, international \ntroops will fight alongside local forces to expel the RUF from the \ndiamond fields.\n  Whereas the Lome Accord was silent on root causes of violence in \nSierra Leone and the region, Ambassador Holbrooke's plan seeks a \n``political strategy for dealing appropriately with Liberia's \nPresident, Charles Taylor, and with the illicit diamond trade that \nfuels conflict and criminality in the region.'' The RUF is in large \npart Taylor's proxy. Under Lome, Taylor's success in seizing the riches \nof Sierra Leone could invite a similar attack on Guinea.\n  Lome is dead. The U.S. will not turn a blind eye to the rape of a \npeople and a land. We will demand that brutal thugs are held \naccountable for their atrocities, and regional trouble-makers.\n  Why the change? I do not flatter myself that my ``hold'' did all of \nthis, but it did give those of us who opposed the Lome Accord a chance \nto right a terrible wrong. And to his credit, Ambassador Holbrooke has \ncrafted a forceful plan, and vetted it through the inter-agency process \nin record time. It is a plan that I believe Americans can and should \nsupport, and can be proud of.\n  Therefore, I am releasing my hold on the $50,000,000 owed the U.N. \nfor peacekeeping in Sierra Leone. I will also press ahead to ensure \nthat my provision blocking the illicit sale of diamonds from Sierra \nLeone and other war-torn countries is included in the final version of \nthe fiscal year 2001 military construction appropriations bill. \nFinally, I look forward to working with Ambassador Holbrooke and his \nstaff to ensure that the strategy laid out in his letter is supported \nby Congress.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4521-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4521-S4523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE SECOND AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appear on the floor to speak about a \nprovision of the Constitution of our country that has been under nearly \nconstant attack for 8 years. In fact, we heard on the floor this \nmorning two Senators speak about provisions in law that would alter a \nconstitutional right.\n  The provision I am talking about is part of our Bill of Rights--the \nfirst 10 amendments to our Constitution--which protect our most basic \nrights from being stripped away by an overly zealous government, \nincluding rights that all Americans hold dear:\n  The freedom to worship according to one's conscience;\n  The freedom to speak or to write whatever we might think;\n  The freedom to criticize our Government;\n  And, the freedom to assemble peacefully.\n  Among the safeguards of these fundamental rights, we find the Second \nAmendment. Let me read it clearly:\n\n       A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security \n     of a free State, the right of\n\n[[Page S4522]]\n\n     the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n  I want to repeat that.\n  The second amendment of our Constitution says very clearly that ``A \nwell regulated Militia'' is ``necessary'' for the ``security of a free \nState,'' and that ``the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, \nshall not be infringed.''\n  What we heard this morning was an effort to infringe upon that right.\n  Some--even of my colleagues--will read what I have just quoted from \nour Constitution quite differently. They might read ``A well regulated \nMilitia,'' and stop there and declare that ``the right of the people to \nkeep and bear Arms'' actually means that it is a right of our \nGovernment to keep and bear arms because they associate the militia \nwith the government. Yet, under this standard, the Bill of Rights would \nprotect only the right of a government to speak, or the right of a \ngovernment to criticize itself, if you were taking that same argument \nand transposing it over the first amendment. In fact, the Bill of \nRights protects the rights of people from being infringed upon by \nGovernment--not the other way around.\n  Of course, we know that our Founding Fathers in their effort to \nratify the Constitution could not convince the citizens to accept it \nuntil the Bill of Rights was established to assure the citizenry that \nwe were protecting the citizens from Government instead of government \nfrom the citizens.\n  Others say that the Second Amendment merely protects hunting and \nsport shooting. They see shooting competitions and hunting for food as \nthe only legitimate uses of guns, and, therefore, conclude that the \nSecond Amendment is no impediment to restricting gun use to those \npurposes.\n  You can hear it in the way President Clinton assures hunters that his \ngun control proposals that will not trample on recreation--though his \nproposals certainly walk all over their rights.\n  In fact, the Second Amendment does not merely protect sport shooting \nand hunting, though it certainly does that.\n  Nor does the second amendment exist to protect the government's right \nto bear arms.\n  The framers of our Constitution wrote the Second Amendment with a \ngreater purpose.\n  They made the Second Amendment the law of the land because it has \nsomething very particular to say about the rights of every man and \nevery woman, and about the relationship of every man and every woman to \nhis or her Government. That is: The first right of every human being, \nthe right of self-defense.\n\n  Let me repeat that: The first right of every human being is the right \nof self-defense. Without that right, all other rights are meaningless. \nThe right of self-defense is not something the government bestows upon \nits citizens. It is an inalienable right, older than the Constitution \nitself. It existed prior to government and prior to the social contract \nof our Constitution. It is the right that government did not create and \ntherefore it is a right that under our Constitution the government \nsimply cannot take away. The framers of our Constitution understood \nthis clearly. Therefore, they did not merely acknowledge that the right \nexists. They denied Congress the power to infringe upon that right.\n  Under the social contract that is the Constitution of the United \nStates, the American people have told Congress explicitly that we do \nnot have the authority to abolish the American people's right to defend \nthemselves. Further, the framers said not only does the Congress not \nhave the power to abolish that right, but Congress may not even \ninfringe upon that right. That is what our Constitution says. That is \nwhat the Second Amendment clearly lays out. Our Founding Fathers wrote \nthe Second Amendment to tell us that a free state cannot exist if the \npeople are denied the right or the means to defend themselves.\n  Let me repeat that because it is so fundamental to our freedom. A \nfree state cannot exist, our free state of the United States \ncollectively, cannot exist without the right of the people to defend \nthemselves. This is the meaning of the Second Amendment. Over the years \na lot of our citizens and many politicians have tried to nudge that \ndefinition around. But contrary to what the media and the President \nsay, the right to keep and bear arms is as important today as it was \n200 years ago.\n  Every day in this country thousands of peaceful, law-abiding \nAmericans use guns to defend themselves, their families, and their \nproperty. Oftentimes, complete strangers are protected by that citizen \nwho steps up and stops the thief or the stalker or the rapist or the \nmurderer from going at that citizen.\n  According to the FBI, criminals used guns in 1998 380,000 times \nacross America. Yet research indicates that peaceful, law-abiding \nAmericans, using their constitutional right, used a gun to prevent 2.5 \nmillion crimes in America that year and nearly every year. In fact, I \nbelieve the benefits of protecting the people's right to keep and bear \narms far outweighs the destruction wrought by criminals and firearms \naccidents. The Centers for Disease Control report 32,000 Americans died \nfrom firearm injuries in 1997; under any estimate, that is a tragedy. \nUnfortunately, the Centers for Disease Control do not keep data on the \nnumber of lives that were saved when guns were used in a defensive \nmanner.\n  Yet if we were to survey the public every year, we would find 400,000 \nAmericans report they used a gun in a way that almost certainly saved \neither their life or someone else's. Is that estimate too high? \nPerhaps. I hope it is, because every time a life is saved from \nviolence, that means that someone was threatening a life with violence. \nBut that number would have to be over 13 times too high for our \nopponents to be correct when they say that guns are used to kill more \noften than they are used to protect. What they have been saying here \nand across America simply isn't true and the facts bear that out.\n  We are not debating the tragedy. We are debating facts at this \nmoment. They cannot come up with 2.5 million gun crimes. But clearly, \nthrough surveys, we can come up with 2.5 million crimes thwarted every \nyear when someone used a gun in defense of themselves or their \nproperty. In many cases, armed citizens not only thwarted crime, but \nthey held the suspect until the authorities arrived and placed that \nperson in custody.\n  Stories of people defending themselves with guns do not make the \nnightly news. It just simply isn't news in America. It isn't hot. It \nisn't exciting. It is American. Sometimes when people act in an \nAmerican way, it simply isn't reportable in our country anymore. So the \nnational news media doesn't follow it.\n\n  Yet two of the school shootings that have brought gun issues to the \nforefront in the last year, in Pearl, MS, and Edinboro, PA, were \nstopped by peaceful gun owners using their weapons to subdue the killer \nuntil the police arrived. How did that get missed in the story? It was \nmentioned once, in passing, and then ignored as people ran to the floor \nof the Senate to talk about the tragedy of the killing. Of course the \nkilling was a tragedy, but it was also heroic that someone used their \nconstitutional right to save lives in the process.\n  A third school shooting in Springfield, OR, was stopped because some \nparents took time to teach their child the wise use of guns. So when \nthat young man heard a particular sound coming from the gun, he was \nable to rush the shooter, because he knew that gun had run out of \nammunition. He was used to guns. He was around them. He subdued the \nshooter and saved potentially many other lives. We have recognized him \nnationally for that heroic act, that young high school student of \nSpringfield, OR.\n  For some reason, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle never \nwant to tell these stories. They only want to say, after a crisis such \nas this, ``Pass a new gun control law and call 9-1-1.'' Yet these \nstories are essential to our understanding of the right of people to \nkeep and bear arms.\n  I will share a few of these stories right now. Shawnra Pence, a 29-\nyear-old mother from Sequim, WA, home alone with one of her children, \nheard an intruder break into the house. She took her .9 mm, took her \nchild to the bedroom, and when the 18-year-old criminal broke into the \nbedroom, she said, ``Get out of my house, I have a gun, get out now.'' \nHe left and the police caught him. She saved her life and her child's \nlife. It made one brief story in the Peninsula Daily news in Sequim, \nWA.\n\n[[Page S4523]]\n\n  We have to talk about these stories because it is time America heard \nthe other side of this debate. There are 2.5 million Americans out \nthere defending themselves and their property by the use of their \nconstitutional right.\n  In Cumberland, TN, a 28-year-old Jason McCulley broke into the home \nof Stanley Horn and his wife, tied up the couple at knife-point, and \ndemanded to know where the couple kept some cash. While Mrs. Horn was \ndirecting the robber, Mr. Horn wriggled free from his restraints, \nretrieved his handgun, shot the intruder, and then called the police. \nThe intruder, Jason McCulley, subsequently died. If some Senators on \nthe other side of the aisle had their way, perhaps the Horns would have \nbeen killed and Jason McCulley would have walked away.\n  Earlier today, we heard the Senator from Illinios and the Senator \nfrom California read the names people killed by guns in America. Some \nday they may read the name Jason McCulley. I doubt they will tell you \nhow he died, however, because it doesn't advance their goal of \ndestroying the Second Amendment. But As Paul Harvey might say: Now you \nknow the rest of the story.\n  Every 13 seconds this story is repeated across America. Every 13 \nseconds in America someone uses a gun to stop a crime. Why do our \nopponents never tell these stories? Why do the enemies of the right to \nkeep and bear arms ignore this reality that is relived by 2.5 million \nAmericans every year? Why is it that all we hear from them is, ``Pass a \nnew gun control law, and, by the way, call 9-1-1.''\n  I encourage all listening today, if you have heard of someone using \ntheir Second Amendment rights to prevent a crime, to save a life, to \nprotect another life, then send us your story. There are people here \nwho desperately need to hear this in Washington, right here on Capitol \nHill. This is a story that should be played out every day in the press \nbut isn't. So let's play it out, right here on the floor of the Senate. \nSend me those stories from your local newspapers about that law-abiding \ncitizen who used his constitutional right of self-defense. Send that \nstory to me, Senator Larry Craig, Washington, DC, 20510, or send it to \nyour own Senator. Let him or her know the rest of the story of \nAmerica's constitutional rights.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to proceed for one more moment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Having said all of this, let there be no mistake. Guns are \nnot for everyone. We restrict children's access to guns and we restrict \ncriminals' access to guns, but we must not tolerate politicians who \ntell us that the Second Amendment only protects the right to hunt. We \nmust not tolerate politicians who infringe upon our right to defend \nourselves from thieves and stalkers and rapists and murderers. And we \nmust not tolerate the politician who simply says: ``Pass another gun \ncontrol law and call 9-1-1.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, with great respect to my colleague from \nIdaho, and I did not come to the floor of the Senate to talk about \nthis, let me say when any of my colleagues stand up and talk about gun \ncontrol issues that the minority wishes to pursue--let me explain in a \nsentence or so what we are trying to do. It is not to restrict the \nopportunity of anyone in this country who has the right to own a gun. \nWe are trying to close the gun show loophole to prevent convicted \nfelons from getting a gun.\n  Go to a gun store to buy a gun in this country and you must run your \nname through an instant check because we do not want convicted felons \nto have weapons. They cannot, by law, possess weapons. Go to a gun \nstore and you have to run your name through an instant check. If it \ncomes up that you are a convicted felon, you do not get the gun. But go \nto a gun show on a Saturday morning as a convicted felon and buy a gun \nand you do not have to have your name checked against anything. Go get \nyour gun at a gun show, if you are a convicted felon and want a weapon. \nWe are trying to close that loophole.\n  Every American should support closing that loophole and should \nsupport it now. That does not affect any law-abiding citizen's right to \nown a gun. All it does is says let's keep guns out of the hands of \nfelons. No one in this Chamber should believe convicted felons ought to \nbe able to go into a gun show and gain access to a weapon they are not \nby law entitled to have.\n  I did not come to the floor to speak about that, but I did want to \nrespond to the pejorative suggestion that people on this side of the \naisle want to injure the rights of law-abiding citizens to possess \nweapons. That is just wrong. We are trying to close a loophole that \nevery American ought to support closing--to keep felons from getting \nguns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4523-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4523-S4524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INTERSTATE PRISONER TRANSFERS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a picture of a man named Kyle \nBell. This brutal criminal killed Jeanna North, an 11-year-old girl \nfrom Fargo, ND.\n  After being convicted and imprisoned, Kyle Bell escaped. How did he \nescape? When North Dakota authorities were going to transport him to a \nprison out of State for safekeeping, a prison in the State of Oregon, \nthey contracted with a private company called TransCor to haul him \nthere. As he was being transported across the country by bus with a \ndozen or more other prisoners, this child killer escaped. While stopped \nat a gas station, two guards with this private company were sleeping; \nanother was apparently buying a cheeseburger. Kyle Bell went out \nthrough the top of the bus and this child killer walked away.\n  When I discovered what had happened, I thought to myself, that cannot \nbe. We are turning child killers over to private companies to be \ntransported across the country? But it is true. Then I discovered the \nrecord of these companies. You can be a retired sheriff and call your \nbrother-in-law and say: Let's buy a mini van and let's go into the \nbusiness of transporting criminals. In fact, in one state, a man and \nhis wife showed up with a little mini van to pick up five convicted \nmurderers. The warden of the penitentiary said: You have to be kidding \nme. They weren't kidding. That is who the State hired to transport \nthese murderers. And of course the murderers escaped in short order.\n  What I have discovered is we have private companies being hired by \nState and local governments to transport violent criminals around the \ncountry, and those companies have no requirement to meet any standards \nat all. That doesn't make any sense.\n  I have introduced a piece of legislation I call Jeanna's Bill that \nsays if any local or State government is going to contract with a \nprivate company to haul a violent criminal, they must meet some basic \nstandards. They must meet some regulations. If you haul toxic waste, \nyou must meet regulations. Haul cattle, you must meet regulations. Haul \ncircus animals, you must meet regulations. But some of our States and \nlocal governments are willing to turn killers over to private companies \nwho have no such standards to meet at all.\n  I received a letter in the last few days from the Governor of Nevada. \nI want to say I pass him my compliments. The Governor of Nevada was \nsending a convicted murderer named James Prestridge to North Dakota for \nsafekeeping under the Prisoners Exchange Agreement. Mr. Prestridge, \nalong with another fellow convicted of armed robbery, was being hauled \nto North Dakota by a company that is called Extraditions International.\n  Mr. Prestridge, this convicted murderer, escaped, as did John Doran, \nan armed robber. Mr. Doran was found just south of the Mexican border \nwith a bullet through his brain, and Mr. Prestridge was recently \napprehended. I wrote to the Governor of Nevada and said: I hope if you \nstill intend to send this convicted murderer to North Dakota you will \ndo it through the U.S. Marshals Service. They will haul violent \noffenders anywhere across this country for a flat fee and they don't \nlose them.\n  I got a letter back from the Governor of Nevada. He said:\n\n\n[[Page S4524]]\n\n\n       In response to your request that Nevada stop using private \n     transport companies, please be advised our prison system has \n     ceased its business relationship with Extraditions \n     International and that all of this State's out of state \n     inmate transfers are now being staffed by our prison system.\n\n  Good for him. He said, incidentally, Mr. Prestridge is now not going \nto be sent to North Dakota. Good for us.\n  But good for him that he changed the policy. In our State, in the \nmost recent days, the company that let this fellow go, the company \nwhose negligence allowed a convicted child killer to walk away and \nevade authorities for some months, settled with the State for $50,000. \nThe State sent them a bill for $102,000 and the company said: We won't \npay it. We'd pay you $50,000. And then the State says this company is a \npretty good company and we will use them again.\n  My State is making a mistake, in my judgment. I would like every \nState to make a decision when they are going to transport violent \ncriminals around this country, do it with law enforcement officials, do \nit with the U.S. Marshals Service. They will do it for a flat fee and \nthen some American family won't have to worry that, when they pull up \nat a gas station, next to them at the pump is a mini van with two \ninexperienced folks hauling three murderers. What is that about, in \nterms of public safety?\n  It seems to me we ought to have enough common sense in this country \nwhen we have convicted someone of killing children, when we have \nconvicted someone of murder or violent crimes, at least we ought not to \nturn them into the arms of someone inexperienced in the private sector, \na company that has to meet no standards at all with which to transport \nthem. That doesn't make any sense to me.\n  So I say to the Governor of Nevada: Good for you. It is the right \ndecision. I would say to our State: Change your mind. Decide this \ncompany should not haul violent offenders in North Dakota and that when \nyou are going to transport a violent offender, the U.S. Marshals \nService ought to be used to do it.\n  I say to every State official across this country: Until we get in \nplace basic standards these companies must meet, you ought not use them \nfor transporting violent offenders. Were I a chief executive of a \nState, I would not use them anyway because I do not think people who \nkill children, as in the case of Kyle Bell, ought to be turned over to \nanyone other than law enforcement authorities to transport them to \nanother place of incarceration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4524-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4524-S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SANCTIONS ON EXPORT OF FOOD AND MEDICINE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to speak about an issue that is of \ngreat importance to my State and to all agricultural producers around \nthe country. That is the issue of the sanctions on food and medicine \nthat now exist in our relationships with some countries around the \nworld.\n  Our country has been in the habit of saying: We don't like certain \ncountries, we don't like the way they behave, so we are going to slap \neconomic sanctions on these countries and we have included sanctions on \nthe shipment of food and medicine. So countries such as Libya, Iran, \nCuba, North Korea, and others, are in a circumstance of having economic \nsanctions enacted against them to punish them, and we have included in \nthose sanctions food and medicine.\n  A group of us are trying to change that. We do not think it is the \nmoral thing to do. What is this country doing, saying to others that we \nwill not allow them to have access to food and medicine? Taking aim at \ndictators and hurting poor people, sick people, and hungry people is \nhardly something about which we ought to be proud. This is not a moral \npolicy.\n  I come from a farm State, so I care about having access to these \nmarkets as well. I admit that. Aside from the market side of this, \nwhich is important--after all, these countries against whom we have \nsanctions on food and medicine represent almost 11 percent of the \nworld's wheat markets, and we have said to our farmers: By the way, 11 \npercent of the world's wheat market is off limits to you. Why? Because \nwe decided we do not like these countries and we are going to make them \npay a price. Part of the price we are going to exact is the ability for \nthem to access food and medicine from the United States.\n  Of course, other countries access it from Canada, Europe, or others. \nWe are the country that decides to withhold food and medicine from \nthese countries.\n  Last year, we had a vote in the Senate on that. Senator Ashcroft, I, \nand many others who pushed to repeal the sanction on food and medicine \nwon with 70 out of 100 votes. We were hijacked by the House of \nRepresentatives in conference. I was one of the conferees. They just \nflat out hijacked us. When it was clear to them we were going to win \nthe issue in conference, they adjourned the conference, never to see \nthem again, and they stripped the provision.\n  I offered the same provision in the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nand it is now in the Agriculture appropriations bill. That is coming to \nthe floor of the Senate. We have 70 Senators who said they think it is \nwrong to continue sanctions on food and medicine. The message in the \nSenate is: Stop using food as a weapon. It is the right message.\n  There are a lot of people in the House of Representatives who \napparently are willing to do that except for Cuba; Cuba is a special \ncase, and they will not withdraw sanctions on food and medicine with \nrespect to Cuba. In fact, that is what derailed it last year.\n  I am one person, but I tell my colleagues that I am not going to \nallow, to the extent I can prevent it, the hijacking of this issue \nagain this year by just two or three people who decide they are going \nto strip this provision and then have the House and Senate deal with \nthe broader appropriations issues that do not include this provision.\n  We have spent a lot of time on this issue. This country is wrong in \napplying sanctions with respect to food and medicine shipments to \ncountries such as Cuba. Yes, Cuba.\n  I was in Cuba last year. I have no truck with the Castro government. \nI think the Cuban government and its economic system have collapsed. \nBut the sanctions that exist with respect to this country's actions \nagainst Cuba have represented Fidel Castro's greatest excuse to the \nCuban people. He says: Of course my economy does not work; of course my \ncountry is in trouble. The United States has had its fist around our \nneck for 40 years.\n\n  It is Fidel Castro's greatest excuse, in my judgment, for an economic \nsystem that has failed Cuba. It does not make sense, in my judgment, \nfor us to exact a penalty on the Cuban people, on poor people, on \nhungry people, and on sick people in Cuba, in North Korea, and \nelsewhere to continue these absurd sanctions on food and medicine.\n  We can have a broader discussion at some other time about whether the \nembargo that exists with Cuba ought to be lifted. That is a different \nsubject, a broader subject. Incidentally, I have strong feelings about \nthat as well. This is a narrower issue: Do we believe it appropriate to \ncontinue sanctions with respect to the shipment of food and medicine to \ncountries such as Cuba, North Korea, Iran, and others? The answer ought \nto be a resounding no.\n  My colleague, Senator Slade Gorton from the State of Washington, is \nin the Chamber. He was a cosponsor of this in the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. He, I, and John Ashcroft have issued a statement that says \nto all within hearing distance that if you think you are going to \nhijack this issue again this year, think again, because we have 70 \nvotes in the Senate that say we ought not use food and medicine as a \nweapon, and we intend to insist this year that we prevail on this \nissue.\n  I cannot speak for anybody else, but the statement we issued is \npretty self-explanatory. I am here to give fair warning to those who \nwant to do what they did last year that it is going to be a pretty \ndifficult proposition if they intend to hijack this issue. We have the \nvotes. Vote on it in the Senate, and it will pass by an overwhelming \nmargin. Allow a vote in the House, and it will pass by an overwhelming \nmargin. The only way those who want to defeat this proposition because \nit contains Cuba--which is an irrational position, for those who think \nthrough this a little bit--the only way they can possibly defeat it is \nto try to use some hijinks in the process to avoid an up-or-down vote.\n  I and others intend to see we have a full opportunity to have votes \nin the\n\n[[Page S4525]]\n\nHouse and the Senate on it. If the House leadership does what it did \nlast year, I say to them: Fair warning, I am going to be here on the \nfloor of the Senate objecting to a whole series of things. We need to \nstraighten this out now. This country, at this time, on this issue, \nsays we will no longer use sanctions with respect to the shipment of \nfood and medicine. It does not work, it is not a moral policy, and it \nought to stop now.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4525-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does the Democratic whip desire to be recognized?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. This amendment was shared beforehand with my colleague \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I don't know of any understanding, but the \nchairman has a right, of course, to offer an amendment. We just \nunderstand that this amendment now is to be temporarily laid aside so \nthe opening statements can be given. The Senator has a right to offer \nan amendment at any time he wishes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is the amendment about which I spoke \non the floor earlier this morning. I think colleagues have had an \nopportunity to inform themselves about it. It is my hope that a number \nwill desire to be cosponsors. We have a number of cosponsors right now.\n  This amendment relates to the continuing work of the Armed Services \nCommittee with regard to the necessity to provide a health care program \nfor retirees over 65. As the Presiding Officer well knows, the \ncommittee has addressed this in several increments, and now with \nanother amendment by the Senator from Virginia, which I offer on behalf \nof many. I want to recognize that this is a subject that has quite \nproperly gained the attention of a number of colleagues. I know Senator \nMcCain, on our side of the aisle, and Senator Hutchison have worked on \nthis subject of health care. In no way do I indicate that anyone--\ncertainly not myself--has been the principal; we have all worked \ntogether as a team.\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\nAnd at such appropriate time, I will return to this amendment.\n  I want to make some opening comments now regarding this very \nimportant piece of legislation. This bill contains the much-needed \nincreases in defense funding and critical initiatives, including in the \narea of recruiting and retention. Retention is one of the most serious \nproblems we have facing us today in our current military, as well as \nrecruiting. This bill, in the collective judgment of the committee, \ngoes a long way toward helping to alleviate the problems we have and to \nimprove those critical areas in our defense.\n\n  It is most appropriate that we begin this discussion today, on June \n6, the 56th anniversary of D-Day. Today, America recalls the heroic \nacts of bravery and valor demonstrated on the beaches of France and the \nmany who paid the price in life and limb for liberty and freedom. And \nhow proud we are, as the Senate, to have as the President pro tempore \nthe distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond, \namong us. He, of course, crossed the beaches of D-Day 56 years ago. He \naddressed the Senate earlier today on that subject.\n  As we look to the future and the defense of this Nation, we must \nnever forget what may be required, and indeed what was required, of so \nmany--over 1,400 American servicemen, not to speak of our allies; they \nhad casualties also. But 1,400 American servicemen died on June 6, \n1944, on the beaches of France, and thousands more were wounded. They \ndid it to restore freedom to so many nations and people all through \nEurope--freedom that had been taken away by Hitler and the Axis forces.\n  I begin by expressing my thanks to the ranking member, Senator Levin. \nWe came to the Senate together 21 years ago. We have worked as partners \non this bill and have produced a bipartisan product that will \nstrengthen the security of the United States, in the collective \njudgment of all members of the Armed Services Committee, and improve \nthe quality of life of our men and women in uniform and, most \nespecially, for their families.\n  I also applaud our subcommittee chairmen, ranking members, and all \nmembers of the Committee for their fine work throughout this year. I \nwill put in the Record elsewhere the volume of hearings, special \nmeetings, the prolonged markup sessions that led to the work product \nfor which we labored in the Senate today.\n  A special thanks to our committee staff. What a superb professional \nstaff--not only this year and last year, but throughout the 22 years I \nhave been privileged to be on this committee. Under many distinguished \nchairmen and ranking members, we have had the most nonpartisan and the \nhardest-working staff in the Senate. I salute Colonel Les Brownlee, \nDavid Lyles, and the personal staff of the committee members for their \ninvaluable work which led to the creation of this bill.\n  I appeal to all Members to join us in our bipartisan effort to \nimprove our security. The safety and well-being of our men and women in \nuniform, thousands of whom are deployed at this very moment in harm's \nway across this world, should not fall victim to any partisan debate \nand certainly no election year politics. We have done that in the past. \nI hope we will not do it on this bill and in the future.\n  We should keep in mind that Members of the Senate have always \nrecognized the importance of the annual Defense authorization bill, and \nin the past we have put our partisan concerns aside for the good of the \nNation. I remind colleagues that the Senate has passed a Defense \nauthorization bill every year since the authorization process began in \n1961, some nearly 40 years. The House this year had a strong, \nresounding vote of 353 yeas to 100-some-odd nays. So that is a clear \nindication of the strength of the House and the Senate bills and the \nneed for these bills to be brought into law.\n  At this time of increased tension around the world, at this time of \nunprecedented deployments of U.S. military personnel around the globe, \nwe must show our support for our troops. Accordingly, I urge all \nMembers to abstain from offering nondefense-related amendments and to \njoin in a bipartisan effort to pass this Defense authorization bill, to \nsend a strong signal of support to our brave troops, wherever they are \nin the world, for risking their lives at the very moment we address \nthis legislation, risking to safeguard freedom of our allies, our \nfriends, and indeed those of us here at home. The problems and the \nthreats facing the home front have increased to where they are greater \ntoday than I ever envisioned in my life.\n  The national security challenges that the United States will face in \nthe new millennium are many and diverse--new adversaries, unknown \nadversaries, new weapons, and unknown weapons. A very complex threat \nfaces us at home and our forces forward deployed. It is important that \nwe remain vigilant, forward thinking, and prepared to address these \nchallenges.\n  Just days ago the National Commission on Terrorism, established by \nCongress in 1998, issued its report, ``Countering the Changing Threat \nof International Terrorism''. I would like to quote from the Report's \nexecutive summary: ``Today's terrorists seek to inflict mass \ncausalities, and they are attempting to do so both overseas and on \nAmerican soil. They are less dependent on state sponsorship and are, \ninstead, forming loose, transnational affiliations based on religious \nor ideological--regrettably I have to use that word, ``a common \nhatred''--affinity and a common hatred of the United States. This makes \nterrorist attacks more difficult to detect and prevent.'' We must be \nprepared to respond to this threat and I look forward to reviewing the \nnumerous recommendations contained within the report which we may \naddress in the course of the deliberations on this bill.\n  While the Department of Defense (DOD) must plan and allocate \nresources to meet future threats, ongoing military operations and \ndeployments from the Balkans to Southwest Asia to East Timor continue \nto demand significant resources in the short term and the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 \nauthorizes a total of $309.8 billion for defense spending--$4.5 billion \nabove the President's request--and provides authority and guidance to \nthe Defense Department to address the critical readiness, \nmodernization, and recruiting and retention problems facing our \nmilitary.\n  For over a decade, our defense budgets have been based on constrained \nfunding, not on the threats facing the nation or the military strategy \nnecessary to meet those threats. The result of this is evident today in \ncontinuing critical problems with recruiting and retention, declining \nreadiness ratings, and aging equipment.\n  Last year, the Congress reversed the downward trend in defense \nspending by approving a defense authorization bill which, for the first \ntime in 14 years, included a real increase in the authorized level of \ndefense spending. This year, we continue that momentum with the bill \nbefore the Senate the second year of increased authorization levels. As \nI stated earlier, the authorized level of $309.8 billion in this bill \nis $4.5 billion above the President's request and consistent with this \nyear's concurrent budget resolution. The fiscal year 2001 funding level \nalso represents a real increase in defense spending of 4.4 percent from \nthe fiscal year 2000 appropriated level.\n  The funding we have provided is primarily going for modernization and \nreadiness and for other benefits for the men and women of the military. \nThe committee authorized $63.28 billion in procurement funding, a $3.0 \nbillion increase over the President's budget. Operations and \nmaintenance was funded at $109.2 billion, with $1.5 billion added to \nthe primary readiness accounts. Research, development, test and \nevaluation was budgeted at $39.31 billion, a $1.45 billion increase \nover the President's budget request.\n  The committee's support for additional funding for defense is based \non an in-depth analysis of the threats facing U.S. interests, and \ntestimony from senior military leaders on the many shortfalls in the \ndefense budget.\n  While the cold war has been over for nearly a decade, it is evident \nthat the world remains a complex and violent place. The greatest threat \nto our national security today is instability; instability fueled by \nethnic, religious, and racial animosities that have existed for \ncenturies, but are now resulting in conflicts fought with the weapons \nof modern warfare. Many have turned to the United States, as the sole \nremaining superpower, to resolve the\n\n[[Page S4527]]\n\nmany conflicts around the world and to ensure stability in the future. \nHowever, this military power does not ensure our security. As \nDirector of Central Intelligence George Tenet told the committee in \nJanuary, ``The fact that we are arguably the world's most powerful \nnation does not bestow invulnerability; in fact, it may make us a \nlarger target for those who don't share our interest, values, or \nbeliefs.''\n\n  U.S. military forces are involved in overseas deployments at an \nunprecedented rate. Currently, our troops are involved in over 10 \ncontingency operations around the globe. Unfortunately, there appears \nto be no relief in sight for most of these operations. At an October \n1999 hearing of the committee, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, General Hugh Shelton, stated that, ``Two factors that erode \nmilitary readiness are the pace of operations and funding shortfalls. \nThere is no doubt that the force is much smaller than it was a decade \nago, and also much busier.''\n  Over the past decade, our active duty manpower has been reduced by \nnearly a third, active Army divisions have been reduced by almost 50 \npercent, and the number of Navy ships has been reduced from 567 to 316. \nDuring this same period, our troops have been involved in 50 military \noperations worldwide. By comparison, from the end of the Vietnam war in \n1975 until 1989, U.S. military forces were engaged in only 20 such \nmilitary deployments.\n  This unprecedented rate of overseas deployments is one of the primary \nfactors contributing to the severe problems we are having with \nrecruiting and retaining quality personnel, and with maintaining \nadequate readiness of the existing force. We have tried to address \nthese issues in the bill before the Senate.\n  It has also affected our readiness, as the Presiding Officer well \nknows as chairman of the subcommittee with the primary jurisdiction of \nreadiness.\n  I want to pause for a moment and acknowledge the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff and the Service Chiefs--the Chief of Naval \nOperations, the Air Force Chief of Staff, the Army Chief of Staff, and \nthe Commandant of the Marine Corps--for their role in helping to \nreverse the decline in defense spending. I cannot think of one single \nfactor that added greater emphasis not only this year but last year to \nthe increase in defense spending--not one fact greater than their \nhonest, forthright professional and personal assessments which were \ngiven this committee time and time in formalized hearings, and indeed \nin private consultations. I commend them. They have ably represented \ntheir troops.\n  There is no group of leaders more responsible for stopping this \ndownward trend than the Chiefs.\n  On three separate occasions, October 6, 1998, January 5, 1999, and \nOctober 26, 1999, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \nthe Service Chiefs came before the Armed Services Committee to tell us \nabout the ever increasing challenges the armed forces were facing in \ncarrying out their military missions. Simply put, they did not have \nenough money. Their individual observations were forthright and candid. \nCollectively, their reports to the Congress became the unimpeachable \nvoice that made Americans sit up and take notice. The chiefs were heard \nacross the land. Our nation echoed back: we believe you, you have the \npeople's support.\n\n  The military service chiefs have testified that they have a remaining \nshortfall in funding of $9.0 billion for fiscal year 2000, a \nrequirement for an additional $15.5 billion above the budget request to \nmeet shortfalls in readiness and modernization for fiscal year 2001, \nand a requirement for an additional $85.0 billion in the future years \nDefense Program.\n  This bill adds $3.8 billion to the President's budget request to \nspecifically pay for items identified by the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff and the Service chiefs as necessary requirements: \nnecessary requirements that were not funded by the President's request.\n  As I said earlier, the high operations tempo of our armed forces is \nhaving a negative impact on recruiting and retention. Last year, the \ncommittee took action to provide a pay raise and a package of \nretirement reforms and retention incentives in an effort to recruit and \nretain highly qualified personnel. The committee has received testimony \nthat these changes are having a positive impact on recruiting and \nretention efforts.\n  This year, the committee has focused its ``quality of life'' efforts \non improving military health care for our active duty and retired \npersonnel and their families.\n  Earlier this year, I announced my intention to join with the majority \nleader and others to tackle the long-standing problems with the \nmilitary health care system.\n  I wish to acknowledge the full cooperation of my distinguished \ncolleague, Mr. Levin, and the Members on his side of the aisle. It has \ntruly been a bipartisan effort. We have heard increasing complaints, \nespecially from over 56 retirement communities.\n  While the Congress was taking some steps in the past to try to \nimprove the health care system, it was time for a major assault on this \nproblem. And we have done more than establish a beachhead. I used that \nterm months ago when I laid down the first piece of legislation with \nour distinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott.\n  The bill before the Senate today is but the first step, I hope, in \nwhat will be a continuing process to fulfill our commitment of quality \nhealth care for all military personnel--active duty, retired, as well \nas their families.\n  The Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the \nservice chiefs have all highlighted the many problems associated with \nimplementing a user-friendly health care program for active duty \nservice members, military retirees, and their families.\n  In this bill, the committee included initiatives that ensure our \nactive duty personnel and their families receive quality health care \nand initiatives that fulfill our commitment to military retirees, \nincluding extending TriCare Prime to families of service members \nassigned to remote locations, eliminating copayments for service \nreceived under the TriCare Prime, and authorizing a comprehensive \nretail and national mail order pharmacy benefit for all eligible \nbeneficiaries, including Medicare-eligible beneficiaries with no \nenrollment fee or deductible.\n  I will elaborate on the pharmacy benefit. Prescription medication is \nthe major unmet need of the military retiree. I believe this bill meets \nthat need. This bill for the first time provides an entitlement for a \ncomprehensive drug benefit for all military beneficiaries, including \nthose who are Medicare eligible.\n  Hopefully, I will add my amendment which will further enhance this \nwhole package of retiree benefits, particularly for those over 65. At \nthe appropriate time, I will ask to turn to that amendment.\n  Other quality-of-life initiatives of note in this bill are a 3.7-\npercent pay raise for military personnel effective January 1, 2001, and \na provision that directs the Department to implement the Thrift Savings \nPlan for military personnel not later than 180 days after enactment of \nthis act. We put similar provisions in last year's bill but gave the \ndiscretion to the Department. This year, we have been forthright and we \ndirect action on that program.\n\n  Last year, NATO conducted its first large-scale offensive military \noperation with the 78-day air war campaign--and it was associated with \nother military operations and was not exclusive to air--on behalf of \nthe beleaguered and persecuted peoples of Kosovo. The lessons learned \nfrom that operation addressed during a series of committee hearings \nhighlighted not only shortfalls in weapon systems and intelligence \nprograms but also the complexities of engaging in coalition operations.\n  As noted in the combined testimony of Operation Allied Force \nCommanders, Gen. Wesley Clark, Adm. James Ellis, and Lt. Gen. Mike \nShort, the Kosovo campaign:\n\n       . . . required [that] we adopt military doctrine and \n     strategy to strike a balance between maintaining allied \n     cohesion, striking key elements of the Yugoslav Armed Forces, \n     minimizing losses of allied aircraft and crew, and containing \n     collateral damage.\n\n  Of paramount concern to the committee this year was applying the \nlessons learned from the air campaign over Kosovo to our defense budget \nto ensure the future preparedness of the\n\n[[Page S4528]]\n\nU.S. Armed Forces for future military operations. Accordingly, the \ncommittee included over $700 million for a program to include aircraft \nprecision strike capability, aircraft survivability, and intelligence \nsurveillance and reconnaissance assets based on lessons learned from \nthe Kosovo conflict.\n  Over 38,000 combat sorties were conducted during the Kosovo air \ncampaign--and I proudly say, for all nations that participated, some \nseven nations flew--with no combat casualties and some heroic rescue \noperations. While the committee understands that no military operation \nis without risk, limiting the risk to military personnel is an \nimportant goal. Every day, advances in technology such as computing and \ntelecommunications are being integrated into warfighting equipment.\n  The committee believes the Defense Department must further pursue \nthese technological advances in an effort to provide advanced \nwarfighting capabilities, while at the same time limiting the risk to \nmilitary personnel. To this end, this legislation directs the DOD to \naggressively develop and field unmanned combat systems in the air and \non the ground so that within 10 years one-third of our operation of \nthese type aircraft would be unmanned, and within 15 years one-third of \nour ground combat vehicles would be unmanned. The committee also added \n$246.3 million to accelerate technologies leading to the development \nand fielding of remotely controlled air combat vehicles and remotely \ncontrolled ground combat vehicles.\n  As demonstrated in Kosovo, our Armed Forces are the best prepared in \nthe world. They can beat the enemy on any battlefield. I don't say that \nwith arrogance. It is factual. Our enemies, certainly those that can be \nidentified, know that. It is the ones that we can't identify--the \ngrowing number we cannot identify, that we cannot anticipate--that pose \nthe greatest threat. Current and future potential adversaries must \nfully understand, however, our military capability. Many are now intent \non carrying the battle right here at home in the continental limits of \nthe United States of America either by ballistic missile attack or \nattacks with chemical or biological agents or through cyberterrorism. \nThat is where we are soft, soft in the underbelly of this great Nation. \nRecently, retired Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre characterized \ndomestic preparedness as ``the mission of the decade.'' I agree with \nthat distinguished former public servant.\n\n  The military services play a critical and important role in domestic \npreparedness for such attacks. Should some madman or terrorist release \na chemical biological agent on the civilian population at home--or, \nindeed, at a military base that could be a target--the Defense \nDepartment must be prepared to assist the first responders, whether \nthey are volunteer firemen, the police officers, or even citizens who \ninstinctively try to come to the aid of those suffering, along with the \nhealth care professionals in our local communities. To deter and defeat \nthe efforts of those intent on using weapons of mass destruction or \nmass disruption in the United States, this bill does the following:\n  It adds $76.8 million for initiatives to address the threat of \ncyberattack, including establishment of an Information Security \nScholarship Program to encourage recruitment and retention of \nDepartment of Defense personnel with computer network security skills. \nThis is a program in which I have had a great deal of interest. I do \nhope the Members will work with me on this. We have this massive people \nprogram, maybe $20 or $30 million just to begin to give incentives for \nyoung people to go into cyberspace terrorism. What better evidence do \nwe need than this love note that floated around, causing billions of \ndollars of loss to the economy in this country for the shutdown of \ncomputers.\n  Second, there is the creation of an institute for defense computer \nsecurity and information protection to conduct research and critical \ntechnology development and to facilitate the exchange of information \nbetween the government and the private sector, and sharing of \ninformation to try and meet this common threat.\n  Further, we added $418 million for ballistic missile defense \nprograms, including $129 million for National Missile Defense Risk \nReduction, $92.4 million for the Air Forces Airborne Laser Program, $60 \nmillion for the Navy Theater-Wide Missile Defense Program, $15 million \nfor the Atmospheric Interceptor Technology Program, $8 million for the \nArrow System Improvement Program, $15 million for the Tactical High \nEnergy Laser Program, and $30 million for the Space-Based Laser \nProgram.\n  This is a serious threat to our homeland, the intercontinental \nballistic missiles. We are forging ahead. I wish we could be stronger \nin our efforts.\n  I will, with others, try everlastingly to increase our strength to \ntry to approach these things and solve these problems--because we are \ndefenseless. Americans think we spent $300.9 billion this year and $300 \nbillion previous years and that we have some defense. We do not. We are \nabsolutely defenseless against these intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles, particularly the ones that might be fired by a rogue state or \nterrorist state or, indeed, an accidental firing. It could decimate any \nof our great cities or, indeed, rural areas.\n  (Mr. HAGEL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Last, we added $25 million for five additional Weapons of \nMass Destruction-Civil Support teams formerly known as RAID teams. This \nwill result in a total of 32 of these teams by the end of fiscal year \n2001. It is the committee's intent to support the establishment of \nthese teams for each State and territory. I commend this committee, \nparticularly the subcommittee that handles this under Senator Roberts, \nfor their relentless initiative to drive and get these teams in place. \nThe Department of Defense has not been as aggressive as has the Senate \non this issue.\n  I would like to briefly highlight some of the other major funding \ninitiatives and provisions of the bill.\n  First, we strengthen the Joint Strike Fighter Program by \nsignificantly increasing funding for the demonstration and validation \nphase of this program while removing funding for the engineering, \nmanufacture, and development phase in the fiscal year 2001.\n  It increases the shipbuilding budget by $603.2 million to over $12 \nbillion. I commend the chairman and ranking member of that committee, \nthe Senator from Maine. This is a very essential investment, an \nincrease in spending, if we are ever to hope to maintain just a 300-\nship Navy.\n  It authorizes $98.2 million for military space programs and \ntechnologies, $22 million for strategic nuclear delivery vehicle \nmodernization, and $190 million for national and military intelligence \nprograms.\n  We support the Army transformation initiative and we add additional \nresources that support research and development efforts designed to \nlead to the future development of that force.\n  Congress has to help the Army. They have some very bold initiatives, \nbut the funding profile for these initiatives in the outyears has a \ndegree of uncertainty which troubles this Senator. But we will try to \ndo our best to work with the distinguished Chief of Staff, the \nSecretary, and others, in trying to move the Army along in its \nprojected transformation program.\n  We included provisions supporting, under certain conditions, the \nagreement reached between the Department of Defense and the government \nof Puerto Rico that is intended to restore relations between the people \nof Vieques and the Navy and provide for the continuation of live fire \ntraining on this island. I commend the former Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Oklahoma, for his unrelenting efforts, many visits down to \nthat region to work on this problem.\n  We increased funding for military construction and family housing \nprograms by $430 million to $8.46 billion.\n  We authorized $1.27 billion for the environmental restoration \naccounts to enhance environmental cleanup of military facilities.\n  We required the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Energy, to:\n  No. 1, develop long-range plans for the sustainment and modernization \nfor U.S. strategic nuclear forces and;\n  No. 2, to conduct a comprehensive review of the nuclear posture of \nthe United States for the next 5 to 10 years.\n  That is an essential program. We must get that evaluation. We have \nnot\n\n[[Page S4529]]\n\ndone one since 1994. This was of great concern to me. While I commend \nthe President--he did the best he could at the recent summit--it would \nhave been advisable if this Nation had conducted one of these essential \nprograms to make an analysis of the threat--what we have in our \ninventory, the inventories of the other nations of the world--and, \ntherefore, have a better idea of exactly where this country stands \ntoday and what it faces in the future.\n  These are but a few of the highlights of the many initiatives \nincluded in this bill. The subcommittee chairmen are truly the \narchitects of this bill. They will discuss in greater detail the \nprovisions in their respective subcommittees. Each should be \ncongratulated for their study and hard work, together with their \nranking members.\n  I urge my colleagues to support rapid passage of this bill. We need \nto send a strong signal of support to our Armed Forces in the field, at \nsea, and those who have gone before them in the line of duty. We are \ntrustees of this great Nation and we are given that trust by generation \nafter generation after generation of Americans who have gone from the \nshores of our Nation to defend the cause of freedom in farflung places \nof the world. These are outstanding men and women now serving in \nuniform. We have an obligation to them as previous Congresses have had \nobligations to other generations, engaged in the preserving of our \nfreedom.\n  I, once again, thank my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Michigan, for his work on this committee--indeed, nonpartisan hard \nwork--and the wonderful staff. We put this bill together.\n  I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee in bringing the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 2001 to the floor. The bill is the \nproduct of several months of bipartisan work on the part of our \ncommittee. I am, indeed, pleased to join with him in bringing this bill \nto the floor.\n  This year the President added $12 billion in defense spending to last \nyear's appropriated levels. The congressional budget resolution added \nan additional $4.5 billion. For the most part, the committee chose to \nspend the money wisely. More than three-quarters of the money added by \nthe budget resolution would be used to meet needs that are identified \nas priorities by the Joint Chiefs, or to accelerate items that are \nincluded in the future years' defense plan.\n  I may not agree with every provision in the bill--I do not--but S. \n2549 overall is a sound bill that basically continues the bipartisan \npartnership between the Congress and the administration. This bill \nwould build on the budget that was presented by the Department of \nDefense to improve the quality of life for the men and women of our \nArmed Forces and their families, and to transform our military to \nensure they are capable of meeting the threats to American security in \nthe 21st century.\n  I am particularly pleased the bill would implement the \nadministration's proposal to address shortcomings in the health care we \nprovide for our military personnel and retirees. Indeed, the bill would \ngo a step further than the administration proposed and provide a \nprescription drug benefit for military retirees.\n\n  I am appalled, and I hope most of us are appalled, by the rising cost \nof pharmaceuticals in this country and by the growing gap between the \nprices paid for drugs by our citizens and people who live in other \ncountries. We have taken an important first step in this bill in \nagreeing to address the problem for military retirees. But it is my \nhope, perhaps during the course of this bill, and surely before the end \nof this Congress, we will be able to provide a similar benefit for \nMedicare beneficiaries whether they are military retirees or otherwise. \nAll of our seniors--all of our seniors--should have an opportunity to \npurchase prescription drugs and not be precluded by an inability to pay \nthe outrageous costs which prescription drugs now present to too many \nof our seniors.\n  The committee also made the right decision in supporting the Army \ntransformation plan that was put forward by Secretary of the Army \nCaldera, and Army Chief of Staff General Shinseki. The committee \nconcluded the Army needs to transform itself into a lighter, more \nlethal, survivable and tactically mobile force, and we approved all the \nfunds that were requested by the Army for that purpose. In fact, we \neven added some research money that the Army said would help the long-\nterm transformation process.\n  At the same time, we have instructed the Army to prepare a detailed \nroadmap for the transformation initiative, and to conduct appropriate \ntesting and experimentation to ensure the transformation effort is \nsuccessful.\n  The Department has made a strong commitment to the Joint Strike \nFighter Program and the committee supports that effort. While our bill \nrecognizes that slippage in the test schedule is virtually certain to \nresult in a delay of the next milestone decision, we remain open to \nreprogramming of funds to enable the Department to make that decision \nin the year 2001, if it proves possible to meet a tighter schedule.\n  I am also pleased the bill reported by the Armed Services Committee \nprovides full funding for the Department of Defense Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program and the three ongoing Department of Energy \ncooperative programs with Russia and other countries of the former \nSoviet Union. These programs serve as one of the cornerstones of our \nrelationship with Russia and play an important role in our national \nsecurity by reducing the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction from Russia or from rogue nations with which Russia may \notherwise be tempted to form closer ties in the absence of these \nprograms.\n  While some restrictive language has been included in the bill, I am \nhopeful this language will not undermine the effectiveness of the \nprograms. I am disappointed the committee chose not to provide $100 \nmillion for a new, long-term Russian nonproliferation program at the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  This program would allow the Department of Energy to accelerate the \nclosure of portions of Russian nuclear weapons complexes and secure \nadditional nuclear materials. I am hopeful, with the help of other \nSenators, we can address this issue in the course of our debate on the \nSenate floor or perhaps in conference.\n  The committee bill would authorize $85 million of military \nconstruction sought in fiscal year 2001 by the administration to begin \nconstruction of a national missile defense site. The President's budget \nexplains this request as follows:\n\n       The budget includes sufficient funding so that if the \n     administration decides in 2000 to proceed with deployment of \n     a limited system, the resources will be available to quickly \n     proceed toward a 2005 initial capability.\n\n  I emphasize the word ``if.'' It is my understanding that this funding \nis provided consistent with the President's request in the event the \nPresident decides to proceed with the deployment of a limited national \nmissile defense. As indicated in the President's budget, this decision \nwill be based on an assessment of four factors: one, the assessment of \nthe threat; two, the status of technology based on an initial series of \nflight tests and the proposed system's operational effectiveness; \nthree, the cost of the system; and four, the implications of going \nforward with a national missile defense deployment in terms of the \noverall strategic environment and our arms control objectives, \nincluding efforts to achieve further reductions in strategic nuclear \narms under START II and III.\n  As our chairman said, the committee spent a great deal of time \naddressing the status of training exercises by Navy and Marine Corps \npersonnel on the island of Vieques. As we all know, training on Vieques \nwas suspended last year after the tragic death of a security guard at \nthe training range. The Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval \nOperations, and others have testified before the committee that there \nis no adequate substitute for the live-fire training on the island of \nVieques.\n  Earlier this year, the President entered into an agreement with the \nGovernor of Puerto Rico which establishes an orderly process for what \nwe all hope will be the resumption of such training. As of today, the \nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico has lived up to its obligations under the \nagreement. The Navy\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\ntraining on Vieques has been cleared of protesters with the assistance \nof the government of Puerto Rico, and the Navy training exercises have \nnow resumed on the island with the use of inert ordnance as provided in \nthe agreement.\n  During the course of our markup, the committee considered proposed \nlegislation which would have been inconsistent with this agreement. In \nmy view, unilateral changes to or actions in violation of the terms of \nthe agreement at a time when the government of Puerto Rico is living up \nto its obligations under the agreement would have sent exactly the \nwrong signal. Such changes would have offended many citizens of Vieques \nand others throughout Puerto Rico, undermining the efforts of the Navy \nand this committee to eventually resume live-fire training on Vieques.\n  In the end, the committee included legislation that would implement \nthe provisions of the agreement that call for limited economic \nassistance and holding a referendum on the island of Vieques. With \nregard to the other element of the agreement--the transfer of specific \nland to Puerto Rico under certain circumstances--the legislation is \nsilent, deferring congressional action until a later date.\n\n  While I would have preferred to fully implement the agreement between \nthe President and the Governor of Puerto Rico at this time, avoiding \nunilateral changes to the terms of the agreement was the next best \noutcome. In light of the position taken on the floor of the House, I \nexpect we will have an opportunity to further consider this issue in \nconference.\n  One area where I am very disappointed with the outcome of the markup \nis the organization of the Department of Energy. Last year, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act contained provisions reorganizing \nthe Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex by creating a new \n``semi-autonomous'' National Nuclear Security Administration, NNSA, \nwithin the Department of Energy. These provisions, which were added in \nconference, were inconsistent with legislation passed in the Senate by \na vote of 96-1 and went far beyond anything that was even considered by \nthe House.\n  The Secretary of Energy dual-hatted a number of key NNSA employees, \nauthorizing them to serve concurrently in both NNSA positions and DOE \npositions outside the NNSA. Although the provisions establishing the \nNNSA did not contain any provision prohibiting dual-hatting, many \nmembers of our committee believed this approach was inconsistent with \nthe legislation.\n  This bill responds to that perceived violation of the statute with \nprovisions that would, one, prohibit the Department of Energy from \npaying any NNSA officials who are dual-hatted and, two, prohibit the \nSecretary of Energy from changing the organization of the NNSA in any \nway. These are unprecedented restrictions on the ability of a Cabinet \nSecretary to manage his own Department and undermine our ability to \nhold Secretary Richardson and his successors accountable for the \nactivities of the Department of Energy.\n  Dual-hatting is commonplace throughout the Government and has been \nlegally permissible since we repealed the Dual Office Holding Act of \n1894 more than 35 years ago. Moreover, the Secretary provided our \ncommittee with a legal opinion which concluded that such dual-hatting \nis permissible.\n  In any case, the prohibition on reorganization is completely \nunnecessary in light of the express prohibition on dual-hatting. The \nreorganization prohibition would go far beyond its stated purpose of \naddressing dual-hatting, and it would prohibit the Secretary of Energy \nfrom even establishing, altering, or consolidating any organizational \nunit, component, or function of the NNSA regardless of demands of \nefficiency or accountability.\n  Last year, the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board \nreported that the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex had \nbecome organizationally ``dysfunctional.'' Much of this organization \nremains unchanged despite its transfer to the new NNSA. Yet the \nprovision added in our committee would prohibit the Secretary from \naddressing that problem.\n  In short, the Department of Energy organization provisions not only \nfail to address the problems identified by its sponsors, which is the \ndual-hatting problem, but go way beyond that and thereby undermine the \nability of the Secretary of Energy to address many of the concerns that \nled to the enactment of last year's legislation in the first place.\n  I am also disappointed that the bill does not contain a base closure \nprovision. Last year, as this year, the top military and civilian \nleadership of the Department of Defense came to us and told us that \nmore base closures are critical to saving billions of dollars needed to \nmeet our future national security needs. Year after year, some Members \nexpress concerns about shortfalls in the defense budget and then reject \nthe one measure that would do the most to help the Department address \nthose shortfalls in the long term.\n\n  Secretary Cohen said recently his biggest disappointment as Secretary \nhas been that the Department of Defense still has too much overhead and \nthat he has not been able to persuade his former colleagues--meaning \nus--that they are going to have to have more base closures. Authorizing \na new round of base closures is an issue of political will to meet our \nlong-term security needs. In the course of our debate on this bill, \nSenator McCain and I plan to again offer an amendment to allow more \nbase closures.\n  Finally, I will mention two other issues. First, the bill contains a \nprovision that would replace the School of the Americas with a new \nWestern Hemisphere Institute for Professional Education and Training \nwhich would provide a broad curriculum of studies, including human \nrights training, to both military and civilian leaders of democratic \ncountries. I hope this step will allow us to put the controversial \nhistory of this institution behind us while we look instead to the \nfuture.\n  Second, the bill contains an amendment I offered to prohibit the \nDepartment of Defense from selling to the general public any armor-\npiercing ammunition or armor-piercing components that may have been \ndeclared excess to the Department's needs.\n  This prohibition was enacted on a 1-year basis in last year's Defense \nAppropriations Act, and Senator Durbin has introduced a bill in the \nSenate to make the ban permanent. There is no possible justification \nfor selling armor-piercing ammunition to the general public. I am \npleased that we have taken this step toward enacting the ban into \npermanent law.\n  Again, I thank Senator Warner for his work as chairman of the \ncommittee. There are a lot of provisions in the bill, and there will \nbe, I am sure, a lot of amendments which will be offered in the course \nof our deliberations on the Senate floor. I think we all look forward \nto a full debate on all of the issues that will be presented to us.\n  I am wondering if Senator Warner is on the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I make a parliamentary inquiry as to whether or not \namendment No. 3173, which is the pending amendment, is subject to a \npoint of order and, if so, what point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment that the Senator \ninquires on violates section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This amendment was presented to us this morning. I think \nwe should make an effort to see if we can't bring this amendment \nsomehow or other into compliance with the Budget Act so we can \naccomplish the important provisions that are in this amendment. This is \na goal which has been sought on a bipartisan basis to try to improve \nthe provision of health care services to our retirees.\n  I think it is in all of our interests to see if we can't find a way \nthat we can make this come into compliance with the Budget Act. I am \nparticularly sensitive to the Budget Act's provisions. I am not sure \nSenator Domenici is with us today. I believe he was absent during the \npicture, for reasons with which we are familiar. In that case, I am \nwondering whether or not, because of the Budget Act implications of \nthis amendment, the Senator might be willing to set this aside so we \ncan determine if there are ways of achieving these important goals \nconsistent with the Budget Act.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, I will try to \naccommodate you on that because it is a very important amendment. I \nwould like to\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\ndiscuss with you just perhaps the following procedure: That we have the \nopportunity to have a colloquy and make some presentations about the \namendment, and then at that time I will consider laying it aside. I \nwould like to have that opportunity this afternoon. I would very much \nappreciate the comments of my colleague.\n  It had been my intention to give it to you a little earlier today, \nbut I think it began to get to your people around 11 or 12 o'clock. It \nhad been my intention to bring it up. That is not a fact in any way I \nwish to conceal. But anyway, that did not come to the attention of the \nSenator from Michigan.\n  So, yes, we will work on this because in fairness to our colleagues--\nand I anticipate an overwhelming majority of the Senate would like to \nsupport the objectives of this amendment--we should address what could \nbe done to the amendment.\n  I acknowledge that a point of order does lie, and at the appropriate \ntime I would ask for the waiver. Yes. The answer is, we will see what \nwe can do. So I suggest as follows, that we allow other colleagues--the \nPresident pro tempore, a member of our committee, the former chairman \nwishes to address the bill, and the Senator from Colorado wishes to \naddress the bill. There may be others.\n  So let us have some brief opening statements by our two colleagues, \nand I will adjust the procedure at the request of the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That procedure would be fine. I welcome hearing from our \ngood friends, including our former chairman, and then perhaps we will \nlay this aside so we can try to make it in compliance, if possible, \nwith the Budget Act. I welcome the comments of the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the Senate begins consideration of \nthe national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001, I join my \ncolleagues on the Armed Services Committee in congratulating Chairman \nWarner and the ranking member, Senator Levin, on their leadership in \npreparing a strong bipartisan defense bill, which passed the Committee \nby an overwhelming 19-1 vote.\n  The national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001 ensures \nthat our Armed Forces can continue to carry out their global \nresponsibilities by focusing on readiness, future national security \nthreats, and quality of life. I am especially pleased with the focus on \nthe quality of life issues. Our military personnel and their families \nare expected to make great sacrifices and they deserve adequate \ncompensation. Therefore, I strongly support the 3.7 percent pay raise, \nthe significant improvements in military health care, especially those \nimpacting our military retirees and their families. These are critical \nprovisions, which when coupled with the additional family housing and \nbarracks construction, will result in a well-earned improvement in the \nstandard of living for all our military personnel.\n  The defense bill before us continues the improvements in the \nreadiness issues identified by our Service Chiefs. The committee added \nover $700 million for programs identified as shortfalls during the \nKosovo conflict. It increased key readiness programs such as \nammunition, spare parts, base operations and training by more than $1.5 \nbillion. Although these are significant improvements, we cannot be \nsatisfied with these increases and must ensure continued robust funding \nincreases for these programs in future bills.\n  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall our Nation has faced ever changing \nthreats. Among these are the spread of nuclear weapons and other \nweapons of mass destruction, international terrorism, and the ever \nincreasing sophistication of weapons in the hands of countries \nthroughout the world. To counter these threats the committee added \n$78.8 million in the Emerging Threats Subcommittee accounts. These \nresources will fund critical research into new technology, while at the \nsame time provide for the reduction and security of the nuclear and \nchemical arsenals of the former Soviet Union. It is money wisely spent \nand deserves our full support.\n  I have previously congratulated the chairman and ranking member for \ntheir work on this bill. Before closing, I want to congratulate each of \nthe subcommittee chairmen--Senator Inhofe, Senator Snowe, Senator \nSantorum, Senator Roberts, Senator Allard and Senator Hutchinson--and \ntheir ranking members for their contribution to this bill. Their \nleadership and work provided the foundation for this legislation. \nFinally, I believe it is important that we recognize Les Brownlee and \nDavid Lyles for their leadership of a very professional and bipartisan \nstaff.\n  This national defense authorization bill is a strong and sound bill. \nI intend to support it and urge my colleagues to join me in showing our \nstrong support for the bill and our men and women in uniform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Warner for allowing me \nthe opportunity to speak in strong support of this essential bill for \nour men and women in the armed services. I believe it to be very \nfitting that we bring up S. 2549, the fiscal year 2001 Department of \nDefense Authorization Act, only 9 days after Memorial Day.\n  This bill should always be more than just a funding mechanism for \ntoday's military but a fitting tribute and to show our appreciation for \nthose who served, are serving, and will serve in the future.\n  The Defense bill is entirely too important to be mired in politics. \nWe must respect our military and provide them the best Defense \nauthorization bill we can.\n  The fiscal year 2001 Defense Authorization Act is a bipartisan \neffort, and I believe we all did some essential heavy lifting in \ncommittee for our warfighters.\n  For the second year in a row, we have reversed the downward trend in \ndefense spending by increasing this year's funding by $4.5 billion over \nthe President's request, for a funding level of $309.8 billion. This \nresults in a 4.4 percent increase in real growth from last year's \nappropriated level.\n  Last year as the Personnel Subcommittee chairman, I had the \nopportunity to oversee the first major pay raise for our military in \nalmost 20 years. Now, I have the great privilege to serve as the \nchairman of the Strategic Subcommittee. While it is a tall order to \nfill the shoes of Senator Bob Smith as subcommittee chair, I believe \nthe subcommittee has had a very successful and productive session. Just \nlike last year with Senator Cleland, it is always rewarding to have a \ndedicated ranking member like Senator Landrieu. I want to thank her, as \nwell as all the members of the subcommittee, for all the hard work they \nput into this bill.\n  The Strategic Subcommittee has oversight and program authority over \nthe following areas: (1) ballistic and cruise missile defense; (2) \nnational security space; (3) strategic nuclear delivery systems; (4) \nmilitary intelligence; and (5) Department of energy (DOE) activities \nregarding the nuclear weapons stockpile, nuclear waste cleanup, and \nother defense activities.\n  During the last year, the subcommittee held four hearings.\n  The first was on our national and theater missile defense programs \nwhich showed that the DOD continues to have a funding-constrained \nballistic missile defense (BMD) program. In this year's budget, the \nadministration finally increased the funding for the National Missile \nDefense (NMD) program, but we found that all of the Ballistic Missile \nDefense Organization's or BMDO's major acquisition programs remain \nunderfunded. Plus, we were very concerned about the lack of funding for \nthe research and development technology programs. That is why in this \nbill we recommend substantial increases in funding for ballistic \nmissile defense programs and technologies.\n  We also had a hearing regarding our national security space issues \nwhere we identified a number of areas in which budget constraints have \ncaused DOD to insufficiently fund key space programs and technologies \nand technology development. We also learned from our extensive post-\nKosovo conflict hearings that intelligence processing and dissemination \nwas insufficient to meet some of our warfighting requirements. That is \nwhy we recommended funding increases for the National Imagery and \nMapping Agency to improve the imagery tasking, processing, exploitation \nand dissemination process.\n\n[[Page S4532]]\n\n  The Strategic Subcommittee also has oversight over two-thirds of the \nDepartment of Energy's budget, including the newly created and much \nneeded National Nuclear Security Administration or the NNSA. The \nsubcommittee also authorized funds for the Defense Nuclear Facility \nSafety Board, an independent agency responsible for external oversight \nof safety at DOE defense nuclear facilities.\n\n  We held the first congressional hearing to assess the programs of the \nnewly established National Nuclear Security Administration or the NNSA. \nWe remain concerned about the science-based stockpile stewardship \nprogram and the fact that it could be 15 years before the DOE stockpile \nstewardship program can be evaluated as an acceptable substitute for \nunderground nuclear testing. We are also concerned about the slow pace \nin re-establishing pit manufacturing and tritium production \ncapabilities and any long-term requirements or plans for modernization \nof its aging weapon production plans.\n  The fourth hearing was in the area of environmental management. I am \nencouraged that DOE continues to make progress in focusing its \nresources on closure of a limited number of sites and facilities. \nHowever, just like in the area of space and missile defense, I am very \nconcerned that funding requests for science and technology development \ncontinues to drop. DOE needs a vigorous research and development \nprogram in order to meet its accelerated cleanup and closure goals.\n  In response to these needs, the Strategic Subcommittee has a net \nbudget authority increase of $266.7 million above the President's \nbudget. This includes an increase of $530.3 million to the DOD account \nand a decrease of $263.6 million to DOE accounts.\n  In the DOD accounts, there is a net increase of $418.6 billion for \nthe Ballistic Missile Defense programs, an increase of $98.2 million \nfor advanced space technology, an increase of $190.0 million for \ntactical and national intelligence programs, and an increase of \napproximately $22 million for strategic forces.\n  There are two provisions which I would like to highlight which \npertain to the future of our nuclear forces. First, we have a provision \nwhich requires the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the \nSecretary of Energy, to conduct an updated nuclear posture review. It \nhas been since 1994 since the last nuclear posture review. This is \nimportant piece of the puzzle when determining the future shape of our \nnuclear forces.\n  The second provision requires the Secretary of Defense, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Energy, to develop a long range plan \nfor the sustainment and modernization of the U.S. strategic nuclear \nforces. We are concerned that neither Department has a long term vision \nbeyond their current modernization efforts.\n  A few budget items I would like to highlight include: an increase of \n$92.4 million for the Airborne Laser program that requires the Air \nForce to stay on the budgetary path for a 2003 lethal demonstration and \na 2007 initial operational capability; an increase of $30 million for \nthe Space Based Laser program; a $129 million increase for NMD risk \nreduction; an increase of $60 million for Navy Theater Wide; and extra \n$8 million for the Arrow System Improvement Program; and for the \nTactical High Energy Program an increase of $15 million.\n  For the Department of Energy programs, the budget structure we have \nproposed for DOE is slightly different from the Administration's \nrequest. We recommend that all activities of the NNSA appear in a \nsingle budgetary provision, as required by section 3251 of the National \nDefense Authorization Act of FY 2000. The bill has an increase of $87 \nmillion to the programs within the NNSA, which is an increase of $331.0 \nmillion over last year.\n  In DOE's Environmental Management account, we decrease the \nauthorization by $132.0 million. However, I want to stress that this \nbill still increases the environmental management account by more than \n$350 million over last year's appropriated amount. In addition, we \ndecrease the other defense account by $88.8 million and move the \nFormerly Utilized Sites Remedial Action Program account to a non-\ndefense account, reflecting a decrease of $140 million. Finally, the \nbill also provides $34 million to continue progress on restoring \ntritium production.\n  I would like to mention an important highlight of the Authorization \nbill outside of the Strategic Subcommittee.\n  I want to commend the new Personnel Subcommittee chairman, Senator \nHutchinson, for his work on the comprehensive health care provisions in \nthe bill. There are many significant improvements to the TRICARE \nprogram for active duty family members. The bill includes a \ncomprehensive retail and national mail order pharmacy program for \neligible beneficiaries, with no enrollment fees or deductible. This \nresults in the first medical entitlement for the military Medicare \neligible population. I am also very happy with the extensions and \nexpansions of the Medicare subvention program to major medical centers \nand in the number of sites for the Federal Employees Health Benefit \ndemonstration program.\n  Lastly, I would like to point out a few items specific to Colorado. \nThe Defense Authorization Act fully funds Rocky Flats at $673 million. \nPlus, we require that all safeguard and security activities to be \nmanaged by Rocky Flats, and not at DOE headquarter organization, in \norder to ensure that future savings will be used for additional Rocky \nFlats cleanup. There is also a provision asking for a report on, as \nwell as encouraging the Secretary of Energy to use, the authority \nprovided in last years DOD authorization bill which allowed him to use \nprior year unobligated balances to accelerate cleanup at Rocky Flats. \nLastly, we also provide employee incentives for retention and \nseparation of federal employees at closure project facilities. These \nincentives are needed in order to mitigate the anticipated high \nattrition rate of certain federal employees with critical skills.\n  Also, the bill fully funds the Chemical Demilitarization Program at \nover $1 billion, while fully funding the military construction for the \nPueblo Chemical Depot at $10.6 million. For Pueblo's destruction of \ntheir chemical agents, there is a provision which provides for the \ndestruction of the chemical agents at Pueblo either by incineration or \nany technology through the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment on or \nbefore May 1, 2000. The provision is to expedite the destruction \nactivities by using one of the technologies listed in the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act documents for the Pueblo Chemical Depot.\n  Plus, there are $34 million for the procurement of precision \ntargeting pods for the Air National Guard and I expect these funds to \nbe used for such procurement.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Warner for the opportunity to \npoint out some of the highlights in the bill which the Strategic \nSubcommittee has oversight and to congratulate him and Senator Levin in \nthe bipartisan way this bill was developed and ask that all Senators \nstrongly support S. 2549. I also want to thank Eric Thoemmes, Paul \nLongsworth, Tom McKenzie, and Tom Moore of the Strategic Subcommittee, \nall the Armed Services Committee staff, and Doug Flanders of my staff \nfor all their long hours and hard work they put into this important \nbill.\n  Finally, one of Congresses main responsibilities is to provide for \nthe common defense of the United States and I am proud of what this \nbill provides for our men and women in uniform. We must not be blinded \nby political motives when it comes to our men and women in the Armed \nServices. I look forward to moving this bill through the Senate, out of \nconference and to the President in order to quickly provide the much \nneeded and much deserved resources for our military. To our Armed \nServices, I say this bill is a tribute to your dedication and hard \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. It is \na great pleasure to work with him. He has one of the toughest \nassignments as subcommittee chairman, and he does it very ably. I thank \nhim.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the speedy \nadoption of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2001.\n\n[[Page S4533]]\n\n  I join my colleagues on the committee in expressing my appreciation \nto Chairman Warner for the outstanding job he has done in his work on \nthis bill.\n  I commend Senator Allard for the great work he has done as chairman \nof the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces, for the work he did on the \nPersonnel Subcommittee prior to my ascension to that post, and for the \nassistance he has given me; I express my appreciation for that.\n  As chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, I worked closely with \nSenator Max Cleland, our ranking member, to develop a package that is \nresponsive to the manpower readiness needs of the military services, \nthat supports the numerous quality of life improvements for our service \nmen and women, their families, and their retirement communities, and \nthat reflects the budget realities we have today and will face in the \nfuture.\n  The subcommittee focused on the challenges of recruiting and \nretention during each of our hearings this year. Even the health care \nhearing really focused on that area of recruitment and retention and \nthe impact of what we do in the area of health care on our future \nretention and recruiting ability.\n  This bill will have a positive impact on both recruiting and \nretention as those who might serve and those who are serving see our \ncommitment to provide the health care benefits promised to those who \nserve with a full military career.\n  I am very pleased with this bill. I am proud of this bill. I believe \nthese initiatives will result in improved recruiting and retention \nwithin the military services.\n  The bill supports the administration's request for an active duty end \nstrength of 1,381,600, and reserve strength of 847,436, more than this \nadministration requested.\n  On military personnel policy, there are a number of recommendations \nintended to support the recruiting and retention and personnel \nmanagement of the services. Among the most noteworthy is a provision, \nthat would be effective July 1, 2002, requiring high schools to provide \nmilitary recruiters the same access to the campus, to student \ndirectors, to student lists and information as they provide the \ncolleges, universities, and private sector employers unless its \ngoverning body, the school board, decides by a majority vote to deny \nmilitary recruiters access to the high school.\n  Currently, there are literally hundreds of high schools that have \nmade decisions--usually on the basis of the superintendent or the \nprincipal--to deny access to military recruiters. For those school \nboards that do not vote to limit access to military recruiters, the \nproposed modification in the bill retains the original requirement that \nthe services must send a general or flag officer to visit high schools \nwithin 120 days of the denial of access to military recruiters. If the \nhigh school continues to deny equal access to military recruiters, the \nSecretary of Defense will then send a letter to the Governor notifying \nhim of the denial and requesting assistance in obtaining access for \nmilitary recruiters.\n  If, after the efforts of the Secretary of Defense and the Governor, \nthe high school continues to deny access to military recruiters, the \nSecretary of Defense will notify the congressional delegation of the \nhigh school that has not complied with the statute we will enact with \nthe passage of this bill. Of course, if the school board votes not to \nrestrict access of military recruiters, the services and the Secretary \nof Defense will not be required to go through the procedures I just \ndescribed.\n  I believe requiring school boards to take that affirmative vote and \nto do so publicly in the light of their constituencies will really \neliminate this problem that has posed such an obstacle to our military \nrecruiters. In our hearings, we heard from frontline military \nrecruiters that the biggest obstacle they have is actually having \naccess to be able to make their case to young people in our schools \ntoday.\n  Another initiative to support recruiting is a pilot program in which \nthe Army could use motor sports to promote recruiting, implement a \nprogram of recruiting in conjunction with vocational schools and \ncommunity colleges, and a pilot program using contract personnel to \nsupplement active recruiters.\n  Another important recommendation in this mark is the expansion of \nJROTC programs. We have added $12 million to expand the JROTC programs. \nWe combine it with the funds in the budget request. This will maximize \nthe services' ability to expand JROTC during fiscal year 2001.\n  I am proud to be able to support these important programs that teach \nresponsibility, leadership, and ethics and assist the military in \nrecruiting. In fact, it has been one of the most effective tools the \nmilitary has in recruiting high school students.\n  Our major recommendations include a 3.7-percent pay raise for \nmilitary personnel and a revision of the basic allowance for housing to \npermit the Secretary of Defense to pay 100 percent of the average local \nhousing costs and ensure that housing allowance rates are not reduced \nwhile permitting increases that local housing costs dictate.\n\n  The bill directs the Secretary of Defense to implement the Thrift \nSavings Plan for active and reserve forces not later than 180 days \nafter enactment. Making mandatory the provision of the Thrift Savings \nPlan will be a very positive recruiting and retention tool in assisting \nthe military services in attracting highly qualified personnel and \nencouraging them to remain until retirement.\n  This year, the committee focused on improving health care for active, \nreserve, and retired military personnel and their families. In health \ncare, there are a number of key recommendations. The foremost of these \nprovisions is the pharmacy benefit for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries \nto which Senator Allard alluded in his remarks. This is the first time \nMedicare-eligible military retirees have an entitlement to military \nhealth care.\n  In addition, prescription drugs represent the largest unmet need of \nMedicare-eligible beneficiaries. I will be speaking on the Warner-\nHutchinson amendment, when that is offered, regarding health care and \nwhat we are doing for our men and women in uniform.\n  I am very proud of this bill and pleased with what the committee has \nput together. It will provide the resources the military services need \nto maximize their readiness and to improve the quality of life for \nactive and retired military personnel and their families.\n  I express my gratitude to Charlie Abell, committee staff, for the \noutstanding work he has done in the past and for the service he has \nagain performed to our country and to the committee. I appreciate his \nwork, along with other members of the committee staff. I especially \nthank my personal staff, Michael Ralsky, for the work he has done not \nonly on behalf of our country and our national security but for the \nState of Arkansas. This is a good bill worthy of the support of the \nSenate. I am pleased to be supporting it.\n  I again thank Chairman Warner for his leadership in putting this bill \ntogether.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his thoughtful \nremarks, most particularly the remarks directed at the staff and other \nmembers of the committee. He is a hard-working subcommittee chairman, \nand he is tackling the problem of recruiting and retention. We will \nhear further from the Senator as we proceed with this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent we proceed briefly to discuss the pending \namendment, and then we will proceed to an amendment to be offered by \nSenator McCain on food stamps, if that is agreeable as procedure. I say \nto my colleague, we are moving expeditiously, with Senator Robert \nKerrey anxious to come to the floor.\n  I am not suggesting we will vote on the Warner amendment. We will \ndiscuss it, and when Senator McCain comes to the floor, we will take up \nthat amendment. My understanding is he desires less than half an hour. \nThe Senator can indicate the time the other side desires, and then we \nwill proceed to rollcall vote and possibly go to the Kerrey amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is fine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3173\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Michigan. He indicated to the \nSenator from Virginia that the pending\n\n[[Page S4534]]\n\namendment, in our collective judgment, is subject to a budget point of \norder. I have shared with his senior staff that corrective measures \nwere taken to try to bring that amendment within the strictures of the \nbudget amendment so it would not be subject to a point of order. We \nwill show immediately what we intend to do.\n  In the meantime, I will discuss the amendment until Senator McCain \ncomes to the floor.\n  I have introduced this amendment today to change the existing \nmilitary medical program to encompass in the future retirees over 65. \nThis amendment provides uninterrupted access to both TRICARE and \nCHAMPUS for military retirees and their families without regard to age.\n  Let me use the term ``retirees.'' Those following this debate might \nnot fully understand. We are talking about men and women in the Armed \nForces who put in the necessary number of years of active service or \nreserve service or guard service, whatever the case may be, to meet the \ncriteria of the various frameworks of law to qualify them for a \nretirement for such services as they render. That is the class of \nindividuals being referred to. It does not include persons, such as \nmyself, who have short tours of military duties; it does not apply to \nme. When we use the term ``retirees,'' it is only for those who, by \nvirtue of their services, met the statutory requirements and are \neligible to receive retirement benefits.\n  Beginning in World War II, promises were made to military members \nthat they and their families would be provided health care if they \nserved a full career. Of course, we certainly included active duty and \nto some limited extent the reserve and guard for military health care. \nWe are talking about that category of persons I have just described.\n  Subsequent legislation was enacted which cut off medical benefits for \nthose over age 65, leaving them to depend on the Medicare system, \nwhich, in their judgment and in the judgment of others, has proven \ninsufficient, and in other ways it is a breach of promise.\n  So there are many underlying reasons for the legislation I am \nproposing and the most important is equity. The reputation of those in \nthe military who gave the promise--not knowing there wasn't any \nstatutory foundation--made promises concerning medical care to induce \nindividuals to provide a minimum, say, 20 years of service in most \ninstances, to enable them to have a career in the U.S. military.\n\n  Not meeting the commitment to provide medical care is a breach of \npromise made on behalf of our Nation. We have to correct it. These \nindividuals devoted a significant portion of their lives, their \ncareers, in service to our country. I recognize with profound sorrow \nhow we broke the promise to these retirees, certainly when we passed \nlegislation in the early 1960s. We rectify it today.\n  I have examined these issues. There is no statutory foundation \nproviding for entitlement to military health care benefits. It simply \ndoes not exist, in my judgment. It is mythical in terms of a foundation \nlaw. But good-faith representations were made to these members. Who \nmade the commitment is irrelevant.\n  I have some personal recollection. I was on active duty for a brief \ntime toward the conclusion of World War II, and then I had a second \ntour of active duty during the Korean conflict-- again, less than 2 \nyears. Nevertheless, I was surrounded by military people. I remember \nwell the inducements given at the conclusion of World War II when so \nmany desired to return to civilian life, requests to stay on active \nduty; the same thing during the Korean conflict--stay on active duty; \ncontinue; give the military the opportunity to show you a career \npattern. Part of those representations included the health care \npackage.\n  Our committee has made a determination--and indeed it is a bipartisan \ndecision--that we would fix the issue of health care for our retirees \nthis year. We started with a series of bills, step by step by step. I \nhave acknowledged my gratitude, and indeed other members of the \ncommittee acknowledge their gratitude, for what the military retirees \ndid in bringing to our attention certain inadequacies of steps we had \ntaken. Step by step, we have improved the benefits, in this particular \nphase of legislation, in this fiscal year. We are going to achieve a \nvery significant improvement to the health care benefit, particularly \nif that amendment is adopted by the Senate.\n  The amendment I bring to the floor repeals the restriction barring 65 \nor older military retirees and their families from continued access to \nthe military health care system. If included, this provision will \nprovide an equal benefit for all military health care system \nbeneficiaries, retirees, reservists, guardsmen, and their families. \nThis puts all beneficiaries in the same class.\n  It is expensive, but I think it is essential we do this to keep the \nfaith with military retirees. I have had many meetings with both active \nand retired military on the health care issue. I conducted town hall \nmeetings, discussions with groups who have come to my office, and I \nhave listened to those who have attended the Armed Services Committee \nhearings regarding their views. They filled the room on a number of \noccasions. They have come from all areas of the country to talk about \nthis. They are not seeking it solely for themselves. They are seeking \nto preserve the image of the U.S. military so the young people today \nwho are considering joining at the recruiting stations--going through \nour ROTC, NROTC, the AROTC, all of these programs--will consider a \nmilitary career.\n  When they go back home they hear the oldtimers say: Watch out, they \nbroke a promise to me on health care. You are thinking about devoting \n20 years of your life to this, or more--watch out.\n  We are going to get rid of the, ``Watch out.'' That is what we are \ntrying to do, get rid of it, because the military retirees are the most \ncost-effective recruiters that we have in America today. They do not \ncost us anything. Yet it is those ladies and gentlemen who served this \nNation who go out and talk to the youngsters. The youngsters look up to \nthem. The youngsters trust them. They look up to the veterans. They \nhave been there. They have done it. They help tremendously helpful in \nrecruiting. So there are many reasons for making these health care \nimprovements.\n  The amendment is a quantum leap ahead of the provisions already in \ncommittee markup at the desk. While the markup includes the \ncomprehensive drug benefit regardless of age, the amendment goes \nfurther and provides uninterrupted access to complete health care \nservices. As a result of these initiatives, all military retirees, \nirrespective of age, will now enjoy the same health care benefits.\n  In town hall meetings, as I said, I listened carefully to the health \ncare concerns of the military, particularly those over 65. We have all \ndone that. The constant theme that runs through their requests is that \nonce they have reached the point at which they are eligible for \nMedicare, they are no longer guaranteed care from the military health \ncare system. This discriminatory characteristic of our current health \ncare system has been in effect since 1964. It reduces retiree medical \nbenefits and requires a significant change in the manner in which \nhealth care is obtained at a point in the lives of our older military \nretirees when stability and confidence and respect and indeed the love \nof the community is most needed. This is an amendment which in effect \nrepeals the 1964 law.\n  In order to permit the Department of Defense to plan for restoring \nthe health care benefit to all retirees, my provision would be \neffective on October 1, 2001. While some may advocate an earlier \neffective date, it is simply not feasible to expand the medical \ncoverage to the 1.8 million Medicare-eligible retirees overnight.\n  The amendment eliminates the confusing and ineffective transfer of \nfunds from Medicare to the Department of Defense. Military retirees \nwill not be required to pay the high cost of additional basic or \nsupplemental insurance premiums to ensure their health care needs. \nMilitary readiness will not be adversely impacted, and our commitment \nto those who serve their full career will be fulfilled.\n  What is apparent to me is that the will of the Congress, reflecting \nthe will of the Nation, is that now is the time to act on this issue. \nAccess to military health care has reached a crisis point. With the \nreduction in the number of military hospitals and with the growth\n\n[[Page S4535]]\n\nin the retiree population, addressing the health care needs of our \nolder retirees has become increasingly difficult. These beneficiaries \nshould be assured that their health care needs will be met.\n  I am well aware of the legislative alternatives that have been \nproposed to address military retiree health care needs. I have \nstruggled to examine the most acute needs of these beneficiaries and \nhave struggled to develop a plan that equally benefits all our \nretirees, not just those fortunate enough to live near a military \nmedical facility, or those fortunate enough to be selected through some \nsort of lottery to be allowed to participate in the various pilot \nprograms now underway. My goal is to provide health care through a \nmeans that is available to all beneficiaries, in an equitable and \ncomplete manner.\n  As I have made it clear throughout the year, improving the military \nhealth care has been the Committee's top quality of life initiative \nthis year. We have listened. We have, with bipartisan support, enhanced \nour earlier legislation to include full pharmacy benefits. The \namendment now before the Congress complements those earlier efforts and \nprovides an equitable medical benefit, one that is not based on age. It \nis time to act.\n\n  At the suggestion of my distinguished colleague, to avoid a point of \norder, I am looking at not changing the fundamental provisions in the \namendment but limiting it to two or possibly three fiscal years. That \nwill bring us within the constraints of the budget resolution. That is \nan important step. I appreciate my colleague bringing this to our \nattention.\n  It will have another effect. It will enable the Congress, and \ninitially our committee, to go in, in depth, and study this amendment \nbecause it is going to have a very significant impact on the existing \ninfrastructure that is caring for the existing active duty and military \nretirees under 65. We cannot fully calculate, no matter how hard we \nlook into this, what that impact would be. In my own judgment, it will \nrequire the Congress to step forward and provide funds, maybe some \nlegislation, to help the existing infrastructure absorb the over-65 \nretirees as they return to what was justly promised them when they \nsigned up.\n  So this amendment has the advantages of laying it out, giving a \nreasonable period of time for the Department and for the Congress to \nexamine it and determine what we have to give by way of additional \nsupport.\n  Also--I say this with no political motive whatsoever--it should \nbecome and will become, in my judgment, an issue in the Presidential \ncampaign. I am quite certain the retirees will say to both candidates: \nLook here, the Senate of the United States included this provision. It \nwent over to the conference with the House. It survived. It was signed \ninto law by the President. But it ends. It ends in, say, 2003. I want \nto hear what the Presidential candidate has to say about this program \nand whether he will support it, support it in the sense of extending it \nbeyond 2003, support it in the budget requests to provide the \nadditional funds and whatever is necessary to make the infrastructure \nof our military able to support this program.\n  That is what we are working on. Momentarily I will ask my amendment \nbe modified. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my intention to speak for about 10 \nminutes in reference to the National Defense Authorization Act. I thank \nthe distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator \nWarner, for his outstanding leadership in the past year. I also thank \nthe distinguished ranking member, Senator Levin, for his leadership as \nwell.\n  This is a good, solid, and positive effort in behalf of our national \ndefense. As a subcommittee chairman, I am particularly proud of the \nwork we were able to accomplish in the subcommittee that we call the \nEmerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. I would like to review \nthe key provisions contained in this act that fell under the \njurisdiction of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee.\n  As the chairman has pointed out, as well as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan, in the last year, what we call information warfare, and \nwhat some call cyberthreats--and the American public is certainly \nbecoming much more aware of that situation--to the United States, \nincluding the Department of Defense, have increased very dramatically. \nThe Department of Defense reported that these attacks on Defense \nDepartment systems increased from under 6,000 in 1998, only 2 years \nago, to over 22,000 in 1999. That figure is doing nothing but \ndramatically increasing and there is every indication that this trend \nis going to continue.\n  From a national economic standpoint in regard to private industry, we \nare very susceptible and we are very vulnerable. In regard to our \nnational security, we are very vulnerable. I remain concerned that many \nimportant, what we call information assurance programs, designed to \nprotect against such cyberattacks, basically remain underfunded by the \nDepartment of Defense. For example, at the hearing before the \nSubcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, as of this spring \nwitnesses from the Department once again confirmed that such funding \nshortfalls remain significant and presented a list of almost $500 \nmillion in unfunded requirements in this area. Obviously that is a \nconsiderable amount of money. When you compare it to the ever-\nincreasing threats and vuneralabilities, you can see just how important \nthis is.\n\n  For these reasons, we have included $76.8 million in this bill not \nonly for today's underfunded requirements but also to really try to \ninitiate programs such as training and education. Let me really \nunderscore the word, in regard to education, in something called \n``cybersecurity,'' that will continue to provide meaningful solutions \nfar into the future. Senator Warner's initiative--what I refer to as \nthe Roberts-Warner initiative, and the distinguished chairman refers to \nit as the Warner-Roberts initiative--he has embarked through his \nleadership and through his research on a whole series of scholarships \nin information security to attract our young people, the best and \nbrightest; not to rely on those who come to us from foreign countries \nwith ever-increasing higher immigration quotas. We must bring the next \ngeneration on to have this expertise. So these Warner scholarships in \nregard to information security for the Department of Defense will have \nfar-reaching and, most important, positive effects in this situation.\n  Second, I want to talk about the terrorist threats to our citizens \nand our service members. It shows no sign of diminishing. Especially in \nregard to the weeks that led up to the millennium celebration, numerous \nindividuals who were suspected of planning terrorist attacks directed \nat U.S. citizens were arrested in the United States and abroad.\n  This is a threat from state actors and nonstate actors all over the \nworld; and with the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the \nthreat of a terrorist attack with a chemical, biological, or nuclear \nweapon is increasing at an alarming rate.\n  We asked the experts who came before the Emerging Threats \nSubcommittee, the experts whose job it is to determine what represents \na vital national security risk: What keeps you up at night? What makes \nyou really worry in regard to a vital national security threat?\n  Their response was largely along two lines of concern: one, in regard \nto the cyberattacks which we are already experiencing in private \nindustry and the Pentagon experiences every day, and the other one was \nbiological attacks. It is so easy to use, whether it be a state actor \nor a nonstate actor or anybody connected with organized crime or any \nindividual who wants to cause a great deal of trouble.\n  We, as a nation, must continue to detect and try to deter such \nattacks, but if such an attack happens, we must be prepared to deal \nwith the consequences. We call this consequence management. We in \nKansas, just to the north of Oklahoma City, full well know what kind of \na tragedy can occur in regard to consequence management. Stop and think \na minute about a terrorist threat and what could happen in our urban \nareas or, for that matter, anywhere in the country, and my colleagues \ncan understand the seriousness of this problem.\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\n  Our subcommittee will continue to play a leading role in ensuring the \nDepartment of Defense is adequately funded and structured to perform \nits critical role in the overall U.S. Government effort to, again, \ndeter, detect, and combat terrorism. The bill contains an additional \n$35 million for these efforts.\n  This year we continue a comprehensive review, initiated last year, of \nthe activities of the Department of Defense to combat terrorism. \nObviously, our goal is to make the Department efforts in this critical \narea more visible and certainly better organized. In fact, at a \nsubcommittee hearing, leading Department of Defense witnesses testified \nto, No. 1, what their jurisdiction is; No. 2, what they have been \ndoing; No. 3, what they plan to do and what their budget requirements \nare; and if, in fact, they could ask us for their priority concerns, \nwhat would they be.\n  Before this hearing, I asked them to sit in the order of their chain \nof command to figure out who was in charge and is this effort being \nproperly coordinated and shared, and what about communication. They \nlooked at one another. There were four witnesses and nobody knew who \nwas at the top of the chain of command. Hello, we have a big problem in \nthat respect.\n  We included in the markup a provision to address this. When I say \n``we,'' I include the distinguished ranking member of the subcommittee, \nSenator Bingaman, and the distinguished Senator whose efforts, in part, \nled to the creation of the subcommittee, Senator Lieberman.\n  We have also worked to increase the capabilities of the Department of \nDefense to assist in the event of a terrorist attack on U.S. soil \ninvolving the use of a weapon of mass destruction.\n  This bill also authorizes over $1 billion, again to support the \nRussian threat reduction and nonproliferation efforts. During the post-\ncold-war decade, the U.S. Government has spent--I do not think too many \nof my colleagues recognize this; I know not too many of our American \ncitizens understand this, but during the post-cold-war decade, the U.S. \nGovernment has spent over $4.7 billion in the former Soviet Union to \nreduce the threat posed by the possible proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction and weapons-usable nuclear materials and scientific \nexpertise. After nearly a decade of working in Russia and the other \nstates of the former Soviet Union, committing ourselves to future \nefforts, we thought it was important for us to review what these \nprograms have achieved.\n\n  Senator Levin has spoken eloquently of the need for the continuation \nof this effort and the intent of the effort. I share his commitment, \nbut I am concerned that for all the good intentions and all the \nsignificant investment that has been made, the return of reducing the \nthreat has been too small relative to the $4.7 billion. We can do \nbetter.\n  For example, the General Accounting Office found that $481.2 million \nhas been spent since fiscal year 1993 on a program designed to secure \nthe weapons-usable nuclear material in Russia and the states of the \nformer Soviet Union, but only 7 percent of the total nuclear material \nidentified as being at risk has been secured. I am troubled by this \nprogress achieved in light of this significant investment. We are not \ngoing to scrap the program, but we must do better.\n  In March, the GAO testified that the costs associated with achieving \nthe threat reduction will continue to increase due primarily to the \nfollowing facts: Russia's inability to pay its share of the costs of \nthese programs, and we are certainly working in that regard with our \nRussian counterparts; Russia's basic reluctance to provide the United \nStates with needed access to its sensitive facilities. I was in Russia \nlast August attempting to gain greater access. We will continue those \nefforts.\n  To help solve those problems, this mark contains several initiatives \nto obtain greater Russian commitment and necessary access to ensure \nthese programs will have a greater chance of attaining their stated \nobjectives, and if we do that, these programs will attain even further \nwidespread support and they can be a success.\n  I call the attention of my colleagues to a modest, but extremely \nimportant, initiative in this bill with widespread bipartisan interest \nthat will lead to a major joint field experiment in 2002. I do not know \nof any commitment that will be undertaken in the future by any of our \nmilitary services that will not be joint.\n  This experiment will evaluate visions of our military services for \nfuture combat forces and ensure they can be brought together \neffectively for joint military operations to deter and counter the \nemerging threats to our national security. I am talking about the fact \nthat we lack interoperability. I know the services and the service \nchiefs say we have this interoperability. With all due respect to the \nservice chiefs and others, we do not have that ability to the degree we \nneed it. That is why we feel we must press ahead with a major joint \nfield experiment if we possibly can. It is absolutely essential.\n  Finally, my colleagues will find in this recommendation an \naffirmation of the subcommittee's strong support of the Defense Science \nand Technology Program. This bill includes an increase--I emphasize, an \nincrease--of $446 million to science and technology. That is a 9-\npercent increase over the President's budget request. It is this \ninvestment that will provide for future capabilities to deal with \nemerging threats to our national security.\n  This is a solid effort; it is a positive effort. It will meet the \nobjective within the constraints of the defense budget for the work \nassigned to the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee. I urge \napproval of this legislation.\n  I join our able chairman in thanking the majority and minority \ncommittee staff, my subcommittee staff, and my personal staff for a job \nwell done. I specifically mention Pam Farrell. If one puts charming and \ntenacious together, it might be considered an oxymoron. It is not the \ncase with Ms. Farrell. Without her leadership and expertise and being \njust as tenacious as she can be, we would never have increased the \nscience and technology budget by more than 9 percent over the \nPresident's budget. She does an amazing job.\n  I would also like to thank Ed Edens and Joe Sixeas, who is \naffectionately called Andy, for their work in regard to the \ncounterterrorism efforts we are conducting, more especially with the \nRAID teams that we now say are CST teams; Chuck Alsup in regard to the \njoint experimentation initiative; Cord Sterling, who has been in \nCentral America, South America, virtually every country where we have a \nthreat in regard to drugs, working overtime. In regard to cyberattacks, \nEric Thoemmes, does an outstanding job. He really has to keep up with \nthat and has done a super job. Then on the cooperative threat reduction \nprograms, Mary Alice Hayward.\n  All of these folks have done an outstanding job. Their minority \ncounterparts have done likewise. We are only as good as our staff. In \nthis regard, I want to pay personal thanks to the staff.\n  I urge the adoption of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Before the Senator proceeds, I express my gratitude to \nour distinguished chairman of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee for a \nmarvelous job. I commend the Senator for giving his staff due \nrecognition for their wonderful work. It is a vital subcommittee. It is \non the absolute cutting edge of everything we have to be doing in the \nSenate.\n  I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3179\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a special subsistence allowance for certain \n  members of the uniformed services who are eligible to receive food \n                           stamp assistance)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have amendment No. 3179 at the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3179.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 206, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 610.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment would provide the funding \nnecessary to end the food stamp military. I come to the floor with this \nproposal which I introduced in March. Two months ago, I offered an \namendment to the congressional budget resolution for fiscal years 2001 \nthrough 2005. The Senate adopted an amendment then to secure funding to \nend the ``food stamp military'' by a vote of 99-0.\n  I would expect a similar vote, but I think it is important that we \nget Members on record to try to rectify what is really a very \ndeplorable and unacceptable situation, and that is, our junior enlisted \nservice personnel, mostly in the pay grades E1 through E5 are on food \nstamps.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that several articles in the \nWashington Post, and several other newspapers--the Memphis Commercial \nAppeal, the London Sunday Telegraph--be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 20, 1999]\n\nFeeling the Pinch of a Military Salary; For Some Families, Pay Doesn't \n                            Cover the Basics\n\n                            (By Steve Vogel)\n\n       On a muggy Saturday at Quantico Marine Corps Base, about \n     two dozen Marines and family members quietly poked through \n     piles of discarded furniture, clothing and household goods in \n     what has become a weekly ritual at the big Northern Virginia \n     installation.\n       Those who defend the nation were trying to make ends meet.\n       At 8 a.m., the patch of lawn was covered with beds, tables, \n     dressers and desks. Within 45 minutes, almost all the \n     furniture was gone. The price was right--everything was free.\n       The items had been gathered by volunteers who go \n     ``trashing'' every Tuesday, scouring garbage left at curbs on \n     the base. Every Saturday, they give away what they collect to \n     needy, eager Marine families.\n       Their efforts reflect a cold reality for thousands of low-\n     ranking men and women in uniform assigned to high-priced \n     Washington and elsewhere: Military salaries, never \n     substantial, often fall far short of what they need.\n       ``We're talking about the basics of life here, and they \n     don't have it,'' said Lisa Joles, a Marine wife who created \n     the volunteer network two years ago. ``Sometimes, they don't \n     have a thing. I didn't know how large the problem was until I \n     got to Quantico.''\n       Of the 40,000 enlisted soldiers, Marines, sailors and \n     airmen based in the area, many feel compelled to work part-\n     time or even full-time civilian jobs to supplement what their \n     country pays them, according to military families and \n     officials. Hundreds more, especially low-ranking troops with \n     families, rely on food stamps or other forms of federal \n     assistance. Many depend on the charity of their fellow \n     troops.\n       ``How can we send members of the military to Kosovo and \n     expect them to do their job if they're concerned about the \n     family being able to afford new school shoes?'' said Sydney \n     Hickey, a spokesman for the National Military Family \n     Association in Alexandria.\n       Since 1982, military salaries have fallen nearly 14 percent \n     behind civilian pay, according to federal figures. Congress \n     has tentatively approved a 4.8 percent pay raise to take \n     effect Jan. 1; many service members will receive a second \n     raise six months later.\n       But the raises still will leave a military-civilian gap of \n     more than 11 percent, according to studies. The situation is \n     particularly hard of families--and 53 percent of the enlisted \n     force nationally is married.\n       ``A single Marine, with due diligence, can get by,'' said \n     Thomas Loughlin, who heads the Marine Corps Community \n     Services at Quantico. ``The real problem is people with \n     families. It's a sad indictment of society that somebody \n     who's willing to give his life for his country gets paid \n     close to minimum wage.''\n       Pentagon officials acknowledge that some service members \n     face severe hardships, not only in the Washington area but \n     also in other parts of the country. But they insist that such \n     cases do not reflect conditions for the vast majority of \n     troops, and they point to statistics showing that junior \n     enlisted service members earn more than the general \n     population of high school-educated 18- to 23-year-olds.\n       At the same time, the officials said that improving pay is \n     critical to Pentagon efforts to solve problems in retaining \n     people in the armed forces. ``A lot of our troops are waiting \n     to see what happens with the pay package,'' said Rudy de \n     Leon, undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness.\n       Military pay varies considerably by rank, length of service \n     and other factors. A single Marine private first class, for \n     example, would earn base pay of $1,075 a month, plus a \n     subsistence allowance of $225 a month for food. Those living \n     off base also receive a housing allowance that varies by \n     jurisdiction and would be $612 for someone living near \n     Quantico.\n       In addition, members of the armed forces receive some \n     benefits, such as medical care, at a fraction of the cost for \n     most civilians. Commissaries offer items that are 30 percent \n     cheaper than at civilian stores, according to Pentagon \n     figures. Service members also do not pay federal taxes on \n     their food and housing allowances.\n       A recent Pentagon study found that, overall, only 450 of \n     the 1.4 million members of the armed forces were living at or \n     below the national poverty level, which is $413,332 for a \n     family of three.\n\n[[Page S4538]]\n\n       But advocates for military families said that the \n     statistics and benefits do not reflect how difficult it is \n     for many men and women to both serve their country and \n     live comfortably in peacetime.\n       ``We believe there are an awful lot of families who are \n     living at the wire, and frequently fall over it,'' Hickey \n     said.\n       Several evenings each week, as soon as he finishes duty at \n     Quantico, Lance Cpl. Harry Schein darts off base, picks up \n     his 14-month-old son from day care and drops him off with the \n     boy's mother.\n       Then he drives up I-95 to Arlington and joins a group of \n     Marines who moonlight by moving office furniture until about \n     11 p.m. On Saturdays and Sundays, he works from 4 p.m. until \n     midnight as a security guard in Alexandria.\n       ``Most of the Marines I know are living check to check and \n     barely making it by and have to get some kind of \n     supplement,'' said Schein, whose pretax paycheck is $2,168 a \n     month, including housing and food allowances. That, he said, \n     does not cover his $595-a-month apartment in Dale City; gas; \n     car insurance; and day care, clothes and food for his son, \n     Devantre.\n       On top of his part-time work, Schein has had to turn to the \n     government's Women, Infants and Children nutrition program, \n     which provides federal vouchers so he can buy formula, juice \n     and baby cereal. The Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society also \n     gave him several hundred dollars in commissary vouchers to \n     buy food.\n       ``All the pride in the world, all the awe people have when \n     they see a Marine, all that isn't going to pay the bills,'' \n     said Schein, 22.\n       The Queens, N.Y., native said that he joined the Marines to \n     make his parents proud but that he is likely to leave when \n     his enlistment runs out next year. ``As much as I love being \n     a Marine, monetarily, I can't,'' he said.\n       Military installations do not generally track how many \n     troops receive public assistance. But many officials who work \n     with low-income service members in the Washington area said \n     that the problem is significant and has grown worse in recent \n     years.\n       Many soldiers ``can only afford food, clothing and shelter \n     and getting to work,'' said Brenda Robbins, an Army Community \n     Services worker at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. ``Saving \n     is almost obsolete.''\n       A recent survey of 165 soldiers at Walter Reed found that \n     41 percent were using some form of public or private charity, \n     according to Bill Swisher, a spokesman.\n       Commissaries at Fort Belvoir, Fort Meade, Fort Myer, \n     Andrews Air Force Base, Quantico and Patuxent River Naval Air \n     Station collected more than $800,000 worth of food stamps and \n     WIC vouchers last year, according to the Defense Commissary \n     Agency.\n       More than $21 million worth of WIC vouchers were redeemed \n     at military commissaries last year, according to Pentagon \n     figures. Nearly 12,000 service members--less than 1 percent \n     of the force--received food stamps in 1995, the last year a \n     study was conducted.\n       ``I think it stinks, really, that a member of the armed \n     forces has to go to food stamps,'' said Lance Cpl. Damon \n     Durre, 25. But that's what the Quantico Marine did after \n     finding he could not support his wife and two children on his \n     take-home pay.\n       Service members in this area do not receive cost-of-living \n     adjustments in their pay, unlike those in New York, San \n     Francisco and Boston. Washington does not qualify as a high-\n     cost area under a formula used by the military.\n       Housing allowances are adjusted according to jurisdiction, \n     but many service members say it is not enough to cope with \n     area rents, and many end up living 40 or 50 miles from their \n     duty stations.\n       ``The cost of living will eat you alive,'' said Sgt. Edna \n     Jackson-Jones, a Marine at Quantico who tried to find \n     affordable housing near the base but instead lives with her \n     three children in an apartment in Fredericksburg. ``I had to \n     go further south because it's cheaper down there.''\n       Quantico offers classes in budgeting and buying cars and \n     directs needy Marines to emergency aid, but officials say it \n     is difficult to assist all those facing difficulties.\n       ``We have a lot of problems reaching out to them, because \n     many times, they don't want you to know they have a \n     problem,'' said Maj. Kim Hunter, deputy director of Marine \n     Community Services. ``It's not their nature.''\n       One result is that members of the military routinely work \n     second jobs, often without permission from superiors, \n     military officials acknowledged. Enlisted men and women sell \n     goods at Potomac Mills, flip hamburgers at fast-food \n     restaurants, do construction work, deliver packages for UPS.\n       ``Seems like everybody who's been here a while has a part-\n     time job,'' said Marine Lance Cpl. Robert Hayes, who has a \n     second job as a mover. ``You really don't have enough money \n     to make it to the next paycheck otherwise.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n        [From the Commercial Appeal, Memphis, TN, Mar. 5, 2000]\n\n         On Home Front, Military Families Struggle With Low Pay\n\n                    (By Kim Cobb, Houston Chronicle)\n\n       Quotesha Austin is tired of being poor. It is not what she \n     expected as an Army wife.\n       Her husband, Pfc, Gary Austin, spends his days training at \n     sprawling Fort Hood, where he drives a lumbering, tank-like \n     vehicle called a Bradley. He is paid $1,171 a month before \n     taxes, a couple hundred dollars in subsistence pay and a \n     housing subsidy that does not cover the rent for his family.\n       ``That spells broke,'' Quotesha Austin says dryly. They \n     can't afford a car, and she can't find a job that pays enough \n     to cover day care for her two children.\n       In November, she began collecting food stamps, and the \n     Austins joined the list of an estimated 12,000 military \n     families who do the same.\n       More than $13 million in food stamps was redeemed last year \n     in military commissaries. There is no way to measure how many \n     were redeemed by military families in civilian supermarkets.\n       Although food stamp recipients are less than 1 percent of \n     the nation's 1.4 million service members, the issue has \n     embarrassed some officials who claim to be supporters of the \n     military and has erupted as an emotional campaign topic for \n     GOP presidential hopefuls George W. Bush and John McCain.\n       They argue it is an outrage that men and women who put \n     their lives on the line for their country must seek help to \n     feed their families.\n       For its part, the Defense Department has studied the food \n     stamp issue and dismissed it as too costly to fix in light of \n     the relatively small number of military families eligible for \n     food stamps.\n       But the military has another problem--how to recruit and \n     retain good people when jobs are plentiful and the economy is \n     strong. The Senate Armed Services Committee met recently to \n     discuss the subject.\n       Many advocates for better military pay point to a 13 \n     percent gap between overall military pay and that for \n     comparable civilian jobs. The defense-oriented Center for \n     Strategic and Budgetary Assessments believes the gap is \n     exaggerated but concludes that increasing pay and benefits to \n     some degree is a reasonable response to recruitment problems.\n       The Defense Department has ordered another study on its \n     food stamp families, the third since 1991. Defense spokesman \n     Susan Hansen said incremental pay raises scheduled through \n     2005 and a proposed major boost in the housing allowance \n     should help alleviate cost-of-living problems for everyone.\n       ``But I think we've seen in the past that the food stamp \n     issue is more a function of larger families for junior \n     personnel than other demographic groups,'' Hansen said.\n       Food stamp recipient Shauntrel Linton says her husband \n     joined the Army specifically because she was pregnant with \n     their first child. Her father was in the military, and they \n     assumed joining the Army would cover their young family's \n     costs. ``I think I thought he'd be making the same amount as \n     my dad,'' she said.\n       The military doesn't want to encourage people who are young \n     and at low levels in the military to have many children, said \n     Steven Kosiak of the defense-oriented Center for Strategic \n     and Budgetary Assessments. Although raising all military \n     salaries costs more than just taking care of the food-stamp \n     population, targeting special financial consideration to \n     potential food-stamp recipients creates the problem of \n     different pay for the same work. ``But having said that, \n     nobody wants to think there are military people who are so \n     underpaid they are resorting to food stamps,'' Kosiak said. \n     ``This is not an unsolvable problem, but it is complicated.''\n       The last Defense Department study, conducted in 1995, found \n     that 59 percent of military food stamp recipients were living \n     on the base. Most of that group would not be eligible for \n     food stamps, the study speculated, if the agencies that \n     administer them were able to fully measure ``hidden \n     compensation,'' like on-post housing.\n       Those conducting the study found that an additional 41 \n     percent of recipients were collecting food stamps even though \n     they lived off base and their housing allowances were \n     calculated as part of their gross pay. The study determined \n     that of 4,900 food stamp families living off base, only 1,100 \n     should qualify for food stamps, based on income and family \n     size.\n       At the lowest end of the scale, an enlisted man or woman at \n     the pay grade of E-1 earns $1,005.49 per month in base pay. \n     The largest percentage of servicemen and women drawing food \n     stamps are at the slightly higher E-4 pay grade, which starts \n     at $1,242.90 per month for those with less than two years of \n     service.\n       The military got a 4.8 percent raise in January for every \n     person in uniform. Seventy-five percent of all service \n     members will receive another pay increase in July, although \n     it's targeted to midgrade and noncommissioned officers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the London Sunday Telegraph, Oct. 31, 1999]\n\n           U.S. Soldiers Rely on Charity to Support Families\n\n                           (By David Wastell)\n\n       Thousands of American soldiers serving in the world's most \n     powerful armed forces are so poorly paid that they are having \n     to depend on charity to provide their families with basic \n     household necessities.\n       The spectacle of America's defenders standing in line at \n     social service offices, or raking through discarded furniture \n     to find beds for themselves and toys for their children, has \n     horrified the nation and is emerging as a potent issue in the \n     forthcoming presidential election.\n       Although military authorities insist that the problem is \n     small, and only affecting young men with unusually large \n     families, soldiers' wives and welfare organisations say\n\n[[Page S4539]]\n\n     that many more service personnel are struggling to make ends \n     meet--but are too proud to seek the help which they need.\n       Tony Bradshaw, a 19-year-old lance-corporal at Quantico, a \n     US Marine base 30 miles south of Washington, who has been \n     receiving food stamps--vouchers that can be exchanged for \n     goods at shops--for the past two months, said: ``It's very \n     hard to realise and admit it. I have to do whatever I can to \n     provide for my family. But I did not expect it to be like \n     this when I joined up.''\n       A family of three--with one child and the wife not \n     working--would qualify for food stamps if their pre-tax \n     income is less than $873 (K528) per month. A two-child family \n     would qualify on income less than $1,176 (K705) per month, \n     rising to $2086 (pounds 1252) for a family with five \n     children.\n       Food stamps worth $142 a month have helped eke out the \n     $1,000 monthly pay cheque on which L/Cpl Bradshaw, his wife \n     Tenille and their two young children must live in a small, \n     tin house in the middle of the base. Mrs. Bradshaw said: \n     ``Without food stamps my children would not be having much of \n     a Christmas.''\n       But the system can be humiliating. Despite having no other \n     means of paying, L/Cpl Bradshaw was not allowed to buy a loaf \n     of bread at the base's military supermarket recently because \n     although he had his food stamps, he did not have with him an \n     official card stating he was entitled to them. A long line of \n     other shoppers, many of them fellow marines, saw him being \n     refused.\n       Denis McFeely, food stamps programme manager at the nearest \n     social services office to the base, said: ``The coupons \n     identify an individual in a check-out queue as being on a low \n     income. Other people look to see what is being bought with \n     their tax dollars. The programme has a sigma attached to \n     it.''\n       That is one reason why the true number of US servicemen and \n     their families entitled to receive food stamps is almost \n     certainly far higher than the 12,000 who actually do so.\n       The problem for young recruits to the American forces is \n     that many in the junior enlisted ranks earn only just over \n     $1,000 a month before tax. Even after allowing for free--if \n     rudimentary--housing and other benefits, a package that may \n     be adequate for single soldiers puts those with even small \n     families well below the official American poverty line.\n       Military pay has fallen behind the rest of the American \n     economy as a result of budget squeezes over the last decade, \n     and a recent vote by Congress to grant a 4.8 per cent \n     increase from January still leaves a wide gap. Senator John \n     McCain, who is trying to beat George W. Bush for the \n     republican presidential nomination, is repeatedly raising the \n     subject in his election campaign.\n       He said: ``These enlisted service members proudly wear \n     their uniforms on our behalf, ready to make the ultimate \n     sacrifice. They are the very same Americans sent into harm's \n     way in recent years in Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo and now \n     East Timor. They have a right to a decent salary.''\n       It is a sentiment shared by many at Quantico, where 7,200 \n     marines, many of them officers in training, live and work \n     inside the sprawling, 10 square-mile base with a small \n     civilian town at its centre. Although the base boasts a \n     marina and a leafy golf course, frequented by the marines' \n     upper echelons, living conditions for lower ranks are more \n     down-to-earth.\n       In one case a young soldier, his wife and their baby lived \n     without furniture in their newly-allotted house for three \n     weeks before contacting a voluntary group in desperation.\n       Tobias Miller, 18, who arrived at the base in March from \n     Missouri with her husband Mike, a lance-corporal, shortly \n     after he completed his basic training, said: ``We slept on \n     the floor for three weeks before I got up the guts to call \n     someone.'' Almost all the furniture in their two-bedroom home \n     was subsequently given to them by an organization called \n     Help--Help Enlisted Lives Prosper.\n       Mrs. Miller and her husband also reluctantly decided to \n     apply for food stamps. But after three separate visits to a \n     social services office outside the base, during the last of \n     which they were forced to wait for three hours, they gave up \n     because they could not endure the humiliation.\n       Mrs. Miller said: ``My mother was on food stamps and I \n     never wanted to be on them myself. This isn't what my \n     husband's recruiter led us to expect.'' Lisa Joles, 35, the \n     energetic founder of Help and the wife of a local marine, has \n     become an unofficial welfare officer for many of the young \n     families who arrive on the base, often to set up home for the \n     first time.\n       She encourages them to apply for food stamps and other \n     welfare benefits. She has also worked hard to publicise the \n     problem, something which has not endeared her to the marines' \n     authorities. They have their own support system which Mrs. \n     Joles insists she is trying to complement. They point out \n     that any problems are not unique to Quantico.\n       Most weekends Mrs. Joles and her husband, Baron, an \n     infantryman, distribute large quantities of furniture, \n     clothing and other household goods which have been donated \n     either by better-off marines or by sympathisers.\n       Families like the Bradshaws and the Millers have equipped \n     most of their homes that way. Last week L/Cpl Eric Clay and \n     his family--wife Alisha and children Kelsey, aged three and \n     one-year-old Emily--were praising Mrs. Joles as they sifted \n     through the mound of material she had gathered in a shed \n     behind her house.\n       Mrs. Joles also organises small squads of wives to do \n     temporary work for local employers, helping boost their \n     families; income. But she is no soft touch: if the women do \n     not learn how to manage the extra money they earn she will \n     not ask them back. She said: ``I don't want them coming back \n     two weeks later saying they don't have enough money to buy \n     diapers.\n       ``I am teaching them to take care of their young man--that \n     he belongs to the country--and if the country needs him, he \n     will go. If his family is in chaos the marines are not \n     getting 100 per cent from him.''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, these are stories concerning the \nlifestyles of the service men and women in the military. One in the \nWashington Post article of July 20 concerns Quantico Marine Corps Base \nin Virginia. One of the enlisted marines says:\n\n       I think it stinks, really, that a member of the armed \n     forces has to go to food stamps,'' said Lance Cpl. Damon \n     Durre, 25. But that is what the Quantico Marine did after \n     finding he could not support his wife and two children on his \n     take-home pay.\n\n  In the London Sunday Telegraph there is a story:\n\n       Food stamps worth $142 a month have helped eke out the \n     $1,000 monthly pay check on which L/Cpl Bradshaw, his wife \n     Tenille and their two young children must live in a small, \n     tin house in the middle of the base. Mrs. Bradshaw said: \n     ``Without food stamps my children would not be having much of \n     a Christmas.''\n       But the system can be humiliating. Despite having no other \n     means of paying, L/Cpl Bradshaw was not allowed to buy a loaf \n     of bread at the base's military supermarket recently because \n     although he had his food stamps, he did not have with him an \n     official card stating he was entitled to them.\n\n  These are just demonstrations of a situation that exists in our Armed \nForces today; that is, that approximately 6,300 service members receive \nfood stamps. That is an unofficial DOD report, while the General \nAccounting Office and Congressional Research Service place the number \nat nearly 13,500. There is some disparity with the numbers, but the \nfact is that there are still thousands on food stamps. Obviously, I \nbelieve this is a national disgrace and it needs to be repaired.\n  The amendment will cost approximately $28 million over 5 years. That \nis an average of less than $6 million per year, to pay for an \nadditional allowance of $180 a month to military families who are \neligible for food stamps. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that this amendment would save millions of dollars in the \nFood Stamp Program by removing service members from the food stamp \nrolls for good.\n  As we know, in recent years military pay increases have barely kept \npace with inflation. But last year there was a significant increase, \nincluding a pay raise for admirals and generals, who received a 17-\npercent pay raise last year. And enlisted families continue to line up \nfor free food and furniture.\n  I was pleased to hear the prospective Chief of Naval Operations, \nAdmiral Vern Clark, support a food stamp stipend when he testified \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 16. Admiral Clark was \nasked by Chairman Warner if he was concerned that a food stamp stipend \nwould create an inequity between service members who qualify for food \nstamps and those who do not. Admiral Clark stated:\n\n       My view is that it is far, far more important to not have \n     our people on food stamps than it is to have a small \n     inequity. . . . This is the kind of thing that speaks \n     volumes, much more than a few dollars that are involved in \n     it, about . . . how important we think they are. I support \n     any measure that would put us in a position where we do not \n     ever have to have a single Sailor on food stamps.\n\n  I commend Admiral Clark for his clear thinking and his support of a \nmeasure that will reflect whether or not we care fundamentally for our \nservice members. Admiral Clark is right. We need to rectify this \nproblem. There is no provision in the bill at this time concerning the \nfood stamp issue.\n  I might point out, this amendment is supported by The American \nLegion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the National Association for \nUniformed Services, the Disabled American Veterans, The Retired \nOfficer's Association, and every enlisted association or organization \nthat specifically supports enlisted service member issues in the \nMilitary Coalition and in the National Military/Veterans Alliance. \nThese associations include the Non Commissioned Officers\n\n[[Page S4540]]\n\nAssociation, The Retired Enlisted Association, the Fleet Reserve \nAssociation, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the U.S. Coast Guard \nChief Petty Officers Association, the Enlisted Association of the \nNational Guard of the United States, and the Naval Enlisted Reserve \nAssociation.\n\n  During the budget resolution, I talked for a long time about this \nproblem in the military. We are talking about, I believe, a $290-some \nbillion authorization. We are talking about now an additional $6 \nmillion a year to handle a problem which has received enormous \npublicity, enormous visibility. In the view of officers and enlisted \nalike, it is a problem that has caused a great impact on the morale of \nthe men and women in the military, whether they happen to be on food \nstamps or not.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Warner, the chairman of the committee, \nfor allowing me to offer this amendment at this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. This is an initiative on which he \nhas worked for some time.\n  I wish to ask him a question or two. I intend to support it. I think \nwe need a little clarification on one or two points.\n  I commend him for bringing this up. I commend him for his \ndetermination to address this issue, and not only this year but in past \nyears.\n  It was passed by our committee, this basic language, in last year's \nbill; am I not correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is basically correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. This question of pay inversion, let me just sort of \ndescribe it. You have a sergeant who has served 5 or 6 years. He has a \nwife and two children. And then a private comes into his platoon, and \nhe has a number of children, which enables him to qualify for food \nstamps.\n  Now we add a certain sum of money, which the Senator proposes, and \nthe salary of the private is coming right up very close to the salary \nof the sergeant. Now, the Senator knows from his long experience in the \nmilitary--and my experience is far more modest than our distinguished \ncolleague from Arizona, but having served in the Department of Defense, \nI have watched for many years this question of pay because pay has a \ntremendous significance not only to the military person who wears the \nuniform, but to the wife and family. It is a matter of pride. It is \nrecognition for his length of service, for his professionalism, which \nby virtue of that length of service is greater than the younger people \ncoming on. How do we address that? What guidance do we give, say, the \nofficer corps and senior noncoms who have to deal with this issue, on \nthe assumption that Congress passes it?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague. I am sure the Senator from Virginia \nis aware, as he points out, that this is a problem, although the reason \nwhy we chose $180 a month was so that while it would not completely \nclose the gap, which is higher than that between the two ranks he just \nstated, far more important than that--I can only quote the prospective \nChief of Naval Operations, Admiral Vern Clark, when asked by Chairman \nWarner this past May 16, a few weeks ago, about this exact issue he \nraises. The response of the prospective Chief of Naval Operations was:\n\n       My view is that it is far, far more important to not have \n     our people on food stamps than it is to have a small \n     inequity. . . . This is the kind of thing that speaks \n     volumes, much more than a few dollars that are involved in \n     it, about . . . how important we think they are. I support \n     any measure that would put us in a position where we do not \n     ever have to have a single Sailor on food stamps.\n\n  Also, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, every enlisted \nassociation: the Noncommissioned Officers Association, the Retired \nEnlisted Association, the Fleet Reserve Association, the Air Force \nSergeants Association, et cetera, who are also aware of this situation, \nstill because of the gravity of the problems, support this $180-a-month \nincrease for those who are on food stamps.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. Indeed, we will have \nto call upon those organizations to help explain this because it is \ngoing to pose some problems. But like others, we have to deal with it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I may respond briefly to my friend, Senator Warner was \ninvolved in this many years ago when we had enormous retention problems \nin the military, especially in what we call critical rates--those who \nhad specialized skills and talents. The chairman was involved in this \nbecause we decided we would give higher pay to people who were of the \nsame time or even less time in the military because they had special \nskills. And they are today, and were then, receiving higher pay because \nof the special skills and the need to retain those people with special \nskills.\n  I have always felt that the backbone of the Navy was the bosun's \nmate. Yet we find in the Navy that the bosun's mate is the lowest paid, \nwhile the electronic technician, the computer specialist, and others, \nwho are of equal rank--or rate, to be accurate--receive a much higher \nsalary. We did that for practical reasons, which was that it was an \nabsolute criticality of maintaining people in the Navy and other \nbranches of the military who had these critical skills. We are sort of \ndoing the same thing here. We are trying to correct the morale problem \nthat exists when the word spreads throughout the military and in our \nrecruiting efforts in high schools all over America that if you are \ngoing to join an organization, i.e., the U.S. military, and you have \nchildren, you may still be on food stamps. I think there is some \ncomparability between those two situations, although not an absolute \none. I hope the chairman takes my point here.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I do. Of course, that is strictly a \nquestion of professionalism in the aviation community to which the \nSenator has given a lifetime of service. It is critical that they get \nhigher pay, not only for flight but for retention purposes, than other \nofficer segments. I have to chuckle. In what little military experience \nI have, I was an electrician's mate third class. I am not sure I could \nhave qualified for a bosun's mate.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Today, you could have a lieutenant who is an aviator \nmaking more money than a nonaviator officer, an E1 or E2 ranked senior \nto that person because of the criticality of keeping those people in \nthe Navy.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is right, the electronic technician people, \nand so forth.\n  The second question is--and it is interesting--you were quoting from \nthe future Chief of Naval Operations--indeed, an outstanding \nprofessional. He says he would rather not have people on food stamps. \nIsn't that what he said?\n  Mr. McCAIN. He said:\n\n       My view is that it is far, far more important to not have \n     our people on food stamps than it is to have a small \n     inequity. . . .\n\n  The Commandant of the Marine Corps and the current Chief of Naval \nOperations also share those views.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is important as part of this colloquy that we lay the \nfoundation that the Senator was very careful in arriving at his pay \nlevels--not to bump sergeant, or jump over it, which I think was wise. \nIn doing so, would I not be correct in saying you will not eliminate \nall food stamp cases? In all probability, the efforts, if adopted and \nsigned into law, will still leave some on food stamps. Would I be \ncorrect?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is not clear because we have gotten two or three \ndifferent estimates, I say to the Senator from Virginia. Several \nexperts say this will largely eliminate the problem. There are others \nwho say there will still be a few remaining, but all agree this would \neliminate the overwhelming majority of service members on food stamps.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is going to have my support. Mr. President, those are \nthe questions I had in mind. I thank the Senator for the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend my good friend from Arizona for \nhis tremendous sensitivity to the issue that he raises. We still have \nservice members who are receiving food stamps and that should not be \nthe case.\n\n[[Page S4541]]\n\n  If there is good news here--and there is--it is that, since 1991, the \nnumber of service members on food stamps has been dramatically reduced, \nas well as the percentage in the total force has gone down dramatically \nsince 1991. In 1991, there were 19,400 service members receiving food \nstamps. That number went to 11,900 in 1995, and then in 1999 it went to \n6,300. That number--which is the latest we have--does not include the \nfiscal year 1999 or a later pay raise. So we have at least some good \nnews in this area, which is that the number of service personnel on \nfood stamps has been reduced by about two-thirds since 1991.\n  As a percentage of our total force, the percentage has been cut \nroughly in half, from .9 percent in 1991 to .45 percent in 1999. So \nthere has been significant improvement. Senator McCain is absolutely \nright. We still have 6,300 service members on food stamps. We should \nnot be in that situation. He is pointing out to this body again that we \nshould try to do something about it. The informal estimate we get is \nthat his amendment will help. It will not eliminate the number of \npeople who we have on food stamps, but it will reduce by somewhat that \nnumber of 6,300. I am going to support it on that basis.\n\n  Again, I commend the Senator from Arizona for his constant raising of \nthis issue until we can try to finally resolve this problem.\n  There is one little wrinkle in here which is sort of an irony, I \nguess. Maybe that is the best it is. For instance, if you take a \ntypical E4 with three dependents who lives on base in Government \nhousing, he will get the food stamps because he doesn't have a housing \nallowance. The person under this proposal who might be a similar E4 \nwith the same number of dependents gets a housing allowance if he lives \noff base, and it is that housing allowance which pushes him above the \neligibility level for food stamps. Yet, because that housing allowance \nmay be inadequate to pay for housing, he may actually be in greater \nneed for the food stamps than the person who is on base. However, that \nis something we will just have to try to work with. We have to try to \nmake this work the best we possibly can to reduce the number of further \nservice members who are receiving food stamps.\n  Again, I thank Senator McCain for his constancy, his commitment, his \ndedication, and his passion to this issue. He is right, as he so often \nis in terms of what this goal must be, which is to remove members in \nthe services from receiving food stamps. They should not need food \nstamps. We ought to be able to pay them enough and give them enough of \na housing allowance so there is no need for them to receive food \nstamps.\n  I commend him. I will be supporting this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for their support of this amendment. I think the remarks of both \npointing out that this is not a perfect fix but is a significant step \nin the right direction is entirely appropriate. Obviously, we will have \nto review the situation after we see what the result of this amendment \nis once it is enacted into law.\n  I thank both Senator Warner and Senator Levin. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, momentarily I believe the Senator from \nArizona will ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have already been ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n  I want to work with Senator Levin to see if we can order the \nsequencing of amendments this afternoon to accommodate the Senate. We \nwill have the McCain vote. We will decide on that time in a few \nminutes. I have talked to our distinguished colleague from Nebraska, \nMr. Kerrey. He has a very important amendment. He just indicated to \nthis manager that he is willing to bring it up and have a vote on it \ntonight. Is that correct?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct, unless the chairman is going to accept \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Perhaps we can avoid the vote after he hears my argument. \nI am prepared to send an amendment to the desk and schedule a vote on \nit this evening. That is fine. I am ready to go as soon as we vote on \nthe McCain amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask my colleague if he has any comment to make.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the managers will address the question of \nhow we proceed from here at the conclusion of the vote on the McCain \namendment. Let us proceed. I would suggest the yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let's proceed with the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the McCain amendment. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. \nDomenici) and the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Biden), the \nSenator from Louisiana (Mr. Breaux), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nDodd), the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. Landrieu), and the Senator from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Lautenberg) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L.

Mr. President, first, I modify the pending amendment, the \nWarner amendment No. 3173. I send to the desk the amendment, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike sections 701 through 704 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 701.

Could I put in a UC request before that?\n  Would the Senator forbear and allow me to put in a UC request?\n  Mr. President, in consultation with the majority leader, the \nDemocratic leader, and my colleague, Senator Levin--while I had hoped \nwe could continue with votes tonight--we have now reached the following \nrecommendation in the form of a UC request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Virginia be recognized \nto modify his amendment, and following the modification of the \namendment, the amendment be laid aside and Senator Robert Kerrey be \nrecognized to offer an amendment relative to strategic forces, and \nimmediately following the reporting by the clerk, the Senator from \nVirginia be recognized to offer a second-degree amendment.\n  I further ask consent that following the debate tonight, there be 90 \nminutes additional beginning at 9:30 a.m. on the strategic forces \nissue, to be equally divided in the usual form, and following that \ndebate, the amendments be laid aside.\n  I also ask consent that following that debate, the Senate resume the \namendment of the Senator from Virginia, amendment No. 3173, and it be \nlaid aside in order for Senator Johnson to offer a similar amendment, \nand there be 2 hours, equally divided, total, for debate on both \namendments, and following that debate, the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the amendments.\n  I also ask consent that there be no amendments in order to either of \nthe four amendments described above, or the language proposed to be \nstricken, and there be 2 minutes for explanation prior to each vote. \nThe voting order for tomorrow would be as follows: Warner amendment No. \n3173; Johnson amendment; Warner second degree to Kerrey; Kerrey first \ndegree, as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, I just want \nto be clear that the Senator from Washington would be recognized prior \nto Senator Kerrey, and that that time would not come out of any time \nindicated.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues for working out \nthis UC.\n  If I could just make an announcement, in light of this agreement, \nthere will be no further votes tonight. However, Members should be \naware that at least two, and up to four, back-to-back votes will occur \nsometime tomorrow commencing at around 12:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to mark a solemn occasion in \nthe lives of the people of my home State of Washington.\n  Many of my colleagues have heard me talk on the Senate floor about \npipeline safety.\n  Today I want to remind everyone of the reason I have become such a \nstrong advocate for improving pipeline safety.\n  June 10--one year ago, coming up this Saturday--will be the first \nanniversary of a horrible pipeline accident in Bellingham, WA.\n  In that accident, a gasoline pipeline ruptured and released more than \n275,000 gallons of gasoline into Whatcom Creek. That gasoline caught \nfire and sent a fireball racing 1\\1/2\\ miles down the creek side. It \ncreated a plume of black smoke that rose more than 20,000 feet into the \nair.\n  Two 10-year-old boys and a young man were enjoying the outdoors on \nthat quiet summer afternoon. Tragically, they died as a result of that \npipeline rupture.\n  Three families in Bellingham, WA, will never be the same because of \nthe events that took place on June 10, 1999.\n  As we mark this anniversary, we can never forget the lives that were \nlost.\n  For just a moment I want to ask my colleagues and the American people \nto pay tribute to those young lives; Wade King, Stephen Tsiorvas, and \nLiam Wood. I also want to honor their parents--who have endured a loss \nthat no family should have to experience.\n  They have shown such strength and courage. They have led the charge \nfor safer pipelines, and their advocacy has made a difference.\n  Their courage was clear to everyone who attended the Senate Commerce \nCommittee field hearing in Bellingham on March 13 and to everyone who \nheard them testify just last month here in Washington, DC, before the \nCommerce Committee.\n  They came to Washington, DC, to ask for one thing. They want this \nCongress to improve pipeline standards this year. This Congress--this \nyear.\n  I believe we have a moral obligation to do everything we can to meet \nthe parents' wishes and to protect everyone else from pipeline hazards. \nThat is why I have been working to raise the safety standards for oil \nand gas pipelines.\n  There are 2.2 million miles of pipelines running across the country. \nThey run near our schools, our homes, and our communities.\n  They perform a vital service. They bring us the energy we need to \nfuel our cars and heat our homes.\n  But at the same time, they are not as safe as they could be. We have \na responsibility to pass a bill this year that will protect families \nfrom the dangers of unsafe pipelines.\n  To be honest, I--like many Americans--was not aware of those dangers \nuntil the accident in my State.\n  But as I spent months learning about pipelines, I found that the \naccident in my State was not a rare event.\n  Since 1986, there have been more than 5,700 pipeline accidents in \nthis country, 325 deaths, 1,500 injuries, and almost $1 billion in \nenvironmental damage.\n  On average there is one pipeline accident every day in this country, \nand 6 million hazardous gallons are spilled into our environment every \nyear.\n  That is why back in January I introduced my own pipeline safety \nbill--the Pipeline Safety Act of 2000. I want to thank the Members who \nhave signed on as cosponsors--Senators Inouye, Gorton, Wyden, \nLautenberg, and Bayh.\n  I want my colleagues to know, in the 4 months since I introduced my \npipeline safety bill, at least 20 States have experienced pipeline \naccidents. In addition to my bill, pipeline safety measures have been \noffered by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain and by the \nadministration.\n  I am pleased that all of the current proposals touch on five key \nareas of pipeline safety. First, all of these bills recognize the need \nto improve pipeline inspection and accident prevention practices, \nsecond, they recognize the need to develop and invest in new safety and \ninspection technology, third--and importantly--they expand the Public's \nright to know about problems with pipelines in their neighborhoods, \nfourth, they recognize that States can be better partners in improving \npipeline safety. Finally, these bills increase funding for new State \nand Federal pipeline safety programs.\n  I thank Senator McCain for the strong personal interest he has taken \nin this issue. I thank him for the very effective way he has worked to \nmove this legislation forward. The Senate\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\nCommerce Committee has tentatively scheduled a markup session for June \n15.\n  Senator Gorton and I are working with both the majority and minority \nmembers of the Senate Commerce Committee to come up with a manager's \npackage that will meet the standards we have outlined and will be \nacceptable to as many members as possible.\n  As we work here in the Senate on this important legislation, I want \nto encourage my colleagues in the House of Representatives to move \nforward quickly on their legislation so this Congress can pass a bill \nthis year.\n  One of the things that has been so important over the past year is \nthat so many people have come together to improve pipeline safety. And \nwhile I don't have time to thank them all, I do want to mention a few.\n  First among them is Bellingham's Mayor Mark Asmundson, who has done \nmore to educate the public and legislators about pipeline safety than \nanyone I know.\n  I also want to recognize Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater who \nstationed a pipeline inspector in my State after the accident, and DOT \nInspector General Kenneth Mead, who issued a report at my request on \nthe Office of Pipeline Safety.\n  I also thank the President and the Vice President for their \nleadership.\n  In particular, the Vice President took the time to learn about this \nissue when he was in my State. He recognizes its importance, and he \nsent the administration's pipeline safety bill to the Senate.\n  I also thank the rest of the Washington State delegation--which has \ncome together across party lines to address this issue--particularly my \ncolleague Senator Gorton, along with Representatives from our \ndelegtion.\n  And of course, I want to recognize Washington State Governor, Gary \nLocke, for the work he has done to raise pipeline standards in our \nState.\n  Mr. President, one year has passed since the accident in Bellingham, \nWA, that you can see on the chart behind me.\n  We have made some progress, but we need to finish the job.\n  We need to pass a strong pipeline safety bill this year. We owe it to \nthe people of Bellingham, the victim's families, and to the American \npeople. As we mark the 1-year anniversary of the Bellingham explosion, \nwe must answer the call of the families with a strong bill. Nothing can \nease the pain of this anniversary for so many people in my State, but \nwe can and we must use this occasion to enact stronger pipeline safety \nstandards.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4543-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4543-S4555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, in 1998, the Congress, for the first time \nin the history of strategic nuclear weapons policy, imposed upon a \nPresident a limitation on what that President could do in terms of \nreducing nuclear weapons. It imposed a floor at the START I levels, \nwhich is roughly 6,000 strategic nuclear weapons. It said the President \ncould not go below 6,000, unless and until the Duma ratified START II.\n  Last year, when I attempted to eliminate this restriction--which I \nbelieve is putting a position upon an Executive that would be very \ndifficult to sustain if we were discussing this in the clear light of \nday, if it was understood by the American people that this was what we \nwere doing--many people on that side of the aisle said: We believe this \nlanguage will put pressure upon the Duma to ratify START II. The \nargument carried the day in a close vote of 54-46; the current policy \nwas sustained. The language in the current law is section 1302 of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. It references that section 1017 of \nthis particular legislation we are considering right now was held in \nlaw.\n  Well, since that time, the Duma has ratified START II. I expected to \nbring this language to the floor this year with open arms. It worked. \nWe put in a floor and said the United States could not go any lower, \ndeclared victory, and the Duma ratified START II. Instead, we have an \nalternative proposal the Senator from Virginia has offered that has a \ncertain amount of appeal because it requires a strategic review of our \nnuclear force structure. After that review, it gives the President \nauthority, subject to what the review says, to waive the provisions of \n1302 if the President says it is in the national security interest to \ndo so.\n  It still puts us in a position--whether it is President Clinton or, \nif Vice President Gore wins the election, President Gore or, if \nGovernor Bush wins, President Bush--the President will be prevented by \nCongress from reducing nuclear weapons below the START I levels, below \n6,000, unless the President of the United States can accelerate a \nstrategic review. I guess that is possible. I would like to find out \nfrom the authors of this second degree if that is their understanding. \nIn other words,\n\n[[Page S4544]]\n\ncould President Clinton satisfy the requirements of this amendment by \nsaying: My Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Energy are going to do \nan accelerated review?\n  This language has to be concurrent with the quadrennial review and \nsubmitted no later than December 2001. Could the President accelerate \nthat review on this particular question? If not, whoever the next \nPresident is, they are going to be held up at least until December of \n2001 from doing so. That makes complete sense for America to do, in my \njudgment.\n  One of the most compelling things that happened on this subject prior \nto our leaving for our Memorial Day recess was a remarkable speech \ngiven by the likely Republican nominee for President, Governor Bush, \nfollowed by a speech at the Naval Academy given by Vice President Gore, \nthe likely Democratic nominee for President. The comments, which I \nfound to be very striking and very encouraging, indicate a significant \nshift in our policy if the Republican nominee has any influence over \nthe Republican Party platform.\n  Governor George Bush, surrounded by the preeminent thinkers on the \nRepublican side on nuclear strategy--former National Security Chief \nBrent Scowcroft, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Colin Powell, \nformer Secretary of State George Shultz, and former Secretary of State \nHenry Kissinger--they were all there standing with Governor Bush as he \nsaid the following:\n\n       America should rethink the requirements for nuclear \n     deterrence in a new security environment. The premise of the \n     Cold War nuclear targeting should no longer dictate the size \n     of our arsenal. As President, I will ask the Secretary of \n     Defense to conduct an assessment of our nuclear force posture \n     and determine how best to meet our security needs. While the \n     exact number of weapons can only come from such assessment, I \n     will pursue the lowest possible numbers consistent with our \n     national security.\n\n  If Governor Bush were President today, he would not think very kindly \nof Congress coming along and saying: We don't think you have been in \noffice long enough; 9 years is not long enough, so we are going to ask \nyou to do an additional review before you do what you say you are going \nto do here. It is an interference on the part of Congress at a time, in \nmy view, that the President ought to be doing exactly what Governor \nBush is suggesting; that is, to break out of the Cold War thinking, and \nhas us saying we have to maintain our parity with the Russians; \notherwise, it is not going to be possible to get the kind of arms \ncontrol agreements we want to get.\n  I must say, I find much to be commended in many things I have heard \non the other side of the aisle having to do with missile defense, \nbelieving that in an era when we begin to reduce nuclear weapons, \naccidental and unauthorized launches from rogue nations, or the threat \nof them, are likely to increase as we draw down our nuclear forces. \nMissile defense becomes, in my judgment at least, an even more \ncompelling part of our arsenal.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                       A MEMORIAL DAY OBLIGATION\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to carry out an obligation I \nmade on Memorial Day at the Arlington National Cemetery services.\n  This statement was presented at the Arlington National Cemetery \nmemorial service by the Flying Tigers of the 14th Air Force \nAssociation. It was in the form of a prayer that was entitled, ``Empty \nCockpit; To our Departed Comrade.''\n\n     His is a place no one can take,\n     The void he leaves cannot be filled,\n     For the mark he made, stays, fresh on us,\n     Although his heart has stilled.\n\n     Though the years pursue their relentless course,\n     And images are replaced,\n     And memories grow dim and fade,\n     And time obscures that familiar face,\n     And even a name be forgot,\n     And the things he said, and did,\n     And lives more noble may come and go,\n     But what he was cannot be hid.\n\n     The lessons he unknowingly taught,\n     By being what he was,\n     Have certainly changed the lives he met,\n     As his life touched ours.\n\n     So that the course which they now take,\n     Points somehow higher than before,\n     A true and gently comrade,\n     Has opened an unknown door.\n\n     So although his life on Earth is done,\n     His heritage will not rust,\n     For parts of him, that was, remain,\n     And live on as part of us.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I made a commitment to repeat that here on the \nfloor of the Senate. I appreciate the time.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it is somewhat difficult to get back to \nthe somewhat arcane subject of how many nuclear weapons are needed \nafter listening to the recitation of the Senator from Alaska of a \nshort, very moving statement that in many ways gets to the heart of the \nmood we ought to be in when we are discussing our defense authorization \nbill, which is not just trying to answer the question how we authorize \nand defend the United States of America but how we give honor to those \nwho have given the highest and most in service to this country.\n  I appreciate very much the presentation by the Senator from Alaska of \nthat memorial because I think it puts us indeed in the correct mood, \nwhich is, we ought to be writing this law so as to enable all of us to \ntake action to defend the United States of America against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic, without regard to some previous ideology that we \nhave held onto for a long time.\n  We ought to do the right thing and not worry about whether or not we \nare going to find ourselves subject to criticism as a consequence of \nsome group saying we didn't do enough, or we have done too much, and so \non and so forth. It is that kind of thinking that is required if we are \ngoing to get the right number of nuclear weapons. We spend $15 billion \nto $20 billion a year on our nuclear weapons force structure. It is an \noppressive effort.\n  I happen to have the privilege of not just serving the people of the \nState of Nebraska but in the State of Nebraska is an effort and an \norganization known as STRATCOM. STRATCOM's entire mission is to operate \nthe strategic nuclear force. The current STRATCOM CINC and I have a \nvery good relationship, as I have with all other CINCs, because this \nmission is very important to the people of the State of Nebraska and to \nthe people of the United States of America. I have had the opportunity \non many occasions to be briefed, and I can state to my colleagues that \nwe get our money's worth. These men and women work very hard. They are \ntireless in the execution of their duties. They want to make certain \nthey follow the command and the orders that are given by the people's \nleaders--in this case, the Commander in Chief--who instruct STRATCOM on \nwhat to do through a Presidential directive. They are following orders.\n  They put together target requirements. They put together a list of \nrequirements that are called SIOP. SIOP determines what targeting is \nbeing done. Then it comes back to us, and it says this is what we need \nin order to follow the civilian orders. They come to us and say these \nare the resources we need in order to be able to accomplish that \nobjective.\n  It is very important for us to follow that because often times it \nwill turn to the military. We turn to the STRATCOM and say such things \nas: Tell us the minimum level of deterrence. They come back and say: \nThe minimum level is 2,500. We have to have 2,500 warheads.\n  Remember, that 2,500 number comes as a consequence of an order they \nhave been given by a Presidential directive. They have been given an \norder. That is where it comes from. Change those requirements and the \nnumber of warheads is going to be changed. It may be that a \nPresidential directive comes and says we need more. I do not know. But \nright now, without the lengthy review--I appreciate the lengthy force \nstructure review that is in this authorization. That is basically the \nsubstitute--that we have a lengthy review that is going to be done.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to think of several things.\n  One, the Russians, first of all, are no longer the military threat \nthey were in the cold war. It is a democratic nation. They have had \nthree elections. They just elected their second President. We have \npartnerships with them in many different areas. We want their \nexperiment in democracy and free markets to succeed.\n  The chairman of the Armed Services Committee said earlier he believes \nthe No. 1 threat to the United States of\n\n[[Page S4545]]\n\nAmerica is political instability. It is uniquely the case. In Russia, \nthat is the case. Our mood toward the Russians ought to be that we want \nto partner with them and help them be successful in making this \ntransition from an economy run by a central government--a Politburo--to \na political system that is not limited to a single party but one that \nhas selected its leadership. They are trying to make a successful \ntransition. They need the partnership and they need the assistance of \nthe world's leading democracy to make that likely to occur.\n  No. 1, we are dealing with a dramatically different political \nsituation. This is not the Soviet Union. It is Russia we are talking \nabout.\n  No. 2, everybody who assesses Russia right now understands that as a \nconsequence of the catastrophic failure of the Communist economic \nsystem, and as a consequence of a number of other things associated \nwith the decisions made by their political leaders, they have barely \nenough money to be able to make payroll for a dramatically reduced \nmilitary, let alone be able to allocate the resources--though they are \nmodernizing in certain areas--and their ability to provide the early \nwarning that is necessary is woefully deficient and is weakening every \nsingle day, leading up to the possibility of increasing the likelihood \nof a false warning to their leadership.\n  One of the things the President and President Putin agreed on is that \nwe are going to have this site in Russia for the first time. But the \nRussians are going to be provided data that comes from U.S. computer \nanalysis. They are not going to get it through their own system, or \nthrough their own overhead system, or through their own electronic \nsurveillance; they are going to get it from us.\n  It is likely to give them slightly more confidence. But it is not \ngoing to give them the kind of confidence that is necessary when \ndecisions have to be made very rapidly not to put a launch against the \nUnited States even though the warning they get may be a false warning.\n  The second thing colleagues need to understand as we think about \nimposing--that was a fundamental change in 1998--for the first time on \nthe President that ``thou'' cannot go below the START I agreements, \neven though President Bush did it very successfully in 1991, is that we \nwere not going to allow this President to do it in last year's debate. \nIt was because we were putting pressure on the Duma to ratify. This \nyear, it is a different argument that is being used; we are imposing \nupon the President an unusual and unprecedented restriction at a time \nwhen Russia is not able to come up with the resources they need to \nmaintain the level at 6,000. They are begging us to go to 1,500.\n  It may not be in our interest to go to 1,500, but it is \nunquestionably in our interest to assist them to go to lower levels \nsince they can't maintain the levels they have now. It increases, in a \nparadoxical fashion, the likelihood of an unauthorized accidental \nlaunch and decreases the likely effectiveness, if we are going to have \none, of an effective missile defense system because the Russians aren't \ngoing to launch 10 or 20. The Russians aren't going to launch a \nrelatively small number of not very accurate missiles, as rogue nations \nmight. They have very highly accurate missile systems and large numbers \nof them. They would launch in the hundreds, or perhaps in the \nthousands, based upon a warning that may be inaccurate.\n\n  We are increasing the risk when we force the President to maintain at \na START I level at a time when the Russians are saying we can't afford \nto maintain at that level and begging us to come to some kind of an \nagreement that enables them to go to lower levels.\n  The last argument: Again, if you take a commonsense approach to this \nand just say what the targeting requirements are.\n  A long time ago, or 6 months ago, much of this was classified. But \nincreasing amounts of it are making their way into the public record.\n  It is a very interesting problem because, again, the number of \nnuclear warheads begins as a consequence of a Presidential directive. \nIt goes to STRATCOM. That Presidential directive is then fairly precise \nlanguage. But it still doesn't tell the exact number. It gives them a \nset of instructions that they then follow. They produce what is called \na SIOP. That SIOP has been read by a very small number of elected \nrepresentatives. Very few elected people look at the targeting \nrequirement.\n  Recently, we have seen in published accounts some information which \ngives us some idea of the size of our capacity and the deadliness of \nour capacity.\n  I believe as well it is an unwise conclusion that we ought to \nmaintain at our current level.\n  The Russian nuclear target of a 2,500 force structure would be \nslightly under the START II. START II would take us to 3,000. The \nPentagon says we need 2,500 warheads. Again, that is based upon the \nPentagon taking the Presidential directive they have been given at \n2,500.\n  We have 1,100 nuclear weapons we would put on nuclear sites, 3,500 on \nconventional weapon sites, 160 on leadership, and 500 nuclear weapons \non war-supporting industry.\n  These numbers tend to dull our thinking, making it difficult to \nassess just what it is we are talking about.\n  Let's reverse it. Say the Russians have targeted American territory \nwith 160 nuclear weapons. They don't have a nuclear weapon in the \nstrategic arsenal that is less than the 15-kiloton weapon dropped on \nHiroshima. We dropped two weapons in 1945 that ended the war in the \nPacific. We had a vested interest in that. My uncle was killed in the \nPhilippines. My father was part of an occupation, instead of invasion \nforce. I believe Truman did the right thing. Nonetheless, it is \nimpressive that two 15-kiloton weapons ended the war in the Pacific. We \nare talking about hundreds in this case.\n  Imagine the Russians are only going to hit the United States with 160 \nnuclear weapons averaging 150 to 300 kilotons each. I don't need a \ncomplicated, detailed year-long strategic review to determine that 160 \nnuclear weapons hitting the United States of America would not just do \nslight damage; they would cause massive damage to our economy, to our \npolitical structures, to our social structures. They would produce \nmonstrous losses to us.\n  Ask Alan Greenspan what it would do to the economy. He seems to be \nthe most trusted person right now in trying to get American people to \nbe concerned about things going on in the world. It would produce \ntremendous and devastating losses.\n  The same is true with Russia. Mr. President, 160 nuclear weapons \ninside of Russia would reduce Russia to a state of chaos. It wouldn't \njust damage their leadership and eliminate their leadership. It would \ndo exactly the opposite, in my view, of what we would desire. It would \nproduce the very political instability and chaos we seek to avoid. As a \nconsequence, it likely would not be selected as an option, thereby \nproducing, again, one of the great paradoxes of maintaining a defense \nsystem where we authorize $15 to $20 billion of scarce resources.\n  The chairman of the committee talked earlier about the possible need \nto allocate additional money for retirees' medical care. There is no \nquestion we look across the current conventional forces and we don't \nhave to look far to find a situation where we are flying the wings off \nthe planes. We are having a difficult time sustaining levels of \nreadiness. We are short on the conventional side. At a time when we are \nshort, I don't believe we ought to be expending precious resources into \nareas that are likely to be unnecessary or that are unlikely to be \nused.\n  I am arguing the President ought to go to lower levels. The President \nmay disagree with me. In fact, up until now, the President has \ndisagreed with me and hasn't gone to lower levels. That is why I was \npleasantly surprised at that part of Governor Bush's speech prior to \nthe Memorial Day recess where he said we ought to scrap the old cold \nwar thinking. I agree. We need to assess what kind of weapons system we \nneed to keep the people of the United States of America safe in light \nof the new political realities--not in light of the old mutual assured \ndestruction reality, in light of the new political realities.\n  I believe without extensive and expensive nuclear review, we would \nreach a conclusion of significantly lowering. I don't believe this \nCongress under any circumstance, whether the President agrees with me \nor not, should be imposing this kind of restriction. It ties\n\n[[Page S4546]]\n\nthe President's hands. It limits the President. It forces the President \nto do something that up until 1998 we had not required the President of \nthe United States of America to do. Again there was an argument last \nyear made that this would get the Duma to ratify START II on that \nbasis.\n\n  I said earlier to the distinguished Senator from Virginia, I was \nhoping perhaps my amendment would be accepted, declare victory, and we \nshake hands and say we had a good argument and there is no need to go \nfurther. Indeed, I ask the Senator from Virginia, it may be that what I \nought to do is vote for the Senator's substitute, depending on what it \nis the Senator proposed to do. In this amendment, it appears to be that \nthe President would have the authority to waive the restrictions of \n1302 after a comprehensive review was done. However, in the language of \nthe Senator's amendment, it merely says this is supposed to be done \nconcurrently with the quadrennial review and due to operate in 2001.\n  Does the Senator mean, therefore, that President Clinton couldn't ask \nSecretary Cohen and Secretary Richardson to do an accelerated \ncomprehensive review of the nuclear force structure, and, as a \nconsequence of that review, say perhaps the President says: I want to \ngo to 5500, I want to go below because I think on that basis I could \nget the Russians to agree to accept changes in ABM that might even be \nacceptable to the Senator from Virginia --would that sort of \naccelerated review be possible? It appears it would be in the language \nof the Senator's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n  I remember so well when the Senator brought this up last year. This \nis a serious effort by one of the most serious, conscientious Senators \nwith whom I have ever been privileged to serve and one for whom I have \nthe highest personal and professional regard. As I said some months \nago, this Senator, too, will miss him.\n  We are not trying to abridge, so to speak, the right of President \nClinton. He is the President of the United States. Until the last day, \nthe last hour, the last minute of his term of office, he is entitled to \nexercise the powers given to him under the Constitution. As the Senator \nknows so well, being a student of foreign and international affairs, \nthe Constitution designates the President of the United States as that \nindividual who is our chief foreign policy advisor, negotiator, the \nhome realm authority that goes with the Presidency.\n  I don't wish to be critical, but I will be factual. The President \nsimply did not, in the course of his administration, avail himself of \nthe opportunity to do the indepth type of study that I and other \ncolleagues think is necessary before any decision of the type the \nSenator describes be made.\n  As the Republican candidate, George W. Bush said he would move in \nsome of the directions President Clinton has indicated in terms of \ntrying to seek that level of reduction to the lowest level that still \nprotects the security interests of this country. But George W. Bush \nwould only do that after he had received the advice and counsel of the \nDepartment of Defense, and presumably his own Secretary. But Members of \nthe Joint Chiefs would still be carrying forward, a number of them, \nfrom one administration to the other, and he would carefully counsel \nwith them as he moved forward.\n  My point is, that study cannot be done in 30, 60, or 90 days, in my \njudgment, nor should it be done. Let's face it; we have elections \ncoming this November. We have the heat that accompanies any election \nfrom the debates that take place between the candidates and, most \nspecifically, the Presidential candidates. To try to overlay a decision \nof that magnitude and try to have a report generated in 30, 40, 60, 90 \ndays is not, in my judgment, the wise thing to do.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate that, but there is nothing in the Senator's \namendment that would prevent----\n  Mr. WARNER. I beg your pardon?\n  Mr. KERREY. Let's say Governor Bush is elected and he comes into \noffice and says I have Brent Scowcroft, Henry Kissinger, George \nSchultz, and Colin Powell. They have done a review from November to \nJanuary and they have made a recommendation to go to lower levels. Does \nthe amendment of the Senator allow a President-elect Bush to do that in \nshort order?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is no constraint on the next \nPresident, be it President Bush or President Gore, within which time--I \nmean it is not next December. He can do it before next December.\n  Mr. KERREY. If that is the case, if it does not restrict the next \nPresident, it does not restrict this President. He could also do it. I \nhave had a briefing on the review that was done in 1997, prior to the \nHelsinki meeting between President Clinton and President Yeltsin. That \nwas a detailed review on the minimal deterrent level necessary, done by \nGeneral Shalikashvili. I believe the chairman has had a briefing of \nthat as well. That was a pretty indepth review, was it not? Do you \nregard that as a good review?\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not here to prejudge that review. I think it was \ndone very carefully. But let me bring to the attention of my \ndistinguished colleague, who spent great heroism in his career in the \nmilitary himself, you should not try to make a decision with reference \nto the strategic capabilities of this country without reference, as \nneeded in the quadrennial review, to the convention. In other words, \nyou cannot just look at that in isolation. It has to be examined in the \ncontext of the totality of our military assets, and the quadrennial \nreview has to be done and upgraded.\n  Mr. KERREY. I presume General Shalikashvili, in 1997, made that \nreview.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not in a position to say what he did or did not do.\n  Mr. KERREY. I would be very surprised, if the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, in 1997, reviewing the minimal deterrent level, did \nnot reference that minimal deterrent level to the rest of the \nconventional forces. This is a conventional Army officer who is the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. My guess is that was a pretty \ndetailed review. In fact, he came to the conclusion at that time that \n2,500 is the minimal level that is necessary.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator repeatedly says he presumes. I am not here to \nact on presumptions. What I do know is the realities, and particularly \nthe political realities that face this Nation of an election and a new \nPresident. In my opinion, it is the wiser course of action to defer \nsuch decisions as this until the next President is in office; he has \nhis quadrennial review; he has his detailed study of our strategic \narsenal. Then those decisions.\n  Mr. KERREY. Let me get this correctly. So the intent of this \namendment is to prevent President Clinton from making any decision and \nto----\n  Mr. WARNER. We cannot block this President. Nor would we try.\n  Mr. KERREY. That is precisely what section 1302 does. Section 1302 \nsays the President cannot go below the START I levels. For the first \ntime, it restricted and tied the hands of a President in his own \ndecisionmaking about strategic forces. That is what it did. I sought to \nstrike it last year and was told the concern was the Duma might not \nratify START II. They have done that.\n\n  It seems to me the language gives the President, this President--I am \nasking the question because it affects whether or not I simply just \ndeclare victory myself and support your second-degree amendment. If \nyour second-degree amendment gives the President the flexibility to \nwaive, if he says, ``I have already done that review and I will submit \nto Congress the review that was done by General Shalikashvili in \n1997,'' it may be we have agreement here. But if you are saying the \nintent of the amendment is to say President Clinton, after having been \nCommander in Chief for 7 years, is not sufficiently prepared to make \nthis decision, we need a further review before he can make it, then I \ncouldn't support the second degree.\n  Mr. WARNER. I certainly cannot rely on a 1997 review as being up to \ndate. Much has occurred in those 2 years, indeed over 2 years, to where \nwe are today.\n  Let me give one example. The Russians are strapped financially. One \nof the principal motivations to go to a lower level, on behalf of the \nRussians, is they simply do not have the financial resources to \nmaintain their existing arsenals--the readiness, the safety,\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\nall aspects of those existing arsenals. That is the 1997 assessment. I \nwould not accept that. I would not think President Clinton would want \nto accept it.\n  What I am telling the Senator is that I would like to reply in \ntotality to the Senator's question by giving my statement and then we \ncan perhaps continue this colloquy. Is that an option?\n  Mr. KERREY. That would be an option for me.\n  Mr. President, let me finish my statement, and I will yield to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am anxious to hear the statement. As I said, it may \nbe--expecting that the chairman, the Senator from Virginia, after \nlistening to last year's debate, would merely this year declare victory \nand allow this provision to be struck, it may be I should declare \nvictory and accept this amendment, if it does not restrict the \nCommander in Chief who has had plenty of time to review it--and he may \nnot. As I said, up to now he hasn't agreed that going to lower levels \nin exchange for ABM is a good strategy--and he may not. It may all be \nmoot as far as I know. But if it does not restrict this President, or \nthe incoming President, to make a determination prior to December 2001, \nit may be that I should declare victory and go home as well.\n  I want to repeat something I tried earlier to discuss. I do not think \nit is very well understood by many Members of Congress. I certainly do \nnot think it is very well understood by the American people. I say that \nwith great respect. It has been a voyage that has produced some \nsurprising discoveries on my part as well. I am not suggesting I am \nsmarter, more informed than anybody else. I am merely saying I spent \ntime on this.\n  I am deeply concerned that the threat to the United States of America \nof an accidental and unauthorized launch from Russia goes up every \nsingle day that we maintain the force structure as high as we currently \nhave. We have plenty of safety. We have plenty of redundancy. We have \nplenty of capacity to tell whether we are actually being attacked or \nwhether the signals are false.\n\n  The Russians do not have any of that or they have a declining amount \nof it. We are forcing them to maintain at levels, in my view, that are \nincreasing the danger to the people of the United States of America. \nThe danger is enhanced as a consequence of our sort of presuming maybe \nthere is no real risk.\n  I put these numbers out. This is the minimal level. This is what the \nPentagon said in 1997. It is what the Pentagon is currently saying is \nstill valid: That the minimal level we need in the number of warheads \nis 2,500. The reason we need 2,500 is, according to the people who do \nthe targeting--again, they are doing the targeting based upon a \nPresidential directive, presumably evaluated by the Congress after we \ndo the directing and tell them what needs to be done--there are 2,260 \nvital Russian nuclear targets.\n  These are on active alert. We are ready to attack. We are not talking \nabout the kinds of missiles that might miss by a couple of miles. These \nthings are going to hit. They are very accurate; they are very \nsophisticated; and they are very reliable. We have 1,100 nuclear \ntargets. That is to say the Russians hold nuclear weapons. So 1,100 of \nour nuclear warheads --and we do not have one under 100 kilotons--are \ngoing to be targeted on 1,100 Russian nuclear sites.\n  Then there are conventional sites, conventional weapons sites--500 \ntargets; 500 targets. I urge my colleagues to get a map out of Russia \nand try to come up with 500 targets on top of 1,100 targets of nuclear \nweapon sites. Part of this debate needs to be done in the open so we \ncan do a commonsense check as to whether or not we have more than we \nactually need, again forcing the Russians to maintain more than they \ncan control.\n  Mr. President, 160 leadership targets. These are the guys to whom we \ntalk. We have a meeting with them: President Putin, would you agree to \nmodify ABM? And oh, by the way, we have 160 nuclear weapons of 100 \nkilotons or more targeted on you and all the rest of the Russian \nleadership. Try to come up with 160 targets. Get a Russian map out and \nput 160 targets up, or 500 targets, on something called war-supporting \nindustry. This is all published accounts. This is not me coming out of \nthe Intelligence Committee or some top secret briefing; this is now \npublished accounts of this targeting. It is vital for the American \npeople to understand that; otherwise they are going to say to the \nCongress: Just keep doing what you are doing; it seems to be working.\n  The longer we continue doing what we are doing, the more likely it is \nthat the horrible, unimaginable disaster occurs and that is an \naccidental unauthorized launch against the United States of America on \nthe people of America and that the people suffer as a result.\n  I have no idea if President Clinton would do an expedited review and \nsay: I am going to try to strike a deal with President Putin that will \nallow us to go to lower levels of ABM to solve the stalemate we have \nover missile defense. He may not take the option.\n  Whether he takes the option or not, I believe it is unwise for us to \nbe tying the hands of President Clinton. I think it would be unwise to \ntie the hands of President Gore, President Bush, or any President in \nthis fashion. We had never done it up to 1998. There may have been a \ncompelling argument prior to the Duma's ratification of START II, but \nthere is no longer a compelling argument, in my view, and it would be a \nmistake for us to have this continuing limitation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I am thoroughly enjoying this opportunity. It is an \nimportant amendment. Let me start by allowing those who are following \nthe amendment to understand what it is our distinguished colleague \nwishes to do. By his amendment, he wishes to repeal the limitation on \nretirement or dismantlement of strategic nuclear delivery systems in \nexcess of military requirements. ``Section 1302 of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for fiscal year 1998 is repealed.''\n  The thrust of what he is trying to repeal limits the President of the \nUnited States to certain levels of strategic systems. Are we agreed on \nthat? Does the Senator have a copy?\n  Mr. KERREY. My amendment simply says:\n\n       Strike section 1017 and insert the following:\n       Sec. 1017. Repeal of Limitation on Retirement or \n     Dismantlement--\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Does the Senator have a copy of section 1017 he can print \nin the Record?\n  Mr. KERREY. It is 1017 of the authorization--\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand that. The repeal of the limitation in a \nprevious authorization act of 1998--does the Senator have a copy of \n1998?\n  Mr. KERREY. Section 1302 of the Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mr. WARNER. Section 1302 of 1998. I left mine in the office \ninadvertently.\n  Mr. KERREY. Staff is searching, trying to get an answer. I do have \nit.\n  Mr. WARNER. My distinguished ranking member is always prepared. We \nwant to make sure the Senator from Nebraska has a copy.\n  Mr. KERREY. The answer is yes. The Senator from Virginia and I are \nlooking at, I believe, the same thing.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. We are looking at the conference report \nfor the 1998 authorization bill on page 330, section 1302, ``Limitation \non Retirement or Dismantlement of Strategic Nuclear Delivery Systems.''\n  Mr. KERREY. I am looking at the public law.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is the same thing.\n  Mr. KERREY. My guess is it is pretty close.\n  Public Law 105-85 says:\n\n       (a) Funding Limitation.--Funds available to the Department \n     of Defense may not be obligated or expended during fiscal \n     year 1998 for retiring or dismantling, or for preparing to \n     retire or dismantle, any of the following strategic \n     nuclear delivery systems below the specified levels:\n       (1) 71 B-52H bomber aircraft.\n       (2) 18 Trident ballistic missile submarines.\n\n  I note that under current law, I believe you have given flexibility \nto go from 18 to 14; at least you have allowed it to happen.\n\n       (3) 500 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n       (4) 50 Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\n\n  All of which total, by my rough calculation, slightly more than \n6,000, which is the START limitation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Wouldn't the distinguished colleague from Nebraska say \nthat there Congress expressed its will and put limitations on the \npowers of the President?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine, and that is precisely what the Senator wants to \ntake out.\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Let us frame the argument from that. Congress has already \ndone it. The question is: Should we continue, if we put this into \npermanent law now, so it is permanent? Am I not correct on that?\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Virginia comes along and says there \ncould be merit in waiving this and a future President should have the \noption to waive it, provided he does certain preliminary steps as \noutlined in the amendment of the Senator of Virginia. Are we agreeable \nwith that interpretation?\n  Mr. KERREY. No, I would be agreeable if the Senator from Virginia \nsays----\n  Mr. WARNER. We may not agree, but do we understand that is what I am \nendeavoring to do?\n  Mr. KERREY. That may be what you are endeavoring to do, but I am not \nsure your amendment does it. You are saying with your amendment that \nyou want to make certain President Clinton cannot do it but future \nPresidents could.\n  Mr. WARNER. What I am saying, practically speaking, is I do not think \nPresident Clinton can do it in a judicious and effective way, given the \ntime limitations between now and the end of his term of office.\n  Mr. KERREY. That is an interpretation on which perhaps we should have \na colloquy. If we can reach a conclusion that the President could do an \neffective review in short order, it may be, as I said, that I am going \nto declare victory and go home and maybe support your second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. In the first place, the law of the land is still intact \nuntil the Senate and, indeed, the House are in conference and the \nPresident signs this bill. At the moment, the law of the land precludes \nhim from doing that.\n  What I am trying to offer is a relevant course of action whereby the \nnext President has the opportunity to address this situation in the \ncontext of a fresh QDR and a fresh up-to-date analysis of all the \nstrategic threats, what the other nations possess, and the like. That \nis effectively what I am trying to do.\n  Mr. KERREY. By effectively doing that, you are also saying that the \ncurrent QDR, the current evaluation, is not valid; that the analysis \nthat was done in 1997 by General Shalikashvili is not valid?\n  Mr. WARNER. I say it is outdated. Mr. President, 1994 is when the \nlast assessment was made.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my colleague permit a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I also owe the Senator an answer on a \nprocedural matter which I am prepared to, regrettably, give, but I will \ngive it to him.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I want to follow up on what the Senator from Nebraska said, and I \nstrongly support what the Senator from Nebraska is trying to achieve. I \nask the Senator from Virginia if he will agree that START II was signed \nby the United States of America and was ratified.\n  Mr. WARNER. Factual.\n  Mr. KERRY. And the Senator agrees that now START II has also been \nratified by the Russian Duma.\n  Mr. WARNER. But with certain appendages thereto.\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree. I understand.\n  The Senator is correct. The Russian Duma ratified START II with the \nunderstanding that they had to have the successor states to the ABM \nTreaty ultimately recognized by the United States, and there are a \nseries of bilateral agreements they want us to ratify, and because the \nSenator from North Carolina, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, is fundamentally opposed to these changes, we are stuck. But \nthe larger interests of the United States of America are to make the \nworld and this country safer.\n  We decided, as a matter of policy, I say to the Senator from \nVirginia, that the world will be safer if we move to reduce weapons to \nthe levels of START II. In fact, it is the policy of the United States \nof America now to engage in negotiations toward START III, but no one \nwhom I know, who is rational at least--and I absolutely include the \ndistinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee as among the \nmost rational and most thoughtful people on this subject--nobody is \nsuggesting that we would not want to reduce from the level of 6,000-\nplus warheads and try to move in the direction of START II. I assume \nthe Senator agrees.\n  Mr. WARNER. I simply say to my distinguished colleague, before this \nSenator expresses a view on that, I want to see a new quadrennial \nreview, as well as a new analysis of our strategic system. I will not \ncommit to any numbers at this time until I see that. That is \nessentially what our candidate George W. Bush has said.\n  Mr. KERRY. I interpret what the candidate, George W. Bush, said \nsomewhat differently, and I read his speech closely the other day.\n  It was my understanding he said he is prepared to unilaterally reduce \nweapons no matter what the Russians do. He also wants to accompany that \nwith a fairly robust national missile defense system.\n  I again say to my colleague, I think the Senator from Nebraska is on \ntarget. Look, the former Soviet Union, what remains of it, Russia, has \nan extraordinarily weak command and control system.\n  As a current member of the Intelligence Committee, and the Senator \nfrom Virginia shares that, we know full well that one of the greatest \nsingle threats to the United States of America today is threat \nreduction efforts. To suggest that the United States, that our \ncitizens, are safer with more warheads and more active missiles being \nleft in place, with an army that is not being paid, with command and \ncontrol that is disintegrating and degrading, is a very hard thing for \nme to understand.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might reply, I raised that issue \nearlier. One of the reasons, motivations for the Russians to drive to \nlower figures as soon as they can possibly get there is the inability \nfiscally to maintain their own structure in a readiness posture, which \nequates to what they have had in years past.\n  Mr. KERRY. I agree.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a risk.\n  Mr. KERRY. But I ask my colleague, if you understand their economic \nneed, because they cannot maintain the warheads properly, and we are \nworried about accidental launch, how can you then want to prohibit the \nPresident of the United States from conceivably making us safer by \nwanting to mutually move to a level where we are both safer because we \nhave a number of missiles that are able to be maintained properly and \nthe balance of power is correct?\n  Mr. WARNER. I give to my colleague two responses: No. 1--and I am not \ntrying to be critical of this President's administration--why didn't \nthey do that several years ago? Because the deterioration of the \ninfrastructure and the financial situation in Russia has been an \nongoing situation for several years. It commenced under Yeltsin.\n  Mr. KERRY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why didn't your President take those initiatives several \nyears ago?\n  What I am saying to you now is, before this President or any other \nPresident begins to make an assessment of a magnitude such as this, \nthey better have in place an up-to-date analysis. That is essentially \nwhat I am saying.\n  For the record, I would like to read from the George W. Bush \nstatement:\n\n       As President, I will ask the Secretary of Defense to \n     conduct an assessment on our nuclear posture and determine \n     how best to meet our security needs. While the exact number \n     of weapons can come only from such an assessment, I will \n     pursue the lowest possible number consistent with our \n     national security.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is ironic that a Democrat would be here \ninterpreting the words of the putative Republican nominee. But let me \nsay to my colleague, he very clearly talked about unilateral \nreductions. His father, President Bush, also was supportive of and \nnegotiated the policy of START II and wanted to move in that direction.\n  Now START II takes us down to 3,000 warheads. I do not know anybody \nin\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\nthe world of nuclear assessments--you look at the SIOPs. I think there \nare public targeting figures that do not violate classification. But I \nwill be careful with this because I do not want to violate it.\n\n  Let me just say that the Senator well knows that the SIOPs plans of \nthe United States have a number of targets that are well taken care of \nby the current levels of START II, which is why the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, the Pentagon, and everybody signed off on it.\n  In today's world, in a non-cold-war world, the greatest threat is a \nrusty freighter hobbling its way into New York Harbor, or nearby, and \nhas the potential to launch a cruise missile at us, or the greater \nthreat is some group of terrorists assembling in New York the multiple \nparts of a nuclear weapon and holding us hostage, or, as we saw in \nJapan with the sarin gas attack, terrorists who want to cripple the \ncommunity through chemical or biological warfare.\n  Those threats chill me far more than the concept of reducing to 3,000 \nweapons over the course of the next years. It is going to happen. No \nmatter what the Senator from Virginia says about the next quadrennial \nreview, I am willing to bet my seat in the Senate that this country is \ngoing to move, together with others, to reduce the levels of weapons to \nat least 3,000. The debate today is not whether we ought to be at \n3,000. The debate today is whether or not 1,000, 1,500, 2,200 to 2,500 \nare the appropriate levels.\n  So why on Earth we would want to hobble the ability of the President \nof the United States to make this country safer by reducing to the \nlevel already agreed upon by Republican and Democrat negotiators alike \nis absolutely beyond me.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply say to my colleague, the Congress \nhas done it. Why do we want to hobble? They did it. Last year our \ncolleague brought up the amendment, vigorously argued it, and it was \ndefeated. So Congress did it again.\n  Mr. KERRY. There was a reason, Mr. President. It is because the \nRussian Duma had not ratified. Everybody understood the rationale for \nthat. But now they have ratified it. And the only restraint on our \nmoving to a safer world is the fact that the Senate Foreign Relations \nchairman is unwilling to bring it to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not going to single out the Foreign Relations \nchairman, but I make the following observation. That is, this is the \nlaw of the land. We are giving the opportunity to the next President to \ndo the necessary studies.\n  Supposing President Clinton took such actions, which under the \nConstitution I presume he can--except that the law is pretty explicit \nhere, unless it is repealed--and laid down a set of numbers which the \nnext President, whomever it may be, finds unacceptable after he does \nthe requisite studies, not only of the nuclear posture but also the \nconventional. You have to do them together. Then what happens?\n  The next President is faced with the dilemma of trying to refute what \nPresident Clinton did. That would be the worst of both worlds.\n  Mr. KERRY. May I ask the distinguished Senator from Virginia, with \nall his years of experience--he has been on the inside of these \nnegotiations; there is nobody with a stronger career with respect to \nthis--can he really say to me, in this current climate, with the \nproblems of the Russians in reducing and maintaining their current \nweapons, he can really envision the scenario which would require us to \nreverse a builddown to the 3,000 level?\n\n  Mr. WARNER. First, I thank my colleague for his comments with regard \nto me. But, No. 1, I never commented on SIOPs. I think that is a \nclassification that should not in any way be breached.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator from Virginia yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Let me finish. Then, not addressing the SIOPs in any \nway--I think you understand why we should not do that--I believe that \nit is unwise, given the current posture of the studies and the fact \nthat on the face they are not up to date--certainly there has been no \nrevelation that these studies are up to date--that we should be making \ndecisions with regard to numbers at this time. I simply will not put my \nfinger on any particular number. Your assumption is reasonable, but I \nam not going to accede to it.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend, he talks about the law of the \nland. When you sign a treaty and the Senate has ratified it, it is the \nlaw of the land. Technically speaking, under international law, it is \nthe law of the land when you sign it. When it is ratified, it is even \nmore so the law of the land.\n  I realize that technically speaking the SALT II does not, in effect, \ngo into full effect until we pass on the codicils. But that is such a \ntechnicality in the context of what we are trying to achieve in the \nworld. We are the leader of the free world. We used to be the most \nimportant force in the world for nonproliferation efforts. We used to \nmake the most important efforts to try to encourage other countries to \ntoe the line on nuclear weapons.\n  If we are now going to suggest that having put into law and ratified \na treaty, we are unwilling to reduce these levels of nuclear weapons at \na time we know Russia is growing more and more unsafe in its capacity \nto maintain them, we are not acting in the interests of the American \npeople and making them safer.\n  I say respectfully to my friend from Virginia, in the next 6 months \nthere is ample opportunity for any President to step in, a new \nPresident, and say: I do not want to continue these levels. But we have \nan opportunity here to make the law of the land on this bill in effect \ncarry through properly. I strongly hope my colleagues will do so \nbecause it is the right thing to do.\n  I thank the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have enjoyed my colloquy with my \ndistinguished colleague from Massachusetts.\n  I would like to present my amendment at an appropriate time. Has the \npresentation of the presenter, the distinguished Senator from Nebraska, \nconcluded?\n  Is this an appropriate juncture, because I don't want to encroach on \nthe opportunity for him to fully give his presentation?\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator is not encroaching. I stand by and look \nforward to his argument.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee on \nstrategic affairs seeking some recognition. I would like to accommodate \nhim. I have had more than adequate opportunity to debate these points.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to point out that the Strategic \nSubcommittee, which I chair, has been realizing that times are changing \nand we need to reevaluate and reassess our nuclear forces. In fact, if \nyou look in the bill, we have set up a couple of studies: a revised \nnuclear posture review in section 1015. Another is a plan for a long-\nterm sustainment of modernization of U.S. strategic nuclear forces in \nsection 1016.\n  We recognize that times are changing. But this is very serious \nbusiness. When you are talking about a balance of power between the \nUnited States and the rest of the world--and in this particular case, \nRussia, the former U.S.S.R.--we are talking about very serious \nbusiness. I don't think this decision should be made by one person. \nThat is why we have set up this posture review process. We suggested it \nin the bill we have introduced in the full committee and now it is part \nof the bill. Apparently, this sort of mantle was picked up by \nPresidential candidate George W. Bush. An important part of his \ncomments is that there be a posture review, a careful analysis of where \nwe are with our nuclear forces. I think your amendment is carrying \nforward with what the Strategic Subcommittee suggests and the Armed \nServices Committee and even candidate for the Presidency George W. \nBush.\n  I support the chairman in his amendment to ask for a posture review \nbefore we move forward. If I am not a cosponsor on that amendment, I \nwill ask that I be added because I think it is very important. No \nmatter who is President, I don't think one single person should be \nmaking these decisions without a careful review from those people who \nknow what they are doing in the Department of Defense.\n  As I understand the chairman's amendment, it does call for that very \ncareful review. There is one thing I would like to comment on before I \nyield. The Warner substitute amendment, as I understand it, would \nprovide\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\nauthority for the President to waive the limitations in current law \nregarding the retirement of strategic nuclear delivery systems once the \nSecretary of Defense has completed the Nuclear Posture Review required \nby section 1015, which I referred to earlier in my comments. The \namendment of the Senator from Nebraska, as I understand it, would not \nbe consistent with the policy enunciated by Governor Bush, nor would it \nsatisfy the concerns that Congress has raised for the last 5 years. It \nwould lead to misguided and uninformed reductions, in my view, rather \nthan a force posture based on careful review of all our strategic \nrequirements and how these relate to our overall national military \npolicy. I think the chairman is headed in the right direction.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may, I will make one observation and \nthen I will step back. This provision in the bill that is currently \nbefore the Senate was done in, first, the subcommittee of which the \nSenator is chairman.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. It was brought to a markup, at which time any Senators on \nthat side of the aisle could have objected to it. There was no \nobjection. In fact, as I have looked at the record, it was accepted and \nvoted on unanimously by the entire committee, recognizing the \nimportance of having such a review done timely before any analysis \ncould be made as to future levels of weaponry; am I not correct?\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is correct. This issue was not brought up in \nsubcommittee or full committee that I recall.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield on that narrow point, this \nlanguage was significantly amended in committee, if I may say so. It \nwasn't offered in that form. It was amended. This language here is not \nthe issue. The issue is that the amendment of the Senator from Virginia \nsays that this President and the next President cannot take an action \nuntil after a certain action is taken at the end of 2001. That was \nnever discussed in committee. It is not part----\n  Mr. WARNER. Any time before. It doesn't limit it to the end of 2001. \nIt could be done earlier on.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Oh, it can be?\n  Mr. WARNER. With the next President.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield on that, the \nlanguage of the Senator's amendment doesn't say that. That was the \nquestion I was going to ask the Senator from Colorado. It doesn't \npreclude the President from doing a review before December 2001. The \nSenator from Virginia was saying so long as it is Gore or Bush, it is \nOK; but if it is Clinton, it is not.\n  This is June 6, the day Franklin Delano Roosevelt, while going \nthrough a Presidential campaign, authorized the landing on the beaches \nof Normandy. There was bipartisan support for it. He was running \nagainst Dewey at the time, and he was courageous enough to say we were \ngoing to have a bipartisan foreign policy.\n  The thing that concerns me is that we are losing that. We are saying \nPresident Clinton can't do it. If it is Bush or Gore, fine, they can do \nit, but Clinton can't. I think that is a signal that we are not \nwilling--for example, the Senator said earlier President Bush signed \nSTART II after the November election and authorized troops to go to \nSomalia late in his term. We understood it was late in his term and \nthat he might not have won the election, but, by gosh, the President \nhad the authority to make these decisions right up to the end of his \nterm. This amendment seems to be saying, although I think the language \nof the amendment--I am trying to ascertain whether or not I should vote \nfor this amendment because it appears the language would allow the \nPresident to do an expedited review. It doesn't say he can't have it \ndone earlier. It may be that the Senator's intent is to prevent \nPresident Clinton from doing it. But I don't believe the language of \nthe amendment does that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thought the Senator from Virginia was controlling the \ntime.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask the Senator from Colorado, is it his understanding \nthat this language would prevent a President Bush from doing a review \nthat could be done in 60 days from, let's say, either the time of his \nelection or the time he is sworn in as President? Would it prevent an \nexpedited review? Say he has Colin Powell or former National Security \nAdviser Brent Scowcroft and Henry Kissinger and George Shultz advising \nhim, and the four of them say we believe he ought to go to 5,000, \nand the Secretary of Energy is going to notify Bush on February 1; \nwould your amendment preclude that?\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. In my view, and the way I read the amendment--and I think \nyou are missing the main point of the amendment--is that you have a \ncareful review before making a decision. From a practical standpoint, \nhopefully, it is not going to be an easy decision arrived at. If you \nare using February as an example, I think it may be possible, because \nif you look into it, it says after the quadrennial review of 2001.\n  Mr. KERREY. No. It says concurrent, which, as I read the language of \nthis amendment, would cause me not to vote for it. It doesn't preclude \nPresident Clinton or Bush or Gore from saying we can finish that part \nof the review faster than the rest of the review and have the Secretary \nof Energy submit it to Congress for congressional consideration. By the \nway, you can strike this provision and there is no guarantee at all \nthat President Clinton is going to take any action. He hasn't thus far. \nHe hasn't asked for authority.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The important point is that we have careful review of our \nnuclear posture. I think it should be done with a lot of consultation \nwith a lot of different people, other than only the President and his \nimmediate surrounding staff. I think the amendment of Senator Warner \ndoes that. I think it is certainly compatible and consistent with what \nthe committee has been thinking in terms of the studies they think are \nnecessary, both in long-term as well as short-term posturing with the \nnuclear forces. Personally, I think probably there is going to be an \nopportunity for us to reduce some of our nuclear forces. But it has to \nbe done with a lot of forethought and careful study. I don't think we \nare going to solve that on the Senate floor. I think it is going to \ntake people who know and understand all the details of the program--\nboth ours as well as throughout the world--to make this decision. I \ndon't think it can be made quickly.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator's answer is yes, for a new President. He \ncould do it as long as he is satisfied with the definition of ``careful \nreview.'' He could do it prior to December of 2001. According to this \namendment, it has to be submitted by 2001. So a careful review could be \ndone before December 2001.\n  I am trying to get the Senator to talk me into voting for his \namendment. That is what I am attempting to do here. If the answer is \nyes, as it appears to be, you may not want President Clinton to make \nthe decision. By the way, I think it is unlikely that he will. He \nhasn't thus far.\n  I just think it would not be a good thing for us to say that we are \ngoing to put a restriction on this President that we are not going to \nput on the President-elect, whoever that happens to be.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would like to respond to that. On page 4 of the Warner \namendment, it says after submission of a report, consult with the new \nCongress in subsection (c).\n  I think if those positions are met, we can move forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might interject myself, as this is \ndrawn, I can easily amend it so that the next President can bring about \nthe necessary infrastructure of studies and have them completed on a \ntimetable to accelerate it so it is not tied to December. The way this \nis drawn, it is due in December. But I do not interpret that to \npreclude an earlier assessment by the next President.\n  What I say to the Senator most respectfully is, practically speaking, \nunder the current administration you have several years in which to do \nthis work and bring it up to date. It simply has not been done.\n  I just think, practically speaking, this President would be ill-\nadvised to try in the remaining period of a few months to do this type \nof important thing and to have these studies suddenly brought up.\n  Mr. KERREY. First of all, I think it would be a very unwise thing to \ndo.\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\n  Again, as I indicated earlier, President Bush took action on START II \nafter the election of 1992. President Bush committed troops to Somalia \nlate in his term without getting my objection to do it. I wasn't going \nto draw a line in the sand late in his term if he saw a threat to this \nNation. And if he had a policy, I would agree with that policy. I was \nnot going to prevent him from doing it simply because it would be late. \nI think that would be inadvisable.\n  I look at the language of the amendment. I don't see any need to do \nin the amendment what the Senator is saying. It seems to me that the \nlanguage of the amendment says it has to be submitted by December 2001, \nbut also there is language in there precluding President Clinton, if he \ncould, to accelerate a review if he chose to.\n  I am trying to get the Senator to talk me into voting for his \namendment because it seems to me the language of his amendment would \nallow the President, if he chose to, to do the review just as \nPresident-elect Bush or President-elect Gore could do.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the Senator from Nebraska has carefully pointed \nout that some clarification of this December timeframe is desirable. I \nwill begin to draft it immediately and hope he can accept some.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it is not desirable, if the Senator from \nVirginia seeks to get additional support. I am saying that as long as \nhe keeps the language the way it is right now, I can interpret this in \na way that allows President Clinton to do so if he chooses. Again, I \nsay to my good friends on that side that President Clinton hasn't \nindicated any desire to do so.\n\n  Why would we want to draft this amendment so that it prevented an \nexisting President from doing something that a new President could do \nif the existing President hasn't demonstrated any willingness to do so \nin the first place?\n  It seems to me if Congress is saying we just do not trust this \nparticular President, and we are not going to allow him to do that, it \nis a very bad signal. It signals to people that may have a bad intent \ntoward the United States of America that they might be able to get away \nwith things. They might be able to do things in this current \nenvironment as a consequence of Congress not willing to allow what \nnormally the Commander in Chief would be allowed to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Warner amendment, maybe \nI can offer a little solace to my colleague from Nebraska, which I \nthink is consistent with the intent of the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  First of all, as the Senator from Colorado pointed out, the primary \npoint of the Warner amendment is to ensure that two specific studies \nare done; that this cannot be done just on the certification of the \nPresident. That is the primary distinction between this amendment and \nthe amendment from the Senator from Nebraska.\n  With respect to those two studies, one of them is the quadrennial \nreview. That is the review that Congress now requires of the President \nevery 4 years. It is a very long set of requirements that take all of \nthe defense needs of the country into account in a coordinated, \nstructured way.\n  It is in that context that I believe, incidentally, Governor Bush \nwould probably want to have this review done. I can't speak for \nGovernor Bush. But I am certain after having talked to him that he has \nin mind approaching our defense structure generally in a somewhat \ndifferent way than the past administration has. He has some different \nstrategies in mind.\n  My guess is that he would want the nuclear review to be done \nconsistent with the quadrennial review so that the Nuclear Posture \nReview would be coordinated with the quadrennial review. That is \nprecisely what the Warner amendment calls for. It says:\n\n       The secretary of defense shall submit to Congress in \n     unclassified and classified forms as necessary a report on \n     the result of the Nuclear Posture Review concurrently with \n     the Quadrennial Defense Review due in December of 2001.\n\n  The Senator from Nebraska is quite correct. That report would be \naccelerated some. As a practical matter, however, it is not going to be \naccelerated to the point that would occur in the year 2000, and as a \nresult it would, in fact, occur during the next administration--not \nthis administration, the way the amendment is written, at least as I \nread it.\n  While it does not tie the Nuclear Posture Review to a specific date, \nit does say that it should be submitted concurrently with the QDR, \nwhenever that happens to be submitted.\n  I think that is the answer to the Senator's question. I think this is \na very reasonable approach. I hope the Senator will support the \namendment for that reason.\n\n  I again go back to primarily the point that was made, and that is \nthat we have two different approaches. One relies on just the \ncertification of the President that he thinks this is a good thing to \ndo. The other specifically requires him to do the Nuclear Posture \nReview and the quadrennial review and to submit those two concurrently. \nThen the President can, if need be, bring the force structure down.\n  I would like to make one other point, if I could. If the Senator from \nNebraska wishes to interrupt me, that is fine.\n  The second point I want to make is this: There is a tendency to speak \nin just sort of hypothetical terms about numbers: Well, 6,000 is a lot \nor 3,000 seems more reasonable.\n  What everyone really needs to understand is that we are talking about \none of the most complex sets of interrelated considerations that exist \nin our defense strategic posture.\n  The Senator from Nebraska, as the vice chairman of the Intelligence \nCommittee until very recently, appreciates this point as well as \nanyone. I know that. Among the things that have to be considered, for \nexample, in bringing the number of warheads down, are two things: \nFirst, though we all talk in terms of warheads, the Senator from \nNebraska knows and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee knows \nthat isn't what we really count. We count delivery systems. Those \ndelivery systems include ICBMs, missiles on submarines, and bombers, \nwhich are the three legs of the triad that deliver the warheads.\n  Here is just one consideration that goes into this equation. The \nUnited States has a need to project its conventional forces. We are the \nsuperpower of the world. We try to keep peace in parts of the world \nwhen other nations cannot do so because among other things, we have the \nreach to get to those places. We recently involved those forces in \nKosovo, and before that we did it in the gulf war. In both cases we \nused our bomber forces.\n  Some of these bomber forces, such as the B-2 bomber, clearly count in \nterms of strategic warheads. If we were to bring the strategic warheads \ndown too far, the result of that would be to take out of service \nbombers which we need not just for strategic purposes but for \nconventional purposes as well.\n  That is why this gets to be a pretty complicated matter and why it \nshouldn't be done quickly. It certainly shouldn't be done merely for \npolitical reasons. I am not suggesting that any President would do \nthat.\n  That is why clearly a Nuclear Posture Review is critical to any \nproposal that the President would make in this regard or any decision \nhe would announce. Because you are talking about the interrelationship \nbetween conventional and strategic forces, you should tie this to the \nQDR as well.\n  That is why the Warner amendment very wisely says the Nuclear Posture \nReview, and the quadrennial review should be submitted concurrently, \nand that when they are, the President could make a decision to reduce \nour warheads below that called for by this agreement.\n  One more point in response to a point that the Senator from \nMassachusetts made earlier. The inference of his remarks was now that \nSTART II has been ratified by both the United States and Russia, there \nis no reason why we can't bring these warhead numbers down. But that is \nnot true. START II has not been ratified unconditionally by the Duma. \nThe Duma in Russia ratified START II with conditions, and until those \nconditions are satisfied, Russia will not submit its articles of \nratification. They will not become effective. Until they are deposited \nwith the appropriate international body, and I believe it is Geneva, \nSwitzerland,\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nthe Duma ratification of START II is not effective. It is conditional \nupon two things that the U.S. won't approve: the so-called \nmultilateralization agreement and another agreement which limits the \nway in which our tactical missile defenses could be arrayed.\n  We are at a stalemate in terms of START II. That is why it is \ninaccurate to argue that since both countries have now ratified START \nII, the President might as well bring the numbers down. That is not \ntrue. There may be good reason to bring those numbers down irrespective \nof START II, but it is not an argument that because both countries have \nratified START II, now the President should bring the warhead numbers \ndown. In point of fact, START II has not yet been legally ratified by \nRussia.\n  The bottom line is I agree with President Bush. I take it, to some \nextent based upon what I know of Senator Kerrey's comments, that we \nought to make a determination which makes sense for America. The world \nis different now than it used to be. The President ought to, upon \nproper review, determine the size of our nuclear strategic forces.\n  Where I think perhaps we may have a disagreement, although perhaps he \nnow is convinced, is that rather than simply saying the President can \nhave that authority and can exercise it irrespective of what the \nCongress did last year in passing the law that said no, rather than \ntaking that approach, it makes much more sense to ensure that the \nPresident makes this decision with the calm, cool reflection of the \nquadrennial review and the strategic nuclear posture review having been \ndone. When those two things are done and submitted concurrently, it \nwill be an appropriate time for the President then to make this \ndecision.\n  Mr. KERREY. First, I appreciate very much the statement of the \nSenator from Arizona. We have been together on a number of occasions \nbefore the intelligence committee and in the public environment talking \nabout the threat of the missiles, especially from rogue states. I have \nenjoyed those associations very much.\n  He is quite right; the systems are extremely complicated. We do talk \nabout warheads and we ought to focus on the platforms. One of the \nproblems is that it is very rare we have a chance to focus on any of \nthese. It is debated too little, in my view. These are not bullets; \nthese are very complicated systems. If you are the STRATCOM, you have a \nPresidential directive that tells you what you are supposed to do. \nAgain, that is where it all begins, with a Presidential directive and a \nPPD 60 that was updated during the Clinton administration. You set \nforth talents. You are the CINC in charge of this. You have ICBMs, \nsubmarine launch ballistic missiles; you have your bombers at your \ndisposal; and you are calculating whether they will be reliable, \nwhether they are available, whether they will be able to do what that \nPresidential directive says you have to do. I am challenging the \nPresidential directive, the policy itself.\n  As I understand it, I thought earlier we could have some flexibility \nin this amendment. I am uncomfortable tying this thing to quadrennial \nreview. I don't want to speak for the administration. I am not on the \nArmed Services Committee so I haven't been there when they made the \npresentations, but I have, as a consequence of being provoked to do so, \nrequested a briefing from STRATCOM that was given to General \nShalikashvili in 1997 and was presented to the Armed Services \nCommittee. I believe both the chairman and ranking member received that \nbriefing, as well. I am satisfied that is a current analysis. I am \nsatisfied that it needs relatively little attention.\n  I don't agree with what the chairman has said, saying that the \nPresident has not been evaluating this over the last 7 years. He has \narms control negotiators. In fact, he has resisted pressure from this \nside of the aisle to do the very thing I am talking about right now. He \nhas been unwilling to do it; he has been unwilling to go lower, to do \nthe thing that President Bush did in 1991.\n  I am not certain, even if this section were stricken, that the \nPresident would take any action, but I am not willing to accept that \nthere hasn't been a sufficient amount of review done on this, and I \nthink it would be unwise, as I hear now, not only restricting President \nClinton but restricting President-elect Bush or President-elect Gore.\n  Earlier in a colloquy with the author of the amendment, it seemed \nthere was some flexibility. But I hear the Senator from Arizona saying, \nno, there is not; it would have to be submitted concurrent with the \nquadrennial review, which is expected in December of 2001, and it may \nnot be done 2001. It could take longer than December of 2001. We are \nsaying that the current President and future Presidents could not, if \nthey got an attractive offer from the Russians to accept the kind of \nmodifications in ABM that permit a vigorous deployment of missile \ndefense along the lines of what Governor Bush is talking about, this \nwould prohibit Governor Bush from doing that unless we came in and \nchanged the law again.\n  I think we should not be tying the hands of the President in these \nkinds of negotiations. What current law does, as modified by the \nSenator from Virginia, is to untie it slightly, but as I understand it \nnow and if the Senator from Virginia agrees regarding the explanation \nof the Senator from Arizona in an earlier evaluation, that could not be \ndone, but only submitted concurrent with the submission of the \nquadrennial review.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERREY. I yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My understanding is the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Virginia would have to make a decision on this because it \nis his amendment. But my understanding is that the decision of the \nPresident to lower the force structure--what he negotiates is a totally \ndifferent issue. We are not limiting what the President can negotiate \nin terms of a treaty which will then be submitted to the Senate.\n  We are talking about a force structure which has to be maintained, \nsubject to being changed either by treaty when ratified becomes the law \nof the land, or by a subsequent law.\n  What this language does, as I understand it, and I think I partly \nagree with the Senator from Arizona, is that he could not lower the \nforce structure until that Quadrennial Defense Review and Nuclear \nPosture Review are submitted. I think that is the way the amendment \nreads.\n  However, I think I agree with what the Senator from Virginia \nsuggested before, which is if that Quadrennial Defense Review and \nNuclear Posture Review is submitted before December of 2001, at that \npoint this waiver could be exercised by a President.\n  Mr. KYL. That is exactly my understanding, too. That is precisely the \nway I think it reads.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERREY. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What is interesting to me is that there has been an \nargument from the Senator from Virginia and our good friend from \nArizona that there should be a review; until there is a review, there \nshould not be a reduction in our force from START I levels.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There was a review in 1994--1994. In 1994, the START II \nlevel was deemed to be adequate by the chiefs. There was a nuclear \nposture review in 1994.\n  Then, in 1996, we come along and say you can't go to START II levels. \nYou have to stay with START I levels, we said, by law--by law.\n  So we had this thoughtful Nuclear Posture Review that took place in \n1994, but we won't let a Commander in Chief implement that Nuclear \nPosture Review, which was thoughtfully carried out and which supported \nthe START II levels in 1994 because we came along a year and a half \nlater and said you have to stick with the START I levels.\n  Now the chiefs are very much opposed to that requirement in law that \nrestricts us to START I levels, the higher levels, and doesn't allow a \nCommander in Chief to go to the START II levels. They have written us, \nand they have testified. Here is General Shelton:\n\n       I would definitely oppose inclusion of any language that \n     mandates specific force structure levels.\n\n  General Shelton:\n\n       The Service Chiefs and I feel it is time to consider \n     options that will reduce the strategic forces to the levels \n     recommended by the Nuclear Posture Review.\n\n  That was 1994. He went on:\n\n       The START I legislative restraint will need to be removed \n     before we can pursue these options. Major costs will be \n     incurred if we remain at START I levels.\n\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\n\n  So we required that they stick at START I levels, in 1996. And then \nsome of us now are critical of the Commander in Chief for not going to \na different force structure. We are saying: Well, that's the law. We \npassed the law. We require him to stay at the START I levels. And now \nsome of us criticize him for trying to do something precipitously, \nwithout adequate study.\n  There was an adequate study. It was called a Nuclear Posture Review \nin 1994, which said the START II levels were adequate for the security \nof this country. We will not let him go to the START II levels. Then, \nas my good friend from Nebraska points out, in 1997 there was an \nadditional review. I do not think any of us want to suggest the chiefs \ndid not do a thoughtful review in 1997, saying we could safely go, in a \nSTART III agreement, to a lower level than START II. But we are stuck \nat START I. We are at START I levels. Now we are saying we will let the \nnext President go to a lower level than START I, but not this, because \nwe want it to be thoughtful, when we had a thoughtful review in 1994. \nWe will not let them go on. We had a thoughtful review in 1997 to which \nwe won't let him go.\n  Of course, it should be thoughtful. We have had two of them right in \nthe Record, right before us, that we are saying, in the Kerrey \namendment, to which we ought to allow a Commander in Chief to go. We \nhave the Chiefs saying they want the option to go to the START II \nlevels. Unless we say the chiefs do not act thoughtfully--and I do not \nthink anybody in this Chamber wants to take that position--then it \nseems to me we should allow a Commander in Chief to go to the \nthoughtful Posture Review level of 1994 and the thoughtful 1997 level.\n\n  So the first thing we need to do is interpret what this amendment \nmeans. I do not know if Senator Warner agrees with this, but I think \nSenator Kyl has suggested the way I phrased that interpretation was \naccurate. I would be asking a question, even though Senator Kerrey has \nthe floor, of Senator Warner, whether he agrees with Senator Kyl's \ninterpretation of the Warner amendment.\n  Mr. KERREY. Let me ask Senator Warner the question.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask my colleague to restate his position for clarity, \nand then I will clearly indicate.\n  Mr. KERREY. In answering the question of the Senator from Michigan, \nthat portion that was directed to me at least, first of all I say you \nare right. I think the question is, Do we need an additional review, \nmore than we have already had, to support a President if the President \ndecides to go at lower levels? That is what this amendment says. This \namendment says we need additional review and it needs to be more \nthoughtful than we have had thus far.\n  I am prepared to say, with the little I know--you know more than I on \nthis subject--that we have had thoughtful and serous review done. What \nthe amendment does is it ties the hands of a President, this President \nand the President-elect, if we have to wait for it to be submitted \nconcurrently with the quadrennial review, and it weakens him as a \nconsequence. It says to the people who are negotiating with him, if an \noffer is put on the table by this President that is different from what \nthe current law allows, he cannot do it. He can't sit down and \nnegotiate with President Putin to go to lower levels in exchange for a \nmodification of ABM because the law prevents him from doing it.\n  It weakens an incumbent President. That is exactly what it does. I \nthink that is what it is intended to do. That is what it will \nsuccessfully accomplish. I don't think--in fact, I know--from my \nexperience of the Senator from Virginia that is precisely the opposite \nof the sort of thing he would want. He would avoid it. I am going to \nlisten to the answer of the Senator from Virginia and then come back in \nthe morning to hear even more.\n  But in the spirit of bipartisanship, I understand the Senator from \nVirginia is going to be offering later, perhaps, an amendment that \nwould provide some resources for the operation of a World War II \nmemorial.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is my intention.\n  Mr. KERREY. I would like to be added as a cosponsor of that.\n  Mr. WARNER. At long last, he is joining me. I am going to do that as \nsoon as the opportunity presents itself.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I believe the question of the Senator from \nMichigan through the Senator from Nebraska to the Senator from Virginia \nis whether he agreed with me.\n  My interpretation is simply the language of the amendment which says \nthat the Nuclear Posture Review shall be submitted concurrently with \nthe quadrennial review, which is due in December----\n  Mr. WARNER. No later than.\n  Mr. KYL. No later than December 2001. It could be, therefore, \nsubmitted prior to that date. It all depends upon when the QDR would be \nsubmitted. But it does have to be at the same time.\n  If I could just make one other point, I am advised by staff that the \nlast quadrennial review did not include a review of the nuclear \nposture. So the last Nuclear Posture Review was in fact in 1994.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my colleague is correct on that. I can \nverify that. And I agree with his interpretation of my amendment. It is \nas simple as that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think I did say the Nuclear Posture Review of 1994, \nwhich was a thoughtful review which supports START II levels. The \nCommander has been precluded from going to that by our law.\n  Mr. WARNER. It comes down to a very practical application, that we \nbelieve strongly--and this amendment recites it--that certain steps \nshould be taken before any President makes such important decisions \nwith regard to the numbers in our future arsenals.\n  Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, this debate can \ncontinue tomorrow. I think we have had an excellent debate. I think we \nhave narrowed, for the benefit of the Senate, where the differences are \non the two sides.\n  Unless my colleague from Colorado has further to say on this \namendment, I will proceed to do another amendment at this time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for just one procedural question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, of course.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is it the intention, then, of the Senator from Virginia to \nmodify his pending amendment?\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Michigan. It is not my intention \nto modify the amendment of the Senator from Virginia at the desk at \nthis time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The modification I was referring to was not a technical \nmodification to comply with the unanimous consent agreement. The \nmodification I was referring to is whether the Senator from Virginia is \nintending to modify any of the language relative to that 2001 date.\n  Mr. WARNER. At this time I do not think it is necessary. I will ask \nthe Chair, for the purposes of clarity, is the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Virginia in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. WARNER. There was some concern, technically, heretofore that it \nwas not.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we will lay aside this amendment for the \ntime being.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent agreement we are \noperating under at the present time does not contemplate any additional \namendments, so it would require unanimous consent.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. I am simply at this point in time asking \nmy colleague for unanimous consent that I can send to the desk an \namendment relating to the World War II veterans memorial.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, we just need a few minutes \nto look at it. We just received it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why don't we put in a brief quorum call, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3189\n\n  (Purpose: To require the disposal of a certain quantity of titanium \n                  from the National Defense Stockpile)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have consulted with my distinguished \ncolleague, and I am going to now send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Levin, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Stevens, \n     Mr. Roth, Mr. Helms, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n     Gorton, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. Kerrey, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3189.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 613, after line 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3403. DISPOSAL OF TITANIUM.\n\n       (a) Disposal Required.--Subject to subsection (b), the \n     President shall, by September 30, 2010, dispose of 30,000 \n     short tons of titanium contained in the National Defense \n     Stockpile so as to result in receipts to the United States in \n     a total amount that is not less than $180,000,000.\n       (b) Minimization of Disruption and Loss.--The President may \n     not dispose of titanium under subsection (a) to the extent \n     that the disposal will result in--\n       (1) undue disruption of the usual markets of producers, \n     processors, and consumers of titanium; or\n       (2) avoidable loss to the United States.\n       (c) Treatment of Receipts.--Notwithstanding section 9 of \n     the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 \n     U.S.C. 98h), funds received as a result of the disposal of \n     titanium under subsection (a) shall be applied as follows: \n     $174,000,000 to defray the costs of health care benefit \n     improvement for retired military personnel; and $6,000,000 \n     for transfer to the American Battle Monuments Commission for \n     deposit in the fund established under section 2113 of title \n     36, United States Code, for the World War II memorial \n     authorized by section 1 of Public Law 103-32 (107 Stat. 90).\n       (d) World War II Memorial.--(1) The amount transferred to \n     the American Battle Monuments Commission under subsection (c) \n     shall be used to complete all necessary requirements for the \n     design of, ground breaking for, construction of, maintenance \n     of, and dedication of the World War II memorial.

Mr. President, our beloved former colleague, former \nmajority leader, Senator Dole, and others have been very active in \nraising funds to build a memorial to those who served in World War II. \nI have been in consultation with him, as have other Members of the \nSenate, with regard to the success of this memorial effort.\n  It has been successful. Today Senator Dole was proud to receive a \ndonation from the private sector in excess of some $14 million. What a \nfitting day, the 56th anniversary of D-Day. I called Senator Dole, \nafter consultation with a number of my colleagues, most specifically \nthose colleagues in addition to myself who served in World War II, to \nget their concurrence in a decision that I had made sometime earlier to \nthe effect that I thought Congress should participate in the funding of \na portion of this memorial, a relatively small portion that remains to \nbe raised to reach the goal. I asked Senator Dole to come today, which \nhe did several hours ago. We met. We reached concurrence on the \nfollowing language, which I will address to the Senate.\n  This is becoming a campaign to build this memorial. It is all \nAmerica. It is extraordinary. I was very heavily involved in the \nfunding, the legislation and other aspects of the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial, spent 2 or 3 years before, in fact, or more working with the \ncourageous group that envisioned that magnificent memorial. I can \nremember when it was just a glimmer in our eyes, the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial. I think there were 10,000 different designs that came in. I \nremember going out to Andrews Air Force Base where all the designs for \nthe Vietnam Veterans Memorial were posted. We had a group of experts \nexamine them.\n  Finally, the experts came down on the design which is the current \nwall. It was designed by a young architectural student or just a \ngraduate, 21 years old. It was as if the hand of providence reached \ndown and touched those individuals who started that campaign, who saw \nit through at times when we didn't have $5 in the bank and we worked to \nrescue it. Then this brilliant woman, Maya Lin, created the design out \nof 10,000 submissions. So much for that history.\n  I have a very modest association with Senator Dole and others who are \nworking on this, but I am happy to present this to the Senate tonight \nas America's campaign. Citizens across our land, corporations, \nfoundations, veterans groups, civic, fraternal, professional \norganizations and State legislatures, yes, indeed, State legislatures, \nhave generously contributed to this important cause. Hundreds of \nthousands of individual Americans, young and old, are rallying behind \nthe opportunity to say thank you to a generation of Americans from the \nWorld War II generation. It is to the military men and women who wore \nthe uniforms, but I, as a young person who went into the service in \nJanuary 1945, remember the war was raging, the Battle of the Bulge had \nnot been completed yet. The campaign in Iwo Jima was about to start. \nThe whole of America was involved in that war, whether you were in \nuniform or whether you were on the home front.\n  This is a recognition of the contribution of millions of Americans, \nupwards of 16 million who wore the uniform in that period, and treble \nthat amount at home were involved in the industrial base, all of the \nactivities to support those who were on the battlefronts in the Pacific \nand in Europe.\n  So it was America's generation of uniformed and those civilians here \nat home who fought courageously and sacrificed in so many ways to make \nvictory assured against tyranny.\n  The memorial campaign currently is progressing toward raising the \n$139.6 million needed to build this lasting memorial to the generation \nthat conquered tyranny in the 20th century. While the campaign is very \nclose to the goal, we in the Congress now have an opportunity to show \nour support and add our shoulder to the wheel.\n  The site on The National Mall has been chosen, preliminary design \napproved, and the intent is to break ground on Veterans Day weekend, \nthis November. Since the private sector is generously donating the \nfunds needed to design, construct, and maintain the memorial--over $120 \nmillion as of today--I believe it is appropriate for Congress also to \nsupport the memorial campaign.\n  The amendment I introduce tonight, together with my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan, Mr. Levin, will show the support of Congress \nfor this important project. Specifically, the amendment provides for $6 \nmillion to the American Battle Monuments Commission from the revenues \nof sale of titanium from the national defense stockpile--\nnonappropriated funds, Mr. President. The $6 million should be used to \ncomplete all necessary requirements for the design of, groundbreaking \nfor, construction of, maintenance of, and dedication of the World War \nII memorial.\n  The Commission plans to complete construction and dedicate the \nmemorial on Veterans Day, 2002. We cannot wait a moment longer to show \nour support for this project. It is astonishing that over 1,000 men and \nwomen each day who proudly wore the uniform, of that 16 million total, \nare passing on to their great rewards--1,000 a day who die. Now it is \nthe hour for Congress to act and put our shoulder to the wheel to give \nour expression, along with all other Americans, for this great project.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I congratulate and thank the Senator from \nVirginia for his leadership in this matter. This is a relatively small \ncontribution from the people, acting through its Congress. The private \nsector is funding 95 percent of this effort. This is really symbolic \nalmost, but it is an important contribution. It symbolizes where the \nheart of this institution, this Congress, is, and reflects where the \nAmerican people are because they would, I think, applaud what the good\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\nSenator from Virginia is doing here tonight, and I am happy to join. I \nthank him. He points out many things that I won't amplify, given the \nhour, except to say it is surely the right day today, this 56th \nanniversary of D-Day.\n  When he talks about how the American people who participated in that \neffort are all being honored, surely first and foremost are our \nveterans, but all the American people who are behind them; it is such \nan important point for all of us to remember.\n  I remember as a kid the minute, little contribution we kids were \nmaking, going around the streets looking for wrappers that we could \npeel off the foil, put it together in a little ball of metal, and then, \nwith all the little balls of metal, put together a tank or an airplane. \nBut first and foremost, obviously, it is the veterans, those who didn't \ncome back and those who did.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for doing this. I don't know if he \nlisted all the cosponsors.\n  Mr. WARNER. I was about to do that. It is so hard for the current \ngeneration of people to remember that period. Both of us do. I happen \nto have been in uniform. I remember where we had a little book of \nstamps, savings bonds, and you put your quarter stamps in. You were \nrationing butter, meat, shoes and clothing. We never thought about it. \nIt was our way of backing the men and women in uniform. I remember it \nwas 3 gallons, I think, a week of gasoline that you had. My father was \na doctor, and I remember that doctors had an additional allocation of \ngasoline so they could make hospital calls and visit homes. It was just \nan extraordinary hour in America, the way there was a total effort.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. All the way down to the kids.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. I remember picking up little bits off the cigarette \npacks and the tin foil.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We used to flatten cans. After we were done with a can of \nfood, we would take off the other end that hadn't been opened, put it \nin a box, flatten the can, and carry in the boxes of tins.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, does the Senator remember the collection \nof scrap metal? I will never forget it. In those days, the Nation's \nCapital, where we lived, had great big trash trucks, and the trucks ran \novertime. They would come down the street, and people would come out \nand put all kinds of scrap metal in the trucks. I remember the person \nwho lived across from me came out with an armful of magnificent guns--\nshotguns and rifles that belonged to her husband--and the trash guys \nlooked at them and just threw them in the truck. I don't know that \nthose guns ever got to the scrap heap, but I remember that as if it \nwere yesterday.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I saw letters of President Roosevelt the other day \nthanking people for their donations--I think it was of telescopes; I am \nnot sure. It was something which people just put into the war effort, \neither scrapped or used in some way.\n  This is a special tribute to those of our colleagues, including \nyourself, who were in World War II. I know you are going to list them. \nBut as this honor roll of heroes is read by the Senator from Virginia, \nI think we are all going to stand very proud that we have so many \nMembers still in this body who served in World War II and, of course, \nmany who did serve in this body who served in World War II who are also \nbeing honored. Senator Dole, of course, is very much in the lead in \nthis effort, but so many others came before us who are currently in \nthis body who served.\n  How many are there who served in this body?\n  Mr. WARNER. I have spoken to every one of them today. I will read \ntheir names in the order of seniority of the Senate: Senator Thurmond, \nwho crossed the beaches on D-Day. He did it in a glider, and it \ncrashed, he was injured, but he went on and took up his duties despite \nthat. Senator Inouye is one of the most highly decorated Members of the \nSenate. The President upgraded his decoration from the Distinguished \nService Cross to the Medal of Honor; is that correct?\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is correct. It will be presented in a ceremony this \nmonth at the White House. That was something Senator Inouye was not \neven aware of until he read about it.\n  Mr. WARNER. No. There is not a more modest Member of the Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. So true.\n  Mr. WARNER. What a great strength he has been to national defense in \nthe 22 years we have worked on this.\n  Fritz Hollings was in the European campaign. Senator Stevens was an \nAir Corps pilot, before there was an Air Force; he flew in the Pacific. \nSenator Bill Roth was in the Army. Senator Helms was in the Navy. \nSenator Moynihan was in the Navy, and he was proud to call me Secretary \nof the Navy. I was just a petty officer third class. Senator Lautenberg \nserved. Senator Gorton served in the Army right at the end. Senator \nAkaka served. I was a young sailor, and we were trained during the \ninvasion of Japan, and the war ended very precipitously.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Senator Bob Kerrey also wanted to be added as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator Robert Kerrey is a Medal of Honor winner. We will \nadd him as a cosponsor. I ask unanimous consent that they all be made \ncosponsors, along with myself and Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3189) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague for joining me and for \nhis kind remarks about our colleagues.\n  Mr. President, we have made some accomplishments today. The hour is 8 \no'clock, and we started promptly at about 2:45. I thank all who \nparticipated in moving this. We have an order for tomorrow which lays \nout the work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4555-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, it is with a great deal of professional \npleasure and personal pride that I rise today to honor an organization \nin which I am a life member and served as the 21st national president \nnearly 50 years ago. The organization of which I speak is our neighbor \nacross First Street, the Reserve Officers Association of the United \nStates, though it is perhaps best known simply by its initials--ROA. \nThe association was organized in 1922, at the instigation of General of \nthe Armies John J. Pershing, who was then serving as the Army's Chief \nof Staff. Like many others who served in uniform in World War I, \nGeneral Pershing was convinced that the war could have been \nsignificantly shortened or avoided altogether if an adequate pool of \ntrained officers had existed at the time. Taking his sentiments to \nheart, 140 Reserve officers met at Washington's Willard Hotel and \norganized the Reserve Officers Association. It was largely through the \ndedicated efforts of this voluntary organization and its members that \nthe United States established its Officer Reserve Corps, which was to \nsupply the great majority of America's trained officers in the days \nleading up to World War II. It is appropriate for the Senate to note \nthat these first ROA members were citizen-soldiers who clearly saw the \napproaching storm clouds. They pushed the nation toward an \nunprecedented level of pre-war preparedness that arguably saved lives \nand formed the very foundations of the great victories of democracy \nthat were to follow.\n  With the end of the war, the ROA resumed its normal operations, \nraising and maintaining the nation's awareness of the role and \ncontributions of its military forces in the uneasy post-war\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\nworld. It was in these tense days, in June 1950, that the Congress \ngranted the ROA the formal charter that established the association's \nobject and purpose. That formulation was clear and direct, unambiguous \nand unequivocal: ROA was ``to support a military policy for the United \nStates that will provide adequate national security and to promote the \ndevelopment and execution thereof.''\n  For 50 years, the ROA has followed that guidance, and taken the lead \nin rigorously advocating a strong and viable national defense posture \nfor our nation. The ROA has worked to support concepts that have \nstrengthened our ability to preserve our freedom and to advance our \nnational interests across the world. It worked to revitalize and fund \nthe Selective Service System, support our Cold War allies, and focus \nthe weight of public opinion in favor of our national commitment during \nthe Gulf War and expanding NATO. It has played a major role in \npersuading the Congress to provide more than $15 billion in critically \nneeded equipment for our nation's Reserve components. In addition, the \nROA has also clearly understood that not all ideas are good ideas. It \nsuccessfully opposed efforts to combine the Army Reserve and National \nGuard, and to disestablish the Coast Guard, and Air Force Reserves, as \nwell as the Selective Service System and the commissioned officer corps \nof the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n  Mr. President, the ROA has, for the past 78 years, proven itself to \nbe a strong and articulate voice in the halls of Congress and the \ncorridors of government for all our service members. It has lived up to \nits charter and supported the cause of national defense in seasons when \nit has not been popular to do so. It has established an enviable \nreputation for nonpartisan expertise and even-handed advocacy, a \nreputation that has grown and flourished as defense issues have become \never more complex in these days of the Total Force Policy. The ROA \nenjoys the confidence of the Congress and of the Department of Defense. \nIts successful legislative efforts have made it a valued partner in the \nformulation and development of the annual defense bills and in building \nbroad, bipartisan support for our men and women in uniform. Over the \nyears I have learned that serious debate on any issue dealing with our \nReserve forces is not complete until we have heard from the ROA. As the \nnumber of members of Congress with personal military experience has \ndeclined, the importance of ROA's contribution to developing our \nmilitary policy has increased exponentially. The ROA has played and \nwill continue to play a crucial role in shaping the debate over the \nappropriate roles and missions of our Armed Forces. The nation is most \nfortunate to have such an asset to call upon. We should all be \ngrateful.\n  Mr. President, I urge all Senators to join me in congratulating the \nReserve Officers Association of the United States on the fiftieth \nanniversary of the granting of its congressional charter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4556-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL PHILLIP J. FORD, USAF\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a life of \nservice devoted to defending the values and ideals of our nation. On \nJuly 1, 2000 the country will lose to retirement its Deputy Commander \nin Chief of the United States Strategic Command, Lieutenant General \nPhillip J. Ford, USAF. Through his leadership, General Ford has taken \nthe United States and U.S. Strategic Command into a new world \nenvironment. During his career, his guidance and foresight helped see \nthe U.S. Military into the new millennium.\n  Throughout a career that spans four decades, General Ford has \ncommanded the 8th Air Force, the 384th Bomb Wing, and the 524th Bomb \nSquadron. As commander of the 384th at McConnell Air Force Base, \nKansas, he transformed and entire installation to bring in and support \na new B-1 bomber wing. General Ford has also served as commandant of \nthe Air Command and Staff College and held key staff positions at the \nHeadquarters of the U.S. Air Force, Military Airlift Command, Air \nMobility Command and Strategic Air Command.\n  As the nation's top bomber commander supporting the United States \nCentral Command, General Ford directed an unprecedented global power \nstrike against Iraq during Operation DESERT FOX. Despite tactical and \nweapon system limitations, his bombers succeeded in retargeting their \nair launched cruise missiles while airborne and en route to their \ntargets. His forces delivered their weapons on time and on target, \nguaranteeing mission success.\n  As Deputy Commander in Chief of the United States Strategic Command, \nand as a strong proponent of an enduring, stable, strategic \nrelationship with Russia, General Ford championed the Defense \nDepartment's cooperative threat reduction activities, to include \nmilitary-to-military contacts. General Ford's historic military-to-\nmilitary exchanges with senior Russian nuclear commanders built a \nlegacy of respect, mutual understanding and cooperation. The general's \ninsight in planning and evaluating the command's communication \ncapabilities assured the nation that the communication between the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, Joint Chiefs and men and women at the \nhelm of ballistic missile submarines, intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles and nuclear bombers remained intact despite Y2K concerns. His \nefforts will have an enduring, positive impact on strategic stability \nfor many years to come.\n  Lieutenant General Ford and his wife, Kris leave the military after a \ndistinguished 34 year career serving their nation. The people of the \nUnited States salute General Ford and Mrs. Ford and wish them well as \nthey begin a new chapter of their lives after military service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4556-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4556-S4557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNITION OF CHANCELLOR ROBERT KHAYAT'S INDUCTION INTO THE \n                    MISSISSIPPI SPORTS HALL OF FAME\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my close \nfriend, Robert Khayat. On March 9, 2000, Chancellor Khayat was inducted \ninto the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame. I want to recognize \nChancellor Khayat not just because of his recent induction into this \nprestigious group, but also for his dedication to the State of \nMississippi.\n  Robert Khayat played college baseball and football at our mutual alma \nmater, the University of Mississippi. Playing catcher for Ole Miss, he \nled the team to two consecutive SEC Baseball Championships. A two-time \nAll SEC player, Bob Khayat earned three letters in his sophomore, \njunior, and senior years.\n  During Bob Khayat's college football career he demonstrated a \ndefinitive leadership role. At the position of place-kicker, ``Golden \nToe,'' as he was called, led the Rebels' extraordinary football team to \nmany a victory. His name is forever in the University of Mississippi's \nhistory books as one of the greatest place kickers to set foot on the \nOle Miss campus. Coach John Vaught's team secured many victories \nbecause of Bob Khayat's athletic ability. He was selected as the place-\nkicker on the Ole Miss Team of the Century.\n  After graduating from Ole Miss, Bob Khayat played professional \nfootball for the Washington Redskins. In his time with the Redskins he \nscored 204 points, tied the all-time Redskins record for most field \ngoals made in a single game, and was voted into the Pro Bowl. In \nrecognition of his great achievements, the NFL presented Bob Khayat \nwith the 1998 Career Achievement Award for his accomplishments on and \noff the field.\n  While performing in the NFL, Robert Khayat pursued his law degree at \nthe University of Mississippi Law School. After graduating third in his \nclass and earning his Juris Doctorate degree in 1966, Bob Khayat \nentered private practice in Pascagoula, Mississippi. In 1969 he became \na law professor at Ole Miss.\n  From 1980 to 1981, Bob Khayat took a leave of absence to pursue a \nMasters of Law degree, which he received from Yale Law School. \nReturning to teach at Ole Miss Law School, he was promoted to Associate \nDean before serving as Vice Chancellor for University Affairs in 1984. \nIn 1994 he served as interim athletic director before becoming the \nUniversity of Mississippi's 15th Chancellor.\n  Chancellor Robert Khayat plays an instrumental role for the State of \nMississippi. He is known for his tireless leadership which he has \nexemplified as a student, an athlete, a professor and\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\nfinally as Chancellor of the University of Mississippi. Chancellor \nKhayat's character is a tremendous asset to Ole Miss. As a person, he \nis a role model for all who know him.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of my fellow Mississippians, I would like to \ncommend Chancellor Khayat for his leadership, his accomplishments, and \nhis continued dedication to making our home state a better place. While \nI am recognizing Chancellor Khayat for his induction into the \nMississippi Sports Hall of Fame, his many talents and abilities \ndistinguish him in countless other areas as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4557-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF DR. WALTER WASHINGTON\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to remember an admirable person \nand a devoted educator, Dr. Walter Washington. Dr. Washington served as \na classroom teacher, assistant principal, Dean of Utica Junior College, \nPresident of Utica Junior College for twelve years, and served as \nPresident of Alcorn State University from 1969 to 1994. Dr. Washington \nretired as President of Alcorn State University on June 30, 1994, and \nwas subsequently named President Emeritus by the Mississippi Board of \nTrustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning.\n  During his tenure as both an educator and administrator, Dr. \nWashington was a leader in the State of Mississippi and throughout the \ncountry. He was a mentor to all who met him, and he set a high standard \nfor his successors. His impact on Mississippi was evident in his work \nas a representative of the state on several national commissions.\n  As a man of many talents, he served on the Advisory Council of the \nNational Urban League's Black Executive Exchange Program and the U.S. \nPresident's Advisory Council on Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities. In 1982, he was awarded the Outstanding Presidential \nCluster Citation by President Ronald Reagan.\n  Dr. Washington was a member of several professional organizations, \nincluding Kappa Delta Phi, Phi Delta Kappa, and Alpha Kappa Mu Honor \nSociety. He served as president of the Mississippi Teachers Association \nand held membership in the Mississippi Association of Educators and the \nnational Education Association.\n  Dr. Washington married his college sweetheart, the former Carolyn \nCarter, in 1949. In addition to his devotion to his wife, he was \ninvolved in many community organizations. Dr. Washington received the \nSilver Beaver Award from the Boy Scouts of America, the Distinguished \nService Award and Distinguished Alumni Award from Peabody College, and \nthe Service to Humanity Award from Mississippi College. He was listed \namong Ebony's 100 Most Influential Black Americans in 1974, 1975, and \n1976, and was selected Mississippi Man-of-the-Year in Education in \n1981.\n  Dr. Washington passed away on December 1, 1999, but his legacy will \nlive on as an eternal flame.

Mr. President, we are so fortunate to live in an era \nwhen modern medical breakthroughs are an almost common occurrence. \nEvery day brings new research and insight into the human body and \ndiseases that, unfortunately, affect our friends, families, co-workers, \nand ourselves. For example, there are several wonderful new therapies \nthat help people with chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, \nmultiple sclerosis, and Hepatitis C live more active and pain-free \nlives. I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of the Access to \nInnovation for Medicare Patients Act (S. 2644), which would extend \nMedicare coverage to new self-injected biological therapies for these \nchronic diseases.\n  One of the most important things I do as a United States Senator is \nlisten to the people and the stories of their lives. The story of one \nof my constituents, Judith Levinson of Rockville, Maryland, is a \ncompelling example of the power of these new therapies. Judith was \ndiagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when she was 40 years old. At \nfirst, her fingers and toes swelled up and sent sharp pains into her \narms and shoulders. Over the next few years, she had multiple surgeries \nto place artificial knuckles in her fingers, to fuse her thumbs, and to \nreplace both of her wrists with steel rods. Her feet have also been \naffected. Judith had six surgeries on her feet because bone \ndeterioration made walking very difficult and painful. She now wears a \nsize 2 shoe because so much bone has been removed from her feet. \nUnfortunately, Judith's suffering did not end with the surgeries. \nDuring recovery, her hands had to be placed in cages in order to heal \nproperly--which made her completely dependent on others for daily \nactivities. On a scale of 1 to 10, Judith rated her daily pain as an 8.\n  In January of 1999, Judith's doctor prescribed a new self-injectable \ndrug called Enbrel, which had just been approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced RA. I am proud to \nadd that the Johns Hopkins University's Division of Rheumatology was \ninstrumental in the development of this breakthrough therapy as one of \nits clinical trial sites. Judith says that, within five weeks, she had \nless swelling in her fingers and she had more energy. As she puts it, \nshe is in ``go mode.'' I am happy to report that Judith has resumed \nwriting, takes daily walks with her family without stopping at every \nstreet corner, and truly believes that this treatment has changed her \nlife.\n  Judith is fortunate in that her insurance plan covers the cost of \nEnbrel, with a small co-payment. Medicare, on the other hand, does not \nallow coverage of self-administered injectable drugs. It covers only \ndrugs that are administered in a physician's office. That means that \nmany Medicare beneficiaries are going without treatment because they \ncan't afford it themselves, or that they are treated with a therapy \nthat is covered but may not be the most appropriate or effective \ntreatment. That doesn't make sense. I am very proud that most of the \nbreakthroughs in medicine today were invented in the United States. But \nbreakthroughs alone aren't enough--I believe that every American ought \nto have access to those breakthroughs. Medicare patients are certainly \nno exception.\n  It is gratifying that this legislation is supported by a broad range \nof women, senior, minority, religious, rural, and health professional \norganizations like the Alliance for Aging Research, the American Public \nHealth Association, the National Farmers Union, the Older Women's \nLeague (OWL), the National Hispanic Council on Aging, and more than a \ndozen other organizations. OWL, the only national membership \norganization that works on the issues unique to midlife and older \nwomen, has stressed the importance of access to innovative medical \ntreatments for older women and urged Congress to recognize that ``73% \nof women on Medicare have two or more concurrent chronic conditions, \nwhich often lead to limitations in the activities of daily living and \nthe need for long-term care. In order to improve the health of women \nsuffering with chronic diseases . . . Congress should extend Medicare \ncoverage to self-administered injectables.''\n  Mr. President, we must ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access \nto promising and innovative new therapies. This legislation will help \nthousands of people living with chronic conditions like RA, MS, and \nHepatitis C live better, happier, and more productive lives. I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senators Gorton, Murray, myself and the other co-\nsponsors in supporting it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4557-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4557-S4558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I wish to share with my colleagues a \nmoving autobiographical article written by Ward Connerly. Mr. \nConnerly's intelligence and personal experience with racism blend \ntogether into a truly insightful analysis and I encourage my colleagues \nto read about Mr. Connerly's uniquely American story.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article which appeared in the June 2000 \nedition of The American Enterprise be printed in the Record.\n\n                     Laying Down the Burden of Race\n\n                           (By Ward Connerly)\n\n       Not long ago, after I'd given a speech in Hartford, \n     Connecticut, I saw a black man with a determined look on his \n     face working his way toward me through the crowd. I steeled \n     myself for another abrasive encounter of the kind I've come \n     to expect over the past few years. But once this man reached \n     me he stuck out his hand and said thoughtfully, ``You know, I \n     was thinking about some of the things you said tonight. It \n     occurred to me that black people have just got to learn to \n     lay down the burden. It's like we grew up carrying a bag \n     filled with heavy weights on our shoulders. We just have to \n     stop totin' that bag.''\n       I agreed with him. I knew as he did exactly what was in \n     this bag: weakness and guilt, anger, and self-hatred.\n       I have made a commitment not to tote racial grievances, \n     because the status of victim is so seductive and so available \n     to anyone with certain facial features or a certain cast to \n     his skin. But laying down these burdens can be tricky, as I \n     was reminded not long after this Connecticut meeting. I had \n     just checked into the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco to \n     attend an annual dinner as master of ceremonies. After \n     getting to my room, I realized that I'd left my briefcase in \n     the car and started to go back to the hotel parking garage \n     for it. As I was getting off the basement elevator, I ran \n     into a couple of elderly white men who seemed a little \n     disoriented. When they saw me, one of them said, ``Excuse me, \n     are you the man who unlocks the meeting room?''\n       I did an intellectual double-take and then, with my racial \n     hackles rising, answered with as much irritation as I could \n     pack into my voice: ``No, I'm not the man who unlocks the \n     rooms.''\n       The two men shrank back and I walked on, fuming to myself \n     about how racial profiling is practiced every day in subtle \n     forms by people who would otherwise piously condemn it in \n     state troopers working the New Jersey Turnpike. As I stalked \n     toward the garage, I didn't feel uplifted by my righteous \n     anger. On the contrary, I felt crushed by it. It was a heavy \n     burden, so heavy, in fact, that I stopped and stood there for \n     a minute, sagging under its weight. Then I tried to see \n     myself through the eyes of the two old men I'd just run into: \n     someone who was black, yes, but more importantly, someone \n     without luggage, striding purposefully out of the elevator as \n     if on a mission, dressed in a semi-uniform of blazer and gray \n     slacks.\n       I turned around and retraced my steps.\n       ``What made you think I was the guy who unlocks the meeting \n     rooms?'' I asked when I caught up with them.\n       ``You were dressed a little like a hotel employee, sir,'' \n     the one who had spoken earlier said in a genuinely \n     deferential way. ``Believe me, I meant no insult.''\n       ``Well, I hope you'll forgive me for being abrupt,'' I \n     said, and after a quick handshake I headed back to the \n     garage, feeling immensely relieved.\n       If we are to lay this burden down for good, we must be \n     committed to letting go of racial classifications--not \n     getting beyond race by taking race more into account, as \n     Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun disastrously advised, \n     but just getting beyond race period as a foundation for \n     public policy.\n       Yet, I know that race is a scar in America. I first saw \n     this scar at the beginning of my life in the segregated \n     South. Black people should not deny that this mark exists: it \n     is part of our connection to America. But we should also \n     resist all of those, black and white, who want to rip open \n     that scar and make race a raw and angry wound that continues \n     to define and divide us.\n       Left to their own devices, I believe, Americans will \n     eventually merge and melt into each other. Throughout our \n     history, there has been a constant intermingling of people--\n     even during the long apartheid of segregation and Jim Crow. \n     It is malicious as well as unreasonable not to acknowledge \n     that in our own time the conditions for anger have diminished \n     and the conditions for connection have improved.\n       We all know the compelling statistics about the \n     improvements in black life: increased social and vocational \n     mobility, increased personal prestige and political power. \n     But of all the positive data that have accumulated since the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964--when America finally decided to \n     leave its racial past behind--the finding that gives me most \n     hope is the recent survey showing that nearly 90 percent of \n     all teenagers in America report having at least one close \n     personal friend of another race.\n       My wife Ilene is white. I have two racially mixed children \n     and three grandchildren, two of whose bloodlines are even \n     more mixed as a result of my son's marriage to a woman of \n     half-Asian descent. So my own personal experience tells me \n     that the passageway to that place where all racial division \n     ends goes directly through the human heart.\n       Not long ago, Mike Wallace came to California to interview \n     Ilene and me for a segment on ``60 Minutes.'' He seemed \n     shocked when I told him that race wasn't a big topic in our \n     family. He implied that we were somehow disadvantaging the \n     kids. But Ilene and I decided a long time ago to let our kids \n     find their way in this world without toting the bag of race. \n     They are lucky, of course, to have grown up after the great \n     achievements of the civil rights movement, which changed \n     America's heart as much as its laws. But we have made sure \n     that the central question for our children, since the moment \n     they came into this world, has always been who are you, not \n     what are you. When we ignore appeals to group identity and \n     focus instead on individuals and their individual humanity, \n     we are inviting the principles of justice present since \n     the American founding to come inside our contemporary \n     American homes.\n       I won't pretend this is always easy. While a senior at \n     college, I fell in love with an effervescent white woman \n     named Ilene. When Ilene's parents first learned how serious \n     we were about each other, they reacted with dismay and spent \n     long hours on the phone trying to keep the relationship from \n     developing further. Hoping for support from my own relatives, \n     I went home one weekend and told Mom (the grandmother who had \n     raised me) about Ilene. She was cold and negative. ``Why \n     can't you find yourself a nice colored girl?'' she blurted \n     out. I walked out of the house and didn't contact her for a \n     long time afterward.\n       Ilene and I now felt secretive and embattled. Marrying \n     ``outside your race'' was no easy decision in 1962. I knew \n     that Ilene had no qualms about challenging social norms, but \n     I was less sure that she could deal with exclusion by her \n     family, which seemed to me a real possibility. Nonetheless, \n     she said yes when I proposed, and we were married, with no \n     family members present.\n       I called Mom the day after and told her. She apologized for \n     what she'd said earlier. Ilene's parents were not so quick to \n     alter their position. For months, the lines of communication \n     were down. Sometimes I came home from work and found Ilene \n     sitting on the couch crying.\n       Finally her parents agreed to see her, but not me. I drove \n     her up to their house and waited in the car while she went \n     in. As the hours passed, I seethed. At one point I started \n     the engine and took off, but I didn't know the area and so, \n     after circling the block, came back and parked again. When \n     Ilene finally came out of the house, she just cried for \n     nearly the entire return trip.\n       Today, people would rush to hold Ilene's parents guilty of \n     racism.\n       But even when I was smoldering with resentment, I knew it \n     wasn't that simple. These were good people--hard working, \n     serious, upstanding. They were people, moreover, who had \n     produced my wife, a person without a racist bone in her body. \n     In a sense, I could sympathize with my new in-laws; there \n     were no blacks in their daily life, and they lived in a small \n     town where everyone knew everything about everyone else. Our \n     marriage was a leap nothing in her parents' lives had \n     prepared them to take.\n       But their reaction to me still rankled. After having to \n     wait in the car that afternoon I vowed never to go near their \n     house again.\n       For a long time we didn't see Ilene's parents. But we did \n     see her Aunt Markeeta and Uncle Glen. They were wonderful \n     people. Glen, dead now, was a salt-of-the-earth type who \n     worked in a sawmill, and Markeeta had a personality as \n     piquant as her name. They integrated us into their circle of \n     friends, who became our friends too. In those healing days, \n     we all functioned as an extended family.\n       If I had to pick the moment when our family problems began \n     to resolve themselves if would be the day our son Marc was \n     born.\n       Not long after, we were invited to come for a visit. This \n     time I was included in the invitation. I remember sitting \n     stiffly through\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\n     the event, which had the tone of the recently released film, \n     Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? I was supremely uncomfortable, \n     but I also sensed that the fever had broken. And indeed, a \n     peace process was in place. The visits became more frequent. \n     The frigid tolerance gradually thawed into welcome.\n       There was no single dramatic moment that completed the \n     reconciliation; no cathartic conversation in which we all \n     explored our guilt and misconceptions. Instead, we just got \n     on with our lives, nurturing the relationship that had been \n     born along with my son. It grew faster than he did. Within a \n     year we were on our way to becoming what we are now--a close-\n     knit, supportive family. Today, my relationship with my in-\n     laws could not be better. I love them very much, and they let \n     me know that the feeling is mutual.\n       The moral is clear. Distance exaggerates difference and \n     breeds mistrust; closeness breaks down suspicion and produces \n     connection. My life so far tells me that our future as a \n     nation is with connection.\n       Most people call me a black man. In fact, I'm black in the \n     same way that Tiger Woods and so many other Americans are \n     black--by the ``one drop of blood'' rule used by yesterday's \n     segregationists and today's racial ideologues. In my case, \n     the formula has more or less equal elements of French \n     Canadian, Choctaw, African, and Irish American. But just \n     reciting the fractions provides no insight about the richness \n     of life produced by the sum of the parts.\n       A journalist for the New York Times once described my \n     bloodline as being right out of a Faulkner novel. He was \n     right. And my family was always trying to understand how the \n     strands of DNA dangling down through history had created \n     their individual selves. They had their share of guilty \n     secrets and agonized over the consequences of bad blood, \n     whatever its racial origin. But in their actions, they, like \n     Faulkner's characters, treated race and other presumed \n     borders between people as being permeable.\n       I grew up with my mother's people. My maternal grand-father \n     was Eli Soniea, a mixed-blood Cajun born in the tiny \n     Louisiana town of Sulphur. He eventually settled in \n     Leesville, not far from the Texas border, a sleepy town with \n     hazy foothills stretching behind it like a movie backdrop.\n       Eli died ten years before I was born, and I never knew him. \n     But photographs of him have always intrigued me. He was light \n     skinned, had straight black hair, and a serious look. I've \n     been told he spoke a pidgin French and English and was an \n     ambitious man. He worked as a carpenter, sometimes ran a \n     construction gang, and amassed enough money to buy some land \n     and build a restaurant and bar in Leesville, He was evidently \n     a no-nonsense type who didn't like anyone, especially his own \n     kin, putting on airs.\n       Eli's wife, my grandmother Mary Smith--or ``Mom,'' as I \n     always called her--was half Irish and half Choctaw. This \n     latter element was clearly evident in her high cheekbones and \n     broad features, and in the bloom of her young womanhood she \n     was sometimes referred to as an ``Indian Princess.'' Mom was \n     born and raised in Texas. She married Eli Soniea as a result \n     of an ``arrangement'' brokered by her parents, after which he \n     brought her to Louisiana.\n       In their early life together, the two of them lived in that \n     part of Leesville known as ``Dago Quarters'' because of the \n     large number of Italian immigrants. After Eli's early death--\n     when I was growing up you didn't ask why or how someone died; \n     the mere fact of it ended all discussion--Mary's only income \n     was from the restaurant and bar he had built, which she \n     leased to people who did business with the servicemen from \n     the nearby Army base. Because money was tight, she moved the \n     family to a less expensive neighborhood, the predominantly \n     black ``Bartley Quarters.''\n       The complexions of Mom's own six children ranged from light \n     to dark. (William, for instance, was always known as ``Red,'' \n     because of this Indian look and coloring.) But whatever their \n     exact coloration or facial characteristics, they all had \n     ``colored'' on their birth certificates. In Louisiana in \n     those days, being ``colored'' was not just a matter of blood; \n     it was also a question of what neighborhood you lived in and \n     what people you associated with. ``Colored'' is on my birth \n     certificate.\n       The Sonieas' race problem came not only from whites but \n     from blacks too. Leesville's social boundaries were \n     reasonably porous, but if you were falling down through the \n     cracks rather than moving up, as the Sonieas were doing after \n     Eli died, you attracted notice. My grandmother often recalled \n     how her new neighbors in Bartley Quarters called her and her \n     children ``high yellers,'' a term coined by white Southern \n     racists but used with equal venom by blacks too. In fact, \n     Mom's kids had so much trouble that officials tried to \n     convince them to transfer out of the school to escape the \n     racial animosity. This experience left some of my relatives \n     with hard feelings that never really went away. During the \n     campaign for California's Proposition 209, for instance, when \n     I was being accused of selling out ``my people,'' my Aunt \n     Bert got annoyed one day and said, ``When we lived back in \n     Leesville, they didn't want to be our ``brothers and \n     sisters'; they didn't own us as `their people' then; so why \n     do they think we owe them something now because of skin \n     color?\n       My biological mother Grace, Bert's little sister, was the \n     youngest of Mom's children. I wish I had more memories of \n     her. I have only one sharp image in my mind: a face resting \n     in satin in a casket. Old photographs show my mother as a \n     beautiful woman with a full, exotic face. But she wasn't \n     beautiful lying there with a waxy, preserved look, certainly \n     not to a terrified four-year-old dragged up to the front of \n     the church to pay his last respects. I still remember \n     standing there looking at her with my cousin Ora holding my \n     hand to keep me from bolting as the pandemonium of a Southern \n     black funeral--women yelling, crying, fainting, and lying \n     palsied on the floor--rose to a crescendo all around me.\n       According to family legend, she died of a stroke. But I \n     suspect that this claim was really just my family's way of \n     explaining away something infinitely more complex. Two other \n     facts about my mother's life may have had something to do \n     with her early passing. First, she had been in a serious car \n     accident that left her with a steel plate in her head. And \n     secondly, she had been physically abused by my father.\n       I didn't find this out until I was in my fifties. The \n     information accidentally escaped during a conversation with \n     my Aunt Bert, who said, when the subject of my father came \n     up, ``You know, your Uncle Arthur once said, excuse the \n     expression, `That son of a bitch once took out a gun and shot \n     at me!' ''\n       I asked her why.\n       ``Because Arthur told your father that if he ever beat your \n     mother again he'd kill him, and your father got out a gun.''\n       I guess Roy Connerly was what they called a ``fancy man'' \n     back then. Judging from his photos, he was quite handsome, \n     with light skin and a wicked smile, and a reputation as a \n     gambler, a drinker, and a womanizer. He worked odd jobs, but \n     it seems that his real profession was chasing women. I've \n     been told so many times about the day he got tired of me and \n     my mother and turned us in at my grandmother's house that it \n     has come to feel like my own legitimate memory.\n       He arrived there one afternoon with the two of us and with \n     his girlfriend of the moment, a woman named Lucy. My Aunt \n     Bert was watering the lawn when he walked into the yard.\n       ``Is Miss Mary here?'' my father asked.\n       Bert said yes.\n       ``Go get her,'' he ordered.\n       Bert went in to get Mom, who appeared on the porch wiping \n     her hands on her apron.\n       ``I'm giving them back to you, Miss Mary,'' Roy said, \n     gesturing at my sobbing mother and at me, the miserable child \n     in her arms. ``I want to be with Lucy.''\n       Always composed in a crisis, Mom looked at him without \n     visible emotion and said, ``Thank you for bringing them.''\n       A few days later he brought my red wagon over. Then Roy \n     Connerly vanished from my life.\n       Later on I learned that Roy Connerly eventually got rid of \n     Lucy and, at the age of 39, entered a relationship with a 15-\n     year-old girl named Clementine and had a couple of kids by \n     her. But nothing more than that for over 50 years. Then, just \n     a couple of years ago, a writer doing a profile on me for the \n     New York Times called one day.\n       ``Are you sitting down?'' he asked melodramatically.\n       I asked him what was up. He said that in his research about \n     my background he had discovered that my father was still \n     alive, 84 years old, and living in Leesville. The writer gave \n     me his phone number.\n       I didn't do anything about it for a long time. Then, in the \n     fall of 1998, I was invited to debate former Congressman \n     William Gray at Tulane University in New Orleans. One of the \n     things that made me accept was how close it was to Leesville. \n     But I didn't actually decide to go there until after the \n     speech. I came back to the hotel, rented a car, and got \n     directions from the concierge.\n       It was a four-hour drive in a dreary rain. I warned myself \n     not to surrender to counterfeit sentiment that would make a \n     fool of both me and my father.\n       I stopped on the outskirts of town and called from a \n     convenience store. My father's wife Clementine answered. I \n     told her who I was and asked if I could come by and see him. \n     There were muffled voices on the other end of the line, then \n     she came back on and said that I should stay put and she'd \n     send someone out to lead me to the house.\n       A few minutes later, a couple of young men in a beat-up \n     blue car came by and motioned at me. I followed them down the \n     main street and over railroad tracks to a run-down \n     neighborhood of narrow houses and potholed roads without \n     sidewalks.\n       We got out of the car and went into a tiny, shuttered house \n     whose living room was illumined only by a small television \n     set. I introduced myself to Clementine, and we talked about \n     my father for a minute or two. She emphasized that the man I \n     was about to meet was very old, quite ill, and easily \n     confused.\n       When she led me into the bedroom, I saw him, sunk down in \n     the mattress, a bag of bones. His hands and feet were gnarled \n     and knobby with arthritis, but in his face I saw my own \n     reflection.\n       I touched his arm: ``How are you feeling today?''\n       He looked up at me uncomprehendingly: ``All right.''\n       ``You know who I am?''\n       Seeing that he was lost in a fog, Clementine said, ``It's \n     Billy,'' using my childhood nickname. He looked at her, then \n     at me.\n       ``Oh, Billy,'' the voice was thin and wavering. ``How long \n     you're staying?''\n       I told him I couldn't stay long.\n       There was an awkward silence as I waited for him to say \n     something. But he just stared\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\n     at me. We looked at each other for what seemed like a very \n     long time. Finally, a lifetime's worth of questions came \n     tumbling out.\n       ``Did you ever care how I was doing?'' I asked him.\n       ``No,'' he replied uncertainly.\n       ``Did you ever try and get in touch with me?''\n       ``No,'' he looked at me blankly.\n       ``Did you ever even care what happened to me?''\n       ``No.''\n       At this point Clementine intervened: ``I don't even think \n     he knows what you're asking.''\n       I stood there a moment, resigning myself to the situation. \n     I would never get an explanation for his absence from my \n     life. Then Joseph, one of the young men who'd guided me to \n     the house and who I now realized was my half-brother, \n     beckoned me out of the room. In the hallway, he asked if I'd \n     like to visit some of my other relatives living nearby. I \n     said yes and he took me outside. We crossed the street to a \n     narrow house where an elderly woman was waiting for us. \n     Joseph introduced her to me as my Aunt Ethel. She cordially \n     invited us in.\n       Ethel had married my father's brother and served as the \n     family's unofficial archivist and historian. As we talked, \n     she asked if I knew anything about my father's family. I said \n     no. Ethel showed me some photos. She told me that his mother, \n     born in 1890, was named Fannie Self Conerly, and that they \n     spelled it with one n then. She said that Fannie's mother was \n     Sarah Ford Lovely, who had died at the age of 98, when I was \n     a boy. This woman, my great-grandmother, had been born a \n     slave.\n       After I walked back to my father's house and sat for a \n     while beside him. I stood and said, ``I've got to be going. \n     You take care of yourself.''\n       ``You too,'' he said to me. ``You ever coming back this way \n     again, Billy?''\n       I smiled and waved and left without answering, and without \n     asking him the one question that was still on my mind: Did \n     you beat my mother like they say? Did you hasten her death \n     and thus deprive me of both of you?\n       On the drive back to New Orleans I thought about my \n     discoveries--this sickly old man who was my life's most \n     intimate stranger; the fact that his blood and mine had once \n     been owned by another human being. I felt subtly altered, but \n     still the same. My father's gift to me, if you could call it \n     that, was a deeper realization that it is not the life we're \n     given that counts, but the life we make of the life we're \n     given.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4560-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DELAWARE RT. 52--KENNETT PIKE, NATIONAL SCENIC BYWAY DESIGNATION\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my continued \nendorsement for the Federal Highway Administration's National Scenic \nByways Program, and to express my support for the Kennett Pike \nPreservation Committee's efforts to seek both state and federal scenic \nbyways designation for Route 52, the Kennett Pike, in New Castle \nCounty, Delaware.\n  The National Scenic Byways Program recognizes roadways that exhibit \noutstanding examples of scenic, historic, recreational, cultural, \narcheological or natural qualities along their routes. The Kennett Pike \nboasts a number of cultural, scenic, historic and recreational values \nthat I believe make it an excellent candidate for federal designation \nas a national scenic byway.\n  Originally constructed in the 1700's and named Doe Run, the Kennett \nPike maintains much of its original character, despite more than 200 \nyears of steady development in the area. During the Revolutionary War, \nGeneral George Washington and his troops were thought to have marched \nalong the road, and, during the Civil War, soldiers settled at Camp \nBrandywine, now the location of an intersection on the Pike.\n  Along its route, not only will you find world renown tourist \nattractions, including Winterthur Museum, Hagley Museum and Longwood \nGardens, but also historic villages, numerous inns, farms, parks and \nmills. Within the Kennett Pike Corridor, over 30 sites are already \nlisted on the National Register of Historic Places, with many more \nsites in the corridor also eligible for the historic designation.\n  In addition to its historic and cultural relevance, the Kennett Pike \nhas been designated a greenway by the State of Delaware. A ride along \nthe Pike reveals a beautiful landscape of rolling hills, forests and a \nstate park. The Kennett Pike is truly a gem among the ever increasingly \npopulated suburban landscape of the middle Atlantic region.\n  In the Fall of 1999, the State of Delaware received a grant from the \nFederal Highway Administration, in the amount of $140,000, to establish \na state scenic byways program. A roadway can only be nominated for a \nnational scenic byway designation after it has been designated on the \nstate level.\n  It is my hope that the State will act quickly and implement its \nscenic byways program, so I can continue my efforts to see that Route \n52, the Kennett Pike, is designated the first national scenic byway in \nthe State of Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4560-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A TRIBUTE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the \nwinner of the American Sportfishing Association's Lifetime Achievement \nAward, Mr. Johnny Morris, who is also a friend of mine. This award is \nbeing given to Johnny today in recognition of his outstanding lifetime \ncontribution to sportfishing.\n  Johnny Morris is the founder of Bass Pro Shops, which offers anglers \nand sportsmen the same equipment that the tournament professionals use. \nHis business has expanded from its original store to include eight \nadditional shops, a catalog, a line of Bass Pro products and a \nwholesale operation that supplies more than 7,000 independent sporting \ngoods stores in the United States and several foreign countries.\n  Since 1970, Johnny has provided a place for sportsmen, and the entire \nfamily, to outfit their outdoor and sporting activities. Because of my \nlove for the outdoors and fishing, the Bass Pro Shops has long been one \nof my favorite places in Springfield to visit. I am not alone. The Bass \nPro Shops is one of Missouri's top tourist sites, attracting over three \nand a half million visitors a year.\n  In addition to outfitting anglers, Johnny donates ten percent of Bass \nPro Shops' earnings to conservation efforts, which benefit fishing \nareas far beyond Missouri's borders. Johnny believes ``the future of \nthe sport and of our business depends more on conservation and how we \nmanage our natural resources than absolutely anything else.'' To \nfurther that belief, Johnny is an outspoken supporter of not-for-profit \nand youth organizations that support or raise awareness of conservation \nissues. Organizations such as the Missouri Beautification Association, \nwhich helps clean up trash along Missouri's roadways and riverbanks, \nand ``Operation Game Thief,'' a program launched to curb poaching in \nMissouri, have benefitted from Johnny Morris' support. In March 1998, \nthe first ever World's Fishing Fair was hosted by Bass Pro Shops, and \nthe proceeds were given to Missouri forests and fisheries. I personally \nhave witnessed Johnny's commitment to his community through the many \neducational events which Bass Pro Shops hosts. Great Outdoors Day, for \nexample, brings together families to learn more about hiking, fishing, \narchery, shooting and conservation through hands-on experience. He also \nhosts Kids' Fishing Fun Day in Springfield, an event that brings \nthousands of young participants to a local pond to try their hand at \nsportfishing. His efforts show that individual initiative to preserve \none's local environment for future generations is not only responsible \ncitizenship but just plain good sense.\n  I commend Johnny Morris both for receiving this award and for his \nefforts to enrich the fishing experience for all Americans and to \npromote conservation through the Bass Pro Shops.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4561-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A TRIBUTE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Marc \nhas recently been selected to head Gateway National Recreation Area in \nNew York and New Jersey and I want to wish him well with this important \nnew assignment and thank him for the terrific job he did in managing \nAssateague over the past seven years.\n  Throughout his 29-year career in public service, Marc Koenings has \ndistinguished himself as a leader in natural and cultural resource \nmanagement and conservation at the local, national and international \nlevels. Beginning with the Peace Corps in 1971, Marc also served for \nnine years in a variety of positions with the Heritage Recreation and \nConservation Service before joining the National Park Service. He \nquickly advanced to top management jobs in four Parks including Golden \nGate National Recreation Area, Point Reyes National Seashore and Virgin \nIslands National Park where he made substantial contributions to \nimproving park facilities, protecting park resources and developing \nhighly professional work forces.\n  I came to know Marc in 1993 shortly after he came to Maryland from \nVirgin Islands National Park. I had invited Interior Secretary Bruce \nBabbitt to join me on a tour of Assateague Island and to officially \ndedicate the Beach-to-Bay Indian Trail as a National Recreational \nTrail. Marc served as host and Master of Ceremonies for the visit and I \nwas immediately impressed not only by his professionalism, but by the \nknowledge and vision which he had for Assateague after such a short \nperiod on the job. Over the past seven years, I have had the \nopportunity and privilege to work closely with Superintendent Koenings \nand members of his staff at Assateague in efforts to restore the north \nend of the island, construct a new pedestrian/bicycle bridge, protect \nthe seashore from encroaching development, and develop the new Coastal \nEcology Teaching and Research Laboratory. I know from personal \nexperience that these initiatives would not be taking place, but for \nhis persistent efforts, energy and innovation. In addition to these \nprojects, under Marc's leadership, Assateague's barrier island visitors \ncenter was expanded and improved, a new Administrative facility was \nconstructed, and new partnerships were formed to develop water trails \nand promote other eco-tourism opportunities in the area.\n  The efforts of Marc Koenings throughout his career in the National \nPark Service have had a lasting effect not only on the parks he has \nworked to protect, but on the people with whom he has come in contact. \nHe has earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues in the Park \nService as well as the visitors and citizens in the local communities \nsurrounding the parks.

Throughout his career Marc Koenings has \nexemplified a steadfast commitment to meeting this demand. I want to \nextend my personal congratulations and thanks for his many years of \nhard work and dedication to the principal conservation mission of the \nNational Park Service and join with his friends and coworkers in \nwishing him and his family well with his new endeavors.\n\n[[Page S4562]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4562-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO KENTUCKY'S TOYOTA MOTOR MANUFACTURING TEAM MEMBERS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express \ncongratulations to all of the team members at the Toyota assembly plant \nin Georgetown, Kentucky, on being recognized by J.D. Power and \nAssociates for the high quality of vehicles which they have produced.\n  It is my understanding that the Georgetown assembly plant is the only \nplant in North America to win this award this year. Moreover, I \nunderstand that all of the cars produced at the Georgetown plant have \nbeen ranked best in their category in this year's J.D. Power and \nAssociates survey of the best cars and trucks. Not only is it an \noutstanding achievement to be chosen by J.D. Power--whose rankings are \nwidely considered to be the industry standard for new car quality--to \nreceive a Gold Plant Quality Award in recognition of outstanding \nvehicle quality, but to receive this honor for the fourth time in ten \nyears is a truly remarkable accomplishment. I commend you and all of \nyour hard work in earning this award.\n  News of the announcement by J.D. Power of the Georgetown plant's \naward follows closely on the announcement by Toyota that the company \nhit a milestone with a record-breaking production of 1 million vehicles \nin North America. A significant amount of the credit for this \naccomplishment, too, belongs to the hard-working folks at the \nGeorgetown facility, and I want to congratulate you on this \nachievement, as well.\n  I am proud of the relationship between Toyota Motor Manufacturing and \nthe Commonwealth of Kentucky. Since Kentucky made its original \ninvestment in Toyota in 1986, the state has realized a 36.8 percent \nannual rate of return, and has benefited greatly from the more than $5 \nbillion which Toyota has invested statewide. Most of all, though, I am \nproud of the work being done by the Kentuckians who work at the Toyota \nplant. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States \nSenate, congratulations again on your significant achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4562-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ADOPT-A-SCHOOL PROGRAM\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, in May of 1990, the Second Grace \nUnited Methodist Church of Detroit and the First United Methodist \nChurch of Northville collaborated to ``adopt'' a Detroit Public School, \nDixon Elementary School. On June 16, 2000, the two churches, one \nmetropolitan and one suburban, will celebrate the tenth anniversary not \nonly of the Adopt-a-School Program, but also of their unique \nrelationship. I rise today to commemorate this occasion.\n  The primary emphasis of the Adopt-a-School Program is the mentoring \nplan. Adults from both of the churches, as well as the local community, \nprovide tutoring and role modeling for the students. In addition to \nweekly one-on-one sessions, the mentoring plan also includes a \ntoastmasters club, in which students practice speaking in front of \naudiences, and a great books program, which introduces students to \nfamous books and authors.\n  In its ten years, the program has experienced continual expansion, as \nadditional activities have been added for the students. There is an \nawards dinner each year at Second Grace to recognize students who have \nattained high levels of academic achievement. Christmas and Easter \nparties are held each year, as well as the Dixon School Spring Cleanup \nand Flower Planting Day. Church members also participate in school \nfunctions, including career day and musical programs. Finally, what \nbegan as a summer field trip has evolved into monthly Saturday field \ntrips for the mentors and their pupils.\n  Mr. President, the partners are pleased with how the Adopt-a-School \nProgram has developed in the last ten years. The program has touched \nthe lives of over 300 students at Dixon Elementary School, and there is \nno measure for success like that. The partners look forward to its \ncontinued development in the coming years. In addition, efforts will be \nmade by the two churches, along with Dixon Elementary School, to \ndevelop a training program to share the Adopt-a-School program with \nother faith-based communities interested in serving our children in \nurban schools.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of the many people whose hard \nwork over the last ten years has made this birthday celebration \npossible. Each year, when the partners renew their commitment to this \nprogram, it is a testament to the bridges that can be built when people \nsimply reach out to one another. On behalf of the entire United States \nSenate, I would like to wish the Adopt-a-School Program a happy 10th \nAnniversary, and continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4562-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SMURFIT-STONE CONTAINER'S MISSOULA MILL NAMED PLANT OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to bring your attention \nto the fact that the Smurfit-Stone Container Plant in Missoula, Montana \nhas received the Jefferson Smurfit Group Worldwide Award as plant of \nthe year.\n  As you know, Montana's wood products industry has been hit extremely \nhard with federal regulation and the lack of available federal fiber to \nkeep our mills running. Despite these hardships, our mill workers and \nmanagers continue to take great pride in their work and continue to do \nthe best with the hand they have been dealt.\n  The result is that Missoula's Smurfit-Stone Container employees have \nensured that their mill rose above the other 563 Smurfit facilities \nworld wide and defined themselves as being able to increase \nproductivity and reduce operating costs while actually improving safety \nand the quality of production.\n  These accomplishments were worker driven and accompanied a 20% \nreduction of OSHA incidents last year. Some times efficiency comes at \nthe expense of safety or environmental responsibility. This is not the \ncase at the Missoula plant. In addition to reducing injuries, the plant \nwas able to increase paper efficiency while reducing waste, energy \nconsumption and maintenance costs. While Montana's wood products \nindustry relies on renewable natural resources, we are keenly aware \nthat these resources must be conserved and used responsibly. Smurfit-\nStone container consistently looks for ways to make the fiber available \nto them go as far as possible. It makes sense from both a business and \nan environmental standpoint, and it is a goal that makes them one of \nthe top employers in Montana.\n  As I mentioned, Montana has been hit extremely hard by federal \nrestrictions on the wood products industry. As a result we have lost 17 \nmills in Montana over the last decade. These mills provided jobs for \nthousands of families and numerous communities. While times are \nextremely tough, Montanans involved in the industry still take great \npride in what they do. This is reflected in the honor recently bestowed \non the Missoula Smurfit-Stone Container paper mill. Clearly, this mill \ndeserves recognition not only by their parent group, but by Congress as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4562-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4562-S4563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS GREATER DETROIT CHAPTER \n                    CELEBRATES ITS 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nNational Association of Women Business Owners Greater Detroit Chapter, \nwhich tonight will celebrate its 20th Anniversary. Since 1980, members \nof the Greater Detroit Chapter have maintained their commitment not \nonly to helping fellow women business owners throughout Michigan, but \nalso to helping the communities in which these businesses reside.\n  In its twenty years, the Greater Detroit Chapter, originally the \nMichigan Chapter, has done much to publicize the efforts of women \nbusiness owners, and to create alliances between women business owners \nin the State of Michigan. In 1982, chapter members organized the first \nstatewide conference for women business owners, during which awards \nwere given to women business owners in the following categories: \nPioneer, Innovator, Dedication to Women Business Owners and Community \nService.\n  In bringing women business owners together from throughout the state,\n\n[[Page S4563]]\n\nthe chapter makes it easier for members to work together on a local \nlevel. In 1994, NAWBO North, a networking group of Northern Oakland \nCounty members, was formed. In the years since, following the \nsuccessful model of NAWBO North, satellites have been established in \nPlymouth, Detroit, Sterling Heights, Brighton, Southfield and Ann \nArbor. Involvement in a satellite allows chapter members to work with \none another to benefit the community. Currently, 89 percent of chapter \nmembers donate money to charities, 76 percent volunteer their time to \nlocal organizations, 65 percent serve on local boards, and 61 percent \nmentor other women.\n  The Greater Detroit Chapter of the NAWBO has also established many \nprograms to assist women owned businesses. In 1990, the Greater Detroit \nChapter helped to launch the EXCELI (The Initiative for Entrepreneurial \nExcellence) Project in Detroit, along with corporate partner Deloitte \nand Touche, the Small Business Administration, NAWBO's National \nFoundation and the YWCA. In 1994, the chapter took over sole \nresponsibility of this program.\n  In 1993, Huntington Banks of Michigan entered into a partnership with \nthe chapter to offer market-rate financing to chapter member companies \nthrough a special lending process for service businesses. And in June \nof 1996, Comerica Bank announced its Power Perks Program, in which \nideas, resources, and benefits are provided exclusively to NAWBO \nmembers. Over the next two years, Comerica invested approximately $10 \nmillion in the program.\n  Mr. President, women-owned small businesses are the fastest growing \nsegment of the business community. By the year 2010, they will make up \nmore than one-half of all businesses in the United States. Traveling \nthrough the State of Michigan I know that women business owners are \nworking very hard to be successful. The twentieth anniversary of the \nNational Association of Women Business Owners Greater Detroit Chapter \nis certainly evidence of this.\n  And this incredible growth has been accomplished in spite of some \ndisadvantages. For example, it is clear that the federal government \ndoes not do business with a representative percentage of women-owned \nbusinesses. This issue was brought to my attention by NAWBO members at \na Small Business Committee meeting I held last August in Troy, \nMichigan.\n\n  Mr. President, in 1994, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act \nestablished a modest five percent goal of federal procurement dollars \nfor women-owned businesses. Last year, though, women-owned businesses \nreceived only 2.4 percent of the total dollar value of all prime \nfederal contracts.\n  Mr. President, these standards have to change. There are too many \nwomen in this nation working too hard, only to not find the proper \nsupport from Washington. Earlier this week, I cosponsored Senate \nResolution 311, a resolution urging the President to adopt a policy in \nsupport of the five percent federal procurement goal, and to encourage \nthe heads of the federal departments and agencies to undertake a \nconcerted effort to meet this five percent goal before the end of the \nfiscal year 2000. I strongly hope that this action on my part and the \npart of my colleagues will lead to an increased procurement for women \nowned businesses this fiscal year.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the many members of the National Association \nof Women Business Owners Greater Detroit Chapter on the great work they \nare doing for women business owners throughout the State of Michigan. I \nfeel that there is much more we can do here in Washington to support \nthem, and I hope that changes will be made, and followed through upon, \nin this regard. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, I wish \nthe greater Detroit Chapter a happy 20th Anniversary, and continued \nsuccess in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4563-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4563-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED ON MAY 30, 2000\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  A message from the House of Representatives, delivered during the \nadjournment of the Senate, announced that the Speaker has signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 4489.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to extend to \npersons over age 64 eligibility for medical care under CHAMPUS and \nTRICARE; to extend the TRICARE Senior Prime demonstration program in \nconjunction with the extension of eligibility under CHAMPUS and TRICARE \nto such persons, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n       legislation regarding medicare-eligible military retirees\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, S. 2669, to \nafford members the opportunity to examine the issues related to the \ncomplicated military medical program. We desire to change the existing \nprogram to encompass, in the future, retirees over age 65.\n  Beginning in World War II promises were made to military members that \nthey and their families would be provided health care if they served a \nfull career. Subsequent legislation was enacted which cut off medical \nbenefits at age 65, leaving them to depend on the Medicare system, \nwhich has provided to be inefficient. This is a breach of promise made \non behalf of our country to retirees who devoted a significant portion \nof their lives with careers in service to their country. I recognize \nwith profound sorrow how we broke this promise to these retirees.\n  I have gone back and carefully examined these issues. There is no \nstatutory foundation providing for entitlement to military health care \nbenefits. It does not exist. It is a myth. But good faith \nrepresentation was made to these members. Who made the commitment is \nirrelevant. I know personally that these representations were made. I \nserved in the military and heard the same promises.\n  My Committee has made a determination, a bipartisan decision, that we \nwould fix the issue of health care for our older retirees, this year. \nWe have started with a series of bills, strengthening them as we went \nalong, listening to those beneficiaries who use the system. The \nlegislation I bring to the floor today repeals the restriction barring \n65 and older military retirees and their families from continued access \nto the military health care system. If enacted, this legislation will \nprovide an equal benefit for all military health care system \nbeneficiaries, retirees, reservists, guardsmen and families. This puts \nall beneficiaries in the same class. It is fairly expensive, but we \nneed to do it.\n  The legislation is a quantum leap over the provisions included in the \nCommittee markup of the annual Defense bill. While the markup includes \na comprehensive drug benefit regardless of age, the legislation goes \nfurther and provides uninterrupted access to complete health care \nservices.\n  As a result of my initiatives, all military retirees, irrespective of \nage, will now enjoy the same health care benefit.\n  In Town Hall meetings, I have listened carefully to the health care \nconcerns of military retirees--particularly those over age 65 who have \nlost their entitlement to health care within the current military \nhealth care system. The constant theme that runs through their requests \nis that, once they reach the point at which they are eligible for \nMedicare, they are no longer guaranteed care from the military health \ncare system. This discriminatory characteristic of our current system--\nthat has been in effect since 1964--reduces retiree medical benefits \nand requires a significant change in the manner in which health care is \nobtained at a point in the lives of our older military retirees when \nstability and confidence are most important. This bill, in effect, \nrepeals the 1964 law.\n  The bill that I am proposing today would eliminate the current \ndiscrimination based on age and would permit military retirees \nand their dependents to be served by the military health care system \nthroughout their lives. Under my proposal, it would not matter whether \nthe military retiree is 47 years old or 77 years old. He or she will be \ncovered by the military health care system while on active duty and \nthroughout their retirement. No new systems will be required, although \nthe existing military system may require assistance from the Congress \nto strengthen its ability to serve all retirees. This bill eliminates \nthe confusing and ineffective transfer of funds from Medicare to the \nDepartment of Defense. Military retirees will not be required to pay \nthe high cost of additional basic or supplemental insurance premiums to \nensure their health care needs are met. Military readiness will not be \nadversely impacted and our commitment to those who served a full career \nwill be fulfilled.\n\n  In order to permit the Department of Defense to plan for restoring \nthe health care benefit to all retirees, my bill would be effective on \nOctober 1, 2001. While some may advocate an earlier effective date, it \nis simply not feasible to expand the medical coverage to the 1.8 \nmillion Medicare-eligible retirees overnight.\n  What is apparent to me is that the will of the Congress, reflecting \nthe will of the Nation, is that now is the time to act on this issue. \nMy bill would eliminate the discriminatory practice that caused concern \namong our military retirees and will restore full benefits of the \nmilitary health care system to all retirees.\n  Access to military health care has reached a crisis point. With the \nreduction in the number of military hospitals and with the growth in \nthe retiree population, addressing the health care needs of our older \nretirees has become increasingly difficult. These beneficiaries should \nbe assured that their health care needs will be met. They were promised \na healthcare benefit, they served to earn a benefit, and our country \nneeds to fulfill the commitments that were made to them.\n  I am well aware of the legislative alternatives that have been \nproposed to address military retiree health care needs. I have \nstruggled to examine the most acute needs of these beneficiaries and \nhave struggled to develop a plan that equally benefits all our \nretirees, not just those fortunate enough to live near a military \nmedical facility, or those fortunate enough to be selected through some \nsort of lottery to be allowed to participate in the various pilot \nprograms now underway. My goal is to provide health care through a \nmeans that is available to all beneficiaries, in an equitable and \ncomplete manner.\n  As I have made it clear throughout the year, improving the military \nhealth care system has been the Committee's top quality of life \ninitiative this year. My Committee has held hearings and listened to a \nvariety of beneficiary representatives. I have traveled throughout my \nstate and listened to the concerns of retirees. I conducted an \nextensive town hall meeting in Norfolk in March. I have met with many \nretirees and their representatives at my office, during my travels, and \neven in social settings. I have listened.\n  This extensive review has allowed me to examine carefully how to \napproach this issue. The number one priority I\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\nheard from retirees was the importance of access to pharmaceuticals. \nThis inspired me to develop S. 2087, which provided a mail order \npharmacy benefit for all military beneficiaries, including--for the \nfirst time--all Medicare eligible retirees. S. 2087 also addressed a \nnumber of other issues with the military health care system including \nsome critical improvements to the TRICARE program for both active duty \nand retirees and their family members. I appreciate the bipartisan \nsupport of so many of my colleagues in crafting and introducing this \ncritical first step.\n\n  In my many meetings with retirees, and through discussions with my \ncolleagues, I came to understand the need to further enhance S. 2087. I \nproposed amendments to the budget resolution to increase the funding \navailable to address retiree health care needs. Then, again with \nbipartisan support, I crafted a new piece of legislation which improved \nand enhanced the pharmacy provisions of the original legislation. With \nspecial assistance from Senator Snowe and Senator Kennedy, the new S. \n2486 included an enhanced pharmacy benefit with no enrollment fees, \nthat included both retail and mail order programs. This improved \nlegislation addressed the major unmet need of retirees, access to \npharmaceuticals, and provides an equitable benefit, one that is not \ndiscriminatory based on age. This legislation was included during \nCommittee consideration of the Fiscal Year 2001 National Defense \nAuthorization Bill, with the overwhelming support of Committee members.\n  The bill now before the Congress compliments my earlier efforts and \nthose of the Committee. This bill, in conjunction with the provisions \nin the Defense Authorization Bill, would provide a complete health care \nbenefit for all military retirees. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and my statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2669\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to \nrequire major rules of agencies to be approved by Congress in order to \ntake effect, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n         the congressional regulatory review reform act of 2000\n\n Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to curb Federal over-regulation by the executive branch of \nGovernment and to restore congressional accountability for the \nregulatory process.\n  The annual regulatory costs of the Federal Government on the private \nsector have been estimated to be $200-$800 billion annually. The pace \nand scope of over-regulation has accelerated under the Clinton \nAdministration. For example, the IRS has tried to raise taxes \nadministratively, the EPA has exceeded its authority with the Clean \nWater Action Plan and the National Park Service is trying to eliminate \nsnowmobile use in our national parks, all without congressional \nauthorization. Increasingly, we have found that this administration \ntries to advance through regulation and executive order an agenda it \ncannot get done through the normal legislative process. In fact, there \nare currently 137 major regulations in the works that will each have at \nleast a $100 million cost. That means these new regulations will impose \nat least a $13.7 billion yearly impact on the economy.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has allowed this to happen. For years \nCongress has delegated its most fundamental responsibility--the \ncreation of laws--to the executive branch. Consequently, rather than \njust enforce laws, these unelected bureaucrats now also write the laws. \nThese regulatory bureaucracies have often been called the fourth branch \nof Government. This fourth branch has misinterpreted, undercut and \ndirectly contradicted the will of Congress time and time again. It is \nwell past time to end this ``regulation without representation.''\n  As many of my colleagues know, Congress passed the Congressional \nReview Act in 1996 in an attempt to slow the executive regulatory \nmachine. For the first time, this law established a process by which \nCongress can review and disapprove virtually all federal agency rules. \nUnfortunately, the promise of the Act has not been fulfilled.\n  Between 1996 and 1999, 12,269 non-major rules and 186 major rules \nwere submitted to Congress by federal agencies. Only seven joint \nresolutions of disapproval were introduced, pertaining to five rules. \nNone passed either House. In fact, none have even been debated on the \nfloor of either House.\n  The legislation I introduce today will address the flaws in the \nCongressional Review Act and restore the proper balance between the \ncongressional and executive branches when it comes to rule-making. The \nCongressional Regulatory Review Reform Act will require all major rules \n(those with a $100 million annual impact as defined by the Office of \nManagement in consultation with GAO) to be approved by Congress before \nthey take effect. If Congress disapproves a rule, an agency will be \nprecluded from proposing the same or similar rule for a period of 6 \nmonths. A rule may be given interim effectiveness if the President \ndetermines and certifies that a rule should take effect because of an \nimminent threat to health and safety or emergency (this decision is not \njudicially reviewable). Finally, the president is authorized to \nestablish, by executive order a program for the systematic review of \nagency rules.\n  I believe that congressional review and accountability for federal \nregulations will improve efficiency and lessen federal government \nintervention in the daily lives of the American people. Congress cannot \nallow the Executive Branch to continue to legislate through rules and \nregulations. Congress must be responsible. Congress must take back its \nconstitutionally granted authority over the rule-making process.\n  This is not a partisan issue. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer \nsuggested this idea as long ago as 1984. Nor is the purpose of this \nlegislation to overturn a great number of rules submitted by agencies. \nIt is intended to increase incentives regulators have to respond to the \nviews of the general public, rather than narrow interests and to make \nCongress and the president more politically accountable for the \nresulting rules.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthis commonsense, good government reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 2671. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to promote \npension opportunities for women, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S4567]]\n\n    the pension opportunities for women's equality in retirement act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Pension \nOpportunities for Women's Equality in Retirement (POWER) Act of 2000. \nThis legislation is important because the current tax code often fails \nto give women--especially women who take time off to raise children--\nsufficient opportunities to earn a large enough pension to guarantee \ntheir financial security in retirement.\n\n  The facts demonstrate that women need help in building pensions for \ntheir future. In America today, two-thirds of women over 65 have no \npension other than Social Security. This translates into 300,000 women \nin my home state of Missouri and 14 million women nationwide. At the \nsame time, the median income from assets for women age 65 and over is \nonly $860 a year. Retirement is often compared to a three-legged stool, \nwith the three legs being pensions, savings, and Social Security. Now, \neveryone knows what happens to a three legged stool when one of the \nlegs is missing: it falls over. But these statistics shows that many, \ntoo many, American women are trying to manage their retirements on only \none leg of the stool.\n  As a result of the lack of pensions and relatively low savings among \nAmerican women, older women are twice as likely as older men to be \nliving near or below the federal poverty threshold. Further, the \npoverty rates for widows, divorced women, and never-married women are \nsignificantly higher than the rate for all elderly women. The 20 \nmillion elderly American women--including 440,000 in Missouri--carry an \nextremely high risk of poverty.\n  The causes for this risk can be found in the tax code and pension \nrules. One of the key elements of pension building is called vesting. \nEmployees cannot build pension assets until they vest, or serve at a \nparticular job for a redetermined amount of time, often 5 years. \nEmployers have a perfectly good reason for vesting requirements--they \nwant to encourage job stability--and there is no inherent bias in these \nrequirements. But the effect of these requirements is to make it harder \nfor women to build up pension assets. The reason for this is that the \nmedian job tenure for women is 3.8 years, well below the median job \ntenure for men, as well as the 5 years most pension plans require for \nvesting.\n  Another problem women face is that 59 percent of women have not \nfigured out how much they need to save for retirement. When workers, \nmen and women alike, are younger, they are frequently not thinking of \nhow much they need to save for retirement. Younger workers are \nconcerned with mortgages, school loans, children's needs. When these \nworkers get older, and start thinking about retirement, they often \nincrease the amount of money they will put away for retirement. \nUnfortunately women, who have often spent less time in the workplace, \nhave less time in which to make the required `catch-up' contributions \nthat will help create a stable and secure retirement. This process is \nmade even harder by existing rules that limit the amounts of the catch-\nup contributions.\n  Given the difficulties women, especially unmarried women, face in \ntheir retirement years, I believe that it is time for the Congress to \nstep up and to ensure that retirement security law provides for higher \ncontribution limits for working women, easier catch-up to make up for \nyears women missed in the labor force, and increased portability of \npensions.\n  The POWER Act of 2000 will do three major things: First, the bill \nwill increase contribution limits, allowing workers to contribute more \nmoney to retirement accounts during their working years, thereby \nensuring that their retirements will be more secure.\n  For workers who are over fifty, the bill allows additional pension \ncontributions of up to 50 percent more than allowed under current law. \nThis provision is particularly helpful to women who leave the labor \nforce to raise their children, and then want to ``catch-up'' when they \nare older by increasing their contributions in the years leading up to \nretirement. This bill also requires employers to vest employees \nearlier, so that women, who have shorter average job tenures, can \naccrue pension benefits earlier.\n  The bill's third section eases portability of pensions among workers \nwho switch jobs. The bill eases rollovers and requires that rollovers \napply to all retirement plans. In addition, the bill extends pension \nrollovers to include post-tax as well as pre-tax distributions, and \ncalls for the post-tax distributions to be accounted for separately.\n  These provisions are not controversial. They have all passed both the \nSenate and the House of Representatives as part of the Taxpayer Refund \nand Relief Act. President Clinton vetoed that earlier bill. I disagree \nwith the President, but he is entitled to his opinion. On these \nprovisions, however, it is impossible to claim that these female-\nfriendly provisions will cost too much money. The provisions in this \nbill will help all workers save more for retirement, and develop larger \npensions for their golden years.\n  This bill will particularly help women, who face a much greater risk \nof poverty. While the POWER Act will help both women and men save for \nretirement, it will correct specific pension inequalities in the \ncurrent law that particularly hurt women. Missouri's nearly 900,000 \nworking women certainly will benefit through enhanced opportunities to \ncreate financial security for retirement. In Missouri, 65 percent of \nworking age women are in the paid labor force. According to the \nMissouri Women's Council, only 26 percent of older women receive a \npension, compared with 47 percent of men. In addition, the pensions \nthat women do receive are significantly less than those of men--$4,200 \nfor women, on average, compared with $7,800 for men.\n  I hope that the Senate will take quick action on this matter, to help \nAmerican women provide for safe and secure retirements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2672.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this \nbill today which will provide for the transfer of the Sugar Pine Dam \nand Reservoir Project in the Central Valley Project to the Forest Hills \nPublic Utility District. I continue to support the transfer of the \nBureau of Reclamation projects to the local water districts which \noperate and benefit from them.\n\n  This bill is important in one other way. The language in this bill \nwill correct the financial inequity that affects CVP beneficiaries. \nSome of the costs of constructing Bureau of Reclamation projects have \nbeen allocated to other CVP contractors even though the projects have \nnever been operationally integrated into the CVP. Thus, Irrigation and \nMunicipal and Industrial (M) contractors such as Contra Costa Water \nDistrict, East Bay MUD, Santa Clara Valley Water District, Sacramento \nMUD, City of Fresno and a number of others have incurred substantial \ncosts without ever receiving any benefit.\n  This bill has the bipartisan support of Congressman George Miller and \nJohn Doolittle in the House. And I can think of no opposition to \nassisting Forest Hills Public Utility District and other M \ncontractors with this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 2673. A bill to direct the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain land to Eureka County, Nevada, for continued use as cemeteries, \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               the eureka county cemetery conveyance act\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Eureka County \nCemetery Conveyance Act.\n  The settlement of Beowawe, Nevada was destination and home to \npioneers that settled the isolated high desert of the central Great \nBasin. The inhabitants of this community set aside a specific community \ncemetery to provide the final resting place for friends and family who \npassed away. The early settlers established and managed the cemetery in \nthe late 1800's. The Beowawe cemetery is on land currently managed by \nthe Bureau of Land Management (BLM).\n\n[[Page S4568]]\n\n  The site of these historic cemetery was established prior to the \ncreation of the BLM as an agency. The BLM was created in 1946. Under \ncurrent law, the agency must sell the encumbered land at fair market \nvalue to this community. My bill provides for conveyance of this \ncemetery to Eureka County, at no cost. It is unconscionable to me that \nthis community would have to buy their ancestors back from the Federal \ngovernment.\n  I sincerely hope that members of Congress recognize the benefit to \nthe local community that the conveyances would provide and pass this \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2673\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the historical use by settlers and travelers since the \n     late 1800's of the cemetery known as ``Maiden's Grave \n     Cemetery'' in Beowawe, Nevada, predates incorporation of the \n     land on which the cemetery is situated within the \n     jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management; and\n       (2) it is appropriate that that use be continued through \n     local public ownership of the parcel rather than through the \n     permitting process of the Federal agency.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONVEYANCE TO EUREKA COUNTY, NEVADA.\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--The Secretary of the Interior, acting \n     through the Director of the Bureau of Land Management \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary''), shall \n     convey, without consideration, subject to valid existing \n     rights, to Eureka County, Nevada (referred to in this section \n     as the ``county''), all right, title, and interest of the \n     United States in and to the parcel of land described in \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Description of Land.--The parcel of land referred to in \n     subsection (a) is the parcel of public land (including any \n     improvements on the land) known as ``Maiden's Grave \n     Cemetery'', consisting of approximately 10 acres and more \n     particularly described as S1/2NE1/4SW1/4SW1/4, N1/2SE1/4SW1/\n     4SW1/4 of section 10, T.31N., R.49E., Mount Diablo Meridian.\n       (c) Use of Land.--\n       (1) In general.--The county shall continue the use of the \n     parcel conveyed under subsection (a) as a cemetery.\n       (2) Reversion.--If the Secretary, after notice to the \n     county and an opportunity for a hearing, makes a finding that \n     the county has discontinued the use of the parcel conveyed \n     under subsection (a) as a cemetery, title to the parcel shall \n     revert to the Secretary.\n       (d) Right-of-Way.--At the time of the conveyance under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary shall grant the county a right-\n     of-way allowing access for persons desiring to visit the \n     cemetery and other cemetery purposes over an appropriate \n     access route.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2674. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code to provide for \nrealignment of the Department of Defense workforce; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n  the department of defense civilian workforce realignment act of 2000\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the Federal Government is facing \na little-known, yet serious problem that jeopardizes its ability to \nprovide services to the American people--a crisis in human capital. The \nfederal workforce has endured years of downsizing, hiring freezes, and \ninadequate investment in the dedicated men and women who comprise the \nfederal civil service. As a result, the Federal Government is ill-\nequipped to compete with the private sector for a new generation of \ntechnology-savvy workers to replace the nearly 900,000 ``baby boomers'' \nwho will be eligible for retirement from the civil service in the next \n5 years.\n  To meet that challenge, I rise today to introduce legislation, along \nwith my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator Mike DeWine, that will \nhelp one critical department of our Federal Government--the Department \nof Defense--get a head start in addressing its future workforce needs. \nOur bill, the ``Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment \nAct of 2000,'' provides the Department of Defense with greater \nflexibility to adequately manage its civilian workforce and align its \nhuman capital to meet the demands of the post-cold-war environment.\n  During the last decade, the Department of Defense underwent a massive \ncivilian workforce downsizing program that saw a cut of more than \n280,000 positions. In addition, the Defense Department--like other \nfederal departments--was subject to hiring restrictions. Taken \ntogether, these two factors have inhibited the development of mid-level \ncareer, civilian professionals; the men and women who serve a vital \nrole in the management and development of our nation's military. The \nextent of this problem is exhibited in the fact that right now, the \nDepartment is seriously understaffed in certain key occupations, such \nas computer experts and foreign language specialists. The lack of such \nprofessionals has the potential to affect the Defense Department's \nability to respond effectively and rapidly to military threats to our \nnation.\n  The need to address the pending human capital crisis in the federal \nworkforce is increasingly apparent, as more and more leaders \nacknowledge that our past policies did not consider future federal \nworkforce needs. Indeed, in testimony before the Oversight of \nGovernment Management Subcommittee, which I chair, the head of the \nGeneral Accounting Office, Comptroller General David Walker, stated, \n``(I)n cutting back on the hiring of new staff in order to reduce the \nnumber of their employees, agencies also reduced the influx of new \npeople with the new competencies needed to sustain excellence.''\n  The bill that Senator DeWine and I are introducing today will help \nrespond to these concerns by giving the Department of Defense the \nassistance it needs to shape the ``skills mix'' of the current \nworkforce in order to address shortfalls brought about by years of \ndownsizing. Our bill will also help the Department meet its needs for \nnew skills in emerging technological and professional areas.\n  Another area of concern for the Department of Defense--as well as \nmany other federal agencies--is the serious demographic challenges that \nexist in its workforce. The average Defense Department employee is 45 \nyears old, and more than a third of the Department's workforce is age \n51 or older. In the Department of the Air Force, for example, 45 \npercent of the workforce will be eligible for either regular retirement \nor early retirement by 2005.\n  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH, is an excellent \nexample of the demographic challenge facing military installations \nacross the country. Wright-Patterson is the headquarters of the Air \nForce Materiel Command, and employs 22,700 civilian federal workers. By \n2005, 60 percent of the Base's civilian workforce will be eligible for \neither regular retirement or early retirement. Although a mass exodus \nof all retirement-eligible employees is not anticipated, there is a \ngenuine concern that a significant portion of the Wright-Patterson \ncivilian workforce, including hundreds of key leaders and employees \nwith crucial expertise, could decide to retire, leaving the remaining \nworkforce without experienced leadership and absent essential \ninstitutional knowledge.\n  This combination of factors poses a serious challenge to the long-\nterm effectiveness of the civilian component of the Defense Department, \nand by implication, the national security of the United States.\n  Military base leaders, and indeed the entire Defense establishment, \nneed to be given the flexibility to hire new employees so they can \nbegin to develop another generation of civilian leaders and employees \nwho will be able to provide critical support to our men and women in \nuniform.\n  That is the purpose of the legislation we are introducing today. The \nDepartment of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment Act addresses the \ncurrent imbalance between the federal workforce and the skills needed \nto run the Federal Government in the 21st century, as well as the age \nimbalance between new employees and the potential mass retirement of \nsenior public employees in the next 5 years. If we wait for this \n``retirement bubble'' to burst before we begin to hire new employees, \nthen not only will we be woefully understaffed in a number of key \nareas, but we will have fewer seasoned individuals left in the federal \nworkforce who can provide training and mentoring.\n  The provisions in our bill will allow the Defense Department to \nconduct a smoother transition by bringing new employees into the \nDepartment over\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\nthe next 5 years. The new employees will have the opportunity to work \nwith and learn from their more experienced colleagues, and invaluable \ninstitutional knowledge will be passed along.\n  While this proposal does not address all of the human capital needs \nof the Defense Department, it will help ensure that the Department of \nDefense recruits and retains a quality civilian workforce so that our \nArmed Forces may remain the best in the world. It is extremely \nimportant to the future vitality of the Department's civilian workforce \nand the national security of the United States that we address the \nhuman capital crisis while we have the opportunity. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nprinted in full in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2674\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today Senator Voinovich and I are \nintroducing the Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment \nAct of 2000. This legislation is designed to give the Department of \nDefense some of the administrative flexibility it needs to shape the \ncivilian workforce to meet the tremendous national defense challenges \nthat face our nation well into this century.\n  My colleague from Ohio and I, along with our Ohio colleagues in the \nHouse, Mr. Hobson and Mr. Hall have been working on this issue for \nalmost two years. What has fostered this bipartisan unity is the \ncurrent workforce situation at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in \nDayton, Ohio. What we have seen there is a rather large microcosm of a \ncurrent and growing problem that affects the civilian workforce \nthroughout our defense infrastructure. At Wright-Patterson, this \nproblem threatens to diminish significantly the pool of talented \nexperts in critical research and development fields. As I have often \nsaid, Wright-Patterson is the brain power behind our air power, and is \nthe central reason why our Air Force is second to none in technological \nand aeronautical superiority.\n  Wright-Patterson has already lost a significant number of people who \nconstituted that brain power as a result of Cold War downsizing. In the \nlast decade alone, 8,000 positions at Wright-Patterson have been lost. \nFor the entire Department of Defense, approximately 280,000 positions \nwere lost during the same period. At the same time we were downsizing, \nhiring restrictions prevented the Defense Department from establishing \na foundation of younger innovators. In short, the combination of \ndownsizing, retirement, and a hiring freeze has left a shallow talent \npool of young skilled workers.\n  The statistics tell the story. Today, for example, nearly one out of \n10 civilian workers at Wright-Patterson's Aeronautical Systems Center \nare under the age of 35, while more than one-third of the workforce is \nover the age of 50. In less than five years, more than half of this \nworkforce will be eligible for retirement, but only 2.5 percent will be \nunder the age of 35. This trend is typical for all civilian functions \nat Wright-Patterson.\n  The Department of Defense Civilian Workforce Realignment Act would \nextend, revise and expand the Defense Department's limited authority to \nuse voluntary incentive pay and voluntary early retirement. Our bill \nwould allow for the Department to utilize the added authority to \nrestructure the civilian workforce to meet missions needs and to \ncorrect skill imbalances. Given the significant numbers of eligible \nfederal retirees the Department will face in just a few short years, \nthis legislation would give the Department the ability to better manage \nthis extraordinary transition period. Just as important, this smoother \ntransition period would allow for better and more effective development \nof our younger workers, who will have a better chance to learn and gain \nfrom the expertise of the older generation of innovators.\n  The legislation we are introducing, fundamentally for Wright-\nPatterson Air Force Base, is about maintaining technological \nsuperiority. That superiority is the foundation of future Air Force \ndominance in the skies. It's that simple. Weakening that foundation \nplaces the lives of our pilots and the security of our nation at risk. \nOur legislation is a positive step toward rebuilding and strengthening \nthat foundation with an investment in those who will make tomorrow's \ndiscoveries and breakthroughs that will keep our pilots safe and our \nnation secure.\n  I am pleased that the Department of the Air Force and the Department \nof Defense have expressed the need for workforce realignment \nlegislation. I believe the legislation Senator Voinovich and I are \nintroducing today will meet the concerns they have expressed not just \nto us, but also to other members of the House and Senate.\n  I want to thank Senator Voinovich for his efforts and leadership on \nhis legislation, and also want to extend my appreciation to his staff, \nespecially Aric Newhouse and Andrew Richardson, for their hard work. \nThe Miami Valley community also has been of great help in demonstrating \nthe importance of this issue not just to Wright-Patterson but also to \nthe entire region and the nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 2675. A bill to establish an Office on Women's Health within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                   women's health office act of 2000\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nWomen's Health Office Act of 2000 and I am pleased to be joined on this \nlegislation by my friend and colleague, Senator Barbara Mikulski. \nCompanion legislation to this bill has been introduced in the House by \nCongresswomen Connie Morella and Carolyn Maloney.\n  The Women's Health Office Act of 2000 provides permanent \nauthorization for offices of women's health in five federal agencies: \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC); the Agency for Health Care \nResearch and Quality (AHRQ); the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration (HRSA); and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n  Currently, only two women's health offices in the federal government \nhave statutory authorization: the Office of Research on Women's Health \nat the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Office for Women's \nServices within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration (SAMHSA).\n  For too many years, women's health care needs were ignored or poorly \nunderstood, and women were systematically excluded from important \nhealth research. One famous medical study on breast cancer examined \nhundreds of men. Another federally-funded study examined the ability of \naspirin to prevent heart attacks in 20,000 medical doctors, all of whom \nwere men, despite the fact that heart disease is the leading cause \namong women.\n  Today, members of Congress and the American public understand the \nimportance of ensuring that both genders benefit equally from medical \nresearch\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\nand health care services. Unfortunately, equity does not yet exist in \nhealth care, and we have a long way to go. Knowledge about appropriate \ncourses of treatment for women lags far behind that for men for many \ndiseases. For years, research into diseases that predominantly affect \nwomen, such as breast cancer, went grossly underfunded. And many women \ndo not have access to reproductive and other vital health services.\n  Throughout my tenure in the House and Senate, I have worked hard to \nexpose and eliminate this health care gender gap and improve women's \naccess to affordable, quality health services. Ten years, ago, as co-\nchairs of the Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues (CCWI), \nRepresentative Pat Schroeder and I, along with Representative Henry \nWaxman, called for a GAO investigation into the inclusion of women and \nminorities in medical research at the National Institutes of Health.\n  This study documented the widespread exclusion of women from medical \nresearch, and spurred the Caucus to introduce the first Women's Health \nEquity Act (WHEA) in 1990. This comprehensive legislation provided \nCongress with its first broad, forward-looking health agenda designed \nto redress the historical inequities that face women in medical \nresearch, prevention and services.\n\n  Three years later Congress enacted legislation mandating the \ninclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials at NIH through the \nNational Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-43). \nAlso included in the NIH Revitalization Act was language establishing \nthe NIH Office of Research on Women's Health--language based on my \noriginal Office of Women's Health bill that was introduced in the 104th \nCongress.\n  And yet, despite all the progress that we have made, there is still a \nlong way to go on women's health care issues. Last month, the GAO \nreleased a report--a ten-year update--on the status of women's research \nat NIH (``NIH Has Increased Its Efforts to Include Women in Research,'' \npublished on May 2, 2000). This report found that since the first GAO \nreport and the 1993 legislation, NIH has made significant progress \ntoward including women as subjects in both intramural and external \nclinical trials.\n  However, the report notes that the Institutes have made less progress \nin implementing the requirement that certain clinical trials be \ndesigned and carried out to permit valid analysis by sex, which could \nreveal whether interventions affect women and men differently. The GAO \nfound that NIH researchers will include women in their trials--but then \nthey will either not do analysis on the basis of sex, or if no \ndifference was found, they will not publish the sex-based results.\n  NIH has done a good job of improving participation of women in \nclinical trials, but our commitment to women's health this is not about \nquotas and numbers. It is about real scientific advances that will \nimprove our knowledge about women's health. At a time when we are on \ntrack to double funding for NIH, it is troubling that the agency has \nstill failed to fully implement both its own guidelines and Congress's \ndirective for sex-based analysis. And as a result, women continue to be \nshortchanged by federal research efforts.\n  The crux of the matter is that NIH's problems exist despite the fact \nthat it has an Office of Women's Health that is codified in law. If NIH \nis having problems, imagine the difficulties we will have in continuing \nthe focus on women's health in offices that don't have this legislative \nmandate, and that may change focus with a new HHS Secretary or Agency \nDirector.\n  Offices of Women's Health across the Public Health Service are \ncharged with coordinating women's health activities and monitoring \nprogress on women's health issues within their respective agencies, and \nthey have been successful in making federal programs and policies more \nresponsive to women's health issues. Unfortunately, all of the good \nwork these offices are doing is not guaranteed in Public Health Service \nauthorizing law. Providing statutory authorization for federal women's \nhealth offices is a critical step in ensuring that women's health \nresearch will continue to receive the attention it requires in future \nyears.\n\n  Codifying these offices of women's health is important for several \nreasons: First, it re-emphasizes Congress's commitment to focusing on \nwomen's health. Second, it ensures that Agencies will enact Congress's \nintent with good faith. Finally, it ensures that appropriations will be \navailable in future years to fulfill these commitments.\n  By statutorily creating Offices of Women's Health, the Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Women's Health will be able to better monitor \nvarious Public Health Service agencies and advise them on scientific, \nlegal, ethical and policy issues. Agencies would establish a \nCoordinating Committee on Women's Health to identify and prioritize \nwhich women's health projects should be conducted. This will also \nprovide a mechanism for coordination within and across these agencies, \nand with the private sector. But most importantly, this bill will \nensure the presence of enduring offices dedicated to addressing the \nongoing needs and gaps in research policy, programs, and education and \ntraining in women's health.\n  Improving the health of American women requires a far greater \nunderstanding of women's health needs and conditions, and ongoing \nevaluation in the areas of research, education, prevention, treatment \nand the delivery of services. I urge my colleagues to join Senator \nMikulski and me in supporting this legislation, to help ensure that \nwomen's health will never again be a missing page in America's medical \ntextbook.\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join my good friend and \ncolleague, Senator Snowe, to introduce the Women's Health Office Act of \n2000. I'm pleased to join Senator Snowe in introducing this bill \nbecause it establishes an important framework to address women's health \nwithin the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS).\n  Historically, women's health needs were ignored or inadequately \naddressed by the medical establishment and the government. It is really \nonly in the last ten years that the health of women has begun to \nreceive more attention. A 1990 General Accounting Office (GAO) report \nacknowledged the historical pattern of neglect of women in health \nresearch, and especially the exclusion of women as research subjects in \nmany clinical trials. This was unacceptable. Women make up half or more \nof the population and must be adequately included in clinical research. \nThat's why I fought to establish the Office of Research on Women's \nHealth (ORWH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ten years ago. \nWe needed to ensure that women were included in clinical research, so \nthat we would know how treatments for a particular disease or condition \nwould affect women. Would men and women react the same way to a \nparticular treatment for heart disease? We had no way of knowing \nbecause women were not being included in clinical trials.\n  While the ORWH began its work in 1990, I wanted to ensure that it \nstayed at NIH and had the necessary authority to carry out its mission \nof ensuring that women were included in clinical research. That's why I \nauthored legislation in 1990 and 1991 to formally establish the ORWH in \nthe Office of the Director of NIH. These provisions were later enacted \ninto law in the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993.\n  Last year, Senator Harkin, Senator Snowe, and I requested that GAO \nexamine how well the NIH and ORWH was carrying out the mandates under \nthe NIH Revitalization Act of 1993. The results were mixed. While NIH \nhad made substantial progress in ensuring the inclusion of women in \nclinical research, it had made less progress in encouraging the \nanalysis of study findings by sex. This means that women are being \nincluded in clinical trials, but we are not able to fully reap the \nbenefits of inclusion because analysis of how interventions affect men \nand women is not being done. While the NIH is taking steps to address \nthis, we are missing information from research done over the last few \nyears about how the outcomes of the research varied or not for men and \nwomen.\n  NIH is but one agency in the DHHS. Other agencies in DHHS do not even \nhave women's health offices. How are these other agencies addressing \nwomen's health? Only NIH and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration (SAMHSA) have statutory authorization for \noffices dedicated to women's health. Other\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\nagencies in HHS have a hodgepodge of women's health offices or \nadvisors/coordinators, some of whom have experienced cuts in their \nfunding. For example, funding for the Food and Drug Administration's \n(FDA) Office of Women's Health has decreased from $2 million in Fiscal \nYear 1995 to $1.6 million in Fiscal Year 2000. In addition, funding for \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Office of \nWomen's Health was cut more than 10% between Fiscal Year 1999 and \nFiscal Year 2000.\n  I believe we need a consistent and comprehensive approach to address \nthe needs of women's health in the DHHS. This bill that I join Senator \nSnowe in introducing today would do just that. The Women's Health \nOffice Act of 2000 would provide authorization for women's health \noffices in DHHS, CDC, the FDA, the Agency for Healthcare Research and \nQuality (AHRQ), and the Health Resources and Serivces Administration \n(HRSA).\n  This legislation establishes an important framework and build on \nexisting efforts. The HHS Office on Women's Health would take over all \nfunctions which previously belonged to the current Office of Women's \nHealth of the Public Health Service. The HHS Office would be headed by \na Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women's Health who would also chair an \nHHS Coordinating Committee on Women's Heath. The responsibilities of \nthe HHS Office would include establishing short and long-term goals, \nadvising the Secretary of HHS on women's health issues, monitoring and \nfacilitating coordination and stimulating HHS activities on women's \nhealth, establishing a national Women's Health Information Center to \nfacilitate exchange of and access to women's health information, and \ncoordinating private sector efforts to promote women's health.\n  Under this legislation, the Offices of Women's Health in CDC, FDA, \nHRSA, and AHRQ would be housed in the office of the head of each agency \nand be headed by a Director appointed by the head of the respective \nagency. The offices would assess the current level of activity on \nwomen's health in the agency; establish short-term and long-term goals \nfor women's health and coordinate women's health activities in the \nagency; identify women's health projects to support or conduct; consult \nwith appropriate outside groups on the agency's policy regarding women; \nserve on HHS' Coordinating Committee on Women's Health; and establish \nand head a coordinating committee on women's health within the agency \nto identify womens' health needs and make recommendations to the head \nof the agency. The FDA office would also have specific duties regarding \nwomen and clinical trials. All the offices, including the HHS Office \nbeginning no later than Jan. 31. 2002, would submit a report every two \nyears to the appropriate Congressional committees documenting \nactivities accomplished. In addition, the bill authorizes \nappropriations for all the offices through 2005\n  I believe that this bill will establish a valuable and consistent \nframework for addressing women's health in the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. It will help to ensure that women's health research \nwill continue to have the resources it needs in the coming years. This \nbill is a priority of the Women's Health Research Coalition. The \nCoalition is comprised of nearly three dozen academic centers, \nvoluntary health associations and membership organizations with a \nstrong focus on women's health research and gender-based biology. I \nencourage my colleagues to join Senator Snowe and myself in supporting \nand cosponsoring this important legislation for women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Sessions, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Helms, \n        Mr. Allard, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, and Mr. Inhofe):\n  S. 2676.

It seems the Justice \n     Department could use a little of both in the handling of its \n     antitrust suit against the Microsoft Corp.\n       When Federal Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson recently issued \n     his ruling, he gave credence to the flawed logic upon which \n     the government has built its case.\n       That flawed logic should have precluded the federal \n     government from bringing the case in the first place. \n     Washington bureaucrats shouldn't be in the business of \n     choosing winners and losers in the private sector. That \n     responsibility belongs to consumers.\n       The government's theory behind the case is that America's \n     high-technology industry has been victimized by Microsoft's \n     stifling competition and squelching innovation. Every piece \n     of the federal government's theory is an insult to the free-\n     enterprise system and the will of consumers.\n       First, there is no more competitive industry in the world \n     than America's high-tech market. That is as true today as it \n     was before the federal government's five-year, $30 million \n     attempt to regulate free enterprise. There are thousands of \n     companies selling software products today, far more than at \n     the start of the trial.\n       And in the time since the federal government and 19 state \n     attorneys general filed their suit, America's technology \n     industry has produced one-third of the nation's economic \n     growth.\n       Those facts hardly would support the government's \n     characterization of the information technology industry as a \n     shell of its former self.\n       As for innovation, consider the change in the simple matter \n     of personal computing since 1995. In 1995, the personal \n     computer was just starting to have its potential realized \n     with the development--among other innovations--of Windows 95. \n     Just as Windows 95 has since been rendered obsolete by \n     Microsoft itself, so now is the debate beginning about the \n     future of the personal computer as we know it. Many believe \n     the PC soon will be replaced by Internet-based appliances in \n     phones, televisions and hand-held computing devices. The \n     technology industry in 2000 looks nothing like it did in \n     1995.\n       Just as many of the technologies of the mid-'90s now are \n     obsolete, so are the issues the government has raised in this \n     case. The high-tech market has moved--and will continue to \n     move--too quickly for any government to keep tabs on it \n     through regulation. By the time federal bureaucrats get \n     around to fixing rules, the market will change them. That is \n     the way of the new economy, built on competition, innovation \n     and customer service.\n       The federal government's case against Microsoft attacks all \n     three principles.\n       Instead of the self-regulating competition that has enabled \n     Microsoft to lead the technology industry to its current \n     heights, the government favors either breaking up the company \n     or regulating away its freedom to innovate and compete. The \n     federal government's ``remedy'' would insert bureaucrats into \n     the technology market in ways never before imagined. Those \n     Washington bureaucrats would be involved in questions of \n     product design and marketing. That would empower pencil-\n     pushing Beltway bureaucrats to second-guess innocent computer \n     programmers and entrepreneurs. The new arrangement would \n     enable regulators to pick winners and losers in the \n     marketplace, stripping consumers of their rights.\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\n       In a free market, it is consumers, not bureaucrats, who \n     should control the destinies of individual industries and \n     companies. In response to consumers' influence over the \n     market, companies have lowered prices, created new products \n     and focused on customer services. The government's scheme \n     would negate those market forces. It also would preclude the \n     industry and the government from working together to bridge \n     the digital divide, since the industry probably would be \n     forced to raise prices to account for new regulatory \n     compliance costs. Higher prices would prohibit low-income \n     families from enjoying newer technologies, so poor families \n     would remain behind the technological curve.\n       The Justice Department has wasted the taxpayers' money and \n     attacked the interests of consumers, from the case's \n     inception to the intentional failure of government lawyers to \n     settle the case to the reckless breakup scheme it hatched to \n     punish Microsoft. The suit is a deliberate attempt by the \n     government to circumvent the economic authority of consumers \n     and entrepreneurs in the free market. It seems the least the \n     federal government could show the American people would be a \n     little bit of hospitality and common sense on this \n     issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2677. A bill to restrict assistance until certain conditions are \nsatisfied and to support democratic and economic transition in \nZimbabwe; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n    legislation to promote political and economic reform in zimbabwe\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, on its surface, the turmoil and \ndeath toll of Zimbabwe's brutal farm invasions is an economic and \nracial battle. At its core, it is an engineered effort to distract from \nthe government's assault on a besieged democratic opposition movement. \nThe crisis in Zimbabwe has profound implications for Africa far beyond \nthe killings and lawlessness necessary to sustain it. It has the \npotential to fundamentally compromise the future of the entire region \nand the United States' most basic interests there. But it is a crisis \nwhich we are ill-prepared to address, and time is not on our side.\n  President Robert Mugabe's orchestration and blessing of the invasions \nof predominantly white-owned commercial farms--the backbone of \nZimbabwe's export economy--by so-called war veterans is actually a \nshrewd maneuver to disguise behind the veil of a racial drama his \nrelentless attack on the democratic institutions and rule of law in \nZimbabwe. By successfully casting the issue as one of race rather than \nhis own lawlessness. President Mugabe has paralyzed the very forces \nwhich should otherwise call his bluff.\n  Most notable among the paralyzed are other African heads of state--\nand Kofi Annan. The deliberate introduction of a racial element to the \ncontroversy has left them in an untenable position: if they dare \ncriticize behavior they find outrageous or even dangerous, they would \nseemingly side against black Africans on behalf of ``colonial'' whites. \nThus neighboring heads of state--some of whom have shown great \ncommitment to democracy and racial reconciliation in their own \ncountries--are unhappily muted, even seemingly compelled to support \nPresident Mugabe's antics.\n  Yet the near paralysis of the United States is of greatest concern. \nOver 10,000 Zimbabwean troops from the thin green line which keeps \nLaurent Kabila in power in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The \nvolatile Kabila, in turn, determines whether or not the war in Congo \nends peacefully--a goal to which the administration has staked \nconsiderable political capital during ``the month of Africa'' at the \nUnited Nations. Thus, President Mugabe has presented us with a \nludicrous choice between support for democracy in Zimbabwe and the \nchance to prevent Kabila from plunging Congo back into full scale war. \nThe United States is frozen lest we provoke them.\n  Relatively small Zimbabwe's ability to direct the fate of Congo and \nthe entire central African region is testament to its weight on the \ncontinent and why its internal chaos is reason for great concern. \nZimbabwe can be a force for good or bad in southern Africa, the region \nwhich will in turn, drive either the progress or further demise of the \nentire continent south of the Sahara. Zimbabwe is currently a driving \nforce for its demise. The best chance to reverse that is through \nsupport for the democratic forces challenging a leader whose \nincreasingly destructive acts imperil the continent. The United States' \npolicy imperative in Zimbabwe could not be clearer, but we are \nseemingly unprepared to take the necessary steps to aggressively defend \ndemocracy and our national interests.\n  First, the United States must be willing to ``decouple'' our support \nfor democracy in Zimbabwe from the war in Congo. As in any hostage \nsituation, you never let the captor dictate the terms. That will \nrequire commitment of considerable political capital and diplomatic \nmuscle. It will require taking some necessary risks.\n\n  Second, the United States should not wait until after ballots are \ncast for parliament on June 24 and 25 to declare whether the elections \nwere ``free and fair'' or even ``flawed but representative.'' The \ngovernment's attempt to steal the election now through violence, \nintimidation, and brazen manipulation of procedures are in daily news \nreports. Silence on that point makes us accomplices in its attempts to \nmaintain its grip on power and false pretense of democracy. More \ninsidious, the world is helping to pave the way for the same deception \nand violence in the critical 2002 presidential elections by essentially \ndemonstrating how little we expect when it comes to democracy in \nAfrica. It stands in shameful contrast to our expectations and actions \nin South Africa in 1994.\n  Third, we must explicitly link international financial support and \ncooperation with Zimbabwe to the fate of its democratic institutions. \nWith the virtual end of support from international lending institutions \nand economic aid, we have precious few ``sticks'' at our disposal. The \n``carrots'' are real, through. We must use them to communicate that \ndemocracy brings immediate benefits and to entice and generously shore \nup any gains made, including progress on real land reform. In the 20 \nyears since independence, land reform, which is broadly supported in \nZimbabwe and among donors, has been slow and has benefitted ruling \nparty insiders.\n  It is critical that the United States be clear about its support for \npeaceful democratic transition in Zimbabwe. That fact must be \ncommunicated to the Zimbabwean government in no uncertain terms, and to \nthe Zimbabwean people. They should know that we back them in their \nstruggle for democracy.\n  But it must be more than just words. The United States should be \nprepared to meet the needs of those fighting for democracy, and to be \nthere to assist them should they have the opportunity to govern.\n  Mr. President, to that end, Senators Feingold and Helms have joined \nme in introducing the Zimbabwe Democracy Act. The legislation contains \nseveral critical democratic support mechanisms which we should act \nquickly to put in place.\n  First, it unequivocally states the policy of the United States is to \nsupport the people of Zimbabwe in their struggles to effect peaceful, \ndemocratic change, achieve broad-based and equitable economic growth, \nand restore the rule of law.\n  It suspends bilateral assistance to the government of Zimbabwe; \nsuspends any debt reduction measures for the government of Zimbabwe; \nand instructs the U.S. executive directors of the multilateral lending \ninstitutions to vote against the extension of any credit or benefits to \nthe government of Zimbabwe until rule of law and democratic \ninstitutions are restored.\n  It includes explicit exceptions for humanitarian, health and \ndemocracy support programs. It authorizes a legal assistance fund for \nindividuals and institutions which are suffering under the breakdown of \nrule of law. The legal fees for torture victims, independent media \nsupporting free speech and other democratic institutions challenging \nelection results or undemocratic laws can be paid from the funds.\n\n  It provides new authority for broadcasting of objective and reliable \nnews to listeners in Zimbabwe.\n  It doubles next year's funding for democracy programs in Zimbabwe.\n  It expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States should \nsupport election observers to the parliamentary and presidential \nelections.\n  It prepares the United States to act decisively to support democracy. \nIf the President certifies to Congress that rule of law has been \nrestored, freedom of speech and association is respected,\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\nfree elections have been conducted, Zimbabwe is pursuing an equitable \nand legal land reform program, and the army is under civilian control, \na series of programs to support democratic transition and aggressively \npromote economic recovery are initiated:\n  Suspended assistance is restored.\n  The Secretary of Treasury is directed to undertake a review of \nZimbabwe's bilateral debt for the purposes of elimination of that debt \nto the greatest extent possible.\n  It directs the U.S. executive directors at the multilateral \ninstitutions to propose and support programs for the elimination of \nZimbabwe's multilateral debt, and that those institutions initiate \nprograms to support rapid economic recovery and the stabilization of \nthe Zimbabwe dollar.\n  It allocates an initial US$16 million for alternative land reform \nprograms under the Inception Phase of the Land Reform and Resettlement \nProgram--including acquisition and resettlement costs.\n  It directs the establishment of a ``Southern Africa Finance Center'' \nin Zimbabwe which will serve as a joint office for the Export-Import \nBank, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and the Trade \nDevelopment Agency to pursue, facilitate and underwrite American \nprivate investment in Zimbabwe and the region.\n  Mr. President, the future stability of Zimbabwe is in the United \nStates national interest. That future is dependent on the viability of \nthe democratic legal and economic institutions in Zimbabwe which are \ncurrently under assault. It is clear that the United States must \nsupport those individuals and institutions, both during the current \nassaults and especially if they gain in elections.\n  This legislation offers clear support for democratic institutions and \nthe rule of law now, and it provides aggressive future United States \neconomic and institutional support for a transition to democracy, \nincluding real land reform based on equitable distribution and title to \nthe land.\n  In the end, President Mugabe may simply dismiss all international and \ninternal pressure. He has both the power to do so and increasingly \nseems to have the inclination, despite the costs. Even so, the United \nStates cannot be intimidated or compromised. We must act decisively and \nquickly to support the democratic institutions upon which he is waging \nwar. It is upon the fate of those institutions and individuals which so \nmuch of Africa's future depends.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2682. A bill to authorize the Broadcasting Board of Governors to \nmake available to the Institute for Medial Development certain \nmaterials of the Voice of America; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n       legislation regarding the voice of america/africa archives\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with \nSenator Boxer, a bill to authorize the Broadcasting Board of Governors \nto make available to a private entity archival materials from the \nAfrica Division of the Voice of America. This bill is also being \nintroduced today in the other body by Representative Cynthia McKinney, \nwho initiated this proposal and asked me to introduce the Senate \nversion of the bill.\n  The bill authorizes the Broadcasting Board of Governors to make \navailable to the Institute for Media Development, a non-profit \norganization, archival materials of the Africa Division of the Voice of \nAmerica (VOA). These materials, currently stored at the VOA in analog \nform, will be put into modern digital form and made available to \nscholars through the University of California, Los Angeles, and any \nother institution of higher learning approved by the Board.\n  I believe this is a very useful public-private partnership that will \nresult in a positive benefit to scholars of African studies. As I am \nsure my colleagues are aware, the Voice of America is not broadcast in \nthe United States. Programs which may be of interest to students and \nscholars of African politics, history, literature and foreign policy \nare often inaccessible. Moreover, there is no systematic means, much \nless the funds, to make such archival material available. And once the \nprograms are aired, there is no guarantee that the analog tape on which \nthey are recorded will be preserved. History may literally be lost, if \nnews shows and interviews with prominent figures in various African \ncountries are not preserved. Storing these recordings in a central \narchive should prove invaluable in years to come.\n  There will be no cost to the U.S. Government. The bill requires that \nthe government be reimbursed for any expenses it incurs in making such \nmaterials available, and for the indemnification of the government in \nthe event that the materials are used in a manner that violates the \ncopyright laws of the United States. I would not anticipate that such \ncopyright violations will occur, because the bill also makes clear that \nmaterials made available may be used only for academic and research \npurposes and may not be used for public or commercial broadcast \npurposes.\n  I am pleased that the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations \nhas agreed to place this legislation on the agenda of the committee \nlater this week. I hope the Committee, and then the full Senate, will \ngive its approval.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed at this point in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2682\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills \nthat are important to my State of Maine. The first piece of legislation \npertains to the Narraguagus River dredge in Milbridge and will \nreauthorize former Corps project areas so as to design a portion of the \n11-foot channel as anchorage. The town has provided the Corps with \nharbor use data that indicates that the 11-foot channel need only be \ndredged to 9 feet.\n  I have already requested $30,000 for FY01 Energy and Water \nappropriations to complete plans and specifications for a maintenance \ndredge of the 11-, 9- and 6-foot channel from Narraguagus Bay to the \ntown landings and the 6-foot anchorages in Milbridge. The project \nserves the important commercial fishing and lobstering fleet, \nacquaculture operations, and fish packing facility, and a small \nrecreational fleet.\n  The second bill concerns the Kennebunk River in Kennebunkport that \ndeauthorizes a small elongated section of the Federal Navigation \nChannel. Not only would this allow much needed moorings from a nearby \nmarina to remain where they have been positioned, but most importantly, \nthe deauthorization would be the last piece needed so that the \nimportant dredge project can go forward.\n  This is a very active channel, Mr. President, and the dredge is \nextremely important for the safe passage not only for fishermen, but \nalso for the tour boats, transporting up to 150 people, which go in and \nout of the busy harbor area throughout the spring, summer and fall \nmonths. Anyone who has been to the ``Port'' during the heavy tourist \nseason can tell you it is a very popular attraction, particularly the \ntour boat trips that take tourists out past the breakwater for a view \nof the Maine coastline. The New England District Corps has given its \napproval for the deauthorization as has the town and the Joint River \nCommission.\n  I look forward to the speedy passage of these two non-controversial \nbills separately and to support their inclusion into legislation \nreauthorizing the Water Resources Development Act, or WRDA, for which \npassage is being considered in this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND:\n  S.J. Res. 46. A joint resolution commemorating the 225th birthday of \nthe United States Army; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n commemorating june 6, 2000, as the united states army's 225th birthday\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today on the anniversary of D-Day, June \n6th, 1944, I have the great privilege to introduce a joint resolution \nhonoring the United States Army on its 225th birthday.\n  Before there was a United States of America, there was an American \nArmy, born on June 14th, 1775. On the town square of Cambridge, \nMassachusetts, a small group of American colonists came together to \nform an army, under the authority of the Continental Congress. This \nJune 14th, we will look back over those 225 years and see clearly that \nthe forming of the colonial Army was the prelude to the birth of our \nnation. As the Army's slogan for this commemoration says, it was the \n``Birth of an army and the birth of freedom.''\n  Like Members of this body, to be a soldier is to believe in something \nother than what we can achieve for ourselves as individuals. I am proud \nto help celebrate the Army birthday, marking more than two centuries of \nselfless service to the United States of America. More than 42 million \nAmericans have raised their right hands to take an oath, both in times \nof crisis and in times of peace.\n  As I introduce this resolution, I ask that each of you please join me \nnext month to extend the heartfelt thanks of this Congress to each and \nevery soldier for their outstanding service to our nation!\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to note that \nSenator Thurmond, who took the floor and introduced a joint resolution \ncommending our Armed Forces, is someone who should also be commended \npersonally today. This is the 56th anniversary of Senator Thurmond's \nlanding in the D-Day invasion.\n  As we consider the construction of the museum in New Orleans, LA, to \npay tribute to those soldiers and all those involved in the D-Day \ninvasion, we should take a moment on the floor of the Senate to pay \ntribute to our colleague from South Carolina, who had such a \ndistinguished career in the military. It is almost inconceivable to \nthink he was there as a volunteer to fly a glider into the D-Day \ninvasion--probably one of the more dangerous assignments of the men and \nwomen in uniform who made that invasion such a success. The fact that \nhe is here today is a tribute to not only his longevity, but his \ncontinued dedication to this country.\n  On behalf of a generation--frankly, I wasn't born when that occurred \nbut have been the beneficiary of that victory--I say to my colleague \nfrom South Carolina that we are in deepest debt to him for his personal \nservice to this country, and for his courage in participating in that \nD-Day invasion. I commend not only him but also all of those who made \nthat invasion such a success, and hope that on this 56th anniversary \nall of the people involved, and their families who waited expectantly \nto hear the results of that invasion, will be remembered in the \nthoughts and prayers of every American family.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his kind words. \nI would do it again, if necessary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There is no doubt in the mind of any Member of the Senate \nthat Senator Thurmond would volunteer again, as he just promised that \nhe would. I thank the Senator again.\n\n                              S.J. Res. 46\n\n       Whereas on June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress, \n     representing the citizens of 13 American colonies, authorized \n     the establishment of the Continental Army;\n       Whereas the collective expression of the pursuit of \n     personal freedom that caused the authorization and \n     organization of the United States Army led to our Nation's \n     Declaration of Independence and the codification of our basic \n     principles and values in the Constitution of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas for the past 225 years, our Army's central purpose \n     has been to fight and win wars that were typically fought and \n     won on distant, foreign battlefields, while at home, the Army \n     provided for the Nation's security;\n       Whereas whatever the mission, the Nation turns to its Army \n     for decisive victory, regardless of whether those are \n     measured in the defeat of foreign Army forces or the timely \n     delivery of humanitarian assistance at home or abroad;\n       Whereas the 172 battle streamers carried on the Army's flag \n     are testament to the valor, commitment, and sacrifice of \n     those who have served and fought under its banner;\n       Whereas Valley Forge, New Orleans, Mexico City, Gettysburg, \n     Verdun, Bataan, Normandy, Pusan, Ia Drang Valley, Grenada, \n     Panama, and Kuwait are but a few of the places where American \n     soldiers have won extraordinary distinction and respect for \n     our Nation and our Army;\n       Whereas ``Duty, Honor, Country'' are more than mere words, \n     they are the creed by which the American soldier lives and \n     serves;\n       Whereas while no one can predict the cause, location, or \n     magnitude of future battles, there is one certainty -- \n     American soldiers of character, selflessly serving the \n     Nation, will continue to be the credentials of our Army;\n       Whereas the Army is prepared to answer the Nation's call, \n     and such calls have been increasing in number and disparity \n     in recent years;\n       Whereas the threats are less distinct and less predictable \n     than the past, but more complex and just as real and \n     dangerous;\n       Whereas our Army, the world's most capable and respected \n     ground force, is in the midst of an unparalleled \n     transformation as it prepares for the new challenges of the \n     next century and a different world;\n       Whereas future forces will be prepared to conduct quick, \n     decisive, highly sophisticated operations anywhere, anytime; \n     and\n       Whereas our Army will be ready to fight and win our \n     Nation's call to service at home and abroad: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the valor, commitment, and sacrifice that \n     American soldiers have made throughout the history of the \n     Nation;\n       (2) commends the United States Army and American soldiers \n     for 225 years of selfless service; and\n       (3) calls upon the President to issue a proclamation \n     recognizing the 225th birthday of the United States Army and \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe that \n     anniversary with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n\n[[Page S4576]]\n\n  S.J. Res. 47. A joint resolution disapproving the extension of the \nwaiver authority contained in section 402(c) of the Trade Act of 1974 \nwith respect to Vietnam; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  legislation regarding the trade act of 1974 with respect to vietnam\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to introduce \na resolution concerning our trade relationship with the Socialist \nRepublic of Vietnam. On June 2, 2000, the President of the United \nStates formally recommended a waiver of the application of the Trade \nAct of 1974 with respect to Vietnam. I am deeply troubled by the \nPresident's decision to grant this waiver in light of Vietnam's \ncontinuing poor record on human rights. One need only look at the 1999 \nU.S. State Department report on human rights practices in Vietnam to \nrecognize that the Vietnamese Government once again has failed to meet \nrecognized standards with respect to such fundamental rights as freedom \nof emigration, freedom of speech and freedom of religion, to name only \na few, which are so often taken for granted in our great country.\n  I would like to quote from this revealing report to emphasize my \npoint. The State Department declared the following regarding Vietnam: \n``The Government's human rights record remained poor; . . . and serious \nproblems remain . . . The Government continued to repress basic \npolitical and some religious freedoms and to commit numerous abuses . . \n. the Government arbitrarily arrested and detained citizens, including \ndetention for peaceful expression of political and religious views . . \n. The Government significantly restricts freedom of speech, the press, \nassembly, and association . . . The Government restricts freedom of \nreligion and significantly restricts the operation of religious \norganizations other than those entities approved by the State . . . \nCitizens' access to passports frequently was constrained by factors \noutside the law, such as bribery and corruption. Refugee and immigrant \nvisa applicants sometimes encountered local officials who arbitrarily \ndelayed or denied passports based on personal animosities or on the \nofficials' perception that an applicant did not meet program criteria \nor in order to extort a bribe.'' The list of violations outlined by our \nState Department goes on, but I will stop here.\n  Mr. President, the resolution I have introduced keeps faith with the \noriginal Congressional intent of the Trade Act of 1974. Our dedication \nto fundamental human rights must be resolute, even when it means one \npowerful interest group or another does not get its way. Unfortunately, \nthe President's decision to grant this waiver once again undermines the \nUnited States' long-standing dedication to human rights and sends a \nmessage to the rest of the world that the United States is more \ninterested in profits over principles. Finally, rewarding Communist \nVietnam by allowing U.S. tax dollars to subsidize business operations \nin Hanoi, while at the same time their leaders hold back key POW/MIA \nrecords from the war, is a disgrace to the men and women who valiantly \nserved our country and were honored just last week on Memorial Day. \nThis Presidential waiver should be overturned by the Congress, as is \nour right under the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/06/senate-section/article/S4576-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4576-S4578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 459\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n459, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the \nState ceiling on private activity bonds.\n\n\n                                 S. 620\n\n  At the request of Mr. Sarbanes, the name of the Senator from Maine \n(Ms. Collins) was added as a cosponsor of S. 620, a bill to grant a \nFederal charter to Korean War Veterans Association, Incorporated, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 656\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reed, the names of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. L.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner), for Mr. Jeffords, \n     Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Frist, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3190.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today that \nthe Senate is considering the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources \nand Emergency Act Amendments of 2000, a measure that will reauthorize a \nnational program providing primary health care services to people \nliving with HIV and AIDS. I especially want to commend Senators Hatch \nand Kennedy for the leadership they have provided since the \ninauguration of the legislation establishing the Ryan White programs \nover a decade ago. I also want to commend Senator Frist whose medical \nexpertise played a critical role in key provisions of the bill and \ncontinues to be an invaluable resource to our efforts on the range of \nhealth issues that come before the Senate. I want to recognize Senator \nDodd for his unwavering support for this legislation and people living \nwith HIV and AIDS. Finally, I want to acknowledge Senator Enzi's \nrecognition of the growing burden that AIDS and HIV have placed on \nrural communities throughout the country and the need to address those \ngaps in services.\n  Since its inception in 1990, the Ryan White program has enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support. During the last reauthorization of the Ryan White \nCARE Act in 1996, the measure garnered a vote of 97 to 3 on its final \npassage. As evidence that strong bipartisan support continues, I am \nhappy to report that last month this reauthorization bill was passed \nunanimously out of committee. The bipartisan support for this important \nlegislation underlines the critical need for the assistance this Act \nprovides across the nation.\n  With this reauthorization, we mark the ten years through which the \nRyan White CARE Act has provided needed health care and support \nservices to HIV positive people around the country. Titles I and II \nhave provided much needed relief to cities and states hardest hit by \nthis disease, while Titles III and IV have had a direct role in \nproviding healthcare services to underserved communities. Ryan White \nprogram dollars provide the foundation of care so necessary in fighting \nthis epidemic and have allowed States and communities around the \ncountry to successfully address the needs of people affected by HIV \ndisease.\n  In a recently released report, the General Accounting Office found \nthat CARE Act funds are reaching the infected groups that have \ntypically been underserved, including the poor, the uninsured, women, \nand ethnic minorities. In fact, these groups form a majority of CARE \nAct clients and are being served by the CARE Act in higher proportions \nthan their representation in the AIDS population. The GAO also found \nthat CARE Act funds support a wide array of primary care and support \nservices, including the provision of powerful therapeutic regimens for \npeople with HIV/AIDS that have dramatically reduced AIDS diagnoses and \ndeaths.\n  Much has occurred to change the course of the AIDS epidemic since the \nlast reauthorization. During the last reauthorization, Congressman \nCoburn and our colleague, Senator Frist, focused our attention on the \nneeds of women living with HIV/AIDS and the problems associated with \nperinatal transmission of HIV. Since then, the CARE Act has helped to \ndramatically reduce mother-to-child transmission through more effective \noutreach, counseling, and voluntary testing of mothers at risk for HIV \ninfection. Between 1993 and 1998, perinatal-acquired AIDS cases \ndeclined 74% in the U.S. In this bill, I have continued to support \nefforts to reach women in need of care for their HIV disease and have \nincluded provisions to ensure that women, infants and children receive \nresources in accordance with the prevalence of the infection among \nthem.\n  Another key success has been the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. This \nprogram has provided people with HIV and AIDS access to newly \ndeveloped, highly effective therapeutics. Because of these drugs, \npeople are maintaining their health and living longer. The AIDS death \nrate and the number of new AIDS cases have been dramatically reduced. \nFrom 1996 to 1998, deaths from AIDS dropped 54% while new AIDS cases \nhave been reduced by 27%. However, these treatments are very expensive, \ndo not provide a cure, and do not work for everyone.\n  AIDS, HIV, the people it infects and families that it has affected \nare not in the news today as often as they have been in the past. But \nfor too many of us, this lack of bad news has created a false sense of \ncomplacency. While the rate of decline in new AIDS cases and deaths is \nleveling off, HIV infection rates continue to rise in many areas; \nbecoming increasingly prevalent in rural and underserved urban areas; \nand also among women, youth, and minority communities. Local and state \nhealthcare systems face an increasing burden of disease, despite our \nsuccess in treating and caring for people living with HIV and AIDS. \nUnfortunately, rural and underserved urban areas are often unable to \naddress the complex medical and support services needs of people with \nHIV infection. Thus, Ryan White programs remain as vital to the public \nhealth of this nation as it was in 1990 and in 1996. As the AIDS \nepidemic reaches into rural areas and into underserved urban \ncommunities across the country, this legislation will allow us to adapt \nour care systems to meet the most urgent needs in the communities \nhardest hit by the epidemic.\n  The bill being considered today was developed on a bipartisan basis, \nworking with other Committee Members, community stakeholders and \nelected officials at the state and local levels from whom we sought \ninput to ensure that we addressed the most important problems facing \ncommunities of people with HIV infection. I held a hearing in March \nbefore the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to learn \nwhether the program has been successful and whether it needed to be \nchanged. We received testimony from Ryan White's mother, Jeanne White, \nfrom Surgeon General David Satcher, from a person living with AIDS, as \nwell as state and local officials familiar with the importance of this \nprogram. I especially want to commend Dr. Chris Grace of Vermont who \ntestified as to the particular challenges of providing care to people \nliving with HIV/AIDS in rural, and sometimes remote, parts of the \ncountry. It was clear from our witnesses' statements that, despite the \nsuccesses, challenges remain.\n  To address these challenges, we have developed a bill that will \nimprove access to care in underserved urban and rural areas. My bill \nwill double the minimum base funding available to states through the \nCARE Act to assist them in developing systems of care for people \nstruggling with HIV and AIDS. The bill also includes a new supplemental \nstate grant to target assistance to small and mid-sized metropolitan \nareas to help them address the increasing number of people with HIV/\nAIDS living outside of urban areas that receive assistance under Title \nI of the Act. Rural and underserved areas receive a preference for \nplanning, early intervention, and capacity development grants under \ntitle III. In order to assist states in expanding access to appropriate \nHIV/AIDS therapeutics to low-income people with HIV/AIDS, a \nsupplemental grant has been added to the AIDS Drug Assistance Program.\n  The bill remains primarily a system of grants to State and local \njurisdictions, thereby ensuring that grantees can respond to local \nneeds. States, EMAs, and the affected communities will still decide how \nto best prioritize and address the healthcare needs of their HIV-\npositive citizens. This bill reinforces the ability of States and EMAs \nto identify and meet local needs.\n  Finally, in recognition of the changing nature of the epidemic, I \nhave asked the Institute of Medicine to complete a study of the \nfinancing and delivery of primary care and support services for low \nincome, uninsured, and under-insured individuals with HIV disease, \nwithin 21 months after the enactment of this Act. Changes in HIV \nsurveillance and case reporting, and the effects of these changes on \nprogram funding, will be included in this study. The recommendations \nfrom this study will help Congress and the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to ensure the most effective and efficient use of \nFederal funds for HIV and AIDS care and support.\n  I intend to see this bill become law this year so that the people \nstruggling to overcome the challenges of HIV and AIDS continue to \nbenefit from high quality medical care and access to lifesaving drugs. \nWe have made incredible progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and I \nwant to be sure that every person in America in need of assistance \nbenefits from our tremendous advances.\n\n[[Page S4595]]\n\n  Many groups and individuals have contributed significantly to \ncrafting this bill, but I want to acknowledge those at the Health \nResources and Services Administration, especially Dr. Joseph O'Neill, \nAssociate Administrator of the HIV/AIDS bureau; John Palenicek, \nDirector of the Office of Policy and Program Development; Doug Morgan, \nDirector of the Division of Service Systems; and Howard Lerner, \nPrincipal Adviser for Telehealth and International Collaboration, HIV/\nAIDS. All of the groups united under the umbrella of the National \nOrganizations Responding to AIDS (NORA) deserve recognition. \nRepresenting a diverse community of people with AIDS, CARE Act service \nproviders, and administrative agencies, NORA clearly and effectively \ncommunicated to Congress the needs and priorities of their \nconstituents.\n  I also want to thank several staff members who have worked long and \nhard to craft this bill and to address the concerns and needs of the \naffected communities. Sean Donohue and William Oscar Fleming have \nguided this effort from the beginning, building consensus across the \nmany policy issues, resulting in a bill that meets the pressing needs \nof people with HIV and AIDS and enjoys broad bipartisan support. \nStephanie Robinson and Idalia Sanchez, for Senator Kennedy, were key to \nreaching agreement on this bill and have provided invaluable assistance \nand support throughout the development of this legislation. I would \nalso like to recognize Dave Larson and Mary Sumpter Johnson, of Senator \nFrist's office, for their support for the needs of rural and \nunderserved communities throughout the nation. Similarly, Jeannie \nIreland with Senator Dodd's office, Helen Rhee, working for Senator \nDeWine, Libby Rolfe, for Mr. Sessions, and Raissa Geary and Mary Jordan \nin Senator Enzi's office, provided valuable input. Without the efforts \nof these staff members, we would not have such a strong, well-balanced, \nand targeted reauthorization bill before us today.\n  Mr. WARNER.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner), for Mr. Jeffords, \n     Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Frist, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3190.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure today that \nthe Senate is considering the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources \nand Emergency Act Amendments of 2000, a measure that will reauthorize a \nnational program providing primary health care services to people \nliving with HIV and AIDS. I especially want to commend Senators Hatch \nand Kennedy for the leadership they have provided since the \ninauguration of the legislation establishing the Ryan White programs \nover a decade ago. I also want to commend Senator Frist whose medical \nexpertise played a critical role in key provisions of the bill and \ncontinues to be an invaluable resource to our efforts on the range of \nhealth issues that come before the Senate. I want to recognize Senator \nDodd for his unwavering support for this legislation and people living \nwith HIV and AIDS. Finally, I want to acknowledge Senator Enzi's \nrecognition of the growing burden that AIDS and HIV have placed on \nrural communities throughout the country and the need to address those \ngaps in services.\n  Since its inception in 1990, the Ryan White program has enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support. During the last reauthorization of the Ryan White \nCARE Act in 1996, the measure garnered a vote of 97 to 3 on its final \npassage. As evidence that strong bipartisan support continues, I am \nhappy to report that last month this reauthorization bill was passed \nunanimously out of committee. The bipartisan support for this important \nlegislation underlines the critical need for the assistance this Act \nprovides across the nation.\n  With this reauthorization, we mark the ten years through which the \nRyan White CARE Act has provided needed health care and support \nservices to HIV positive people around the country. Titles I and II \nhave provided much needed relief to cities and states hardest hit by \nthis disease, while Titles III and IV have had a direct role in \nproviding healthcare services to underserved communities. Ryan White \nprogram dollars provide the foundation of care so necessary in fighting \nthis epidemic and have allowed States and communities around the \ncountry to successfully address the needs of people affected by HIV \ndisease.\n  In a recently released report, the General Accounting Office found \nthat CARE Act funds are reaching the infected groups that have \ntypically been underserved, including the poor, the uninsured, women, \nand ethnic minorities. In fact, these groups form a majority of CARE \nAct clients and are being served by the CARE Act in higher proportions \nthan their representation in the AIDS population. The GAO also found \nthat CARE Act funds support a wide array of primary care and support \nservices, including the provision of powerful therapeutic regimens for \npeople with HIV/AIDS that have dramatically reduced AIDS diagnoses and \ndeaths.\n  Much has occurred to change the course of the AIDS epidemic since the \nlast reauthorization. During the last reauthorization, Congressman \nCoburn and our colleague, Senator Frist, focused our attention on the \nneeds of women living with HIV/AIDS and the problems associated with \nperinatal transmission of HIV. Since then, the CARE Act has helped to \ndramatically reduce mother-to-child transmission through more effective \noutreach, counseling, and voluntary testing of mothers at risk for HIV \ninfection. Between 1993 and 1998, perinatal-acquired AIDS cases \ndeclined 74% in the U.S. In this bill, I have continued to support \nefforts to reach women in need of care for their HIV disease and have \nincluded provisions to ensure that women, infants and children receive \nresources in accordance with the prevalence of the infection among \nthem.\n  Another key success has been the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. This \nprogram has provided people with HIV and AIDS access to newly \ndeveloped, highly effective therapeutics. Because of these drugs, \npeople are maintaining their health and living longer. The AIDS death \nrate and the number of new AIDS cases have been dramatically reduced. \nFrom 1996 to 1998, deaths from AIDS dropped 54% while new AIDS cases \nhave been reduced by 27%. However, these treatments are very expensive, \ndo not provide a cure, and do not work for everyone.\n  AIDS, HIV, the people it infects and families that it has affected \nare not in the news today as often as they have been in the past. But \nfor too many of us, this lack of bad news has created a false sense of \ncomplacency. While the rate of decline in new AIDS cases and deaths is \nleveling off, HIV infection rates continue to rise in many areas; \nbecoming increasingly prevalent in rural and underserved urban areas; \nand also among women, youth, and minority communities. Local and state \nhealthcare systems face an increasing burden of disease, despite our \nsuccess in treating and caring for people living with HIV and AIDS. \nUnfortunately, rural and underserved urban areas are often unable to \naddress the complex medical and support services needs of people with \nHIV infection. Thus, Ryan White programs remain as vital to the public \nhealth of this nation as it was in 1990 and in 1996. As the AIDS \nepidemic reaches into rural areas and into underserved urban \ncommunities across the country, this legislation will allow us to adapt \nour care systems to meet the most urgent needs in the communities \nhardest hit by the epidemic.\n  The bill being considered today was developed on a bipartisan basis, \nworking with other Committee Members, community stakeholders and \nelected officials at the state and local levels from whom we sought \ninput to ensure that we addressed the most important problems facing \ncommunities of people with HIV infection. I held a hearing in March \nbefore the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions to learn \nwhether the program has been successful and whether it needed to be \nchanged. We received testimony from Ryan White's mother, Jeanne White, \nfrom Surgeon General David Satcher, from a person living with AIDS, as \nwell as state and local officials familiar with the importance of this \nprogram. I especially want to commend Dr. Chris Grace of Vermont who \ntestified as to the particular challenges of providing care to people \nliving with HIV/AIDS in rural, and sometimes remote, parts of the \ncountry. It was clear from our witnesses' statements that, despite the \nsuccesses, challenges remain.\n  To address these challenges, we have developed a bill that will \nimprove access to care in underserved urban and rural areas. My bill \nwill double the minimum base funding available to states through the \nCARE Act to assist them in developing systems of care for people \nstruggling with HIV and AIDS. The bill also includes a new supplemental \nstate grant to target assistance to small and mid-sized metropolitan \nareas to help them address the increasing number of people with HIV/\nAIDS living outside of urban areas that receive assistance under Title \nI of the Act. Rural and underserved areas receive a preference for \nplanning, early intervention, and capacity development grants under \ntitle III. In order to assist states in expanding access to appropriate \nHIV/AIDS therapeutics to low-income people with HIV/AIDS, a \nsupplemental grant has been added to the AIDS Drug Assistance Program.\n  The bill remains primarily a system of grants to State and local \njurisdictions, thereby ensuring that grantees can respond to local \nneeds. States, EMAs, and the affected communities will still decide how \nto best prioritize and address the healthcare needs of their HIV-\npositive citizens. This bill reinforces the ability of States and EMAs \nto identify and meet local needs.\n  Finally, in recognition of the changing nature of the epidemic, I \nhave asked the Institute of Medicine to complete a study of the \nfinancing and delivery of primary care and support services for low \nincome, uninsured, and under-insured individuals with HIV disease, \nwithin 21 months after the enactment of this Act. Changes in HIV \nsurveillance and case reporting, and the effects of these changes on \nprogram funding, will be included in this study. The recommendations \nfrom this study will help Congress and the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to ensure the most effective and efficient use of \nFederal funds for HIV and AIDS care and support.\n  I intend to see this bill become law this year so that the people \nstruggling to overcome the challenges of HIV and AIDS continue to \nbenefit from high quality medical care and access to lifesaving drugs. \nWe have made incredible progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and I \nwant to be sure that every person in America in need of assistance \nbenefits from our tremendous advances.\n\n[[Page S4595]]\n\n  Many groups and individuals have contributed significantly to \ncrafting this bill, but I want to acknowledge those at the Health \nResources and Services Administration, especially Dr. Joseph O'Neill, \nAssociate Administrator of the HIV/AIDS bureau; John Palenicek, \nDirector of the Office of Policy and Program Development; Doug Morgan, \nDirector of the Division of Service Systems; and Howard Lerner, \nPrincipal Adviser for Telehealth and International Collaboration, HIV/\nAIDS. All of the groups united under the umbrella of the National \nOrganizations Responding to AIDS (NORA) deserve recognition. \nRepresenting a diverse community of people with AIDS, CARE Act service \nproviders, and administrative agencies, NORA clearly and effectively \ncommunicated to Congress the needs and priorities of their \nconstituents.\n  I also want to thank several staff members who have worked long and \nhard to craft this bill and to address the concerns and needs of the \naffected communities. Sean Donohue and William Oscar Fleming have \nguided this effort from the beginning, building consensus across the \nmany policy issues, resulting in a bill that meets the pressing needs \nof people with HIV and AIDS and enjoys broad bipartisan support. \nStephanie Robinson and Idalia Sanchez, for Senator Kennedy, were key to \nreaching agreement on this bill and have provided invaluable assistance \nand support throughout the development of this legislation. I would \nalso like to recognize Dave Larson and Mary Sumpter Johnson, of Senator \nFrist's office, for their support for the needs of rural and \nunderserved communities throughout the nation. Similarly, Jeannie \nIreland with Senator Dodd's office, Helen Rhee, working for Senator \nDeWine, Libby Rolfe, for Mr. Sessions, and Raissa Geary and Mary Jordan \nin Senator Enzi's office, provided valuable input. Without the efforts \nof these staff members, we would not have such a strong, well-balanced, \nand targeted reauthorization bill before us today.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the committee substitute be agreed to, as amended, the \nbill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3190) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2311), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2311\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
