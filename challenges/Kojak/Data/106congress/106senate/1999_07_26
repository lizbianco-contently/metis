Mr. President, the Senate will immediately begin debate on \nthe resolution to reinstate rule XVI. By a previous order, there will \nbe 6 hours of debate on the resolution with one amendment in order \nregarding scope in conference.\n  As a reminder, a cloture motion on the motion to proceed to the \nHouse-passed juvenile justice bill was filed also on Thursday. That \nvote, then, will take place in a series of stacked votes this afternoon \nat 5:30, along with the rule XVI resolution and the amendment regarding \nscope in conference.\n  Further, it is the intention of the majority leader to begin debate \non the Interior appropriations bill, and the reconciliation legislation \nwill also come up this week, probably on Wednesday. Of course, under \nthe rules, 20 hours of debate is permitted, and I am sure there will be \na number of amendments, so we will have to begin on that promptly \nsometime early Wednesday morning.\n  Senators should be prepared to vote throughout each day and into the \nevenings, although we probably will not go late into the evening today \nother than the three stacked votes. But on Tuesday, Wednesday, and \nThursday late evenings should be anticipated in order to get this \nimportant work done.\n\n\n                                Rule XVI\n\n  This is a day I have been waiting for because we have needed for some \ntime now to reinstate rule XVI which would make a point of order in \norder against legislation on an appropriations bill.\n  More and more, the Senate has been abusing that process, making it \nvery difficult to move the appropriations bills through the Senate, \neven though there is a lot of work done on both sides of the aisle by \nthe leadership. For an example, last Thursday we would not have \ncompleted the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill had it not \nbeen for the dedicated efforts of Senator Reid in his position as whip \non the Democratic side, working with the chairman of the committee and \nthe ranking member of the committee to get that legislation through. \nThis is a responsible thing to do; the Senate will run better and we \nwill still have the opportunity to offer amendments on legislative \nissues. So I hope, when the day is over, we will have reinstated rule \nXVI, and we will all be better off because of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9171-6", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 160, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 160) to restore enforcement of rule \n     XVI.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time on the resolution shall be limited to 6 \nhours.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been designated by the Democratic \nleader to control the time on this resolution that is now before the \nSenate.\n  I feel a certain affinity toward rule XVI because it was my point of \norder that was appealed and overruled. In short, what this meant is \nthat we were here on an appropriations bill. It had been standard \nprocedure in the Senate for decades and decades and decades that when \nan appropriations bill came before this body, we did not offer \nlegislative matters on that appropriations bill; it should be for the \n13 subcommittees to deal with the money of this country and not append \nextraneous materials, extraneous legislative matters to an \nappropriations bill.\n  However, that is what happened on such a matter, a supplemental \nappropriations bill. The junior Senator from Texas offered an amendment \ndealing with the Endangered Species Act. I raised a point of order. The \nChair\n\n[[Page S9172]]\n\nupheld my point of order and that was appealed, a vote taken in the \nSenate which overruled that decision, and it changed the precedence of \nthis body.\n  It has caused legislating on appropriations bills as standard \noperating procedure in this body since then. For more than 4 years, \nthat is what has taken place.\n  There is going to be a vote taken later on rule XVI. The minority is \ngoing to vote against it. We recognize that we will be overruled by \nvirtue of the fact that we are in the minority. We are protesting \nbasically because of what has gone on in the Senate these past several \nyears. The fact is that we are not able to offer amendments to bills \ncoming through this body. In short, the Senate has been treated similar \nto the House of Representatives. For those of us who served in the \nHouse, there is not much difference anymore between the House and the \nSenate. When a bill comes to this Chamber, there is, in effect, an \norder placed on that bill just as in the House saying how many \namendments you can offer, how long you can debate each amendment, and \nin effect how the bill is going to be treated.\n  That is very much unlike the Senate. In decades past, when a bill \ncame before this body, debate took place on amendments that were \noffered relative to that piece of legislation. That is not the way it \nis now.\n  The reason that is important is that we Democrats believe we need--\nthe country needs--to debate campaign finance reform. In the State of \nNevada, a small State populationwise, my opponent and I spent over $20 \nmillion last year in the election. It is hard to believe. The State of \nNevada had less than 2 million people in it. But my opponent, \nCongressman Ensign from the State of Nevada, and I spent over $20 \nmillion.\n  How could that be done? It was done because in the so-called hard \nmoney counts in our campaign we spent about $4.5 million each, and in \nState party money we spent over $6 million each. That does not take \ninto consideration the independent expenditures that took place for me \nand against me. That is not the way campaigns should be, I don't \nbelieve. In the small State of Nevada, I repeat, over $20 million, \nprobably closer to $25 million, $26 million was spent when you add in \nthe independent expenditures about which I have talked.\n\n  That is an issue we should debate in this body. Maybe I am wrong. \nMaybe the American public, the people from individual States, want all \nthat money spent. I doubt it. I think we should have a debate as to \nwhether soft money, that is, corporate money, should be used for State \nparties and spend all this money on negative ads. I don't think so.\n  There should be a time, I believe, that we are able to debate \neducation. The State of Nevada leads the Nation in high school \ndropouts. We are not proud of that, but that is a fact. I think we \nshould be able to debate issues relating to that issue.\n  Senator Bingaman and I have legislation that would create within the \nDepartment of Education a dropout czar so that we could debate whether \nor not we should have in the Department of Education a person whose \nsole job it would be to work on curbing dropouts. Three thousand \nchildren drop out of high school every day in the United States. Over \n500,000 kids drop out of high school every year in America. That is not \nthe way it should be. Education is an issue we have not debated nearly \nenough in this body.\n  There are other issues we need to talk about: child care, minimum \nwage, the environment. There are so many issues we have not had the \nability to talk about. That is what this debate is about.\n  I see my friend from the State of New York is here. I am managing \nthis bill. I do not want to take a lot of time because I am sure there \nwill be time later today to speak about issues. But the point is, rule \nXVI is being debated today as a result of a ruling of the Chair that \nwas appealed. It was my point of order to the Chair that brought about \nthis situation in which we now find ourselves. The point we in the \nminority want to make is that we should have full debate on issues, all \nissues. There should not be any arms or legs tied. We should be able to \nspeak as we want on issues. We have not been able to do that.\n  I ask my friend from New York, how much time does the Senator wish?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Might I have, say, 15 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New York is happily yielded 15 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is a special pleasure to rise on this \nimportant subject on this fateful day in the aftermath of the Senator \nfrom Nevada, whose vigilance, if I may say, as minority whip, led him \nto see a clear violation of rule XVI, the rule against legislation on \nappropriations bills, and so he made the point of order. In a casual \nway, having to do with the seeming inconsequence of the measure that \nhad been proposed, the Senate overruled that point of order, and a \ncentury and more of fixed senatorial practice crashed and burned and \nhas been burning all around us ever since.\n\n  There is a larger context, I suggest, in which to consider this \nmatter. I am now in my last term in the Senate. I have been here almost \na quarter of a century. I am frequently asked what has changed in the \nSenate in my time here. Without hesitation, the one thing I say is the \nprocedures by which we work.\n  When I arrived, there was a recognizable symmetry and balance to the \ndistribution of responsibilities, duties, and powers in the body. We \nhad evolved over the 19th century a two-layer pattern of committees--\ncommittees being very special and distinct to our Government.\n  We are one of the few governments in the world that has them. The \nHouse of Commons has none. Recently they have been appointing \ncommittees of inquiry but no legislative committees of any kind. All \nauthority rests with the Prime Minister. On those used-to-be celebrated \noccasions when the Chancellor of Exchequer at No. 11 Downing Street \nwould come out, and he would hold up a briefcase called the budget, \nthat, sir, was, in fact, the budget. There was not going to be a chance \nof change in the government's proposal. It has been that way for more \nthan two centuries.\n  It is not the government that the founders put in place. They put in \nplace a government of checks and balances of the assumption of opposed \ninterests, of the resolution by debate, and by the recognition that \nthere were, in fact, opposed interests. We were not all happily subject \nto the Queen, under her rule--or his if it were a King--and a harmony \nin the realm. Our founders thought no such thing. They did not depend \non virtue. They depended on self-interest and being equally opposed in \na mode of negotiation to resolve matters.\n  We had a series of authorizing committees, and they had jurisdiction \nover principal areas of government service. There were four--well, the \nprincipal committees were Foreign Relations, Finance, Armed Services, \nand then Interior, Commerce, Labor and Public Welfare, as it then was, \nEnvironment and Public Works, having previously been just Public Works.\n  Their jurisdictions changed. New issues came along. Public Works \nbecame Environment. Public Works, under the tutelage of Senator Muskie \nof Maine, brought the issue of the environment to our body. They would \nmake laws which more often than not required expenditure. That \nexpenditure would be provided by the Appropriations Committee in terms \nof the laws that had been passed by the authorizing committees. There \nwas a parallel.\n  The Finance Committee, in the earliest years, from 1816 I believe, \nwas principally concerned with raising the revenue of the Federal \nGovernment. In the early years, up until the beginning of this century, \nthose were tariffs. That is why the tariff legislation, the ``tariff of \nabominations,'' things similar to that are so prominent in American \n19th century history.\n  We moved to the income tax as our principal source of revenue. \nTariffs are still not insignificant. In the Finance Committee, of which \nI am a member--for a period I was the chairman; now ranking member--we \nlooked after the revenues of the Federal Government. Then Social \nSecurity came along; it was a tax. Whether it ought to have been a tax, \nsir, is an issue you could debate.\n\n[[Page S9173]]\n\n  But 54, 55 years ago, at a garden party here in Washington, Frances \nPerkins, the Secretary of Labor who was responsible for developing a \nSocial Security plan--a Justice of the Supreme Court kindly asked her \nabout her work, and she said she had this great plan, but she was very \nconcerned because the great Justices always said it was \nunconstitutional, whatever the New Deal was then going through that \nperiod. The Justice asked her to tell him more. She did, and he leaned \ndown and whispered: The taxing power, my dear; all you need is the \ntaxing power.\n\n  So in that famous photograph of President Roosevelt signing the \nSocial Security Act, the person to his right is the chairman of the \nCommittee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, a \ngentleman from North Carolina named Robert Doughton--little noted in \nhistory but enormous in his impact.\n  So the Finance Committee has taken over these other areas as well. \nStill our basic task is to raise revenue that the Appropriations \nCommittee will spend in accordance with the laws passed by the \nauthorizing committees. A workable system--rational, understandable, \ncomprehensible and functioning.\n  Then in 1974 came the Budget Act and the creation of the \nCongressional Budget Office, the creation of the budget resolution. In \npart, this was a reaction to events in the Nixon administration--\npolitical and contemporary. But just as important, if I may be allowed \na certain excursion into political science, if that is the term, it is \na pattern that one observes in governments the world over, and you can \nsee in ours. It was with the proposition, sir, that organizations in \nconflict become like one another.\n  A German sociologist at the end of the 19th century noted that even \nPersians finally determined it was better to have Greeks fight Greeks. \nAnd you can trace these patterns of imitation and competition through \nour own government.\n  Item. In 1904, or thereabouts, Theodore Roosevelt built the West Wing \nfor the White House. He now had an office, the President had an office \nwith a desk, and he could ask reporters in to tell them about things. \nSuddenly an office that had not been that eminent, certainly not \ncompared to the Speaker of the House of Representatives, took on a \nquality previously unnoticed.\n  Right away the House built the Cannon Office Building named for their \nSpeaker, Joe Cannon. We built what is now the Russell Building. \nFranklin Roosevelt built the East Wing of the White House. They built \nLongworth; we built Dirksen. In the meantime, the Supreme Court, which \nhad worked happily down the hall for a century and a half--or, well, \nfrom the time we moved in to the new quarters in 1859, I believe--they \ncame up from the basement and lived happily down there, and they said: \nWhy don't we have a building? And they produced a building which \neventually was across the park here. This pattern goes on and on.\n  Presidents travel abroad now. We travel abroad. There are more judges \nin the executive branch than there are in the judicial branch, and the \nlike.\n  In 1921, Warren Harding created the Bureau of the Budget. Suddenly \nthere was a consolidation of Presidential authority. Departments used \nto send their budgets to the Congress on their own. The President would \nknow about them, of course, but there was no unified Presidential \nexecutive budget. That made for a real shift of authority toward the \nPresident.\n  It took almost half a century, but then we got our Bureau of the \nBudget in the Congressional Budget Office, and we started having our \nbudget. This suddenly intrudes on the authority of the authorizing \ncommittees. Each year they would be given a notice of how much money \nthey could spend, which was to be tolerable, of course, but it was \nsomebody else telling them what previously they decided on their own. \nIn this context, there was a centralization of authority in the Senate \nwhich did not serve it well.\n\n  Then came the decision to overturn rule XVI. Our government became \nincomprehensible. I cannot think of the number of hours I have stood on \nthis floor, sometimes there at the desk for the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee or ranking member, sometimes back here, looking at the final \nproduct of some massive, mysterious, impenetrable conference that went \non somewhere in this building, downtown, elsewhere, that would bring to \nour desks at the end of the Congress 1,500-page bills that did \neverything, combined the appropriations with the legislation, with \nthis, with that, with nobody knowing its contents. Not one Member of \nthis body could attest to having read the bill, probably no one person. \nObviously, some persons had read some parts, but that is not a \ndemocratic procedure. That is not a wise procedure.\n  It came about through a combination of the Budget Committee and this \nbreaking away of a long, established unrestraint on ourselves that \nthere are 13 appropriation bills, each must pass, and, therefore, if \nsomehow you could get a measure on an appropriations bill, it would \nbecome law, even if it might not make it through the authorizing \ncommittees.\n  Well, yes, but what law? Whose law? Who knew? Those committees \nhaven't been up there, the Foreign Affairs Committee, Armed Services \nCommittee, for two centuries without acquiring some experience in their \nmatters; and here, sir, we are heading for the same thing because the \nrule was overturned. Appropriations bills don't get passed any longer. \nNow it is we have 2 weeks left in July and August, really, because of \nthe recess.\n  Mr. President, if my time has expired, may I ask for 5 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator another 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We are heading for this situation. There is even talk \nthat the tax bills, which we will bring to the floor tomorrow or \nWednesday, need not be resolved in this period of time. They can lay \nover until September. Well, that means they will lay over until the \nlast day of the Congress, the last moment of the session. In the \nmeantime, we can expect over half the appropriation bills to have \npassed.\n  I wonder if I might address a question to my friend from Nevada, if I \nmight interrupt. How many appropriation bills have passed this year? \nWould he happen to know? No reason to know.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New York, surprisingly, in spite of \nthe legislating on appropriation bills, we have passed, I think, seven \nappropriation bills at this stage, give or take a bill or two. But, for \nexample, we were able, on Thursday, to pass Commerce-State-Justice, \nwhich had hundreds of amendments filed. It was only through the \ncooperation of the membership.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. We begin to come to our senses; that has brought us to \nthis point. We passed seven. I don't think we will pass 13. I think our \ntax legislation has every prospect of being an abomination. The Senate \ncannot pass legislation which it has never read and does not \nunderstand. That is what has been the consequence of this new \nsituation.\n  In addition to which, the distinguished minority leader is proposing \nan amendment to the fine initiative of the majority leader that says: \nNo more writing legislation in conference committees. That is against \nall of our rules, too, but has crept into our practices. Again, the \nauthorizing committees are gradually being marginalized and have no \nrole. Power is centralized.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from New York yield for a question?\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I surely will.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has graphically illustrated what happened under \nour present situation. Last fall, being more specific, that huge \ndocument we were asked to vote upon, we all came from our individual \nStates, because we had been out of session, while a few people \nnegotiated this bill for all of us.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Right.\n  Mr. REID. It was well over 1,000 pages, and it was something that you \nor I didn't read or anyone else read, isn't that true?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I stood here and said: I haven't read it. I know no one \nwho has read it.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New York, the same thing is \nhappening now. The mere fact that the Senate has passed an \nappropriations bill doesn't mean it is going to become law because we \nhave to go to conference with the House. If we are fortunate enough to \ncome up with a bill, it goes down to the President. He has said he is \ngoing to veto most of these appropriations bills. So that means we will \nbe right back\n\n[[Page S9174]]\n\nwhere we started last year, isn't that the case? We will have a bill \nwritten in conference that you or I, or even the members of the \nappropriations subcommittees, have never seen; is that fair?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is exactly so, sir. I can say to you, for example, \nthat Senator Roth, our distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, \nand I have jointly been sending letters regularly to the Appropriations \nCommittee saying: You have Social Security Act or tax matters in this \nappropriations measure you are dealing with; surely, you don't want to \ndo that. We don't get answers somehow.\n  Mr. REID. But under our present rules, I say to my friend, that is \nnot only the rule, it is being done.\n  The minority leader has offered an amendment to this change we are \ndiscussing today regarding rule XXVIII, so that when you go to \nconference, the conferees could only work on the bills they have, the \none from the House and the one from the Senate, and have to work on \nmatters that are before them. They can't go outside that scope and \nstart talking about wild horses in Nevada or they can't start talking \nabout the wheat crop in North Dakota, if it is not in the conference \nreport.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If it is not in the conference report.\n  I will close, sir, by simply saying this is a subject that is said to \nbe arcane, to be incomprehensible, to be something on the margin. The \nConstitution of the United States is a bit arcane. It was not something \nimmediately obvious to everyone, what its principles were. But they \nwere powerful, and they have persisted. So, indeed, have the rules of \nthe Senate, developed in the early 19th century, and then later, \nstarting in 1868, with regard to germaneness and the like. Language \nvery similar to our Rule XVI dates to 1884. We have here the question \nof whether we are going to be able to govern ourselves in the future. \nIf we should fail in that regard, what else, sir, will there be said of \nus when the history of the decline of the American Congress is written?\n  I thank the Chair for its courtesy in allowing me to extend my time. \nI thank my friend, the minority whip, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the statement made by the Senator \nfrom New York and the wisdom that he imparted to us is something we \nshould all listen to.\n  Some have said: Well, we have to treat the Senate like the House of \nRepresentatives. We really can't debate measures.\n  I say to my friend from New York, and anyone else within the sound of \nmy voice, we used to debate matters and let the cards fall where they \ndid. A good example of that was the Budget Deficit Reduction Act of \n1993. As Senators will recall, we had all kinds of statements of doom \nregarding that. The chairman of the House Budget Committee said: This \nplan will not work. If it does work, then I will have to become a \nDemocrat.\n  Well, it has worked. We have now a budget surplus. But my friend from \nthe House has not become a Democrat.\n  My friend, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said: It will \nflatten the economy. That has not been the case.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Texas, said: I want to predict \nhere tonight that if we adopt this bill, the American economy is going \nto get weaker, not stronger. The deficit 4 years from today will be \nhigher than it is today, not lower. When all is said and done, people \nwill pay more taxes. The economy will create fewer jobs. The government \nwill spend more money, and the American people will be worse off.\n  Every statement made by my friend from Texas was absolutely wrong. \nThe fact is that we had that bill. We had a debate. Without a single \nvote from my friends on the other side of the aisle, we passed that \nbill, with the Vice President breaking the tie. The deficit did not \nrise. In fact, it went away.\n  The economy got stronger, not weaker. More jobs were created; in \nfact, almost 20 million new jobs have been created since that \nlegislation was passed.\n  The point I am trying to make is that we can debate issues, debate \nthem in their entirety. We should do more of that. That is what this is \nall about.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will my friend yield for a comment?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I was chairman of the Finance Committee in 1993 when \nthat deficit reduction act passed. It was a risk. We risked that what \nwe understood of markets and of the economy was right. We could have \nbeen wrong. But it was not a casual affair. Day after day and evening \nafter evening in the Finance Committee we debated it. We voted on it. \nIt came to the floor, admittedly under a time limit from the Budget \nAct, but it was adequate to the purpose.\n  We legislated, and it was done in the open. The consequences are here \nto see. The $500 billion deficit reduction package contained in the \n1993 reconciliation bill has been re-estimated by the Office of \nManagement and Budget as having saved a total of $1.2 trillion. We had \na $290 billion deficit that year. The 10-year projection was $3 \ntrillion, and more, of cumulative deficits. Now we are dealing with a \n$3 trillion surplus. But that is because the process worked--and in the \nopen. The oldest principle of our Government is openness and \nresponsibility. We have been abandoning both, and the consequences \nshow.\n  Mr. REID. I say also to my friend, he will remember when we had the \ndebate about uninsured people who had no health care--who needed health \ncare but had no insurance. That was a debate that came early in the \nClinton administration, and we had a full and complete debate on that \nissue. It was debated at great length.\n  At that time, we had 38 million people with no health insurance. Now \nwe have 43 million people with no health insurance. But the fact is, \nwhen you are in the majority, you have to take chances, as did the \nformer chairman of the Finance Committee, the senior Senator from New \nYork. You have to take chances. Health care was a good debate for the \ncountry. Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I much agree.\n  Mr. REID. So I hope this debate will allow the majority to give us \nmore opportunities to debate issues. It doesn't hurt to talk at length \nabout issues. It is good for the country to talk about issues. It is \ngood for the body politic. But we should legislate the way the Founding \nFathers determined we should, and not have 1,500 bills that are \nprepared by 8 or 9 people when we have 535 Members of Congress. We have \nless than two handfuls of people that came up with that bill, and that \nis wrong. I think we need to change rule XVI, of course. We are going \nto protest and probably vote against that. But we also need to change \nrule XXVIII while we are doing it. If we do that, we will have a much \nmore open and better legislative body. Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Well said, sir.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nas in morning business and that the time I consume be counted against \nthe time on the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9174-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9174-S9176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE ACT\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, this morning I noticed in the Washington \nTimes newspaper that President Clinton has signed the bill we authored \nhere in the Senate, the National Missile Defense Act. This is very \nimportant legislation which the Senate passed after a lot of debate. \nThe House and the Senate then reconciled differences between the House-\npassed measure and the Senate bill and sent the bill to the President.\n  The President made a statement in connection with his signing the \nbill which raises some questions that I thought should be addressed by \na comment this morning. After talking about the fact that he is signing \nthe bill to address the growing danger that rogue nations may develop \nand field long-range missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass \ndestruction against the United States and our allies, he then has this \nto say in his message. He is referring to the fact that authorization \nand appropriations measures will\n\n[[Page S9175]]\n\nbe a part of the process in terms of when and how and to what extent \nthe funding is available for national missile defense.\n\n       This interpretation, which is confirmed by the legislative \n     record taken as a whole, is also required to avoid a possible \n     impairment of my constitutional authorities.\n\n  The President is suggesting that the bill doesn't mean what it says. \nI think that has to be brought to the attention of the Senate. The bill \nis very clear. It provides that it is the policy of the United States, \nupon enactment of this law, to deploy a national missile defense system \nas soon as technologically possible. That is unequivocal. It does not \nsay ``but if.'' It is a change in policy of our Government. It has \npassed both Houses by a large majority, and now the President has \nsigned the statute.\n  It seems to me the President is trying to reinterpret the bill to \njustify changing his position on this issue. He signed the bill; he \ndidn't veto it. This is not a veto message. He could have vetoed the \nbill, if he disagreed with the terms, and given Congress an opportunity \nto review that veto message and override the veto or sustain it, as the \nCongress' will dictates.\n  I point this out to suggest that it is clear we have changed our \npolicy, irrespective of the President's qualms about the new policy, \nand we now are committed as a nation to deploy a national missile \ndefense system. We will do so in the orderly course of authorization \nand appropriation bills that we pass, as required. We have an annual \nappropriations bill funding all of the activities of the Department of \nDefense. But it is clear that one of those activities will be the \ncontinued research, development, and deployment of a national missile \ndefense system.\n  I think it is very timely to point this out because the Prime \nMinister of Russia is coming to the United States. There will be talks \nthis week with the President.\n  I am hopeful, and I urge the President to be honest with the Russian \nleadership about the need to modify the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \nbecause the first part of that treaty says that neither signatory will \ndeploy a missile defense system to protect the territory of its nation. \nBut we have just changed the law of the United States to say that is \nour intention. We are committed to deploying a missile defense system \nthat will protect the territory of the United States.\n  So, insofar as that is inconsistent with the Anti-Ballistic Missile \nTreaty, the treaty needs to be changed, and our President should say \nthat to the Prime Minister of Russia unequivocally--not we ``may'' \nchange our mind when it comes time to authorize a deployment or to fund \na deployment.\n  The decision has been made to deploy a system, and when technology \npermits us to deploy an effective missile defense system under the \nterms of this act, we are going to do it irrespective of the provisions \nof that treaty. So we must change the treaty. And we want to assure the \nRussians that we are not targeting them. We are not trying to create a \nnew era of tension or competition or to make this a more dangerous \nrelationship--just the opposite; we want to be aboveboard, candid, and \nhonest with the Russians.\n  That is what I hope the President will do as a spokesman for our \ncountry.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the statement \nby the President at his signing of the National Missile Defense Act be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        White House Briefing Room,\n\n\n                                Office of the Press Secretary,\n\n                                   The White House, July 23, 1999.\n\n                       Statement by the President\n\n       I have signed into law H.R. 4, the ``National Missile \n     Defense Act of 1999.'' My Administration is committed to \n     addressing the growing danger that rogue nations may develop \n     and field long-range missiles capable of delivering weapons \n     of mass destruction against the United States and our allies.\n       Section 2 of this Act states that it is the policy of the \n     United States to deploy as soon as technologically possible \n     an effective National Missile Defense (NMD) system with \n     funding subject to the annual authorization of appropriations \n     and the annual appropriation of funds for NMD. By specifying \n     that any NMD deployment must be subject to the authorization \n     and appropriations process, the legislation makes clear that \n     no decision on deployment has been made. This interpretation, \n     which is confirmed by the legislative record taken as a \n     whole, is also required to avoid any possible impairment of \n     my constitutional authorities.\n       Section 3 of that Act states that it is the policy of the \n     United States to seek continued negotiated reductions in \n     Russian nuclear forces. Thus, section 3 puts the Congress on \n     record as continuing to support negotiated reductions in \n     strategic nuclear arms, reaffirming my Administration's \n     position that our missile defense policy must take into \n     account our arms control and nuclear nonproliferation \n     objectives.\n       Next year, we will, for the first time, determine whether \n     to deploy a limited National Missile Defense, when we review \n     the results of flight tests and other developmental efforts, \n     consider cost estimates, and evaluate the threat. Any NMD \n     system we deploy must be operationally effective, cost-\n     effective, and enhance our security. In making our \n     determination, we will also review progress in achieving our \n     arms control objectives, including negotiating any amendments \n     to the ABM Treaty that may be required to accommodate a \n     possible NMD deployment.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, further, I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of this morning's report contained in the Washington Times written \nby Bill Gertz describing the issue and the President's actions also be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 26, 1999]\n\n   Clinton Signs Bill for Missile Defense--Says He's Not Required to \n                               Deploy It\n\n                             By Bill Gertz\n\n       President Clinton has signed into law a bill that says U.S. \n     policy is to deploy a nationwide defense against long-range \n     missiles as soon as the technology is available.\n       The president signed the legislation Friday but issued a \n     statement saying the law does not obligate him to deploy the \n     national missile defense, remarks that will likely upset \n     congressional Republicans in favor of deployment.\n       The National Missile Defense (NMD) Act states that it is \n     U.S. policy to deploy ``as soon as technologically possible'' \n     a system of interceptors, radar and communications gear that \n     can shoot down an incoming long-range missile.\n       Mr. Clinton said the law on deployment is subject to \n     funding by annual authorization and appropriations for \n     national missile defense.\n       ``By specifying that any [national missile defense] \n     deployment must be subject to the authorization and \n     appropriations process, the legislation makes clear that no \n     decision on deployment has been made,'' Mr. Clinton said.\n       ``This interpretation, which is confirmed by the \n     legislative record taken as a whole, is also required to \n     avoid any possible impairment of my constitutional \n     authorities.''\n       Mr. Clinton said the legislation also calls for continuing \n     to seek negotiations with Russia on reducing nuclear forces, \n     ``reaffirming my administration's position that our missile \n     defense policy must take into account our arms control and \n     nuclear nonproliferation objectives.''\n       The president remains opposed to deploying a missile \n     defense because it will upset arms reductions and \n     negotiations with Moscow. Mr. Clinton has said the 1972 Anti-\n     Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty is the ``cornerstone'' of \n     strategic relations with Russia and must be preserved.\n       The administration announced earlier this year that it \n     would begin talks--not negotiations--with Moscow on changing \n     the ABM treaty to allow deployment.\n       The issue is expected to come up this week in talks between \n     senior U.S. officials and visiting Russian Prime Minister \n     Sergei Stepashin.\n       Mr. Stepashin will also discuss beginning a new round of \n     arms reduction talks even though Russia's Duma has failed for \n     several years to ratify the START II strategic arms pact.\n       The U.S. Senate, which ratified START II in 1996, \n     conditioned its approval on Russian ratification of the \n     treaty and prohibited the United States from cutting its \n     nuclear forces to START II levels until Russia's parliament \n     approves the treaty.\n       Many Republicans in Congress have said the ABM treaty is \n     outdated and fails to take into account emerging long-range \n     missile threats from China, North Korea and other nations.\n       A special congressional commission on missile threats \n     stated in a report last year that long-range missile threats \n     to the United States could emerge with little or no warning. \n     The commission, headed by former Defense Secretary Donald \n     Rumsfeld, boosted efforts by missile defense proponents and \n     led to bipartisan support for the Missile Defense Act signed \n     by Mr. Clinton.\n       Mr. Clinton said in his statement that a decision on \n     whether to deploy a limited national missile defense will be \n     made next year based on flight tests and other developmental \n     efforts, cost estimates and an evaluation of the threat.\n\n[[Page S9176]]\n\n       ``Any NMD system we deploy must be operationally effective, \n     cost-effective, and enhance our security,'' Mr. Clinton said. \n     ``In making our determination, we will also review progress \n     in achieving our arms control objectives including \n     negotiating any amendments to the ABM treaty that may be \n     required to accommodate a possible NMD deployment.''\n       Mr. Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin agreed \n     during a meeting in Germany last month to hold talks this \n     fall on possible changes in the ABM treaty.\n       White House National Security Adviser Samuel R. Berger told \n     reporters at the time that the administration would make no \n     decision on deploying missile defenses until June 2000. Mr. \n     Berger also indicated that ABM treaty changes might be needed \n     to accommodate a missile defense ``if we were to deploy \n     one.''\n       Russia has opposed any changes at the ABM treaty, which \n     states that neither side will build missile defenses that \n     cover their entire national territory.\n       Russia has a limited, single missile defense site set up \n     around Moscow. The United States has no defense against long-\n     range missiles.\n       A senior White House official has said that the funding and \n     authorization language of the Missile Defense Act is a \n     loophole that allows that president to avoid having to deploy \n     a national missile defense.\n       However, Sen. Thad Cochran, Mississippi Republican and \n     chief sponsor of the legislation, has said the legislation is \n     unambiguous.\n       Mr. Cochran said the administration should be honest about \n     the need for ABM treaty changes.\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9176-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9176-S9190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RESTORATION OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF RULE XVI--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are here today talking about the change \nin rule XVI. We are also talking about the minority leader's effort to \nchange rule XXVIII.\n  The minority today wants to talk about how we are being treated like \nthe House of Representatives. In fact, if the majority were consistent \nand they were going to vote without any question to change rule XVI, \nthey would also vote to change rule XXVIII, which in effect says you \ncan't go outside the scope of the conference as the conference \ncommittees have done, especially in the appropriations field.\n  I am happy to see my friend from North Dakota here, the chairman of \nthe Democratic Policy Committee, who is in effect the educational arm \nfor the minority.\n  Is the Senator ready to proceed?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the vote that has been called on this \nissue, I assume, is a vote that will come to the Senate because some \nare inconvenienced or upset by amendments that have been offered by \nthose on the Democratic side of the aisle. These amendments have dealt \nwith a range of issues we think are very important: Education, health \ncare, agriculture--a whole series of issues we think need to be \naddressed. Because we have not been able to address them on \nauthorization bills, we have offered amendments on appropriations \nbills.\n  As the Presiding Officer and my colleagues know, the precedent \nstemming back from a vote some while ago in the Senate allows us to do \nthat. That might be inconvenient for the majority because it allows us, \nthen, on an appropriations bill, to offer an amendment and have a \ndebate on the Patients' Bill of Rights, for example. Or it may allow \nfor us to have a debate on the agriculture disaster relief bill. They \nmay not want to do that, but they cannot deny the members of the \nDemocratic minority in the Senate the right to amend an appropriations \nbill. So the proposal is to change the rules back to where they used to \nbe in order to prevent amendments of the type I have just described \nfrom being offered to the appropriations bills.\n  I thought it would be useful today to just go through a list of bills \nthat describe the way the Senate has been operating in recent years and \ndescribe why many of us have felt it necessary to try to add \nlegislation to appropriations bills. Let me just go through a list \ngoing back to 1997 and 1998.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act, S. 4. This bill, as it was \ndescribed on the floor of the Senate, sought to give employees more \nflexibility with their work hours. Senator Patty Murray sought to \npropose an amendment to give employees 24 hours a year of current \nfamily medical leave so they could take time off to go to school \nconferences and other things. But cloture was filed so that amendments \ncould be offered. The purpose of the majority was to say: We want to \ndebate S. 4. It is our bill. We want to debate it and we do not want \nthe inconvenience of having amendments that we believe are not \nappropriate or germane to the bill. So what we want to do is put the \nbill on the floor and file cloture and prevent the Democrats from \noffering amendments.\n  On the Education Savings Act for public and private schools, they had \nthe same approach: Bring the bill out here, file cloture and say: We \nwant to debate this bill. It is our agenda. But we do not want you to \nbe able to offer the amendments you want to offer.\n  The Federal Vacancies Reform Act, the same thing; Child Custody \nProtection Act, same thing. If we go through a list of these, we see \nwhat has happened is the majority leader has set himself up, it seems \nto me, as a kind of House Rules Committee in the Senate, saying I am \ngoing to bring a bill to the floor, and I am going to fill the \nlegislative tree, as they call it, and create a mechanism by which no \none else can move. It is a legislative straitjacket. No one else will \nbe able to offer amendments.\n  Then the majority leader has said to us, on occasion: All right, I \nhave a bill. I have filled the tree, come to me with your amendments, \nand if I approve and think we ought to debate them, I will allow you to \ndebate them; if I don't, I will not.\n  That is not the way the Senate works. The Senate is a very \ninconvenient place and not a very effective or efficient place in the \nway it disposes of legislation. But that happens to be the way George \nWashington and Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin and Mason and Madison \nanticipated this place should work.\n  Remember the description about the Senate being the saucer that cools \nthe coffee? They did not intend the Senate to work the way the House \nworks, to have a Rules Committee to mandate that only certain \namendments will be allowed, and then there will only be a certain \namount of debate allowed, and it will all go very efficiently. That is \nnot the way they intended the Senate to work. Yet that is exactly the \nway the majority leader has anticipated the Senate should work now for \nsome long while.\n\n  If we had this rule in place last year, for example, the Senator from \nNevada knows we would not have been able to offer the agriculture \nrelief package we offered and got attached to the agriculture \nappropriations bill. The first portion of the farm crisis relief \npackage was done in the Senate as an amendment that I and Senator \nConrad offered to the agriculture appropriations bill. It would not be \nallowed under the rule change that is now being proposed by the \nmajority leader.\n  So we have a circumstance where the majority has decided that it \nreally wants to debate its agenda. I understand that. If I were on \ntheir side, I would want to debate their agenda. They have a right to \ndo that; that is their right. I will vote every day to support their \nright to do that. But then they say: Not only do we want to debate our \nagenda, we want to prevent the other side from offering amendments that \nrelate to their agenda.\n  That is not appropriate. It is not the way the Senate should work. \nThe reason we have had to offer amendments to appropriations bills is \nbecause authorization bills have not been passed. When they do come to \nthe floor, the majority leader decides he does not want amendments \noffered to authorization bills.\n  Let me give one example, if I might. Does anybody know anything about \nthe Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization bill? That is an \nimportant\n\n[[Page S9177]]\n\nbill. It describes how we run the airways in this country--the control \ntowers, the safety of air transportation. Do you know we just passed \nthe other night, by unanimous consent, a 2-month extension of the FAA \nbill? I will bet there are not 10 Senators who know we passed, by \nunanimous consent, a 2-month extension. Why did we pass a 2-month \nextension? Because we should have passed an FAA reauthorization bill in \nthe last Congress and it did not get done because we have a huge fight \ngoing on.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from North \nDakota a question. The Senator from North Dakota served in the House of \nRepresentatives how many years?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was in the House of Representatives 12 years.\n  Mr. REID. It is true that it is a very large body, 435 Members. Over \nthe years they have developed certain rules to move legislation because \nit is a large body?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Every bill that comes to the House floor has a rule placed \non it--how long it can be debated, what amendments can be debated. My \ncolleague recalls those days, as do I, being a former House Member?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Nevada is absolutely correct about the \nprocedures of the House.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, isn't his memory of how the House \noperates simply how the majority is now trying to operate the Senate? \nThe leadership in the majority is trying to make it the same, is that \nnot true?\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is exactly what is happening in the Senate, and it \ncauses some heartburn for many people who understand how the Senate has \ntraditionally worked and ought to work. This is not the House. We do \nnot have a Rules Committee which decides what amendments should be \noffered. I know some want to change this into a body that operates \nidentically to the House of Representatives, but it is not the way the \nFramers of this Government decided how it should work.\n  I want to go back for a moment to this issue of the FAA \nreauthorization bill. It describes our problems. We are not passing \nauthorization bills. They are all hung up with big disputes here and \nthere, and when one does come to the floor, the folks who bring it to \nthe floor fill up the legislative tree and decide they do not want the \nrest of us to be able to offer amendments. That is a big problem. If \nthe Senate were operating the way it should, I do not think there would \nbe any concern about whether or not you could legislate on an \nappropriations bill. But because the Senate is not operating the way it \nshould, the Democrats are largely prevented from offering amendments in \nmost cases.\n  And motions to shut off debate before debate starts, or even before \nthe first amendment is offered, have now become routine. Think of that \nagain. The filing of motions to shut off debate, even before the first \namendment is filed, has become routine in the Senate.\n  If you went back to that little room in Philadelphia where they wrote \nthis Constitution, I will bet they would be aghast at that. When Mason \nand Madison and Franklin and George Washington, talked about what kind \nof a framework they wanted to describe for governance of this country, \nthey created a Senate that was deliberately inefficient. It required \nthings to slow down a bit and that there to be a lengthy public debate \nabout what ought to happen and what is good and what is not good public \npolicy. They did that deliberately.\n  Now we have all these folks who say we do not want the Senate to be \nable to consider, for any length of time, these issues. We do not want \namendments to be offered; we want this place to be kind of a slam-dunk, \nhighly efficient mirror image of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. That is not what it ought to be.\n\n  I know outside this Chamber this notion of rule changes and rule XVI \nsounds like a foreign language.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this must sound like a foreign language to \npeople--rule XVI, legislating on appropriations bills, germane. It is \nnot a foreign language. It is about whether folks have the right to \nstand at these desks and engage in debate and offer amendments.\n  This desk I am standing at is the desk that was sat in by Robert La \nFollette, the great, popular Senator from Wisconsin. In fact, I am told \non May 29, 1908, they tried to poison Robert La Follette at this very \ndesk. The Senate historian sent me information about that. He had been \nfilibustering and had been on his feet for some 8 hours or so, and he \nput a glass of eggnog to his lips and spat the eggnog and claimed he \nhad been poisoned. There is a lot of mystery about that circumstance. \nIt was at this desk in 1908 that a great, popular Senator in the middle \nof a filibuster suffered that indignity.\n  Having heard that story now and seen the evidence from the Senate \nhistorian, I am probably not likely to filibuster anytime soon. At \nleast if I do, I will not from this desk.\n  The point is, back in the old days, the way the Senate used to work, \nand the not so old days even going back 10, 20, 30 years, the Senate \nwas a deliberative body. Its ability to debate was not choked by \nsomeone filing cloture motions before anyone else had the opportunity \neven to offer an amendment. That is not the way the Senate should work.\n  The change in rule XVI allowed us to offer legislative amendments on \nappropriations bills. That is necessary only because the Senate is now \nbeing operated in a way that, in my judgment, was not intended at all \nby the framers of the Constitution and certainly was not the way it was \nrun for the first 180 years or so of its existence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for giving \nme this time.\n  I listened with great interest and confusion--I guess a little bit--\nto what the Senator from North Dakota was saying. He is right on \ntarget. I served 10 years in the House of Representatives before I came \nto the Senate. We were always a little frustrated at that time, I \nremember, by the Rules Committee because they would set up the rules by \nwhich we could debate. We only had 5 minutes in the House. You could \nspeak 5 minutes, and that was it. Once in a while, you were lucky to \nget consent to speak for 7 or 8 minutes.\n  We always knew that if the majority party or minority party or \ninterested people could not get an amendment up because of the Rules \nCommittee, it could always be done in the Senate. I cannot think of any \ntime since I came to the Senate in 1975 when an issue we wanted to \ndebate in the House but were prevented from doing so by the action of \nthe Rules Committee was not then later followed up with full debate on \nthe Senate floor.\n  That is as the framers of our Constitution envisioned. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota is right, and the Senator from Nevada is right. With \n435 Members in the House, there is no way it could function if it \nfunctioned under the same rules as the Senate, so they have to have a \nRules Committee. I understand that.\n  In the Senate, as envisioned by the framers of our Constitution, we \nare to have open and deliberative debate about the great issues of the \nday, and it is to be just that, deliberative.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I reminded my friend from Iowa just the other day of one of \nthe first legislative sessions I attended while in the Senate. The \nSenator from Iowa came to the Senate a couple years prior to this \nSenator. It was 2:30 in the morning. We were debating an issue, and the \nSenator from Iowa felt very strongly about aid to the contras in \nCentral America. Even though it was inconvenient, even though it was \n2:30 in the morning, and even though most of us wished the Senator had \nnot offered an amendment, the Senator from Iowa had the right at 2:30 \nin the morning to offer an amendment on a bill\n\n[[Page S9178]]\n\nthat was before the Senate. There were no rules on that bill, and the \nSenator offered an amendment on aid to the contras because the Senator \nfrom Iowa felt strongly about that and he had a right to offer it. Does \nthe Senator remember that?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I do remember that, I tell the Senator. I remember it \nvery well, as a matter of fact.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, we are a better country, \nno matter how one felt about aid to the contras--I happened to agree \nwith my friend from Iowa--for having been able to debate that issue in \nthe light of day.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to the Senator, he is absolutely right. I remember \nthat time. I remember some of the great debates we had. I say to my \nfriend from Nevada, when I came to the Senate, the Republicans were in \ncharge, and then the Democrats were in charge, and then it went back to \nthe Republicans again. In all those years--first it was under Senator \nDole, then Senator Byrd, Senator Mitchell, Senator Dole again--in all \nthat time, we had free and open debate in the Senate. Once in a while, \nthe majority would try to skirt it a little bit, but that was used very \nrarely. The general rule in the Senate was that we had authorizing \nbills, we offered our amendments, and we debated them fully. Sometimes \nthey lasted until 2:30 or 3 in the morning--not often, but once in a \nwhile when it was an important issue of the day, when those who felt \nstrongly about those issues thought it needed a full airing.\n\n  I do not remember at any time during that period that anything got \nheld up, that this body came to a screeching, grinding halt. We had our \nsay. We had good deliberations. That is gone now. We do not have that \nany longer. We do not have a free-flowing debate in the Senate any \nlonger. A person gets up, gives a speech, and leaves the floor. Why? \nBecause the way things are being structured now does not really allow \nfor the free-flowing, deliberative debate we have had in the past.\n  When we changed rule XVI in 1995, when the then-new Republican \nmajority voted to change rule XVI, I was opposed to that. I thought we \nshould continue to operate as we had been operating. But since 1995, \nwhat has happened is, under the new leadership in the Senate, we have a \nstructure that does not allow for that kind of debate and deliberation \non authorizing bills. It has been common now for the majority to take \nthe position that we do not have any regular debate on controversial \nsubjects. We are not allowed the orderly amendment process to be \nconsidered in the Senate.\n  We are all products of our backgrounds, our upbringing, what we \nlearned earlier in life. I know the distinguished majority leader--who \nis a fine man, and I have the greatest amount of respect for him--in \nhis tenure in the House served on the Rules Committee. I am openly \nwondering whether or not the Senate majority leader's tenure on the \nHouse Rules Committee is somehow affecting his leadership in the \nSenate. Is the Senate majority leader trying to run the Senate the way \nthe House Rules Committee runs the House? It seems to me that is what \nis happening, moving the Senate toward House procedures.\n  The pattern has become clear. The Republican leader decides on a \nparticular measure; they move to consider it in a process where no \namendments can be offered or only a limited number of predetermined \namendments may be offered.\n  Again, the argument of limited time is often suggested as a reason--\nwe do not have all this time--but that is clearly a veil that hides \nnothing.\n  Several days are spent working out the details of what may be allowed \ninstead of proceeding to the bill and allowing us to debate.\n  How many days, I ask my friend from Nevada, have we spent on the \nfloor with nobody here, quorum call after quorum call, simply because \nthe majority leader does not want to have a measure on the floor to \nwhich we can add our amendments and openly debate them?\n  The reason given is that, well, it will take too much time if Senator \nHarkin or Senator Reid or Senator Johnson or Senator Dorgan get up and \nstart offering their amendments and debate them. Yet we spend the \nentire week in quorum calls while they try to work out the details of \nsome agreement on how to proceed.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is a great example. We passed that in \nour committee, the committee on which I serve, last spring. We wanted \nto bring it out on the floor for debate. The majority leader would not \nallow it: Oh, it would take too much time, don't you see.\n  What were we forced to do? We were forced to offer it on the \nagriculture appropriations bill. It should not have been there. We \nshould have had open and free debate. That brought the ag \nappropriations bill to a standstill.\n  Then they tried to work out how we were going to do this. Finally, \nthere was a unanimous consent agreement that established a very tight \nrule, similar to the House Rules Committee, in order for us to bring up \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. Why didn't we bring it up in the first \nplace a month or two ago and debate it in the orderly process and be \ndone with it?\n  Another example is the proposed lockbox, a procedure under which \nsurpluses could be blocked from being spent year to year. There are a \nvariety of ways this could have been accomplished. There are a lot of \ndifferent views on this lockbox and how we are going to proceed on it. \nBut look what has happened. Not once, not twice, but three times the \nmajority leader moved to invoke cloture to block any amendments from \nbeing offered to lockbox--three times to shut off any amendments. So we \nstill do not have the measure before us. Yet time is consumed, time is \nwasted around here. More time is wasted in the Senate than any place I \nhave ever seen. We still have not brought up the lockbox. We could have \nbrought it up a month ago and debated it.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the cloture provision in our \nrules was set up to stop endless debate; is that right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes. I say to the Senator, it was to stop endless debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 10 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 additional minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Iowa, the lockbox is used as an \nillustration. There has not been a single word of debate on that, has \nthere been?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Not one word of debate.\n  Mr. REID. Why would you want to file cloture when there is no talk, \nno conversation on anything relating to it?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is what I do not understand. The Senator makes my \npoint. The majority leader is trying to run the Senate like the Rules \nCommittee, saying: We are bringing it up, but we don't want your \namendments, we don't want you to discuss this.\n  The Senate must be an open body. Placing authorizing measures on \nappropriations bills is an imperfect but, under the way the Senate is \nrunning now, a necessary method of bringing matters to the \nconsideration of the Senate.\n\n  In light of the actions by the Republican leader to cut off our \ndebate and our ability to have open deliberation, we have been forced \nto use the appropriations bills as a method of doing that.\n  These issues should be discussed seriously. I do not know that we \nneed to change our rules so much around here as we need to show a \ngreater willingness to be open, to allow for the smooth flow of ideas \nand amendments on the floor, rather than gagging Senators, preventing \nthem from offering timely amendments.\n  I must say, if we do not move toward some accommodation on this, \nparliamentary procedures will be used to deteriorate the ability of the \nSenate to function. The restoration of rule XVI will restrict our \noptions on the minority side. But I cannot believe--and I say this to \nmy friend from Nevada; I say this to the occupant of the Chair--I \ncannot believe that any serious student of parliamentary procedure \nbelieves that rule XVI will effectively block Senators from eventually \ngetting votes on desired matters. It will happen, but it is going to \ntake a terrible toll on this place.\n  We should be debating issues such as the minimum wage and fair pay. \nThe\n\n[[Page S9179]]\n\nother day I saw a figure that said, if you took the CEOs of the Fortune \n500 companies, the CEO pay in 1960 and the minimum wage in 1960, and \nyou brought them forward to 1999, if the minimum wage had gone up at \nthe same rate as CEO pay, the minimum wage today would be $40 an hour.\n  I would like to debate that on the floor. I would like to debate the \nnecessity and the need to raise the minimum wage. Mr. President, \n$10,700 a year, that is what it is right now for people trying to raise \ntheir families. We need a full deliberation on this. It is an important \nissue. Yet we are choked off and gagged from even doing so.\n  I can assure the majority that this can only escalate. The \nreimposition of rule XVI will invite the use of alternative, more \ndisruptive parliamentary methods in order for the minority to raise \nthese important issues for the benefit of the American people. \nFurthermore, I believe that this, then, will cause further erosion of \nthe good will of this body in the smooth consideration of legislation.\n  We had 48 cloture votes in the last Congress. We have already had 17 \nthis session. As the Senator from Nevada said, it is laid down \nimmediately, not after we have debated it for some time; and the \nmajority, exercising its right to bring debate to a close, files \ncloture. No. It is done right in the beginning before one amendment is \noffered, before one word is even uttered on the issue before us.\n  So I say to the majority, do not escalate, because one escalation \nleads to another. The reimposition of rule XVI will lead to some other \naction taken on this side for the minority to exercise its rights. Then \nthere will be another escalation on the other side, and then in the end \nthe Senate will be the loser, our Government will be the loser, and the \nAmerican people will lose.\n  Let us not overturn the 1995 precedent on rule XVI. Let us, instead, \nhave a substantive series of discussions to work out the necessary \nadjustments to the way we operate so that we can, once again, as we had \nuntil recent times, have open and fair deliberation of the major issues \nbefore this body.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Iowa for his \nstatement.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada. I \nassociate myself with the remarks of my friend and colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, on this issue.\n  Today the Senate is considering the reinstatement of rule XVI, the \nSenate rule preventing authorizing legislation from being included on \nappropriations bills.\n  The reason the Senate is forced today to consider the reinstatement \nof rule XVI is because the Republican majority overturned the ruling of \nthe Chair in 1995. Prior to 1995, it always was the rule that no \nauthorizing language could be added to an appropriations bill.\n  Having had several years of experience under this new regime, the \nmajority comes back with a proposal now to go back to that old rule, \nwhereby authorizing language way not be added to an appropriations \nbill. If debate were being brought forward on the floor of the Senate \nin the way that it had over most of the history of this institution, I \ndo not think there would be very much resistance to going back to rule \nXVI.\n  But what needs to be pointed out is the context we find ourselves in \npost-1995, the way in which, frankly, the current majority party seems \nto be bringing legislation to the floor, and the fact that this process \nhas changed radically, and for the worse, not only for the minority \nparty but for the American people.\n  If debate on amendments were brought forward in a fair fashion, with \nthe majority party and the minority party being allowed to bring \namendments and legislation to the floor, to have a reasonable \ndiscussion of those issues--whether it be about HMO managed care \nreform, whether it be about campaign finance reform, whether it be \nabout minimum wage, whether it be about farm disaster legislation--\nregardless of what it might be, I do not think there would be any \nopposition to bringing those amendments up outside the context of an \nappropriations bill.\n  In recent years, it has become common practice, in fact the usual \npractice, for authorizing legislation, when it is brought to the floor \nof the Senate, to be brought with what amounts to a gag order on the \nminority party. By a gag order, I mean legislation is frequently now \nbrought to the floor by our majority leader with the amendment tree \nfilled, meaning that no minority amendments are permitted whatsoever to \nauthorizing legislation, allowing for no additional amendments to be \noffered. Then cloture is filed before there is any debate on anything \nrelative to the amendments the minority party ordinarily is allowed to \nbring.\n  What does the majority fear? Why is there this concern? Is it really \na matter of saving time? As my colleague from Iowa has noted, we go \ndays at a time around this place with no constructive legislative \nprogress being made on the floor of the Senate, with a quorum call in \nprogress, with no one here. Is it really to save time or is it, in \nfact, a concern on the part of the majority that the American people \nshould not be allowed to share the discussion and debate on the floor \nabout key issues that ought to be before the American public, about \nwhere this country ought to be going relative to its domestic and \ninternational agendas. Is there a gag rule for some reason other than \nsaving time? One would have to conclude that, yes, that is the case; \nthat apparently the majority finds it embarrassing to have Members of \nthis body discussing an agenda that is not being addressed by the \nSenate.\n  All of this really amounts to the minority party being shut out of \nthe process, being denied the right to amend legislation when that \nlegislation comes to the floor.\n  An example, Mr. President, is when legislation to create a so-called \nlockbox for the Social Security trust fund was brought to the floor on \nseveral occasions earlier this year. Grossly inadequate lockbox \nlegislation was being brought to the floor. It belied what most people \nwould think of when they think of a lockbox. But there was no \nopportunity for amendments to be offered or even considered.\n  The minority party understands it is the minority party. It may lose \na vote on a proposed amendment. But that party ought to be allowed the \nopportunity to point out the deficiencies of legislation and to have a \nfair up-or-down vote. There are times when Democrats will vote with \nRepublicans, and Republicans will vote with Democrats. That is the way \nthe process ought to work. Yet that opportunity is being denied this \nbody.\n  The question for all of us to consider, again, is, What is the \nmajority afraid of? Do they not believe Senators in the minority have \nthe right to offer amendments, or that any Senator in the majority \nmight from time to time vote with the minority? It is a sad commentary \nabout the bipartisan politics of this body if that, indeed, is the \ncase.\n  I had the honor of serving in the other Chamber for a number of \nyears. Over there, where they have 435 Representatives, there is a \nRules Committee that decides which amendments will be considered and \nwhen, and how that legislation is brought to the floor. In the other \nbody, that process is sometimes abused but probably is necessary, given \nthe sheer size of the body. The possibility of 435 Members offering \nmultiple amendments obviously boggles the mind and could, indeed, slow \ndown the process.\n  But one of the great strengths of the Senate has been, because of our \nsmaller size and the historic collegiality that has existed most of the \ntime in this body, we don't have that kind of Rules Committee, that \nkind of power. Here we bring these issues to the floor for an open and \nfair and balanced debate; obviously, with the majority and the minority \ndividing the time and proceeding with debate in an orderly, \nconstructive fashion but with an opportunity to address the key issues \nfacing the Nation, whether brought by the majority or brought by the \nminority, to have that discussion. Unfortunately, the current \nmajority--and this is out of precedent going back throughout the \nhistory of our country--wants to deny Senators in the minority a chance \nto offer the amendments they believe need to be offered.\n\n[[Page S9180]]\n\n  I think there would be few Senators on the part of the minority who \nwould object to reaching bipartisan agreements on the amount of time to \nbe spent on particular legislation or the number of amendments to be \noffered. It is very common that these agreements about numbers of \namendments and time agreements are reached in a bipartisan fashion so \nthat we can continue to proceed in an orderly fashion so that there is \nno real risk of debate on these issues somehow clogging up the process \nand denying the ability of the Senate to move forward with its agenda. \nThis is not a tradeoff between orderly development of legislative \nissues and the opportunity for the minority to bring up amendments and \ndiscuss them in a reasonable manner.\n  I think it is important for everyone who is following this debate, \nthen, to keep these circumstances in mind, to fully understand what the \nrestoration of rule XVI really is all about. It is not about orderly \nprogress of legislation. It is not about saving time. It is about \ntrying to gag the minority party with no opportunity to bring up \nlegislation which the majority party is ignoring. It is a means of \npreventing the minority party from pointing out the deficiencies and \ninadequacies, as they see it, of legislation being offered by the \nmajority. It is the majority party's effort to see to it that their own \nMembers don't cross the aisle to vote with the minority party on \nselected pieces of legislation and to save themselves from that \napparent embarrassment.\n  I point out another important issue that must be discussed again in \nthis context. That is Senator Daschle's amendment to reinstate the \nscope of conference point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time requested by the distinguished \nSenator has expired.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. May I have 1 additional minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Prior to 1996, a point of order could be brought in \nconference committee against an amendment that had not been offered and \ndebated in either the House or the Senate but was included in one of \ntheir versions of the bill. The majority is also overturning that rule, \nmeaning they have the opportunity, then, to deny minority amendments on \nthe floor of the Senate, but then, when they are in conference \ncommittee behind closed doors, with no media, no press, the majority \nparty can amend legislation any way they wish, without regard to action \nof the House or the Senate on the floor.\n  I hope in the context of all of this the Senate will remain \nconsistent with precedent in supporting Senator Daschle's effort to \nmake sure there is some continuity of action in those conference \ncommittees. This is particularly important in light of the changes \nbeing proposed on rule XVI.\n  I yield back such time as I have to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from South Dakota, I very \nmuch appreciate his statement. I also say that the people in South \nDakota are very fortunate that South Dakota doesn't have a lot of \npeople but, through Senators Daschle and Johnson, has great power in \nthe Senate. I appreciate very much the Senator's remarks.\n  I now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from California, Mrs. Barbara \nBoxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank Senator Reid, \nour distinguished minority whip, who has done such a fine job on so \nmany issues.\n  Mr. President, I say to the public who may be watching this debate, \nit may sound a little arcane, but we are debating the rules of the \nSenate. They will hear about rule XVI, they will hear about rule \nXXVIII, and they will say: What does this have to do with us? What does \nthis have to do with my daily life as an American citizen?\n  Let me tell you, it has everything to do with the daily lives of the \nAmerican people because this debate is about the power to bring issues \nto the American people by way of the Senate. It is about who has the \nright to bring issues to this floor for debate--issues that really \nmatter to people, issues that relate to their jobs, issues that relate \nto their health care, issues that relate to their kids' education, \nissues that relate to how much congestion there is on a freeway or at \nan airport. So the power to bring up issues on the floor of the Senate \nis, in essence, the ability for all of us as Senators to make a \ndifference in the lives of the American people.\n  If you were to ask me who has the right to bring issues to the Senate \nfloor, my answer would be every single Senator, be they Republican, \nDemocrat, or Independent. I think it is a very sad day today because, \nvery clearly, the way this place has been running there is an attempt \nto shut down all but the Republican Senators. Because the Republican \nSenators control these appropriations bills in the committee, they will \nbe able to load them up with all kinds of legislation. But once those \nbills get to the floor, there will be no way for Democratic Senators or \nIndependent Senators to add their voices to that legislation.\n  There was a time in the Senate when things weren't like this. Perhaps \nthey were the golden days of the Senate. When I first got here, we \nworked well--the Democrats did--with the Republicans. In those days, \nthe Democrats were in charge. We worked well together. We weren't \nafraid to take the tough votes. We had full debate. Authorization bills \nwere brought to the floor of the Senate. There was open debate.\n  Now we have a majority leader whom I like very much. Notwithstanding \nthat, every chance he gets, his goal is to shut down the debate, to not \nallow a full debate. If he were in a position to open up the debate on \nauthorizing bills, I say to the distinguished whip, we would not be \nhere today fighting against reinstating rule XVI.\n  I want to take a look at how we actually got to this point. Rule XVI \nof the Senate rules prohibits amending appropriations bills. In other \nwords, the rationale--which is a very good rationale--is that \nappropriations bills are merely bills that decide how much we spend on \na particular item, and therefore they should be immune from the larger \ndebate about underlying law and changes in underlying law. I always \nthought that was a good rule. We had it in place, as I say, when I got \nhere.\n  Then, in 1995, the Republicans changed the rule. It came about \nbecause a Republican Senator wanted to stop the Endangered Species Act \nin its tracks and she wanted to attach an environmental rider to an \nappropriations bill. She needed very much to change rule XVI in order \nto win her point.\n  I remember being very upset at that time for two reasons. No. 1, I \nthought it was really bad to change rule XVI because I thought we had \nfair and open debate. Secondly, I thought, here is a major policy \nchange, a major change in the law, without going through the \nauthorizing committees, no hearings, no witnesses, no real debate in \nthe committee.\n\n  The Endangered Species Act has been a great act. Is it perfect? No. \nBut it saved the California condor and the bald eagle. Yet we have a \nSenator wanting to throw the whole thing out, essentially, and stop all \nthe new listings because she didn't like it. In order to do that, her \ncolleagues accommodated her and they went back to allowing legislation \non appropriations; 54 Republicans voted with her at the time.\n  Now, after several years of seeing some of us move our legislation, \nsuch as the Patients' Bill of Rights, campaign finance reform, taking a \npage out of the book of the Senator from Texas, they suddenly say in \nthe middle of the Congress that they have changed their minds. I know \nwhy they have changed their minds. They have figured out how to run \nthis place similar to the House of Representatives, as my friend, \nSenator Reid, pointed out.\n  I served in the House of Representatives for 10 years. That place \nruns very differently from the Senate. They shut you down. They shut \ndown debate. How many times have you seen House Members try to deliver \na whole speech in 30 seconds or a minute? I know because I learned to \ndo it over there. The fact is that there are time constraints over \nthere. There are so many people over there. The Senate is a different \nplace.\n  Let me put it in a different way. This used to be a different place. \nI say to my friend--and then I will yield to him--when I was a little \ngirl, my father used to tell me, years before I would even dream that I \nwould even be in politics,\n\n[[Page S9181]]\n\nbecause in those days women were not in politics: Honey, I want you to \nwatch the U.S. Senate because that is where they really debate \neverything. The people who are there serve for 6 years. They are not \nafraid to take a tough stand, and they are not afraid of issues. They \nare willing to debate them; they are courageous; you hear all the \ndifferent views. It is the greatest deliberative body in the world.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the State of California has \nabout the seventh largest economy in the world. Is that true?\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Is it true that the Senator from California represents over \n30 million people?\n  Mrs. BOXER. About 33 million people.\n  Mr. REID. I come from the neighboring State of Nevada, which has \nabout 2 million people. We have a lot of things we would like to be \ntalking about. The Senator talked about environmental issues. Our \nStates share beautiful Lake Tahoe. There are environmental issues we \nneed to be talking about that would protect that beautiful gem we \nshare. We need to talk about minimum wage, fair wages, and the fact \nthat women who work comparable jobs should make the same amount of \nmoney as men. We need to talk about campaign finance reform. I am sure, \nrepresenting 33 million people, the Senator believes--and we came to \nthe House of Representatives together in 1982--that we in the Senate \nshould act and be treated as Senators, not as Members of the House of \nRepresentatives. There is nothing wrong with Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, but that is a large body and they need different rules \nthan we do; is that not true?\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is exactly right. We did serve together in the \nHouse of Representatives, and it was a thrill to be there for 10 years. \nBut there are differences between the two bodies. One of them certainly \nis the breadth and depth of the debate that goes on in the Senate as \ncompared to the House. It is a different institution.\n  I think it is, in fact, a sad time. What happens when a piece of \nauthorizing legislation comes before the Senate? We have the majority \nleader blocking our attempts to amend those pieces of legislation. My \nfriend is right.\n  When I ran for reelection in the Senate in 1998, there were many \ndifferences between my opponent and me. It was a very hotly contested \nrace. We talked about health care, campaign finance reform, protecting \nchildren from toxic waste; We talked about raising the minimum wage; We \ntalked about more teachers in the classrooms. We talked about fixing \nschool infrastructure because we have schools, I say to my friend, that \nare falling down because they are so old; We talked about the \nimportance of afterschool programs, preschool, cops on the beat, \nsensible gun laws, and ending violence at women's clinics. These were \nissues of great importance.\n  I told my constituents: Look, I don't know if we are going to win on \nall these issues because it could be that when I get back to the \nSenate, the other party will be in control and they are not for raising \nthe minimum wage; they are not for campaign finance reform; they are \nnot for afterschool programs, and a lot of these things. But I promise \nyou one thing: I am going to put up a fight. We are going to have those \ndebates.\n  So the point is, I say to my colleagues who may be listening today, \nit seems very strange that when a party is in control and they have a \ngood number more seats than we do, they should not be so insecure that \nthey don't even allow us to offer amendments to authorizing \nlegislation; now they have decided to shut us down on appropriations \nbills when they are the ones who fought for that right themselves.\n\n  This is not an arcane debate. This is a very important debate. I \nthink you have to put all of this in the context of how the minority \nparty has been treated. I love this institution. I agree that we \nshouldn't legislate on appropriations bills. But I say that with a \ncaveat--if we are treated fairly on all the other legislative vehicles; \nif we are allowed to offer amendments without having the majority fill \nup the so-called amendment tree and block us out; if we can have bills \nbrought to this floor.\n  The Senator from North Dakota brought up a very important point. \nBecause the majority leader wasn't ready to bring up the FAA \nreauthorization act, we did a 2-month extension. I wonder why. Can it \nbe that he doesn't want to bring a piece of authorizing legislation to \nthe floor because then he couldn't stop us that easily from bringing up \nour issues?\n  I don't know the answer to that. But I do know that I am going to \njoin with a vast majority of Democrats to fight for the kind of Senate \nmy dad talked to me about when I was a little girl, the kind of Senate \nwhere, regardless of political party, every single Senator has a right \nto bring an issue important to his or her State to the floor of this \nSenate. I think that is the least we could do.\n  I say to my distinguished whip, who does such a fine job in leading \nus on this side, that I really appreciate the fact that he is leading \nthis particular effort. I think the issue of rule XXVIII is important \nbecause if we are going to shut down our ability to amend bills on the \nfloor, we ought to shut down the ability of the majority to add \nanything they want in the conference that may not have passed either \nHouse. I don't know how that can be considered democratic.\n  Arcane though this debate might be, I say to the American people who \nmay be focusing in on this debate, it is very important to you. If you \nwant your Senator, regardless of party, to be able to come to the floor \nof the Senate and bring up issues that are important to you, then you \nought to work to make sure that this Senate is open and is fair.\n  Thank you very much. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished whip.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I assume we are having time to discuss the \nSenate resolution on rule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The majority has 168 \nminutes 18 seconds. The minority has 93 minutes 31 seconds.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I wanted to talk about this issue because I feel very strongly about \nit. I have not been able to hear everything this morning, but it seems \nwe have turned this into a little fairness technique which I have a \nlittle trouble understanding.\n  What we are talking about is whether or not you put authorizing \nlegislation on appropriations bills. It seems to have been turned into \nkind of a contest of who is being treated fairly. I don't quite \nunderstand that, frankly.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the House. I served in the House. \nThis is a different place. We have different rules--no question about \nthat. We should have, and we will continue to have different rules.\n  Since I have been here, I think this leader has been very fair in \noperating to give everyone a chance to speak, as should be the case. On \nthe other side of the coin, we haven't heard much about the fact that \nthese appropriations bills are amended with things that have nothing to \ndo with them, and we lose track of where we are going on these \nappropriations bills.\n  I think there is some responsibility on the part of the minority to \nfeel that we need to accomplish something in this place other than \nsimply introducing amendments that have nothing to do with the bill \nthat is being considered. As you can see, I feel fairly strongly about \nthat.\n  One of the things which I think is important is to separate the idea \nof authorizing committees from appropriations. That is why we have an \nEnergy Committee; that is why we have an Armed Services Committee; that \nis why we have an Agriculture Committee--to talk about the policy in \nthose particular areas, and to determine what the authorizations are \ngoing to be and what the role of Government is going to be. Then we \nfollow with the appropriations bills, which also, by the way, have a \ngreat deal of power because, obviously, you can't do a great deal in \nterms of policy unless there are some funds with which to do it.\n  But when you do it the other way, as the minority apparently is \nurging, then\n\n[[Page S9182]]\n\nyou avoid hearings and you avoid having any real discussion in \ncommittees on the issue. They apparently want to just come to the floor \nwith the issue having had no background at all. I am afraid I don't \nunderstand that. It seems to me to be a little naive to suggest that we \nhave rules of that type.\n  I wanted to talk a little bit about it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THOMAS. No. I will continue a little bit, and then I will be \nhappy to answer the question when I am finished.\n  I think we ought to emphasize this idea of authorizations. I was \nhappy to be on the appropriations committee when I was in the Wyoming \nState legislature. So I have had some experience with that.\n  The idea that you just simply ignore the authorizing committees and \nbegin to do everything on appropriations is wrong, absolutely wrong.\n\n  How we got here I am not sure. The minority whip has been here longer \nthan I and I suspect remembers when Democrats were in charge. But I \nthink maybe he has forgotten a little bit about the way it operated \nthen. As I understand it, when the Senator from Maine was in charge, it \noperated very much the same way. I am not suggesting that should be the \ncase, nor am I suggesting it is. It seems to me that there have been \nreal efforts to be as fair as we can be, and that should be. We need to \ndo that.\n  In addition to having the opportunity to put everything on the floor, \nwhich I agree with, there is also a responsibility on the part of all \nof us to accomplish some things.\n  My recollection is that during the last number of months amendments \nthat have come from the other side of the aisle have generally been to \nstop anything from happening. There are a good deal of examples of \nthat. Frankly, that is very frustrating for me--to bring up something \nand then the bill has to be withdrawn from the floor because we have \nlost completely the direction of things.\n  What is this debate about? It is very simple. It simply says that in \nthe precedence of the Senate, unless an amendment has to do with the \nsame subject as does the appropriations bill, it is not allowed on the \nbill. You can make a point of order. And there has to be a majority \nvote to follow it up. That is pretty simple. I think it is fairly \nreasonable. If you are going to come in through the appropriations bill \nand put an appropriations amendment on it, you can have a point of \norder, have a vote on it, and, if it isn't appropriate, it isn't used. \nI don't find much of a problem with that.\n  I think we ought to get to the topic and talk about what it is we are \ndoing rather than going through all of these gyrations of fairness, and \nso on, in terms of getting on the floor. If that is a problem, if that \nis a real problem, then we have to resolve that problem. This is not \nthe way to resolve that problem.\n  We have some things that we have to do. We have to accomplish things \nright now. What do we have, 13 appropriations bills with which we have \nto deal? I think we have dealt with about seven. There are a number of \nexamples of how nongermane issues have been raised and have been \nwithdrawn. We have to withdraw the topic from the appropriations bill.\n  What we are doing is seeking to overturn the ruling of the Chair with \nrespect to legislation on appropriations bills.\n  If the minority whip would like to make a comment, or ask a question, \nI would be more than happy to respond.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend yielding.\n  Rule XVI was changed by virtue of the majority voting to change it.\n  I ask my friend this question: The minority leader has filed an \namendment to change rule XXVIII. Rule XVI would say that there would be \nno legislation on appropriations bills. Rule XXVIII goes one step \nfurther and says: Fine. If we are not going to legislate on \nappropriations bills, then a conference committee should only be able \nto take up matters in the bill that they are conferencing and that has \nwithin it confined limits. Will the Senator comment on whether or not \nhe believes, if we are going to change rule XVI, we should also change \nrule XXVIII which would mean that a conference committee cannot do \nthings outside the scope of the two bills they are dealing with?\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. I can answer that very quickly. Yes, I agree with that. I \nthink it is the same concept as coming to the floor with an amendment \non an issue that has never been discussed, has never been authorized. \nTo do that in the conference committee, I believe, is equally wrong.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that very much. We had here the senior Senator \nfrom New York who went on at some length, as only he can do, using an \nexample of that huge bill last fall which the Senator and I came back \nto vote on--I came back from Nevada and he came back from Wyoming--that \nwe had not even seen. I think we would be hard-pressed to say we could \nlift it, much less to have read it. Yet a few people in the conference \ncommittee, together with the White House, drew this bill. If we were \nworking under the confines of rule XXVIII, that would not be possible. \nI appreciate very much the comments of the Senator from Wyoming, \nacknowledging that would also be a good idea.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I do think so. I do think it is the same concept there. \nWhat we want to avoid, in many ways, is putting more authority into \nthis Appropriations Committee. It is a very important committee. I \nrecognize that. But it ought not be the center of all of our activity, \nand it can be if we are not careful. So I think there is a balance in \nboth these areas. I support both the propositions that are here, and I \nhope we have some action that will put them into place.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield just for another comment, I serve \non the Appropriations Committee. I am very fortunate; I have been able \nto do that since I have been in the Senate. But, having said that, I \nthink we need to get a process where we are doing more legislating on \nauthorizing legislation than what we are doing. Almost all of our \nattention is now focused on the 13 appropriations bills, and we have \nkind of lost track of the fact that we should be legislators on things \nother than appropriations bills.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I have listened just a little bit to the Senator and his \nassociates, and I have the feeling you are not for changing the rules?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Wyoming, I think he is going to \nfind a protest vote, saying we want a more open debate. We are going to \nsupport the change in rule XXVIII, and we are confident rule XVI will \nbe changed if rule XXVIII were changed in addition to that. The \nminority leader is offering that as an amendment. I think it would be a \npretty good day for the country.\n  But the conversations today on this side of the aisle, I say to my \nfriend from Wyoming, have been to the effect we need to do more \nlegislating. An example of the lockbox has been used. That is a very \nimportant concept, that we should lock away enough money from the \nsurpluses to protect our Social Security system. But we would like to \ntalk about that a little bit. Not talk forever; no one wants to \nfilibuster that. That is something we believe in, too. But we may not \nbelieve in it exactly the way the majority has presented it to us. We \nhave had three cloture motions filed on that particular bill and we \nhave not been able to say a single word about it. That is what we are \ncomplaining about.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I understand that. I think it was five, but as a sponsor \nof the lockbox, I am very much for it. But in this instance it just \nseems to me that is what I am talking about, simply blocking it. There \nhas been much opportunity to talk about lockbox. You can talk about it \nwhenever you choose.\n\n  I guess the reason the Senator voted against cloture is because he \nwanted an opportunity to amend.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I do not think anyone could argue against the need for a \nfair process. But I think to talk about all those things with respect \nto rule XVI is inappropriate. I think we very much need this. I urge \nthe Senator's support.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent a quorum call be initiated and the \ntime be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9183]]\n\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I see in the Chamber the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, Jay Rockefeller. I yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer, as well as I thank my \nesteemed friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, I came a bit earlier than was anticipated. I look \nforward to expressing what are some strongly held views on my part.\n  In a formal sense, I rise today to object to the reinstatement of \nSenate rule XVI. That is my purpose in being here. Up until 1995, it \nprohibited legislating on appropriations bills. That is the reason I \nformally rise.\n  The Republican majority, in fact, is responsible for overturning the \nrule which was designed to keep legislative matters unrelated to \nappropriations bills from bogging down the appropriations process. The \nRepublicans themselves were responsible for overturning the \nlongstanding Senate precedent by rejecting the ruling of the Chair, \nsomething that was given little notice and was little commented upon \nbut is now of increasing monumental proportions.\n  I cannot support returning to the previous order because I respect \nthe Senate. It seems to me anybody who has a sense of what the Senate \nwas designed for and what the Senate is, what the Senate should be, \nwhat the American people expect the Senate to be, will vote as I will \nvote because to do otherwise is to diminish this body, which I think \nhas been diminished substantially in the last 5 or 6 years in any \nevent, in terms of its impact on American debate, its impact on \ndiscussion, its impact on the intellectual activity of the Senate, and, \nin fact, its impact on American society as a whole.\n  I happen to represent steelworkers, farmers, airport managers, \nveterans, rural people, patients, doctors, nurses, just as the \nPresiding Officer does. This Senator may have a few more steelworkers \nin his State than the Senator from Kansas does in his State; otherwise, \nwe represent more or less the same people. I do not think these people \nought to have their business pushed aside, their concerns, their \nworries, what they care about pushed aside in order to make the \nSenate's bill or the Senate's way of working more manageable, more \nefficient, more to the liking of the leadership, more House-like, more \nlimiting, less substantial, less interesting, less of scope, less of \ndignity, less of the power of the tradition of the Senate.\n\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I believe the majority is interested in controlling \ndebate. I have wanted to say this a long time, and I have not found the \nplace to do it properly, but I find so today. I believe the majority--\nnot the Presiding Officer who has changed since I began my remarks, who \nis an entirely different kind of person--the people who run the \nmajority, who speak for the majority, who lead the Senate on behalf of \nthe majority, are interested in controlling debate, minimizing debate \nin making the Senate more like the House from whence they came and in \ntrivializing the Senate. Those are harsh words, but they come from a \ndisturbed and unhappy Senator--not disturbed in a psychological sense, \nI point out to the Presiding Officer, but disturbed in the sense of not \nfeeling good about the work I am able to do as opposed to the way it \nused to be a number of years ago when I first came to the Senate.\n  I wish I could tell my colleagues I believe the Senate is functioning \nin a way that means legislative business can occur on authorizing \nlegislation, but I cannot. I wish the Senate would return to a more \nefficient appropriations process that does not deal with extraneous \nlegislative matters, but under the Senate's current leadership, Members \nof the majority party have effectively gagged--there is no other word \nfor it--the minority from raising policy matters on the Senate floor.\n  Every Tuesday, members of both parties have caucuses. Those caucuses, \nin the case of the Democrats, used to deal broadly with issues and with \nfunctions and divisions of responsibility and debate within the \ncaucus. Now, for the most part, they are taken up with, how can we make \nourselves heard? How is it that we can, by some manipulation or clever \nmethod, try to work our way through a loophole which allows us to bring \nup an amendment, to speak on behalf of our constituencies?\n\n  In every single caucus there is a question of how the majority is \ndiminishing the minority, not in a way which would just be satisfying \nin the sense of a Republican making a Democrat feel less important or \nmaking a Democrat's role less important in the Senate, but in the sense \nof diminishing honest and open and real debate.\n  That is what I came to the Senate for in 1985--honest and real \ndebate. I did not expect to win everything. I did not expect to lose \neverything. But I did expect to be able to debate, to be able to make \nmy views known, as one can in a committee. All committees are run \nrelatively fairly. The Finance Committee, the Commerce Committee, which \nI sit on, are run fairly by their majority leadership. This place is \nnot; the floor of the Senate is not. We are gagged, as in the Patients' \nBill of Rights doctors were gagged. We are not allowed to express our \nviews.\n  I resent that enormously, I say to the Presiding Officer. It takes a \nlot away from being a Senator. I know no longer the greatness of the \ndifference between being a Member of the House and being a Member of \nthe Senate. There is, of course, a difference. I stand here and speak, \nand I speak as I choose to speak, and nobody is stopping me, but that \nis because we have this arrangement for this day. For most of the rest \nof the time, morning business has been closed off--or had been--quorum \ncalls were not honored, to be able to interrupt them, as this one was \nhonored. It is a different body. It is a distressing situation. All of \nus, on both sides, all 100 of us, are diminished by the way this Senate \nis run.\n  Let me give an example of a piece of legislation, and it is not even \nthe first one on the minds of most, but it is a big one in terms of \nthis Senator: This legislative body's failure with respect to the FAA \nand the airport improvement reauthorization bill, which is, for the \nfourth time in less than a year, on the brink of expiring.\n  Last fall we threw a 6-month extension into the omnibus \nappropriations bill. When that expired on March 31, we did a 2-month \nextension--embarrassing--until May 31; then a 65-day extension--\nembarrassing--through August 6. And now we are close to August 6, and \nwe may have to--and probably will--have to do yet another extension. \nAll of these short-term extensions may make us feel better temporarily, \nbut they are not solutions. They do not obviate the need to take up and \ndebate and pass an authorization bill.\n  But we cannot debate it. We cannot debate anything on this floor \nexcept what it is the majority wants to debate. Then they fill up every \ntree, preclude every amendment, and we are all diminished, and the \npublic process is diminished at the same time.\n  So in the current Senate environment, which I deplore, regret--I like \nthe people who lead the Senate on the majority side, but I do not \nrespect the way they lead this Senate. I think all of us suffer from \nthe way they lead this Senate; that is, to make the Senate more like \nthe House--puppets.\n  So in this current Senate environment, I am not willing to give up a \nsingle avenue for getting my work done. I will not support giving the \nmajority one more way to cut off debate on important policy issues--\nsuch as aviation or the future of our Nation's steel industry, \nrestoring money to Medicare providers who have been too deeply cut. We \nhear more about this than any other subject when we go home. Have we \ndiscussed it? No. Research and development, lots and lots of other \nthings.\n  So the arcane rules of the Senate may not be at the forefront of the \nconcerns of everyday Americans, but the rules of this Senate guide the \nway our democracy works or fails to work. They guide the way the people \ntrust their Government, and they also guide the way people within the \nGovernment trust the Government within the framework of which they work \nas best as they can.\n  The legislative process is honorable. It is time honored. I fear that \nwe are\n\n[[Page S9184]]\n\ndangerously close to the Senate losing its reputation and role as a \ngreat deliberative body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I recognize my time is up. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport me in objecting to the reinstatement of Senate rule XVI.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia, through the Chair, \nhow much I appreciate him being here today. The people of West Virginia \nare very fortunate to have Senators Byrd and Rockefeller representing \ntheir interests. I appreciate the Senator's statement today very \nmuch. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, Chris Dodd.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Nevada. And I \nthank my colleagues who have spoken on this issue this morning, an \nissue that may seem to the general public as sort of an arcane debate \ninvolving the internal machinations of this body. But in my brief \nremarks this afternoon, I would like to suggest that this debate may be \none of the most significant ones we have in this Congress because it is \nthe process and the procedures which determine the ability of a \nminority in this body to be heard.\n  If that ability is constrained, is gagged, is muffled, then the \npublic is denied the opportunity which the Senate, as a forum, has \nhistorically provided to the citizenry of this Nation, and that is a \nfull airing of the issues that they should hear, that they should be \naware of, as we deliberate the matters which will affect their lives \nand the lives of their families for years and decades to come.\n  So while a procedural debate may sound boring to some and may not \nsound as if it is of terribly great import to others, this is, in \ntruth, a significant debate and discussion. Therefore, I add my voice \nto those who have raised concerns about a vote that will occur later \nthis afternoon dealing with rule XVI of the Senate.\n  I am in somewhat of a unique position. I am standing next to my dear \nfriend and colleague from West Virginia, who is recognized by all in \nthis Chamber, regardless of party, and those who have come before us, \nas one of the truly great historians of the Senate, arguably the most \nknowledgeable person who has served in this body in its 210-year \nhistory when it comes to the role of the Senate both in terms of our \nown history as well as the role of senates throughout recorded history.\n  I am also in a unique position in that I am the inheritor of the seat \nonce held by a distinguished Senator from Connecticut by the name of \nRoger Sherman. Roger Sherman, among other things, was the only Founding \nFather, as they are referred to, to have signed the four cornerstone \ndocuments, as we call them, of our Nation. He signed the Declaration of \nIndependence, the Articles of Confederation, the Constitution of the \nUnited States, and the Bill of Rights.\n  He was from New Haven, CT. I sit in his seat in the Senate, as you \ntrack a Senate seat from those who first represented the Thirteen \nOriginal Colonies in the Senate to the modern Senate of today. But \nmaybe more importantly than his signature on those four cornerstone \ndocuments, he was the author of what was called the Connecticut \nCompromise. The Connecticut Compromise produced the Senate of the \nUnited States as a body.\n  There was a crisis, politically, at the time of the debate in the \nconstitutional convention between large States and small States about \nwhere power would reside. Roger Sherman, along with others, proposed \nthe Connecticut compromise, which gave birth to the Senate as a place \nwhere small States would be equally represented by the participation of \ntwo Senators from each State regardless of the size of the State.\n  But more importantly than that debate, it was also designed to be a \nforum wherein the rights of a minority could be heard. The rules of the \nHouse of Representatives--I served in that body for 6 years--were and \nare specifically designed to guarantee the rights of the majority. \nMajority opinion prevails in the House, and that is how it should be. \nWe had come off a system ruled by one individual, a king. We wanted to \nestablish a system of government where the majority opinion of the \nAmerican people could be heard and their voices could result in \nopinions being rendered and decisions being made which reflected those \nmajority feelings.\n  But the Founding Fathers and those who supported them in their wisdom \nunderstood there could be a tyranny of the majority, that quick \ndecisions made rapidly without a great deal of thought or consideration \ncould in some instances do more harm than good. So the Senate was \ncreated as a balance, as a counterweight, in many ways.\n  The Senate was designed to be a place where those majority decisions, \nas important as they are, would then have to be brought for further \nconsideration in this Chamber where additional consideration and \nthought would be offered, where the views of those who may not have \nbeen heard in the House of Representatives could be heard, where the \nrights of a minority, including a minority of one Senator, would \nabsolutely be guaranteed the right to be heard, as long as that Senator \ncould stand on his or her feet and express their opinions--the \nfilibuster rule which protects the right of one of us out of 100. \nNinety-nine people cannot stop one Senator from speaking, once that \nSenator has gained recognition from the Presiding Officer. It is a \nunique set of rules, completely contrary to the rules of the House, \nwhere one Member of the House cannot command the attention of the \nentire Chamber, or that person is limited to 5 minutes in talking and \nmust get unanimous consent to speak for a 6th minute. In the Senate, \nthat is not the case. As long as you can stand and be heard, no one can \ninterrupt you or break the flow of debate.\n  There are many other distinctions which make the Senate unique and \nspecial, but that is certainly one of them.\n  This afternoon we are going to debate and vote on a rule which also \ngoes to the very heart of whether or not the Senate is going to \nmaintain its unique and distinct role as being sort of the antithesis, \nif you will, the counterweight, as was described by Thomas Jefferson \nwhen he argued against the creation of the Senate, that this would be \nthe saucer in which the coffee or the tea would cool, where \ntemperatures could be lowered, the heat of debate would be softened, \nconsideration and thought would be given to the decisions that the \nmajority had made in the other Chamber.\n  I come to this issue with a sense of history about Roger Sherman, in \nwhose seat I sit, who authored the creation of the Senate with the \nConnecticut compromise, with a deep sense of appreciation for the role \nof the House, having served there, and also a very strong sense of the \nrole that the Senate should play and why this debate on rule XVI is \nmore than just an internal discussion, a debate among Senators that has \nlittle or no impact on the daily lives of the people we seek to \nrepresent.\n\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee, I yield to no \none except, as I mentioned earlier, the senior Senator from West \nVirginia, in my respect for the standing rules of the Senate, as \nintended by the Founding Fathers. The Senate is respected as the most \ndeliberative body in the world. The rules, as I have suggested, of the \nSenate assure that such deliberation can occur, must occur, and that \nthe rights of a minority will always be protected.\n  We are all familiar with the story of the conversation I mentioned a \nmoment ago between Thomas Jefferson and George Washington in which \nThomas Jefferson questioned the need for the United States Senate. \nWashington reportedly responded to Thomas Jefferson, as Jefferson was \npouring his tea into a saucer to cool it during the informal discussion \nthey were having, so legislation would be poured into the senatorial \nsaucer to cool it, Washington suggested to Jefferson, and thus the \nvalue of the Senate.\n  Similarly, as reported by our own historian, Dick Baker, James \nMadison, writing to Thomas Jefferson, explained the Founding Fathers' \nvision of the Senate. Madison reminded Thomas Jefferson that the Senate \nwas intended to be the ``anchor'' of the government. According to \nMadison, the Senate was ``a necessary fence against the fickleness and \npassion that tended to influence the attitudes of the general public\n\n[[Page S9185]]\n\nand Members of the House of Representatives.''\n  Within the first month of its convening, on March 4, 1789, this \nanchor, the Senate, recognized that to function efficiently rules were \ngoing to be required. Almost from the beginning there was a recognition \nof the need to separate the authorizing and appropriating functions of \nthe Senate, the very matter with which rule XVI is concerned.\n  The first Senate rules were adopted on April 16, 1789, and the Senate \nadopted general revisions to those rules seven times over the 210-year \nhistory of our Nation, including revisions in 1806, 1820, 1828, 1868, \n1877, 1884 and 1979. Although the current language of rule XVI did not \nappear until the 1979 revisions, the prohibition on adding general \nlegislation to an appropriations bill had its roots in rule XXX of the \n1868 revisions adopted in the 48th Congress. The 1868 general revisions \nwere the ones last proposed by the special committee prior to the \nestablishment of the Rules Committee as a standing committee in 1874.\n  I ask for an additional 5 minutes, if I may.\n  Mr. REID. Three minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \nan additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my distinguished colleague from Nevada.\n  The 1877 general revisions expanded the 1868 rules to specifically \nprohibit amending general appropriations bills with general \nlegislation, or with amendments not germane or relevant to the subject \nmatter of the bill.\n  The next set of general revisions to the rules was adopted by the \nSenate during the 48th Congress, on January 11, 1884. These revisions \nrenumbered the rules and consolidated the language regarding amendments \nto appropriations bills. The prohibition on including amendments to an \nappropriations bill dealing with general legislation as incorporated \ninto Rule XVI.\n  Then in 1979, under the leadership of our colleague, Senator Byrd, a \ncomprehensive revision of the standing rules of the Senate was adopted. \nThese revisions contained the current language of rule XVI and rule \nXVIII, regarding the scope of conference reports.\n  I do not wish to belabor the history of the Senate rules with my \ncolleagues, but I take this time to stress the historic importance of \nrule XVI in order to put the action of the majority leader in context.\n  The prohibition on legislating on appropriations bills has been part \nof the parliamentary fabric of this great deliberative body almost \nsince its inception. And that should come as no surprise. The orderly \nconsideration of legislation is paramount to the ``cooling'' effect of \nthe Senate's deliberations.\n  For that reason, under normal circumstances, I would support the \nmajority leader in his effort to restore the rule XVI point of order \nagainst legislating on appropriations bills. Under normal \ncircumstances, I would agree that the rules offer Senators ample \nopportunity to engage in debate on legislation. Under normal \ncircumstances, I would agree that appropriations bills are too \nimportant to be the subject of legislative amendments, especially given \nthe need to keep the Federal Government running.\n  But these are not normal circumstances, Mr. President.\n  What brings us to this debate, again, has nothing to do with the \nlongstanding notion that legislation ought not to be included on \nappropriations bills. I don't know of anyone who disagrees with that \nlongstanding proposal. If taken alone, everything else being equal, if \nall the other rules which guarantee the right of this body to function, \nas intended by the Founding Fathers, then I would stand first and \nforemost in a long line, I presume, of my colleagues in demanding that \nrule XVI be upheld and that legislation be kept off appropriations \nbills. Unfortunately, you cannot look at rule XVI alone today. We have \nwatched slowly, some would argue rapidly, over the last several years \nhow the rules of the Senate, such as rule XVIII, have been so \nfundamentally altered that today this body de facto functions as a 99-\n100 Member reflection, not the antithesis, not the corollary, not the \ncounterweight, but as a reflection of the House of Representatives. \nThat is not as it should be. This body ought to function very \ndifferently.\n  In the four and one-half years since the Republicans regained the \nmajority in this Chamber, we have witnessed a profound and regrettable \nchange in the way we do business. Instead of allowing legislation to \ncome to the floor for amendment and debate, the majority has seemingly \nused every opportunity to limit the minority's right to offer \namendments and be heard.\n  It is this attempt to silence opposing views that poses the greatest \nthreat to the Founding Fathers' vision of the Senate as an anchor for \nour democratic form of Government.\n  For example, the majority has repeatedly employed the tactic of \ncombining a motion to proceed to a bill with the immediate filing of a \ncloture petition--which, by definition, is designed to limit debate. \nThe cloture petition is then used as leverage to obtain a limit on the \nnumber of amendments and the allotted time for debate on the bill. In \nsome cases, the majority has even insisted on approving, in advance, \nthe very few amendments that the minority has been allowed to offer.\n  My colleagues might be surprised to learn that from 1996 to the \npresent, the majority has tried to silence the debate by forcing the \nSenate to vote on 102 cloture petitions. But what is even more \nremarkable is that 33 of these votes--or nearly one in three--involved \ncloture petitions on motions to proceed.\n  While the majority are certainly within their rights and consistent \nwith the rules to offer so many cloture petitions, it is not the norm. \nIn fact, during the 4 years immediately preceding the 1994 elections, \nthe Democratic leadership also availed itself of the procedural tactic \nof filing cloture on a motion to proceed--twice, on the motor voter \nbill. In general, Mr. President, cloture petitions on motions to \nproceed have been used by this majority to attempt to dictate the terms \nof debate. It is almost as if the majority does not want the American \npeople to hear this deliberative body speak.\n  But cloture petitions are not the only silencing tactic employed by \nour friends in the majority. They also rely on the arcane parliamentary \nmaneuver known as ``filling the amendment tree.''\n  Mr. President, I am willing to bet that only a handful of people in \nthe world--most of whom are present in this chamber today--could \nprovide a clear explanation of how one ``fills the tree.'' But the \neffect of such a parliamentary maneuver is clear. It is to choke off \ndebate by making it impossible for any member to offer amendments that \nhave not been approved by the senator who has filled the tree.\n  A review of the use of this tactic reveals that since 1995, the \nmajority has ``filled the tree'', and thereby restricted debate, a \ntotal of 9 times. Most recently, this maneuver was used during the \ndebate on the social security lockbox legislation and most notably on \nlegislation to reform our system of campaign finance, where the tactic \nhas been used repeatedly and with great effect to stymie the growing \ncalls for reform.\n  Again, a comparison of the 4 years of Democratic leadership prior to \nthe 1994 elections reveals that Senate Democrats used the parliamentary \nprocedure sparingly--at most once. And the sponsor of the amendment at \nthe time denied that the amendment tree had been filled.\n  Regrettably, Mr. President, since our friends in the Republican \nmajority took office in 1994, there has been unprecedented use of \nparliamentary maneuvering to choke off debate and dictate the terms of \nthe Senate's business. Under Republican leadership, the rules of the \nSenate no longer ensure the cooling off that was intended to take place \nhere. Instead, the rules have become the majority's weapon to prevent \nthe very deliberation, and even disagreement, that the Founding Fathers \nintended.\n  As we have seen time and again over the last 4 years, the most \neffective means for the minority to ensure that its voice is heard is \nby offering amendments for debate to must-pass legislation, such as the \nappropriations bills. Whether it be debate on raising the minimum wage \nfor working Americans, or protecting taxpayers from arbitrary decisions \nby HMOs, the ability to amend appropriations bills has ensured\n\n[[Page S9186]]\n\nthat the people's concerns can be heard.\n  If the Senate could return to the normal open and deliberative \nprocess that the founding fathers envisioned for it, I would welcome \nthe reinstatement of rule XVI. But until that time comes, I must oppose \nthe majority's efforts.\n  But if we are going to reform the rules, we should not stop with rule \nXVI. We should also restore rule XVIII to its original intent. Rule \nXVIII establishes a point of order against conference reports which \ncontain provisions outside the scope of the conference. Again, under \nthis majority, rule XVIII has been overturned so that today, conferees \nmay insert any matter into privileged conference reports, even neither \nthe Senate nor the House has debated the issue.\n  To deny Members the opportunity to be heard, to allow for a \nconference report to include extraneous matter never considered by \neither body, particularly when both Chambers are controlled by one \nparty, to rush to cloture petitions with the incredible acceleration \nthat the majority has authored over the last 4 or so years, undermines \nthe role of this institution. One hundred of us serve in the Senate, \nhave an obligation to represent our constituents, have an obligation to \ndo the Nation's business. We also bear a collective responsibility, as \ntemporary custodians of this valued institution, to see to it that its \nhistorical role will not be undermined, will not be changed by the \nprecedents we establish in the conduct of our business.\n  Over the last 4 or so years, regretfully, the majority in this \nChamber has so warped the rules of the Senate that the minority is \ndenied the opportunity to raise critical issues the American public \nwants us to debate and on which they want to have our voices heard.\n\n  Without rule XVI, as presently enforced under the 1995 precedent, \nwhich allows us to raise the issues that we are denied to bring up \nunder normal circumstances, and without rule XXVIII which prohibits \nmatters which have not been publicly aired from being included in \nconference reports, it is not just a matter that I am denied the \nopportunity to be heard, it is that my constituents and the American \npublic are denied an opportunity to be heard. We are their voices here.\n  So, for these reasons I will support the Democratic leader in his \nefforts to restore rule XXVIII to prohibit the majority from adding \nprovisions in conference that have not been considered by either the \nHouse or the Senate. It flies in the face of common fairness to shut \nout the minority's opportunity to be heard on appropriations bills, but \nthen allow the majority to have unlimited scope to add any provision to \na privileged conference report.\n  I would urge my colleagues in the majority to think carefully before \nopposing Senator Daschle's amendment. When both the House and the \nSenate are in the hands of the same party, it is tempting to ignore \nrule XXVIII and use highly privileged conference reports to pass \nlegislation that the minority in the Senate might otherwise attempt to \nstall by use of the Senate's rules.\n  But such a short-term view can come back to haunt a majority if the \nleadership changes in one of the houses of Congress. The tactic the \nmajority uses today to shut out dissent and debate and force through \nlegislation can just as easily be turned against it tomorrow by an \nopposing party.\n  In the end, rule XXVIII maintains the balance between the House and \nthe Senate. The rule ensures that neither House, regardless of party, \nhas so great a leverage over the other that it can force legislation \nthrough without debate.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to make it perfectly clear that \nDemocrats are not asking for the right to control the Senate. The \nvoters determine who is the majority. But as the majority, the \nRepublican leadership knows that on any issue it can summon the votes \nto thwart a minority victory. Nonetheless, the constitution provides \nfor a body that is intended to engage in full and open debate.\n  I urge my colleagues to restore the Senate to its place as the \ndeliberative anchor of Government by supporting the Daschle amendment \nand opposing the restoration of rule XVI at this time. And I urge the \nmajority, on behalf of history, to modify their behavior in the Senate \nand allow this institution to function as its creators and founders \nintended.\n  I thank my colleague from Nevada for the time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the ranking \nmember of the Rules Committee, Senator Dodd.\n  At this time, I yield 25 minutes to the former President pro tempore \nof the Senate, former chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and \nformer majority leader, Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  We have just witnessed what is wrong with this Senate. I have been \nyielded 25 minutes. We don't have time today to properly discuss one of \nthe most fundamental questions that ever comes before this Senate: \nfundamental freedom of speech; freedom of debate; freedom to offer \namendments.\n  I am limited to 25 minutes. Yes, I agreed to this 6-hour rule, but \nyou can see how it is playing out. Most of the 3 hours allotted to the \nminority are being played out over here. Nobody is talking on the other \nside. Perhaps one, two, or three Senators will. I think the \ndistinguished Senator who now presides over the Senate made some \nremarks earlier. But the point of it is, the minority will have said \nabout all it has time to say under this agreement, and then its time \nwill have run out. As a consequence, the majority will be able to speak \nduring the latter hours or moments, and there won't be much time for \nreal debate.\n  Mr. President, I am in my 41st year in this body. I was in the other \nbody for 6 years. I saw the actions of the other body. When I came to \nthe Senate, I wanted to come to the Senate. I wanted to come to a forum \nin which one could speak as long as his feet would hold him, as long as \nhe could stand, and the floor could not be taken away from him by the \nChair, a majority leader, or anybody else. He could speak for as long \nas he wished.\n  For all these years, I have talked about this institution, about its \nimportance in the constitutional system, about the fact that it is the \nonly forum of the States, the only forum in this Government, where \nsmall States such as West Virginia have the same powers, the same \nprerogatives, the same rights, along with the same responsibilities as \nthe States that are great in territory and in population, such as \nCalifornia, Texas, Florida, New York, and others. I wanted to be in \nthis forum. William Ewart Gladstone referred to the Senate of the \nUnited States, as ``that remarkable body, the most remarkable of all \nthe inventions of modern politics.''\n  But it is getting to where this Senate is not so remarkable. There \nare things unique about the Senate that were meant to be unique, that \nwere made unique by virtue of the framers of the Constitution. Among \nthose, of course, is the responsibility to approve the resolutions of \nratification of treaties, to approve nominations, and to act as a court \nin the trial of impeachments. But aside from those several unique \nthings, the two things in particular that make this body the most \nunique of any upper body in the world, the most unique Senate that has \never existed--and there have been many senates--is the fact that this \nSenate has the right to amend bills, and Senators have the right to \nspeak and to debate at length.\n  The right to debate and the right to amend: The right to amend is \nmentioned in that provision of the Constitution that says revenue bills \nshall originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate shall \nhave the right to amend as in all other bills. So there it is. The \nSenate has the right to amend, and Senators have the right to debate at \nlength.\n  Now, I have been majority leader. I have been elected to the majority \nleadership three times--twice during the Carter years and once during \nthe 100th Congress. When I came to the Senate, Lyndon Johnson was \nmajority leader; then there was Mike Mansfield; I was the next majority \nleader; Howard Baker then became majority leader followed by Bob Dole, \nand then, in the 100th Congress, I was majority leader again, George \nMitchell followed me as majority leader and then Bob Dole became the \nMajority Leader a second time. Mr. Lott is now the majority\n\n[[Page S9187]]\n\nleader. So I have seen several majority leaders operate in this Senate.\n  Mr. President, I think the Senate is losing its uniqueness in that we \nare being deprived, in considerable measure, of the right to debate, \nthe right to debate at length. If I come up here and want a few minutes \nto speak about the departing of some deceased friend, or some other \nmatter--it may not be one of the great moments in history--I can't come \nup here and speak as I used to be able to. I can't get the floor. And \nwhen I get the floor, I am limited. I don't like that.\n\n  I can understand the importance of having time limitations, and we do \nenter into time limitations. We have always done that, when there is a \nunanimous consent agreement limiting time, or the Senate is operating \nunder a cloture motion. Otherwise, there is no limitation on debate and \nthere is no germaneness of amendments under the Senate rules, except \nunder rule XVI, when appropriation matters are before the Senate and \nalso when cloture is invoked. Otherwise, we have freedom of debate.\n  Woodrow Wilson said that the information function of the legislative \nbranch is as important as the legislative function. It is through \ndebate that we inform the American people. It is through debate that we \nbetter inform ourselves.\n  I was in a meeting with the British over the weekend, the British-\nAmerican Group. We met in West Virginia at the Greenbrier. Senator Reid \nwas there. Senators on both sides of the aisle were there, including \nthe Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici. We didn't win or lose. We \neach came away being better informed by the other side. We didn't agree \nwith the British point of view on certain issues and they didn't agree \nwith ours, but we all came away better informed. We had a better \nunderstanding of what their viewpoint was and the reasons for it, and, \nhopefully, they have a better viewpoint of our reasoning.\n  But here in the Senate, it has become dog-eat-dog. It has become very \npartisan--very partisan. Politics is very important, and political \nparty is important. But some things are more important than political \nparty. One of those things is the right to debate and the right to \namend. It isn't for the benefit of the Democratic Party that I want the \nright to amend. It is not for the benefit of the Democratic Party that \nI want the right to debate. It is for the benefit of the American \npeople. That is why the Senate is here. There were no political parties \nwhen this Senate was first created. But it seems that, anymore, the \nidea is that the majority is always to have its way while the minority \nis to be shut out and, in some ways, gagged.\n  That approach does not benefit the people of America.\n  I say these things with misgivings because I have many friends on the \nother side of the aisle. I think that the Senators in the leadership on \nthat side of the aisle are friends of mine. But we are talking about \nthe Senate here today and not the party. I don't come to the Senate \nfloor today emphasizing party. I am here today because I am seeing the \nright of the minority to engage in free debate and to offer amendments \nshut off in some instances.\n  There is a complaint here that too many amendments are offered on \nthis side of the aisle to bills. This side of the aisle, as does that \nside of the aisle, has a right to offer whatever amendments they wish \nto offer.\n  When I was majority leader, I never said to the minority leader: Now, \nyou are going to be limited. You have too many amendments. We are not \ngoing to take the bill up; or, we will let you have 5 amendments, or no \nmore than 10. What are your amendments? I never said that.\n  I said to Members on both sides of the aisle: Let us know what your \namendments are. Let the people at the front table here know what your \namendments are on both sides. Call the Cloakrooms. Let's find out what \namendments there are yet outstanding. There might have been 40. There \nmight have been 55. There might have been 75. But I didn't go back and \nsay: We are going to pull this bill down if you do not cut your \namendments down to 10. Never did I say that. Never did I say you can \nonly call up five, or so, amendments. How many do you have? Then we got \nthe list. Then I said: Now, let's try to get a unanimous consent to \nlimit the amendments to this number--whatever it was, be it 50 or 60 or \nwhatever. Let's try to get an agreement to limit the amendments to this \nlist.\n\n  So when we put that word out, other amendments came out of the wall--\nanother half a dozen and another dozen. They just kept coming.\n  But finally we had a list of amendments. We agreed that those then \nwould be all. Then we would go to the individual Members on the list \nand say: Are you willing to enter into a time agreement on your \namendment?\n  Sometimes some of the amendments would peel off and we wouldn't end \nup with all that many amendments, or Members would be agreeable to a \ntime limit. But never did I attempt to muzzle the minority.\n  I took the position, let the minority call up their amendments. We \ncan move to table them. Or, in many instances, they insisted on an up-\nor-down vote, and we gave them an up-or-down vote. We could defeat the \namendment, in many instances. But in some instances their amendments \ncarried, which was all right. That is what the legislative process is \nall about.\n  The majority is not always right as we have often seen throughout the \ncourse of history. Many times the minority throughout history has been \nright. We are not serving the good interests of the American people \nwhen we muzzle the ox.\n  The Bible says: ``Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the \ncorn.'' The Senate is the ox. It is the central pillar of this \nRepublic. This isn't a democracy; it is a Republic. The Senate is the \ncentral pillar. The Senate is where we can debate at length and offer \namendments.\n  As long as there is a Senate and men and women can debate to their \nhearts' content and offer amendments, the people's liberties will be \nsecure. But once the Senate is muzzled, the people's liberties are in \ndanger.\n  The majority is virtually all powerful here. They have the votes, \nwhich is all right, but they must recognize that the minority has \nrights. That is why the Senate is like it is. That is what it was meant \nto be--a bastion for protection of the minority.\n  Many times when I was leader I insisted on the rights of the minority \non that side of the aisle. I said that there may come a time when we \nDemocrats would be in the minority. I say that to the majority today. \nYou have been in the minority. There may come a time when you will \nagain be in the minority.\n  We must be respectful of the constitutional rights of Senators who \nrepresent the States and the people. We must be respectful of those \nrights. If it takes longer--if it takes longer than three days or a \nweek to do the work--then let's do the work. That is why we are sent \nhere.\n  But we should not forget the reason for the Senate's being. I came \nfrom the House of Representatives. I never wanted this body to become \nanother House of Representatives. The Senate is unique in that respect, \nand we must not give away the uniqueness of this body. This is not a \nsecond House of Representatives. We ought to understand that. The \nConstitution made the Senate different from the other body, and we \nought to do our utmost to keep this as an institution where debate is \nunlimited and where Senators have the right to offer non-germane \namendments.\n  I don't enter into these bickerings and these discussions very often. \nI am no longer in the elected leadership. Senators do not hear me \nsaying these things often. But I have always been interested in the \nSenate as an institution. If the Senate is not the institution that it \nwas meant to be, whose fault is it? The people who make up the Senate--\nit is our fault.\n  I wanted to speak out on this. I am not interested in who wins on \nevery political battle that is fought here. I am not interested from a \nparty standpoint always. Party isn't all that important to me. But I am \ninterested in the Senate. I want it to remain the institution that it \nwas meant to be.\n  I wish we would get away from the idea that we ought to make this a \nmore efficient institution. The Senate was not meant to be efficient. \nThe institution was meant to be a debating forum where ideas would be \nexpressed, and through the medium of debate the right consensus would \nbe hammered out on the anvil.\n\n[[Page S9188]]\n\n  I hear it said: Well, if there are too many amendments, the bill will \nbe taken down. I would suggest that if we want to stop so many \nlegislative amendments from being offered to appropriations bills, then \nlet's call up some of the legislative bills. Let's call up \nauthorization bills.\n  When I was the majority leader, there were times we had to authorize \nlegislation on appropriations bills because the authorizing committees \nsometimes did not do their work. For example, there were years when we \nhad to reauthorize State Department legislation on appropriations \nbills, because the authorizing committee simply did not do its work. \nBut if bills reported from legislative committees are not called up in \nthe Senate, Senators who are interested in amendments to such \nlegislation do not have the opportunity to offer their amendments. \nConsequently, when appropriations bills are called up, Senators will \noffer legislation on appropriations bills, because it is their only \nopportunity. They have no other opportunity, no other legislative \nvehicle on which to call their amendments up, so they are forced to \noffer their legislative amendments to appropriations bills. That is why \nwe have the problem with appropriations bills that we are having.\n\n  Another problem we are having when we go to conference with the other \nbody is that major legislation that has not been before either body is \nadded in conference. We talk about the upper House and the lower House. \nThere is a Third House. The conference committee has become a Third \nHouse, where hundreds of millions of dollars, even billions of dollars \nand major legislation are added in conference and come back to each \nbody in a conference report. We have no opportunity to amend that \nconference report. Authorizing measures are added in conference that \nhave not been before either body. They are stuck in, in conference--in \nthe ``Third House,'' as I want to name it.\n  Another flaw in that operation is that it gives the executive branch \ntoo much power, in some instances all power, because, as we saw last \nyear when it got down to the conferences on the final appropriations \nbills, eight appropriations bills were wrapped into the conference \nreport, one I believe a supplemental, and tax legislation all in that \nconference report. These items had not been properly taken up before \neither body.\n  And, as a result, who sat in? Who made the decisions in conference? \nThe decisions in conference for the more important legislation were \nmade by the Speaker of the House, the majority leader of the Senate--\nboth of whom were Republican--and the President's agents.\n  Who represented the Democrats in the conference? The executive \nbranch. We Senate and House Democrats weren't represented in those \nhigher echelons. We were left out. The Democratic minority in the House \nand Senate was not represented in the conference. It was the Republican \nleadership of both Houses and the President of the United States, \nthrough his OMB Director.\n  That is not the way it is supposed to be. That galls me, to think \nthat in appropriations matters of that kind the executive branch calls \nthe shots in many instances and we House and Senate Democrats are not \neven represented. The Democrats in the Senate, the Democrats in the \nHouse, are left out. That is not the way it ought to be. But that is \nthe result of our delaying action on separate appropriations bills. \nThen they are all put into an omnibus bill. At the end, we vote on that \nbill without knowing what is in it. How many hundreds of millions, how \nmany billions of dollars may have been added in conference? And we vote \non the conference report when we really do not know what is in it. That \ngalls me.\n  I think we ought to reinstitute rule XXVIII. I voted to uphold the \nChair when rule XVI was changed here, and when the Senate overruled the \nChair, I voted to uphold the Chair. I favor the reinstitution of rule \nXVI. But because of the muzzling of the minority, because the minority \nis not allowed to offer as many amendments as we need to offer, I am \ngoing to uphold the Chair's position today.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  I am not going to vote to go back to rule XVI. I want to go back. I \ndo not like the vote I am going to cast. But how else am I going to \nprotest?\n  I think the minority should have the opportunity to offer its \namendments, and not jerk a bill down just because amendments are coming \nin from the minority side.\n  Another thing: There is no rule of, as I say, germaneness or \nrelevancy in the Senate. When we call up bills, except for the two \ninstances which I referred to there, cloture and on appropriations \nbills under rule XVI, there is no rule of relevancy to say: Cut down \nyour amendments; we will give you 5 amendments or 10 amendments and \nthey have to be relevant. Who said they have to be relevant? The rules \nof the Senate don't say they have to be relevant. But if an \nappropriation bill is the only vehicle you are ever going to have on \nwhich to try to take a shot at something that is not relevant, you have \nto take it. And the minority is being robbed of that opportunity. The \nminority is being placed under the gag rule. It is being laid down \nhere: You will do it our way or we will jerk the bill down. You have to \ndo it our way. You have to limit your amendments to 5 or 6 or 8 or 10--\nno more. That is not in this Senate rule book. That is not in this \nConstitution. And it is not in the best interests of the American \npeople that the Senate is being run that way.\n\n  Personally, I have a very high regard for the leadership on the other \nside, for the individuals themselves. I have a high regard for Senators \non the other side of the aisle. Some of the finest Senators I know sit \non that side of the aisle. Some of the most knowledgeable Senators I \nknow are on that side of the aisle. Some of the smartest Senators are \non that side of the aisle.\n  But, Mr. President, I am talking about the Senate as an institution, \nand I do not want and I do not intend to see us run over continually \nand denied the opportunity to offer amendments, and to debate, without \na shot being fired.\n  I stacked the legislative tree very few times when I was leader. But \nvery few times did I resort to that. My rule was one of the basic \nreasons for the Senate to let the minority have their rights, because \nas long as the minority have their rights in this forum, the people's \nliberties will not be taken from them. I want the minority to be given \ntheir rights.\n  Mr. President, I am going to close with the words of Aaron Burr, who \nspoke to the Senate in 1805, on March 5, after presiding over the \nSenate for 4 years. He said:\n\n       This House is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of order, and \n     of liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this exalted \n     refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to the \n     storms of political phrensy and the silent arts of \n     corruption; and if the Constitution be destined ever to \n     perish by the sacrilegious hands of the demagogue or the \n     usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be \n     witnessed on this floor.\n\n  Mr. President, I think we are seeing something akin to its expiring \nagonies because the Senate is not being allowed to fulfill its purposes \nfor being. It is not being allowed to work its will. The people are \nbeing denied. It is not just the Democrats at this moment who are being \ndenied, it is the people who are being denied the right of the minority \nin this Senate to speak their wills, to offer their amendments, to \nfully debate the legislation that is in the interests of the people.\n  In the interest of the people, I urge the leadership, I implore the \nleadership to stop thinking so much, as apparently it does, in terms of \nwho will win today--``we have to win on this one.'' Let's think of the \npeople. Protect the rights of the minority, allow full freedom to \ndebate and amend, and the people's rights and the people's liberties \nwill be secured.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, Senator Domenici and I are here to talk \nabout the tax cut, but I cannot listen to our dear colleague from West \nVirginia without giving a little bit of response.\n  First of all, I agree with virtually everything the Senator from West \nVirginia has said. I do believe we tread on our institution and we \npotentially reduce its ability to preserve our freedom and our Republic \nwhen we engage in\n\n[[Page S9189]]\n\npartisan politics. I agree with virtually every word Senator Byrd said.\n  We all know we have used the appropriations process to offer \namendments that were not part of any national agenda, that did not \nrepresent any real debate on behalf of causes, but in many cases both \nparties have engaged in the kind of politics where the minority--and \nthat minority changes sides from time to time. I hope that will not \noccur in the future, but knowing institutions as I do, I am sure it \nwill. What happens is, too often, the minority delays the work of the \nmajority, and then at the time for electioneering accuses the majority \nof not getting its work done. If we ought to preserve this great \ninstitution and all we love about it and all it stands for for America, \none of the things we have to do is to prevent partisan abuse of the \nsystem.\n  When we voted to overturn the Chair now several years ago, I was very \nreluctant to overturn the Chair. I found myself in a position of having \na colleague who had offered an amendment with which I strongly agreed \nand who also was in a position where it was critically important to her \nto see the Chair overturned. I knew no good could come out of it. I \nthought it would be easier to fix than it has turned out to be. I \nintend to vote to fix it today.\n  I do not believe we ought to be legislating on appropriations bills. \nThe distinguished Senator from West Virginia is correct in that it has \nbecome so easy for the authorization process to be disrupted that we \nhave virtually trivialized authorizations. Authorization committees \noften go an entire term without having any kind of authorization bill \npassed. Legislation builds up, we end up putting it on appropriations \nbills, and in doing so, we also hurt the institution.\n  I have heard every word our colleague from West Virginia has said. I \nbelieve we do need to set a threshold for offering legislation on an \nappropriations bill. It can be overcome with 51 votes. But every Member \nhas to know that when they do that, when they overrule the Chair, they \nopen that avenue for anyone else to do it in the future. In doing so, \nwe take down a small shield which I think is as big as it needs to be, \nbecause there are times when the minority deserves the right to speak, \nand if they feel strongly enough about it and they can convince a \nmajority to do it, they have a right to do it.\n  I intend to vote today to put rule XVI back into place. I do not \nintend to be in any hurry to see it pulled down again because it is a \nvery good and important barrier.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend from Texas yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield very briefly.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's statement \nregarding Senator Byrd's brilliant statement, but I also say to my \nfriend from Texas, there is also going to be an amendment offered by \nthe minority leader to change rule XXVIII--Senator Byrd spoke at some \nlength about that--to stop the procedure whereby we wind up with an \nappropriations bill that is 1,500 pages long, that has been negotiated \nby two or three people from the House, a couple of people from the \nSenate, the President's emissaries, and we get this big bill. A rule \nXXVIII change would say if you have a bill going to conference, you can \nonly deal with the matters brought up in conference. Does my friend \nfrom Texas also agree with Senator Byrd that it would be a good idea to \nchange that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not believe I will. It is something that should be \nlooked at. I remind our colleague from Nevada that our effort today is \nnot to change the rules of the Senate but to put the rules back where \nthey were before we overrode the Chair on the endangered species \nprovision to an appropriations bill, now several years ago.\n\n  Senator Byrd has raised a critically important issue. Too much work \nis done in conference. Anyone who has ever chaired a conference--and I \nam relatively new at it as a new committee chairman--immediately \ndiscovers that the only rule of the conference is you have to get a \nmajority of the members to sign the conference report. Other than that, \nfor all practical purposes, there are no rules.\n  This should be looked at, but I am not ready today to change the \nrules of the Senate. I am ready to go back and undo a mistake that we \nmade some 4 or 5 years ago. I will be willing to look at this. I will \nbe willing to study it, to participate in a discussion about it. We \nought to hold hearings on it and look at it, but I am not ready to \noverturn the rules of the Senate today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I did not understand what the \nSenator from Texas said when he talked about 20 minutes and he and I \nbeing on the floor. Did he intend to share that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I had intended to use less than that. The Senator can get \nany amount of time he wants.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senator from \nTexas is finished, I be allowed to proceed for up to 20 minutes \nthereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry. Will the Chair state how much time \nthe minority has remaining and how much time the majority has \nremaining. I think that will be helpful to the two Senators on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 33 minutes; the majority has \n144 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I will take 1 minute and say to my friend from Texas, the \nactivities today on rule XVI are directly related to the rule and the \nsame thing on rule XXVIII. All we are trying to do with rule XXVIII is \nto restore it to the way it used to be, just like rule XVI.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator will permit me to make an \nobservation on my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, he can make it on my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I was here, as was the Senator from Texas, when the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, spoke. What \nkept coming to my mind was: When are Senators from authorizing \ncommittees expected to bring their bills to the floor and have votes? I \ncame up with a very simple conclusion, with which my friend, Senator \nByrd, will not agree, but I want to state it anyway.\n  The problem we find ourselves in where Senators must offer \nauthorizing legislation time and time again on appropriations bills \ncomes about because this institution, this beloved Senate, insists on \ndoing every single appropriations bill every single year. There is no \ntime for anything else. That is the real problem. Then we do a budget \nresolution every single year. I believe there is a number around that \nwe use up about 67 to 70 percent of the available time of the Senate on \njust those two functions.\n  I hope, as we consider trying for 2-year appropriations and 2-year \nbudgets, my good friend from West Virginia will be participating. We \nwould like to hear his views. But I hope we can make the case that for \nthe betterment of this institution, which he expressed my views on \ntoday when he spoke of how important it is to America, I have learned, \nas he has learned--when I came to the Senate, I was not steeped like \nhim, so I did not know about it--it is to be a revered institution, and \nI want to keep it that way.\n  My last observation is, I think I might have been able to get up--not \nunder your majority leadership, but sometime during my 28 years here, \nmost of which was as a minority Member--and make the same speech you \njust made as to the leadership on that side of the aisle when your side \nwas in the majority, because when you have what we are having take \nplace here with fair regularity, as we try to pass 13 appropriations \nbills, and we hear the other side--not you, Senator--the other side \nsay: You will not pass them until we get to take up our agenda--and \ntheir agenda is not appropriations; it is a list of eight or nine items \nthat are their agenda; and in this body they are probably minority \nviews, but they want to get them up--then I say that is a challenge to \nthe majority leader.\n  That is hard stuff, because how do you then get the appropriations \nbills done and not have six of them wrapped up into one, which you just \ntalked about, and put everything else in it but the kitchen sink?\n  So, frankly, I appreciate your discussion today. Clearly, it is \nintended to help your side of the aisle in a debate on whether or not \nthe appropriations bills should have more authorizing amendments on \nthem that Senators on your side want to offer. In joining\n\n[[Page S9190]]\n\nthem, I commend you. It is pretty obvious to this Senator you have \njoined them so that you can make their case that they ought to be \npermitted.\n  But I also say, if you were in Senator Lott's shoes, or if I were, \nand you were being told on every one of these bills this is another one \nwe are going to get something that is the minority agenda, and you will \nhave to vote on it or else, I would be looking for ways to get the \nappropriations bills done.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is under the control of the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator has asked me a question. He said: If you were \nhere and Senators on the other side of the aisle said that----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I did not make it a question. But if you think it is a \nquestion----\n  Mr. BYRD. I thought you said----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ended with a period; it wasn't a question mark.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But I will be glad to have your answer.\n  Mr. BYRD. The answer to that is, call up authorization bills. Let \nMembers on this side offer their nongermane amendments to them. Then \ncome to the appropriations bills, and the Senators on this side will \nhave already had their chance. Call the legislative bills up. Why not \nhave those bills called up? What are we afraid of?\n  The numbers are on that side of the aisle. As I said to the \ndistinguished majority leader on one occasion: You have the numbers; \nyou have the votes. Why not let the Democrats call up their amendments? \nYou can beat them. You can reject them. You can table them. But if you \ndo not have the votes to defeat them, perhaps that amendment is in the \nbest interest of the country. And the Senate will have worked its will.\n  May I close by saying this--and I thank you for giving me this \nprivilege--reference has been made to the time when I was majority \nleader, very graciously by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \nbecause he stated it was not done during my tenure of leadership while \nhe has been here. But over one-third of the Senate today--over one-\nthird of today's Senators--were not here when I was majority leader of \nthe Senate.\n  I walked away from that position at the end of 1988 and became \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee in January 1989. More than \none-third of the Senators were not here when I was majority leader. \nEven the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Lott, was not in this body \nwhen I was majority leader.\n  But when I was majority leader, I say again, I attempted to protect \nthe rights of the minority because I saw that as one of the reasons for \nthe Senate's being.\n  I thank both Senators. Both Senators have been very kind to me and \nvery courteous. I think very highly of them both. I respect their \nviewpoints.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We are always kind to the Senator from West Virginia for \ntwo reasons: One, we love him; and, two, we know that we had best not \nbe unkind to him because we know he is smart and tough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9190-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9190-S9192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about taxes. I \nwant to deviate from my background in schoolteaching to be brief \nbecause I have to run over for a 2:30 meeting on the banking bill and I \nwant to hear a little bit of what the Senator from New Mexico has to \nsay before I leave.\n  We are beginning a debate that is a very proper and important debate. \nI am frustrated in this debate because, in trying to discuss this issue \nwith the White House, we have a concerted effort on their part to try \nto confuse the issue and mislead the American people as to what the \nchoices are.\n  I want to direct my comments to the choice we face. Basically, we \nhave the great and good fortune of having two things that have occurred \nat the same time. No. 1, beginning in the mid-1980s we started the \nprocess of gaining control over spending. It was not a dramatic change \nin policy, but over the years we have seen a gradual slowdown in the \nrate of growth in Government spending, beginning in the mid-1980s.\n  In the early 1990s we started to see an explosion of productivity as \nmodern technology became incorporated in the workplace in America, and \nthe result has been rapid economic growth and, with that economic \ngrowth, a growth in Federal revenues. We therefore have a situation \nwhich anyone would dream of having during their period of service in \npublic life, and that is, we have a very large budget surplus.\n  Initially, the President proposed spending part of the surplus that \ncomes from Social Security. I am proud to say that Senator Domenici, I, \nand others rejected that, and finally the President reached an \nagreement with us, in the best spirit of bipartisanship, that we were \nnot going to spend the Social Security trust fund.\n  We are trying to lock that into law in the so-called Social Security \nlockbox. We have an agreement with the President on the principle. We \nhave not reached an agreement with the President and with the minority \nparty in the Senate on exactly how to lock it up, but we are working on \nthat.\n  The debate we are beginning today is a debate about what to do with \nthe surplus that comes from the general budget that does not come from \nSocial Security, and, try as they may at the White House to confuse the \nissue and to mislead the public, there really are two stark choices \nbeing presented to the American people.\n  The first choice is presented by the President and his \nadministration. In regard to what is called the President's mid-session \nreview, the Congressional Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan \nbudget arm of the Congress, reviewed both the Republican budget and the \nbudget submitted by the President. They concluded that the President's \nbudget proposes $1.033 trillion worth of new Government spending on \napproximately 81 new programs, above and beyond increases for \ninflation.\n  That $1.033 trillion of new spending that the President's budget has \nproposed is so big that it not only uses up, for all practical \npurposes, the non-Social Security surplus, but in 3 of the next 10 \nyears it will require plundering the Social Security trust fund or \nrunning an outright non-Social Security deficit because the level of \nspending is too big.\n  As an alternative, Republicans have proposed that out of the $1 \ntrillion non-Social Security surplus, we give $792 billion back to the \nworking people of America who sent the money to Washington to begin \nwith and that we keep $200 billion plus to meet the basic needs of the \ncountry and to meet uncertainties we might face.\n  That is a pretty clear choice. The President's budget says spend \n$1.033 trillion on new Government programs. That is how they would use \nthe non-Social Security surplus. Our proposal says, take about 80 \npercent of it and give it back to working people in broad tax cuts and \nkeep 20 percent of it to meet critical needs and to deal with \ncontingencies.\n  If that were the debate we were having, Republicans might be winning \nthe debate, we might be losing the debate, but we would be having a \nmeaningful debate. The problem is, the administration continues to \nmislead the American public and basically to claim they are not \nproposing to spend this money. While proposing $1 trillion of new \nspending, they say that, by giving less than $800 billion back to the \npublic in tax cuts, in the words of the President, we ``imperil the \nfuture stability of the country.'' This is quoting the President at a \nfundraiser, naturally, in Colorado, that by giving this $800 billion \nback in tax cuts, we ``imperil the future stability of the country.'' \nYet to spend $1.033 trillion on new programs, the President would do \nwonderful things for the country.\n  If the President were honest enough to stand up and say, Don't let \nSenator Domenici, don't let Senator Lott, don't let Senator Gramm give \nthis money back to working people, let me spend it, I would have no \nobjections to the debate. But I have to say that it begins to grate on \na person when day after day after day this administration says things \nthat are verifiably false with a level of dishonesty in public debate \nthat is without precedent in the history of this country. No \nadministration in debate on public policy has ever been as dishonest as \nthis administration is. When you look at the actual numbers in their \nbudget and then listen to what they are saying, it is as if\n\n[[Page S9191]]\n\nwe are talking about two totally separate budgets.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 20 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield the floor so Senator Domenici may speak.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 30 minutes \nprior to the vote at 5:30 be equally divided between the two leaders so \nthey can have the last word on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the distinguished \nSenator from Texas has joined me on the floor and that I am permitted \nto join him in the beginning of a debate. I know the Senator has to \nleave, and I will try to make my most succinct points in the next 5 \nminutes.\n  First, I will share with the American people, and in particular with \nmy friend, how I see giving back some money to the taxpayers versus \nwhat else we are going to do with the surplus. I choose today, even \nthough I looked around for a different dollar, an American dollar. This \none is not signed by the new Secretary of the Treasury. I looked for \none. I am not sure he signed any yet. This is one signed by his \npredecessor.\n  I want everybody to look at that. It represents, in my analogy today, \nthe entire surplus that is going to be generated. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget, \nusing moderate economics, even assuming we are going to have a couple \nof downturns or recessions in the next 10 years, the total surplus we \nare going to accumulate is this number, if you will all just look at \nthis chart. It is a little bigger than the Senator has been using, and \nthe numbers are a little bigger in terms of how much we have left over \nto be spent, but it is $3.37 trillion in the next decade.\n  Mr. GRAMM. You are using Social Security.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am using everything. This represents everything. Here \nis what the President says. The President says: Spend it all. Is that \ntrue? Does he say spend it all?\n  Well, look here. Here is a chart showing the entire $3.71 trillion. \nHe says, and we say, put $1.9 trillion of it on the debt by putting it \nin a lockbox for Social Security. Then the Congressional Budget Office \nevaluates the rest of the President's proposal. Here it is in yellow. \nIt is $1.27 trillion, and every bit of that is literally spent, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  The President will argue about that because he even says he has a tax \ncut. We have looked at the tax cut he proposed. Not Pete Domenici, not \nPhil Gramm, but the Joint Tax Commission evaluated it. They said it is \nnot even a tax cut. It is an expenditure. It is in this spending, \nbecause the President is saying, collect taxes, give some of it back to \nsome people so they can save it, but you are giving them tax dollars; \nyou are not cutting their taxes. That is an expenditure of tax money.\n  Believe it or not, when you do that, the President increases taxes in \nhis budget by $95 billion.\n  Let me use the same dollar and let me share it with the Senator. Here \nis the entire accumulated surplus. Republicans say very simply, here \nare two quarters. We are going to put those two quarters into the \nSocial Security trust fund, 50 percent. The number that is available \nfor spending is bigger than the Senator said. It is $434 billion for \nMedicare and other highly critical Federal programs, if there are any. \nSo I am going to say one quarter for spending. And, lo and behold, what \nis the other quarter for? Tax cuts.\n  I ask the American people, out of $1, is 25 cents given back to the \nAmerican people for overtaxation too big a tax cut? Is it something we \nshould become worried about, that we are going to destroy our \nGovernment?\n  I believe the truth of the matter is that you can't have any tax cuts \nif you propose what the President has proposed, because I will show you \nagain what he proposes. On Social Security, he finally came our way, as \nthe Senator said, and said put it all in a trust fund. All of the rest \nis spent.\n  Let me ask, if we spend it all, is there any left for tax cuts? I \nmean, by definition, he is spending it all so there is nothing left for \ntax cuts.\n  A lot has been said about the distinguished economic stalwart of \nAmerica, Dr. Alan Greenspan, in the last few days. What has he said \nabout it? I want to tell my colleagues that regardless of what was said \nin the last few days, Alan Greenspan has essentially made two \nstatements about a surplus. I will give verbatim one of them from \nJanuary 29 before our committee. Here is what he said: I would prefer \nthat we keep the surplus in place; that is, reduce the debt. ``If that \nproves politically infeasible,'' he said, ``cutting taxes is far \nsuperior to spending, as far as the long-term stability of the fiscal \nsystem and the economy is concerned.''\n  In the last speech he made, and I quote: ``Only if Congress believes \nthat the surplus will be spent rather than saved is a tax cut wise.''\n  Now, we don't have to guess about that. Why do we not have to guess \nabout that? Because the President has already told us he is going to \nspend it. So Dr. Greenspan said, if you are going to spend it, it is \nfar better for America's economic future to cut taxes.\n  Essentially it seems to this Senator that we are being sold a bill of \ngoods.\n  We are being told that to spend one quarter of the surplus, that \ngiving back the American people some of their overtaxation is risky to \nthe economy. Dr. Alan Greenspan said the riskiest thing to do with the \nsurplus is to spend it. That is what he just said. We are saying that \nwe agree with him. We think it is too risky to do what the President is \nrecommending. He will, by the time he is finished, have spent every \ncent of it, and he will call some of it ``saving Medicare.''\n  I want everybody to know this. Let's look at this chart again. I \ndon't know how much it is going to cost for the Finance Committee and \nthe House Members to fix Medicare. They are working on it. They have \nall worked terribly hard on a bipartisan commission, and the President \nshot it down. Senator Breaux was involved in that, and he believed that \nwe had one going. What we are saying--and this is very, very \nimportant--when we have completed our tax cut, there is $434 billion \nleft for a Medicare fix, Medicare reform, and prescription drugs, if \nyou want it, and for other highly important programs, such as \neducation, defense, and others. In fact, we might, as the debate goes \non, put together a budget and come to the floor and show how this $434 \nbillion might be used so that everyone will know there is money for \neducation, if that is what you want, and there is money for Medicare \nreform, if that is what you want, and there is money for defense, \nbecause we have been told that that is what is left over as a surplus \nitem, and it doesn't belong to Social Security. So it is either used \nfor tax cuts or it is spent. We are saying: Save a quarter of it, give \nit back in tax dollars, and put a quarter of it in a rainy day fund, so \nto speak--a quarter of the dollar I showed you.\n  I want to close with a few more comments.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield before he gets into his closing \nremarks?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me make a point that I think goes right \nto the heart of the statement by the President that something is \nextreme about our fairly modest tax cut. I have a chart here that I \nwish every American could see and understand. It shows the percentage \nof the economy that was coming to Government the day Bill Clinton \nbecame President.\n  The day Bill Clinton became President, the Government was collecting \nin taxes 17.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every American. As \nyou will recall, in 1993, we had a very big tax increase, and with the \ngrowth in the economy, the Government is now taking in 20.6 percent of \nevery dollar earned by every American. If we took the entire surplus--\nnot the $794 billion being proposed by Republicans, but the whole $1.33 \ntrillion, or whatever it is--if we took the whole surplus, which we are \nnot proposing to do, and gave it back in a tax cut, 10 years from now, \nwhen it was fully implemented, the Federal Government would still be \ntaking 18.8 percent of every dollar earned in taxes, which is \nsubstantially more than it was the day Bill Clinton became President.\n  So what Bill Clinton is calling a ``dangerous, huge tax cut'' is \nactually a\n\n[[Page S9192]]\n\nrelatively modest tax reduction as compared to the tax increase and \nrevenue growth that has occurred in the 6\\1/2\\ years that Bill Clinton \nhas been President, even if we cut taxes by the amount of the entire \nsurplus, which we are not proposing to do. But even if we did, the tax \nburden would still be higher than it was the day Bill Clinton became \nPresident. That is a point I think people need to understand.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to wrap this up, and I intend to \ndo this everywhere I can, anyplace I am asked, on any TV show I can get \non. In summary, plain and simple, it is the following: The man who is \nmost responsible for a good American economy is probably Dr. Alan \nGreenspan of the Federal Reserve Board. He has said:\n\n       I would prefer that we keep the surplus in place and reduce \n     the public debt. If that proves politically infeasible, \n     cutting taxes is far superior to spending it.\n\n  Here is the Republican budget: Debt reduction in Social Security, in \nliteral numbers. I used in the summary 50 percent; it is actually 56 \npercent. Literally, the tax cut is less than a quarter; it is 23 \npercent. The money left over for Medicare and other programs is 20.1 \npercent. Frankly, that is a good plan. That is balanced, and it is not \nrisky.\n  Here it is encapsulated in another manner. Here is the President's \nplan: Of the $3.3 trillion accumulated over the next decade, $1.901 \ntrillion goes into Social Security and debt service. He contends he has \ndone more in debt service than we have. Frankly, who do you believe? We \nbelieve the Congressional Budget Office. They say we are putting more \non the debt than the President is. So when his emissaries get on \ntelevision and say ``we want to reduce the debt,'' the implication is \nthat Republicans don't. But we are doing the same amount, or more, than \nthe President. It is right there.\n  The President then says that they don't want to do any tax cuts \nbecause, if you look at his budget, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, including a tax cut--which is not a tax cut--he spends \nevery nickel of it. If you want to talk about a risky policy, that is a \nrisky policy. From what I can tell, that is what Dr. Alan Greenspan \nsaid would be the worst thing to do--to spend all the surplus.\n\n  Last, our plan: Debt reduction and Social Security trust fund \nencapsulated, so they can't be spent, in a lockbox. Tax cuts, $794 \nbillion, and for expenditure items that are very necessary, such as \nMedicare, education, defense, and others, there is $434 billion left \nover.\n  Now, it is very difficult when the Secretary of the Treasury--the new \none--gets on talk shows and says what a risky policy this is. He talks \nabout the fact that they want to preserve or do more on the debt than \nwe do. We are bound by the Congressional Budget Office in the Congress, \nand they tell us we are doing as much, or more, than the President in \nthat regard. They tell us the President is spending every dime of the \nsurplus on one program or another, or for a tax cut that is not a tax \ncut. And they maintain that a Republican plan that says, use 75 cents \non a dollar for Social Security, debt reduction, Medicare, and domestic \npriorities, and give 25 percent back to the public, is risky. What is \nrisky about it? Is it risky to give 25 cents out of a dollar back to \nthe public to spend and less risky to keep it here and let the Federal \nGovernment spend it? I don't believe anyone would agree it is more \nrisky to give some of it back to Americans and let them spend it, as \ncompared with keeping it here and spending the entire 100 percent of \nthe surplus on Federal Government-controlled programs and projects.\n  Whatever time I have remaining, I yield back, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAPO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, I will commit most of my time to comments on the \ndebate with regard to returning to the full import of Rule XVI. \nHowever, before I do that, I want to comment on the debate that has \njust taken place regarding tax relief. I think it is critical that we \nin America today understand that we have moved into a time of budget \nsurplus, just what those surpluses mean, and what the opportunities are \nfor the American people.\n  Prior to the last 3 or 4 years, we saw, I think, that most Americans \nbecame accustomed to the fact we were running very large deficits, and \nthat the Federal Government was not able to conduct its fiscal policy \nin a manner that was balanced. One of the commitments I made when I ran \nfor the House of Representatives 6 years ago was to work to try to \nbalance the Federal budget. Fortunately, for me, and I think for all \nAmericans, we were able to successfully achieve that objective.\n  The budget today is balanced. In fact, the projections we just heard \ntalked about show that no matter how you look at the budget--whether \nyou count the Social Security dollars, which I don't think should be \ncounted, or whether you don't--we are moving into a balanced posture \nfor the Federal Government.\n  The debate today is over what we do in a surplus posture. It is a \ndebate that Americans have not been able to have for decades because \nour Government has not run surpluses. Now that we are engaged in this \ndebate, it is critical for Americans to focus and to identify what our \nfiscal policy should be as we move into an era of projected surpluses.\n  In that context, I think it is critical that a few important \npriorities be recognized and acknowledged by the country.\n  First and foremost, I am glad we have agreement on the principle, \neven though we don't have agreement on the details yet, that we have to \nprotect the Social Security trust fund surplus dollars, and make \ncertain that what Americans pay into the Social Security system is not \nthen taken by Congress and the President and spent on other spending by \ncounting those surpluses against the unified budget.\n  We have a lock--in a way, a lockbox--which is now before the Senate \nthat we have voted on six or seven times this year. We have to make \nsure those parts of the surplus remain dedicated to the Social Security \ntrust fund. With the remainder of what I call the true budget, the \nonbudget surplus, we have to decide as a country on what we are going \nto focus.\n  Over the next 10 years, we will have a surplus somewhere in the \nneighborhood of $1 trillion. You have heard different numbers discussed \ntoday. I think it is important that we not continue the path of growing \nthe Federal Government, expanding the spending posture of the Federal \nGovernment, and spending those surplus dollars. If we do so, we will \nfind a time in the near future when we will not be able to maintain \nsurpluses in our budget; we will return to deficits, and we will see \nthe national debt continue to rise.\n\n  As a result of that, I think it is critical we focus on two high \npriorities. One is to reduce the national debt. Although we have \nbalanced the Federal budget, we haven't reduced the national debt to \nzero. That should be one of our highest priorities. Two is to make sure \nthat we return to the American people a tax cut.\n  The American people recognize that this is an opportunity. It is an \nopportunity that we may not have too many times as we work through \nthese difficult budget times to achieve tax relief. But to use, as the \nSenator from New Mexico indicated, just one quarter of this total \nsurplus picture for tax relief I think is an appropriate commitment.\n  That leaves us the opportunity to provide resources to parts of our \nFederal obligation that need strengthening. It gives us and the \nAmerican people the opportunity to strengthen and to stabilize the \nSocial Security trust fund. It is a sound policy.\n  I think America should begin to focus on this debate as Congress \nworks its way into a very important new era: How do we deal with budget \nsurpluses?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9192-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9192-S9196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RESTORATION OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF RULE XVI--Continued\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about the \nquestion that we will vote on at 5:30; namely, will we restore the \nmeaning of rule XVI?\n  Over the last 2 or 3 months, there has been a lot of debate and \ndiscussion among us in the Senate on this issue. One part of that \ndebate has been that it was the Republicans who changed the rule by \nvoting to override it a couple of years ago. The Democrats at that time \nvoted not to override it.\n\n[[Page S9193]]\n\n  Today, you have the anomaly on the floor where the Republicans are \nsaying let's restore that rule because it was a mistake to override it, \nand the minority is saying we don't want to restore that rule because \nit is something that we are able to use as a tool in the current \nclimate.\n  I wasn't here 2 years ago. I am in the seventh month of my first year \nin the Senate. I wasn't a part of that debate. But I can go back to 7 \nyears ago now when I ran for Congress. I ran for the House of \nRepresentatives. One of the things I said then was that I thought a \nproblem in our system in Washington was the fact that amendments were \nbeing put forward by Members of the House and the Senate--Republican \nand Democrat--that were not related to that legislation.\n  I come from Idaho. In the Idaho Legislature, that is not allowed. You \ncan't offer an amendment to a bill that doesn't relate to the bill on \nwhich you are working. I think that is probably the way it is in most \nState legislatures. It is the way the Senate rules require that we \noperate.\n  I think one of the other Senators who was debating it earlier in the \nday indicated that these are not new rules we are fighting over now in \nthis rather partisan era of politics. The genesis of this approach was \nway back in, I think, 1868 in one of the earlier predecessors to this \nrule XVI, when it was recognized by the Members of the Senate that \nproper legislative protocol was that the bill on the floor should be \namended by amendments that were related only to that bill.\n\n  Why would we have a big debate over that concept?\n  When I was running for office 6 years ago, I thought there was a \npretty strong national understanding that one of the problems we were \nfacing in the Federal Government was the fact that legislation was \nproliferating, spending was proliferating, and there seemed to be no \nway to bring it under control. Part of the problem was all of the \nnongermane or unrelated legislation that was being tacked on as riders \nto legislation that was moving through. Legislation that wouldn't \nnecessarily have the ability to move on its own was being attached to a \nvehicle that was moving through, and then that vehicle would carry it \nthrough to success and enactment into law.\n  I believe that is wrong legislating. That is the wrong policy under \nwhich we should legislate. I think it results in bad policy decisions \nbeing worked into law because they are attached to something else that \nhas the ability to carry them over the finish line when they themselves \ndon't have the merit to be enacted.\n  I believe that is why in 1868 the Senate proposed the predecessor to \nthis rule that would start the Senate down the road of having a \nprotocol that you could not put amendments on legislation that was not \nrelevant to that legislation.\n  What does rule XVI say? What does the rule we are fighting over say?\n  Sometimes people say to me these procedural issues are arcane and you \nshouldn't spend so much time worrying about them. But, frankly, I think \nit is critical. There is an issue that is important to this \ninstitution, and it is important to America. It has a very big impact \non the kinds of policy decisions that this Nation will make.\n  What does the rule we are fighting over say? It says:\n\n       On a point of order made by any Senator, no amendment \n     offered by any other Senator which proposes general \n     legislation shall be received to any general appropriations \n     bill, nor shall any amendment not germane or relevant to the \n     subject matter contained in the bill be received, nor shall \n     any amendment to any item or clause of such bill be received \n     which does not directly relate thereto.\n\n  That is a sensible statement of what the policy should be. This rule \nsays as to appropriations bills--I think that we should have it be that \nway with regard to all bills--an amendment that doesn't relate to that \nbill is not in order.\n  That is the issue we are debating today.\n  I was on the floor earlier when several of my colleagues from the \nother side gave very strong and impassioned arguments as to why they \nare going to vote against this legislation.\n  Actually, as Senator Gramm from Texas indicated, after listening to \nthose same arguments, I found very little that I disagreed with in \ntheir debate about what they believe should be the protocol of the \nSenate and what they believe should be our attitude toward this great \ninstitution of government.\n  The argument that seems to be made is that because we are not able to \nget all of our agenda put forward on the bills that we want to see put \nforward, we need the opportunity to bring nongermane amendments to \nappropriations bills. It was said that the opportunity to bring their \nissues forward was not being allowed to them.\n  I agree that they should have that opportunity, although I find it a \nlittle difficult to see that they are not having it.\n  I remember 2 or 3 weeks ago when this issue came to a point when we \nwere debating the agriculture appropriations bill. An amendment related \nto health care was brought and debated on the floor of this Senate with \nregard to the agriculture appropriations bill. At the time, what \nhappened? We had a lot of debate about whether we should be debating \nhealth care on an agriculture bill. Ultimately we reached a resolution \nby which we took the agriculture appropriations bill off the floor, \ncame back a week or so later, and brought the health care legislation \nto the floor, had a full week of debate on the health care issue, and \nfinally a vote on that health care issue.\n\n  To me, the question of whether the legislation is moving forward or \nthe issues the minority wants to see brought forward can be brought \nforward is one that has to be focused on closely. In the Senate--and \nthe good Senator from West Virginia very well and very carefully \nexplained the difference between the House and the Senate--in the \nSenate, as compared to the House, the minority rights do give the \nminority many powerful opportunities to bring forth their legislation \nand their ideas, not the least of which are the filibuster, the hold, \nand any number of other procedural opportunities they may have. I am \nconvinced the minority's rights to bring forward their issues for \nargument are well protected. I would say to the Senators who are \nconcerned about that, I agree with them, they should be protected.\n  The way a legislature should operate is that both sides should be \nable to bring forward their issues and the clash of ideas should take \nplace on the floor of the Senate. The Senate should then vote based on \nprinciple, on what the policy of the country should be on the issue \nbeing debated.\n  What should not happen is that, as an important bill that is moving \nforward is being debated, something that cannot survive the clash of \nideas gets attached to it as a rider and then slides through into law \nwithout that opportunity for the clear and concise focus that would be \nfollowed if rule XVI were followed.\n  Although we are debating a procedural issue today, the issue could \nnot be more important to the governance of this Senate and to the \ngovernance of this country. I do not remember who it was, but one of \nthe great political leaders of the country once said: If you give me \ncontrol over the procedure, I can control the outcome. Procedures are \ncritical to the proper outcome in a legislative body. I agree \nwholeheartedly with my colleagues; our procedures must be fair; they \nmust be balanced. In that context, I would willingly support any \nefforts to make the system here more fair and more balanced.\n  I look at this not as a Republican or a Democrat. As I said, I was \nnot here 2 years ago when the fight took place to change the rule from \nwhat it was before. I believe Republicans and Democrats break the \nspirit of this rule regularly in the Senate. To me, we have to look at \nwhat is the right principle by which this great institution should be \ngoverned. When we identify the principle by which we should be \ngoverned, without partisan considerations, we should enact that \nprinciple into our rules. That is what I believe was done in 1868. I \nthink that is what the Senate has done historically with what is now \nrule XVI and with the principle that we should not allow nongermane \nriders to be attached to legislation being considered on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks by going back to a theme that has \nbeen brought up by the Senator from West Virginia, and that is his \nrespect for this great institution. It is one of the\n\n[[Page S9194]]\n\ngreatest honors that ever could be bestowed on anyone to have the \nprivilege to serve in this Chamber, the Senate. I feel about my \nopportunity that deeply. I want to do nothing other than to make this \ninstitution the great institution our Founding Fathers intended for it \nto be. It will be that kind of institution if we look beyond \npartisanship, beyond politics, and beyond personal attacks, and \nidentify the principles by which we should govern ourselves, put those \nprinciples into place, and then operate within their limits.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding the order of \nbusiness is S. Res. 160, a resolution to restore an interpretation of \nrule XVI of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Further, it is my understanding this interpretation of \nthe rule would allow a Senator to make a point of order against any \namendment to an appropriations bill that is not germane to \nappropriations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The issue is legislation on an appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. So in effect it would not allow a Senator to legislate \npolicy changes on appropriations bills if a point of order was made \nagainst the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I think this is one of the most significant \nopportunities this body has had in some time to address an internal \ndisregard for our responsibility. As a consequence, I rise in strong \nsupport of S. Res. 160, the resolution, that would overturn the rule \nXVI precedent the Senate adopted on March 16, 1995, which effectively \nhijacked the authorization process by allowing Senators to routinely \noffer legislative amendments on general appropriations bills.\n  Doing a little research, it was less than a year ago when the Senate \nvoted on the 4,000-page, 40-pound, $540 billion omnibus appropriations \nbill. Not only did that bill contain funding for various Federal \nagencies including the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, State, and \nJustice, the District of Columbia, Foreign Ops, Interior, and Labor-\nHHS; but it also included numerous authorization bills. A few of them \ncontained in that package were the American Competitiveness Act, the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act, the Internet Decency Act, the Vacancies Act, \nthe reauthorization of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, the \nDrug Free Workplace Act, the Drug Demand Reauthorization Act, the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, the Chemical Weapons \nConvention Implementation Act--I could go on and on.\n  In addition, that monstrosity of a bill included tax extender \nlegislation and more than $20 billion of so-called emergency spending.\n  One has to ask the question why we need authorizing committees when \nwe allow appropriations bills to include authorizing legislation. Why \nshould the Finance Committee, for example, exist if the appropriators \ncan include tax legislation in their bills? Why should the Commerce \nCommittee hold meetings when the American Competitiveness Act can be \nincluded in an appropriations bill?\n  We have example after example. I recall not so long ago the battle we \nfought over the fiscal 1998 Interior appropriations. The Clinton \nadministration at that time decided on its own to acquire the \nHeadwaters Forest in northern California--that was at a cost of $315 \nmillion--further, the Administration also decided to acquire the New \nWorld Mine site in Montana, at a cost of $65 million.\n  I am not going to speak to the merits of these acquisitions, but I am \ngoing to speak to the manner in which they were done because here you \nhave an administration that prides itself on public participation. \nThese decisions were made with no congressional involvement. The \nadministration sought to bypass the authorizing committees entirely and \nhave the appropriators essentially just write a check for the purchase \nof those properties, and that is just what they did.\n  I happen to be chairman of the authorizing committee with \njurisdiction, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I wanted the \nopportunity for the committee to carefully review the merits of these \nacquisitions. We tried, but the argument failed, and the authorization \nand funding were included in the 1998 Interior appropriations bill. \nThat was much to the administration's delight. They got their way. But \nthe public, the process, the committee of jurisdiction, had no \nopportunity to review these significant purchases, no opportunity to \nhold hearings, no opportunity for open debate or any type of public \nreview. That is what is wrong with this system.\n  Today we have an opportunity to begin to change that. Moreover, what \nhas happened since this precedent was changed in 1995 is that \nappropriations bills become far more difficult to pass. As we know--we \nhave seen it lately--they are held hostage to nonappropriations issues, \nand the delays in getting them completed raise the specter of a \nGovernment shutdown at the end of each session. We saw it just 3 weeks \nago, an example of how authorizing legislation stands in the way of the \nappropriations process.\n  For nearly a full week, the agriculture appropriations bill was \nstalled because Members on the other side of the aisle demanded we \nconsider the Patients' Bill of Rights. As a result, the Senate had to \nstop the appropriations process for an entire week as we debated this \nimportant health issue.\n  I happen to support the Patients' Bill of Rights that was adopted by \nthe Senate. I believe we should, first of all, have completed all of \nthe appropriations bills before we engaged in that debate and other \ndebates. As of today, we still have not moved forward on the \nagriculture bill.\n  Because of the delays in the appropriations process, what has been \nhappening in recent years is that when the end of the fiscal year \napproaches, the appropriators and the leadership have to come together \nto engage in a negotiation with the White House to ensure the \nGovernment continues to function. As was demonstrated last year, \nauthorizing bills and appropriations bills get mixed in together in a \nsingle omnibus bill which is negotiated by a hand-picked group of \npeople. Authorizers do not participate in the process and, therefore, \nhave no say in the substance of the legislation.\n  This is wrong. This is not the way the Senate was set up to function.\n  As a consequence, as we look at where we are today, the founders \nintended the Senate to operate with a representative process with the \nauthorizing committees doing their job. They were not created simply to \nprovide oversight. Those committees do important things such as holding \nhearings, drafting legislation based on their knowledge gained from \nsuch hearings, and that is why we have the structure of the \nauthorization committees because they have expertise and their \nprofessional staffs have an expertise on much of the complicated issues \nbefore us. If we continue to allow appropriations bills to be laden \nwith authorization legislation, I can assure my colleagues we are going \nto see a repeat of last year's last-minute omnibus bill.\n  In closing, I will make a reference to how we are seen by the \nadministration, and I am speaking as an authorizer, as chairman of an \nauthorizing committee.\n  One Secretary, Secretary Babbitt, Secretary of the Interior, has \nbecome adept at circumventing the Congress. Babbitt has indicated that \nhe is proud of his procedure and proud of the way he is doing it. I \nquote:\n\n       . . . ``We've switched the rules of the game. We're not \n     trying to do anything legislatively,'' says Babbitt.\n\n  That is the National Journal, May 22, 1999.\n  A further quote from Secretary Babbitt:\n\n       One of the hardest things to divine is the intent of \n     Congress because most of the time . . . legislation is put \n     together usually in kind of a House/Senate kind of thing \n     where it's the munchkins--\n\n  The munchkins, Mr. President--\n\n       who actually draft this legislation at midnight in a \n     conference committee and it goes out.\n\n  It is a statement from Cobel v. Babbitt, page 3668.\n  Lastly, from Secretary Babbitt:\n\n       I am on record around this town as saying that the real \n     business on these issues is done in the appropriation \n     committees, and I, I am a regular and frequent participant at \n     all levels in those. That's, that's where the action\n\n[[Page S9195]]\n\n     is, that's where things get done. The authorizing committees \n     are partisan wrangles of the first order. I mean, nothing \n     ever gets done on any level in the authorizing committees.\n\n  Cobel v. Babbitt, page 3811-3812.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have one brief statement, and then I will yield.\n  It is my hope we will overturn this precedent and return the Senate \nto the way it has operated for nearly all of its history. Otherwise, we \nmight just as well abandon our authorizing committees and enlarge the \nsize of the Appropriations Committee to all 100 Members.\n\n  I believe my friend from Nevada has a question.\n  Mr. REID. I do have a brief question to ask the chairman of the most \nimportant Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I asked a similar \nquestion--in fact, the same question--earlier this morning of the \nsenior Senator from Wyoming who shares a lot of the interests of the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  He said he felt it was appropriate to change rule XVI. The minority \nleader is going to file a motion to amend rule XXVIII for that to go \nback the way it used to be.\n  In 1996, on the FAA authorization bill, a point of order was raised \nthat the conferees brought back information and material that was not \ncontained in either bill of the House or the Senate. A point of order \nwas raised that it was not. The Chair ruled that it was true. It was \noverruled.\n  I say to my friend from Alaska in the form of a question, I hope in \nhis support to change rule XVI that he will also look at rule XXVIII \nbecause, as the senior Senator from New York who spoke earlier today \nsaid and the senior Senator from West Virginia said, the problem we are \nfacing is magnified even more so than what the Senator from Alaska \nstated. The Senator from Alaska was called back from his State, and I \nwas called back from my State last fall, and we voted on a 1,500-page \nbill he had not read and, I am sorry to say, I had not read. I probably \ncould not lift that bill, let alone read it.\n  The fact is, there was so much material contained in that, material \nto which I am sure the Secretary of Interior referred. He had stuff in \nthat bill with which the Senator from Alaska had nothing to do with and \nit was put in, even though he is the chairman of the committee of \njurisdiction. Certainly the appropriators did not work on it. It was \ndone by the Chief of Staff of the White House principally, a few people \nfrom the Senate, a few people from the House, and they did the work for \nall of us.\n  I hope that my friend from Alaska, who certainly has so much to do \nwith what we do around here, especially those of us in the Western \nUnited States, will look favorably also at changing rule XXVIII back \nthe way it used to be.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I very much appreciate my friend from Nevada \nhighlighting the inequity associated with the responsibility of the \nauthorizers because, as I indicated in my statement, we get down to a \nsituation where we are out of time and, as I stated, a few hand-picked \nindividuals come together with the White House and basically negotiate \na resolve with no participation from the authorizers. As a consequence, \nas he pointed out, we cannot read the material. It is basically put \ntogether simultaneously with the process of negotiation. We are \nshortchanging our responsibility. I very much appreciate his attention \ngiven to this matter.\n  Mr. REID. I will also say to my friend from Alaska, the Senator from \nWyoming said he agreed with us that the rule should be changed.\n  I yield 8 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Evan \nBayh.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank the Chair. It is an honor for me to be in the \nChamber of this great institution once again with you serving as our \nPresiding Officer this afternoon. I thank my colleagues also for being \nhere today.\n  Before I begin my remarks, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my time, my colleague from Minnesota be recognized. He \nhas very graciously allowed me to cut ahead of him in line this \nafternoon. I want him, if there is no objection, to be recognized at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank the Chair and my colleagues. I am pleased to be \nhere, and I rise in opposition to Senate Resolution 160 because I \nbelieve that it represents bad public policy. It represents a lack of \nconviction and consistency on the part of the majority in this Chamber, \nand it represents a continuing erosion of the traditions of this great \nbody which imperil the very vitality of our democracy.\n  I say these things, although I have no doubt that if we asked many \nwho are in the galleries today or the citizens in my State exactly what \nrule XVI involves, they would have very little awareness of this or of \nthe significance of the change that has been proposed. I do believe \nthat if the citizens of our country understood the importance, the \nsymbolic changes this resolution represents, they would be concerned, \nindeed, because the citizens of our country do care about good public \npolicy.\n  The best avenue to ensuring that the people of our country have good \npublic policy, with the fostering of vigorous, open debate, is the \ncontest of ideas right here in the well of the Senate, where the good \nideas triumph and the bad ones are weeded out.\n  Someone said, the best disinfectant is sunshine. That holds true in \nthe Senate as it does in other forums. We will not get the best \nGovernment that the people of our country deserve if the minority in \nthis Chamber is not given the privilege of introducing our ideas before \nthe American people and debating them in a free and open forum.\n  Think with me for a moment of some of the ideas that would not have \nbeen allowed to come up over the last 6 months that I have been \nprivileged to serve in the Senate if this resolution proposed before us \ntoday were adopted.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights is important to every citizen across our \ncountry. Mr. President, if you believe in the right to have access to a \nspecialist, in emergency care, you should care about this resolution. \nIf you believe in the right to have an effective appeal to the denial \nof coverage, you should support defeat of this resolution.\n  Likewise, the juvenile justice bill, which we addressed in the tragic \naftermath of the Columbine incident, would never have come before this \nChamber if this resolution that we consider today were in effect.\n  Something I worked very hard on, with a bipartisan group, to ensure \nthat the States have access to the proceeds from the tobacco \nlitigation, would never have come before this Chamber and would not \nhave been a part of the emergency supplemental passed into law if this \nresolution we consider today had been in effect.\n  Important issues of public policy, my fellow Americans, would not be \nheard on the floor of this great body, the greatest deliberative body \nin the history of man, if the resolution proposed before us goes into \neffect.\n  Your well-being, the well-being of our country, and those about whom \nwe care will be substantially affected if this resolution is adopted. \nWe should not let that happen to future debates about education or the \nminimum wage or other things that we, as Americans, care about.\n  Likewise, Mr. President, I am distressed to state it, but I believe \nthis resolution represents a very real lack of conviction, a lack of \nconviction on the part of the majority now controlling this Chamber. If \nthey truly have the best ideas, if their ideas are in the best \ninterests of the American people, why not have them subjected to \namendment and debate on the floor of the Senate?\n  Moreover, I ask those here in our presence today, and those viewing \nus at home, if our ideas on this side of the Chamber are so weak, so \nlacking in merit, what is the fear in allowing us to debate them and \nvote on them in the Senate?\n  My friends, I think the answer is distressingly clear. There are some \nMembers of this body who do not want to cast the tough votes. They do \nnot want to be forced to make the tough decisions. They do not want to \nhave to address the compelling challenges of our time. They would \nrather limit debate and too often gag the Members of the minority from \npresenting our ideas.\n  The answer to this, Mr. President, is simple: It is not to stifle \ndebate, it is\n\n[[Page S9196]]\n\nnot to prevent votes. If you do not believe in having a vigorous debate \non the floor of the Senate, why run for the office in the first place?\n  As Harry Truman once said: If you can't stand the heat, you better \nnot go into the kitchen. That is what this resolution is really all \nabout.\n  Next, this resolution, unfortunately, represents a real lack of \nconsistency on the part of the majority. It is a flip-flop, more worthy \nof a gymnastics contest than a debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  Just 4 short years ago, the majority voted to overturn the historic \npractice of not allowing legislation on appropriations. Now they \npropose to change it back. I could not blame Americans listening to our \ncomments today if they thought what was really holding sway on the \nfloor of the Senate had more to do with expediency in politics than \nconsistency of principle.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, it represents something that Americans \nhave come to view as too often is the case in Washington today, and \nthat is the pursuit of power above all else--certainly, the pursuit of \npower above principle, all too frequently. And that is not how it \nshould be.\n  I remind my colleagues, the majority, that the test of character is \nnot how you behave when you are weak; the real test of character is \nwhen we see how you behave when you are strong. That is what we see \ntoday. I am afraid we are not passing this test if we go forward and \ngag and muzzle the minority from offering our ideas to the American \npeople.\n  Let me offer this observation in conclusion.\n  I represent a State of 6 million souls. I believe I was elected to \nrepresent them on the floor of the Senate, to offer the ideas that will \nbest serve to increase the opportunity that they will have in their \nlives. That is why I was sent to the Senate. It is not right to muzzle \ntheir elected Representative from offering the ideas that I believe \nwill serve them best, or the Senator of Nevada believes will serve his \nconstituents best, or the Senator from Minnesota or the other Senators \nin this body.\n  I have hanging in my office a print entitled ``The United States \nSenate,'' circa 1850. It is a wonderful print that I believe embodies \nthe history and the legacy of this institution at its finest.\n  In the center of this print is Henry Clay, speaking on the floor of \nthe Senate in the historic Old Senate Chamber. And listening intently \nto him on the floor of the Senate were some of the giants in the \nSenate: Daniel Webster, John Calhoun, Thomas Hart Benton. Future \nPresidents of the United States were in attendance listening to the \ndebate.\n  They were not debating an arcane subject that would be of no interest \nto the people of this country. They were debating the very union that \nis the foundation upon which our Nation is built. What would our \nforefathers think of the changes that have taken place in this Senate \nif they felt that the issues of union and disunion, States rights and \nFederal rights, the very liberties we hold dear, were no longer allowed \nto be debated on the floor of the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I believe they would be distressed, as I am \ntoday, and as people would be today if they understood what was at \nstake here. I urge my colleagues to vote against this resolution and to \nuphold the traditions of our Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President. I might not even need to \ntake that much time.\n  First of all, I thank the Senator from Indiana for his comments. I \nwas thinking about what he said. When I was a college teacher, I used \nto talk a bit about Birch Bayh, some of the Senators who took strong, \nprincipled stands. The Senator mentioned other great Senators, but I \nthink the Senator represents a really wonderful tradition.\n  I think what Senator Bayh said at the very end of his remarks is what \nis most important to me. I was thinking about when I ran for the Senate \nfrom Minnesota. It would be an honor to be a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives; the Presiding Officer was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. As a Senator, you could do a much better job of being \nan advocate for the people in your State, because the rules of the \nSenate were such that you could come to the floor, even if it was you \nalone --maybe others would not agree with you, but hopefully you could \nget a majority--if you thought the Senate was in a disconnect with the \npeople, to the concerns and circumstances of people you represented, to \nexpress your concerns.\n  I just mention a gathering I was at the Dahl farm in northwest \nMinnesota. It is a huge problem in Arkansas, too. Farmers showed up, \ncoming from a long distance away. It was a desperate situation. In the \nSenate you can come to the floor and say: I have to come to the floor \nand fight for family farmers. I have to come to the floor to talk about \ncomprehensive health care. I have to come to the floor and figure out a \nvehicle whereby I can talk about ending this discrimination when it \ncomes to people who are struggling with mental illness. I have to come \nto the floor to talk about poor children in America. I have to come to \nthe floor to talk about veterans health care and the gap in veterans \nhealth care in Minnesota and around the country.\n  The great thing about being a Senator is you can come to the floor \nwith an amendment and you can fight for it.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. REID. You are a former professor of government. It is true, is it \nnot, that the Constitution was drawn to protect the minority, not the \nmajority?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is true.\n  Mr. REID. Isn't it true that there is nobody better to protect the \nConstitution and the minority than the Senate?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that is part of the genius of the \nSenate and the way Senators have conducted themselves over the years.\n  Mr. REID. Do I understand the Senator to say, unless we have more of \nan opportunity to speak out on issues, that those minorities, in \neffect, are not represented here?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the reason I am going to vote against \nthis resolution is, to be very direct--I am not full of hatred about \nthis; I am just making a political point, and we do make political \npoints on the floor of the Senate--when I look at the context of what \nhas been going on here, I am in profound opposition to what the \nmajority leader and the majority party have been doing, which is to \nsort of what we call fill up the tree, basically denying Senators the \nright to come to the floor with amendments, to try to make sure we \ndon't have to debate tough and controversial questions, to try to make \nsure we can't move forward agendas that we, as Senators, think are \nimportant to the people of our States.\n  I am absolutely opposed to what I think is being done here. \nTherefore, I think this resolution fits into that pattern of trying to \nstifle dissent, trying to stifle a minority opinion, trying to stifle \nindividual Senators from coming to the floor and doing their absolute \nbest to be the strongest possible advocates for the people of their \nStates. That is why I am voting against this resolution.\n  It is sort of two issues. One is the question that the Senator from \nNevada spoke on, which is, what is the role of the Senate in relation \nto the House of Representatives, in relation to making sure that we \nhave respect for minority rights, so on and forth, what is the role of \nthe Senate as a deliberative body, as a debate body. The other issue, \nwhich is even more important to me, is whether or not I can, as a \nSenator, do the best possible job for the people of my State. That is \nwhy I am going to oppose this resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 7 minutes as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9196-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9196-S9198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VETERANS BUDGET REPORT\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. This is an area in which the Presiding Officer has \ndone a lot of work. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for his good work \non veterans issues.\n  Mr. President, on June 15th I sent letters to each of the twenty-two \nVISN\n\n[[Page S9197]]\n\nDirectors of the VA health care system to ask for data on how their \nnetwork would be affected by the President's flat-lined budget. I \nconducted this survey because the stories coming from rank and file VA \nstaff and veterans who I had talked with were horrible:\n  Veterans with PTSD waiting months to get treatment;\n  Veterans living in fear that facilities would be closed and access to \ncare would be cut off;\n  VA nurses working mandatory overtime, frequent back to back shifts \nbecause of staffing shortages.\n  But I wasn't getting complete answers in Washington. So to find the \ntruth I went to the VISN Directors themselves. By the middle of July, \nall 22 VISN Directors had responded. I am pleased to say that overall \ntheir responses were very candid. They took my letters in the spirit \nthat I intended: to understand the stakes involved in the VA health \ncare budget debate here in Washington. Many of these directors showed \nreal courage in responding as frankly as they did.\n  My staff summarized the responses in a report. I think the findings \nshould be of great concern to every one of my colleagues.\n  I can best describe the results in two points:\n  1. The legacy of the Clinton administration's budget will be fewer VA \nstaff, offering fewer services, and treating fewer Veterans.\n  2. The House and Senate cannot buy off the nations veterans by adding \na few hundred million dollars to the President's budget. Only full \nfunding will restore the VA to a capacity America's veterans deserve.\n  Let me be specific: The report finds that:\n  20 VISNs would have funding shortfalls under the Clinton Budget:\n  As many as 10,000 employees would be cut under the Clinton budget: 19 \nof the 22 VISNs indicated that staff reductions would be necessary \nunder the Clinton administration fiscal year 2000 budget. One VISN \nindicated that under the President's budget it would need to reduce \nemployment by 1,454 FTEEs, a cut of 15.4 percent of that VISN's \nworkforce.\n  10 VISNs would reduce patient workload under the Clinton budget: Only \none VISN said it could treat more veterans this year than last year \nunder this budget.\n  71,129 fewer veterans would be served under the Clinton budget: One \nVISN reported that it may need to eliminate services to as many as \n17,000 veterans. And this number is only the total from the 6 VISNs who \ngave us an estimated number. Again. Four other VISNs said they would \ntreat fewer veterans.\n  But even an increase of $500 million above the President's budget \nwould not reverse this trend. On the contrary, this report shows that \nan increase of such a small amount would still require hard choices and \nin some cases reductions in services, staff, and veterans served.\n  At least 12 VISNs would have short falls under Clinton budget plus \n$500 million: the largest deficit for an individual VISN was $100 \nmillion.\n  At least 13 VISNs would reduce staffing under the Clinton budget plus \n$500 million--in one VISN by over 1,100 employees.\n  At least 38,155 fewer veterans would be served under the Clinton \nbudget plus $500 million: Again, only one VISN said it could positively \nincrease services to veterans under this scenario. One VISN said it \nwould still turn away 9,600 veterans.\n  Veterans health care is at a crossroads. While the nation's twenty-\ntwo VISNs have struggled valiantly to do more with a shrinking budget, \nthe results of this survey suggest that urgent action is required to \nreverse what has become a funding crisis in VA health care--even as \nAmerica's veterans population becomes older and more reliant on VA \nservices. Spending decisions made by Congress in the next few months \nwill determine whether predictions made by the 22 VISNs become reality \nor a disaster narrowly averted.\n  This funding crisis will affect the World War II veteran, who has to \ndrive 6 hours to get care because funding problems prevented the VA \nfrom opening a community based out-patient clinic in his area.\n  This funding crisis will affect the VA nurse who has to work 16 hour \nshifts because hiring enough nurses is too expensive.\n  It is outrageous that with federal budget surpluses 20 VISNs will run \na deficit. It is outrageous that staff will be cut, or furloughed while \nbeing asked to work harder and longer hours. It is outrageous that over \n71,000 fewer sick and disabled veterans would be treated by the VA next \nyear even as they get older. These veterans need more health care not \nless.\n  But this story doesn't begin with my report. It is really a \ncontinuation of a battle begun 13 years ago with the release of the \nfirst Independent Budget by the major veterans groups. It is the \ncontinuation of a battle fought by Senator Johnson in the Budget \nCommittee--to provide full funding for veterans. And of a battle Tim \nand I fought on the floor on the Senate to provide full funding for \nveterans in the Senate budget resolution--a fight that we won with a \nunanimous vote to increase VA funding to the level recommended by the \nindependent budget.\n  But let me be clear, this is also a fight we must carry on to \nAppropriations.\n  What this report suggests is that we are through cutting the fat out \nof the VA budget. There is nothing left to pare but bone and muscle. \nThe VA has reached its fighting weight and has plunged dangerously \nbelow.\n  We've squeezed just about as much money out of the system as we \npossibly can. People on the front lines of veterans health care--\nwhether care providers or recipients--know that the VA health care \nsystem is desperately short of resources. I worry that my friend Lyle \nPearson, of North Mankato, decorated for his service in WWII, disabled \nvet, who receives care at VA facilities in Minnesota, will not get the \ncare he needs if the flat-line budget is not improved. I worry that \nveterans across the nation will be caught between increasing need and \nflat-lined funds. Veterans in Bangor, Maine are concerned because a VA \ninspector general report noted that their outpatient clinic had a 10 \nmonth backlog of new patients. Things were so bad last Fall that the \nclinic couldn't see walk-in patients or urgent-care patients, and there \nwas a four month wait to see the clinic's part-time psychiatrist. \nVeterans in Iowa are facing the possible closure of one of their three \nmajor veterans hospitals because of budget shortfalls.\n  The last chance for veterans this year is VA/HUD appropriations. But \nwe still don't know what the funding level will be the VA/HUD \nappropriations bills. In two and a half months, fiscal 1999 will end \nand we still don't even have a start on funding FY 2000. The bills have \nnot been marked up by the committee. This is unacceptable. If veterans \nfunding is allocated in the dark of night in a last minute omnibus \nspending bill, I fear the veteran will be short changed. Bring the VA/\nHUD bill to the floor. If there isn't enough money in it for veterans, \nwe'll amend it to add more.\n  A story in the July 18th edition of the Richmond Times Dispatch \nquotes in chairman of the VA/HUD appropriations Subcommittee as saying \nthat the budget situation that we face this year is very tough. That \nsame article says that VA health care might be facing a $1 billion cut.\n  I've heard that rumor. I've heard the rumor that veterans will get an \nincrease. Well let me start a rumor this morning that veterans can take \nto the bank: I give notice now to my colleagues that I will be on the \nfloor of the Senate offering an amendment to VA/HUD appropriations the \nfirst opportunity I get if the funding is not enough.\n  The veteran has borne the pain of budget cuts for too long. Tax cuts \nshould come after relief for veterans. Defense buildups should come \nafter relief for veterans. Let's make the veteran the priority again.\n  This is a fight to make VA health care the gold standard for health \ncare again. It is a fight to keep a promise to the veteran: If you \nserved your country your nation will stand up for you. If you were \ninjured you will be healed. If you are disabled, the country will raise \nyou up--not cast you aside.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me and the veterans in this fight. It \nwill take every U.S. Senator and every Member of the House. It will \ntake the VFW, the DAV, the PVA, the AMVETS, and the Vietnam Vets and \nall the other groups besides.\n\n[[Page S9198]]\n\n  Most importantly, America's veterans must demand it. Veterans need to \nhear the call one more time.\n  Together we can restore the funds and keep our covenant with the \nveteran.\n  Mr. President, today the Vice President announced that the White \nHouse is going to be asking for another $1 billion. Veterans \norganizations last week--I thank them--came together with us and \npresented this data. We said there are huge problems in the country; a \nlot of veterans aren't going to get the care they need and the care \nthat they deserve.\n  The Vice President stated the White House is going to ask for an \nadditional $1 billion. I thank the Vice President for his announcement. \nThat helps. However, we are going to have to do a lot better. That \nstill leaves us with a $2 billion shortfall. To my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and to the White House and to the Vice President, I \nsay that the veterans community is organizing. It is good grassroots \npolitics. They are going to hold us all accountable. We will have to do \na lot better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9198-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9198-S9199]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STOP WORSENING REPRESSION IN BURMA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to speak today on the \ndistressing human rights situation in Burma. The Association of \nSoutheast Asian Nations, ASEAN, held their Annual Ministerial Meeting \nin Singapore this weekend. And this week Secretary Albright will be in \nSingapore for the ASEAN regional forum and the Post-Ministerial \nConference. It is essential that during all of these meetings serious \nattention is focused on the worsening human rights situation in Burma.\n  We haven't heard much about Burma in the media recently. There have \nbeen no major news events in Burma recently to grab the attention of \nthe world: No Tiananmen Square scale massacres, no Kosovo scale \ndislocations, no bloody street clashes like we've seen in East Timor or \nIran. But in Burma today something equally chilling is proceeding, out \nof the world's view: A slow, systematic strangling of the democratic \nopposition. Since last fall, the ruling military regime has detained, \nthreatened and tortured opposition party members in increasing numbers. \nAt least 150 senior members of the opposition National League for \nDemocracy are being held in government detention centers. 3,000 \npolitical prisoners are held in Rangoon's notorious Insein prison. The \nregime has forced or coerced nearly 40,000 others to resign from the \nopposition party in recent months. In a videotape smuggled out of Burma \nin April and delivered to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, \nthe leader of the National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, said \ngovernment repression had worsened greatly in the past year on a scale \n``the world has not yet grasped.'' She said on the tape: ``What we have \nsuffered over the last year is far more than we have suffered over the \nlast six or seven years.'' According to one Western official, the \nregime intends to do nothing less than eradicate the opposition ``once \nand for all.''\n  Mr. President, most of this repression takes place quietly, through \nintimidation, arrests at night and other activities out of the public \neye. The Burmese regime carefully controls access to the country for \njournalists. So we have no video footage of the repression and only \nscant reporting from a few brave journalists and human rights workers. \nBut just because we cannot see what is going on in Burma does not mean \nwe can ignore it. It is all the more important for us to speak about \nthe situation there and show our support for the forces of democracy \nand human rights.\n\n  In July 1997, when Burma became a full ASEAN member, ASEAN countries \nclaimed that such a move would encourage the regime--the so-called \nState Peace and Development Council, or SPDC, to improve its human \nrights record. In fact the opposite has been true. As the Washington \nPost put it in a recent editorial: ``ASEAN's logic was familiar: \nEngagement with the outside world would persuade Burma's dictators to \nrelax their repressive rule. The verdict on this test case of the \nengagment theory thus far is clear: The behavior of the thugs who run \nBurma has worsened, and so has life for most Burmese.''\n  Not only has the SPDC stepped up its repression of the opposition \nparty, the National League for Democracy, it has intensified its \ncampaign of oppression against the country's ethnic minoriites. The \nregime has increased forcible relocation programs in the Karen, \nKarenni, and Shan States. The use of forced labor in all seven ethnic \nminority states continues at a high level, and forced portering occurs \nwherever there are counter-insurgency activities.\n  Amnesty International has just issued three new reports which \ndescribe in compelling detail the harsh, relentless mistreatment of \nfarmers and other civilians of ethnic minority groups in rural areas. \nLet me read a few brief passages from these excellent, detailed \nreports:\n  In February 1999, Amnesty International interviewed recently arrived \nShan refugees in Thailand in order to obtain an update on the human \nrights situation in the central Shan State. The pattern of violations \nhas remained the same, including forced labor and portering, \nextrajudicial killings, and ill-treatment of villagers. Troops also \nroutinely stole villagers' rice supplies, cattle, and gold, using them \nto sell or to feed themselves. According to reports, Army officers do \nnot provide their troops with adequate supplies so troops in effect \nlive off the villagers. One 33 year-old farmer from Murngnai township \ndescribed the relationship between the Shan people and the army:\n\n       Before, I learned that the armed forces are supposed to \n     protect people, but they are repressing people. If you can't \n     give them everything they want, they consider you as their \n     enemy . . . it is illogical, the army is forcing the people \n     to protect them, instead of vice-versa.\n\n  Amnesty International also reports similar abuses in Karen state:\n  Karen refugees interviewed in Thailand cited several reasons for \nleaving their homes: Some had previously been forced out of their \nvillages by the Burmese army and had been hiding in the forest. They \nfeared being shot on sight by the military because they occupied \n``black areas'' where the insurgents were allegedly active. Many others \nfled directly from their home villages in the face of village burnings, \nconstant demands for forced labor, looting of food and supplies, and \nextrajudicial killings at the hands of the military.\n  These human rights violations took place in the context of widespread \ncounter-insurgency activities against the Karen National Union (KNU) \none of the last remaining armed ethnic minority opposition groups still \nfighting the military government. Guerilla fighting between the two \ngroups continues, but the primary victims are Karen civilians. \nCivilians are at risk of torture and extrajudicial executions by the \nmilitary, who appear to automatically assume that they supported or \nwere even members of the KNU. Civilians also became sitting targets for \nconstant demands by the army for forced labor or portering duties. As \none Karen refugee explained to Amnesty International, ``Even though we \nare civilians, the military treats us like their enemy.''\n  A similar situation exists in Karenni State. Three-quarters of the \ndozens of Karenni refugees interviewed by Amnesty International in \nFebruary 1999 were forced by the military to work as unpaid laborers. \nThey were in effect an unwilling pool of laborers which the military \ndrew from to work in military bases, build roads, and clear land. When \nasked why they decided to flee to Thailand, many refugees said that \nforced labor duties made it impossible for them to survive and do work \nto support themselves. Several of them also mentioned that forced labor \ndemands had increased during 1998.\n  Unpaid forced labor is in contravention of the International Labor \nOrganization's (ILO) Convention No. 29, which the government of Burma \nsigned in 1955. The ILO has repeatedly raised the issue with the \ngovernment and in June 1996 took the rare step of appointing a \nCommission of Inquiry. In August 1998 the Commission published a \ncomprehensive report, which found the government of Burma ``. . . \nguilty of an international crime that is also, if committed in a \nwidespread or systematic manner, a crime against humanity.''\n  Mr. President, I am under no illusion that the military regime in \nBurma will reform overnight and end its human rights abuses. But I \nthink it is critically important that we keep the\n\n[[Page S9199]]\n\nworld's attention focused on the terrible repression of democracy and \nabuse of ethnic minorities going on there. I hope our message of \nconcern, backed by the invaluable reporting done by Amnesty \nInternational, will get through somehow to the Burmese people and to \ntheir courageous leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.\n  ASEAN member countries are gathering in Singapore currently for a \nseries of meetings. We need to encourage them to develop a new strategy \nfor dealing with the SPDC's intransigence regarding human rights. Now \nthat criticism of fellow ASEAN members is no longer completely taboo, I \nhope some of the ASEAN countries that have improved their own human \nrights records will take the initiative to prod the Burmese to move in \nthe right direction. The ASEAN regional forum (ARF), which deals with \nAsian security issues, will meet at the same time and should address \nthis as a security problem. Western nations, including the U.S., who \nwill also be present at the ARF should work closely with all concerned \ncountries to encourage the SPDC to improve its human rights record.\n  Even if we don't see quick improvement, those of us who care deeply \nabout human rights have a duty to keep the plight of the Burmese people \nbefore the world community. I am committed to doing that, and I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in pressing the Burmese regime for real, \nmeasurable improvements in these areas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9199-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9199-S9209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RESTORATION OF THE ENFORCEMENT OF RULE XVI--Continued\n\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I express my appreciation for the statement \nof the Senator from Minnesota regarding the rule change in his usual \ndeliberate style.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the resolution that \nwill be before us for a vote at the end of the afternoon, S. Res. 160, \nto restore enforcement of rule XVI.\n  Mr. President, I believe in the Senate as an institution. I think it \nis an important part of the workings of our democracy that the Senate \ncarry out its duties and responsibilities in a way that it has done \nthroughout the more than 200-year history of our Republic.\n  In a sense, this is a difficult issue for me because I voted not to \nwaive rule XVI, or, in effect, not to overrule the ruling of the Chair, \nat the time the ruling was made. That, of course, was a motion offered \nby my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I thought, well, we \nreally should not change the way we do business. But what has happened \nsince that time is, increasingly, that the minority has been really \nfrustrated by the lack of opportunity to come to the floor of the \nSenate to offer its positions, to have them considered and voted upon. \nTherefore, I am going to vote against this resolution when it comes to \na vote this afternoon simply, among other things, to make a very strong \nstatement of protest against the procedures that are now being followed \nin the Senate, which are effectively preventing us from considering \nimportant issues.\n  Now, repeatedly, we have had a situation in which the majority \nleader, once a measure is offered, fills up the amendment tree by \ngaining first recognition, which is the majority leader's entitlement \nunder our process, and then the minority has no opportunity to offer \nits proposals. I ask the minority whip and the assistant minority \nleader, isn't it the case that time and time again we have simply been \nblocked out from even putting an issue before the Senate? I am not \ncomplaining about being blocked out if we then go to a vote on it--\nwell, I would complain, but you decide these things by majority vote. \nWe are even being precluded from offering amendments in order to have \npositions considered; is that not correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is absolutely true. For example, on the issue of the \nlockbox, cloture has been filed three to five times. We have never \nuttered a single word in a debate about that issue. We have never had \nthe opportunity to offer a single amendment. We agree with the lockbox \nconcept, but does it have to be theirs? Can't we try to change it a \nlittle bit?\n  Mr. SARBANES. As I understand it, the way that has been structured \nnow, the minority is totally precluded from offering any alternative \nproposal or any different proposal because they have completely blocked \nus out from offering any amendments; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is absolutely true. I ask my friends, are they so \nafraid of discussing an issue, and are they so afraid they will lose a \ncouple of Members and we will be right? Is that the problem? I don't \nknow. Why won't they let us at least offer an amendment?\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. It raises this question in a democracy: What happens \nwhen you can't pose issues and have them debated and voted upon?\n  It seems to me an elementary way of proceeding. Traditionally, the \nSenate has always offered that opportunity, as a matter of fact. I have \nbeen in this body a long time and I can recall when, not too long ago, \nwe were in the majority, and even earlier when that was the case, when \nthe Senate was essentially run in a way that enabled Members to bring \nup proposals and have them considered and voted upon. It by no means \nguaranteed that your proposal was going to prevail; You might lose, and \nthat was obvious. But that is part and parcel of the democratic \nprocess. But not to even be able to offer your amendments--and, of \ncourse, this resolution would, in effect, limit down the opportunities \nas well.\n  Essentially, if you had a Senate that was operating in the \ntraditional way, you could offer your proposals. That sort of \nlimitation is one that we traditionally lived with. But this was lifted \nby the majority, and at the same time they did this, subsequently, they \nhave increasingly developed other ways of blocking the minority out \nfrom simply laying their positions before the Senate for consideration. \nIs that not the case?\n  Mr. REID. It is absolutely the case. The fact is that all we want is \nto be treated like the Senate. My friend from Maryland served in the \nHouse of Representatives, as I did. That is a huge body, 435 Members. \nThey need specific rules--and they have always had them--to move \nlegislation along. You can't have unlimited debate in that body. But \nthe Senate was set up differently. We do not need, or should we have, a \nrule on every piece of legislation that comes through, as does the \nHouse of Representatives. Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I agree completely with that. In fact, even in the \nHouse the procedure has gotten so rigid that there is significant \ncomplaint that they do not have an opportunity when important measures \nare before----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the minority has expired, with the \nexception of 15 minutes that was reserved.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, since nobody is on the floor, I ask \nunanimous consent that we be allowed to continue for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, in responding to the \nquestion asked, with his experience in the House and in the Senate, can \nhe tell us how he believes the Senate should be treated differently \nthan the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, the thing that struck me when I came to the \nSenate from the House was, in a sense, how much more wide open the \nSenate was in terms of considering proposals of the Members of the \nSenate. In the House, of course, you have title rules. You adopt a \nrule, and that limits the amendments that can be offered. We even had \nthe so-called closed rule in which no amendment could be offered. You \neither had to vote up or down on the measure that was reported by the \ncommittee to the floor of the House. But usually you would get a rule \nthat would perhaps give the minority an opportunity to offer a couple \nof amendments. One came to the Senate and discovered that both the \nmajority and minority Members had much more of an opportunity to have \namendments offered by the body and considered and voted upon.\n\n  Of course, in order to control that procedure, we had a rule that you \ncould\n\n[[Page S9200]]\n\nnot legislate on an appropriations bill, which seemed to make good \nsense. Now, that was overturned a few years back when the majority \nwanted to have a certain measure considered and the Chair ruled that it \nconstituted legislation on an appropriations bill; therefore, it was \nnot in order. The majority--the other side of the aisle--then went \nforward and appealed the ruling of the Chair and they overruled the \nChair. That established the precedent that you could offer legislation \non an appropriations bill.\n  Mr. REID. I ask permission to ask the Senator a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I remember that very clearly because I was the Senator who \nraised the point of order. It was on an appropriations bill, a \nsupplemental appropriations bill. The junior Senator from Texas offered \nan amendment on the Endangered Species Act that would do great harm to \nthat act. I raised a point of order it was legislating on an \nappropriations bill. The Chair, without question, upheld my point of \norder. There was an appealing of the rule, as the Senator said, and a \nlongstanding rule, with all the precedence, was turned on its head.\n  Now it has been 4 years, and we have been working under this \nsituation that was created by the majority. The minority didn't do \nthat. But I say to my friend, the reason we in the minority are so \nconcerned is because it is not only that rule they are going to \noverturn, the fact of the matter is that we don't have any \nopportunities to offer amendments, to debate substantive issues in this \ncountry, based upon the gag rule placed on all legislation brought \nhere; isn't that true?\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely correct. What has happened is \nlongstanding precedent was overturned. Therefore, you could legislate \non an appropriations bill. That is the precedent we have been working \nunder for the last 3 or 4 years. On occasion, the minority--our side--\nhas offered legislation on an appropriations bill. Now the majority \nwants to go back to the old ruling. Having overturned the old ruling \nthemselves, they now want to return to it.\n  Well, as an institutionalist, you know the old rule made some sense. \nBut what has happened to the Senate in the interim, in the meantime, \nsince the overturning of this old rule, is that other techniques have \nalso been developed to block the minority from offering amendments on \nthe various matters that come before the Senate. So, in effect, they \nare closing out the minority from having any voice, any opportunity to \npresent our positions, any opportunity to have a judgment made on our \npositions.\n  I am very frank to tell you that is not the way the Senate ought to \nwork.\n  Previously, even when we had the old rule, we didn't have a couple \nwith these other techniques that are now being used in order to keep \nthe minority from bringing their position before this body. Until we \ncan remedy that situation and get some assurance that we are going to \nhave an opportunity to really present our amendments in an orderly and \nreasonable fashion, I am not going to support any measure that could \nhave the possibility of closing out some opportunity that we now have \nin order to present our positions.\n  Mr. REID. May I ask my friend another question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that the minority leader is going to \noffer an amendment to S. Res. 160 which will reinstate the scope of the \nconference report rule? That is when you go to conference and the \nconference committee must stay within the scope of the two bills on \nwhich they are working. It will be interesting to me to see if the \nmajority will vote to support the overturning of rule XVI, which we \nknow they will do, to see if they are logically consistent by going \nahead and voting to also reinstate rule XXVIII. Also, this precedent \nwas overturned in 1996 on the reauthorization bill.\n  Does the Senator think it would be consistent for them to vote to \nmake rule XVI the way it used to be and rule XXVIII the way it used to \nbe? How can you vote for one and not the other?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Absolutely. In fact, the rule XXVIII issue is also very \nimportant. That was also overturned by the majority to permit matters \nto be included in a conference report that were not within either of \nthe two bills that the House and the Senate sent to the conference. Of \ncourse, what that means is that a conference can come back with \nsomething that is outside of the scope of the conference and present it \nto these bodies--a matter that neither the House nor the Senate \nconsidered in the course of sending that legislation to conference.\n  Talk about potential mischief. You could bring back in here, \ncontained in a conference report with all of the sort of protections \nthat a conference report has in terms of its consideration, and so \nforth, matters that were outside of what was sent to conference. The \nminority leader is trying to remedy that matter.\n  I can't for the life of me see why someone who supports S. Res. 160 \nwould oppose the proposal of the minority leader. But I guess we will \ndiscover that when we come to a vote on the matter later this \nafternoon.\n  It eventually comes back to the very basic question. That is, What \nare to be the rights of the minority in this body? One of the great \nstrengths of the Senate traditionally has been that it has accorded to \nthe minority a real opportunity to participate in the consideration of \nmatters on the floor of the Senate. The minority has not traditionally \nbeen closed out of participating. In fact, some have argued that \nminorities traditionally have been given too much of an opportunity to \nparticipate. They argue that.\n  But what has been happening in recent years is, the majority has been \nusing its majority to overrule these precedents of the Senate, which \neffectively then allows the majority to do what it wants to do and \ncompletely leaves the minority outside of the process.\n\n  That is, in a sense, the issue that is at stake. That is why there \nhas been such a strong reaction to this proposal, because S. Res. 160 \ncomes in the context of these other matters that have been happening, \nall of which have moved in the same direction; namely, to preclude the \nminority from having a fair opportunity to present its positions to the \nSenate, to have them considered, and to have judgment rendered upon \nthem. It is fundamentally changing the nature of the Senate.\n  One of the great things about American democracy that any political \ncommentator always points to is that, unlike many systems, it isn't run \nin such a tight, rigid, disciplined fashion that the minority can be \nexcluded from any opportunity to be heard and to have its positions \nconsidered. Particularly the Senate has been the great bulwark of \nstrength in that regard.\n  Now we have a proposal to overturn the very precedent which the \nmajority themselves established only a few years ago, and to do so at \nthe very time that increasingly the majority is using other techniques \nto block the minority from presenting its position, including, of \ncourse, this technique of filling up the amendment tree so that no \namendments can be offered.\n  We really are moving very much in the direction of saying to the \nminority, in effect, well, you can come here and sit at your desks, but \nthat is about all you can do around here; there is not much else you \ncan do in terms of trying to constructively affect the legislative \nprocess.\n  I am very frank to say that I think we must resist that development. \nI think it is significantly undercutting the nature of the Senate as an \ninstitution and the role it has played in the country's history. I \nthink this is a very important debate. I think the matter that is \ncoming before us has a great deal to do with saying how the institution \nought to run.\n  I must say that if the procedures were all fair and if we were given \na fair opportunity to present our positions, there might be something \nthat could be said for going back and treating what was done as a \nmistake, as some of us assert it was at the time. But in light of these \nsubsequent developments, it seems to me that the minority has to really \ninsist that no opportunity to offer its position should be denied to \nthem. Therefore, that is the position I intend to take when this matter \ncomes to a vote at the end of the day.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S9201]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be \ncharged to the majority.\n  The reason I say that is so the Presiding Officer, either in his \ncapacity as Presiding Officer or as a Senator from Arkansas--we have \nbeen very diligent in the minority in using up all of our time. Both \nleaders have sought to have a time in the evening to complete our vote. \nIf the time doesn't run off, the time is charged to the majority now. \nThis could go on forever and we wouldn't vote until sometime late at \nnight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be the case.\n  If there is some objection from the majority leader, he can come \nright back and change that.\n  That is my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ALLARD). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I inquire how the time has been divided and what time is \nremaining on each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has remaining 54\\1/2\\ minutes; \nthe minority has used all of their allocated time. Fifteen minutes at \nthe end has been allocated to Senator Daschle and there is an allotment \nof 15 minutes remaining for the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, one further parliamentary inquiry. That \nmeans, then, during the quorum call all time is coming out of the \nmajority side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, then I yield myself time out of this 54 \nminutes, realizing I also would have an opportunity to use my 15 \nminutes in closing. But there has been so much revisionist history \nespoused on the floor of the Senate today, I just did not want to let 1 \nhour 15 minutes go by without maybe correcting some of the record or \nputting an accurate history back into the Congressional Record.\n  A famous quote comes to my mind, from what I have heard here today. I \nfear ``[thou] doth protest too much.'' In other words, there is an \nawful lot of protesting by the Democrats that has been going on that \nmakes anybody who is a dispassionate, disinterested watcher just \nlooking in, inquire why are they protesting so much?\n  I have to note the inconsistency that is involved, too. Basically \nwhat the minority is saying, the Democrats are saying: As a protest \nstatement, we are going to vote against reinstating rule XVI but we \nwant to turn right around and reinstate rule XXVIII.\n  This is Senate gibberish, I know, but it is inconsistent because they \nare saying we want to continue to offer legislation on appropriations \nbills but we do not want anything coming back out of conference between \nthe House and Senate that exceeds the scope of what was in the bill. I \nthink there is an inconsistency there. I think we ought to take a close \nlook at the scope of the conferences question. We have time to do that. \nWe have committees, a Rules Committee, and we have a Governmental \nAffairs Committee that have been considering rules changes. I think \nthere are a number of rules in the Senate that should be reviewed.\n  I think budget rules should be reviewed. For instance, this very week \non the reconciliation bill which would provide some tax relief, at the \nend of the 20 hours, if amendments are still pending, we still have \nthis very poor procedure where we might have to have what is called a \n``vote-arama,'' of one vote after the other, one right behind the other \nevery 2 minutes; I guess it would be 12 minutes between the votes--a \nvery poor way to do legislative business. I think we ought to take a \nlook at that and see if we cannot find a way to improve it. So there \nare a number of things we can do that I think will help the way the \nSenate does business.\n  I would like to go back and remind Senators how this rule was \nchanged, this rule XVI. Rule XVI was overturned by the Senate on March \n16, 1995, on the Department of Defense supplemental appropriations \nbill. Senator Hutchison of Texas appealed the ruling of the Chair, in \nthat the Chair ruled her amendment regarding a restriction on \nappropriations funds to make a final determination with respect to the \nendangered species list was legislation on an appropriations bill. In \nother words, this involved the Endangered Species Act. The Chair ruled \nthis was legislating on an appropriations bill and therefore was out of \norder.\n  That ruling was appealed. Many Members on the Republican side of the \naisle supported her appeal. As a result, the Parliamentarian can no \nlonger entertain a point of order that extraneous language is \nlegislation on an appropriations bill. Again, keep in mind that up \nuntil that point that point of order would have been upheld by the \nChair. That ruling was overturned and therefore a new precedent was \nset.\n\n  Interestingly, in that vote, No. 107, on March 16, 1995, 54 \nRepublicans voted to overturn the Chair, 44 Democrats voted to sustain \nthe Chair's ruling.\n  I am sure for the most part on both sides what was really being voted \non was the substance of this endangered species list amendment. For \ninstance, one interesting quote on that occasion came from our \ncolleague, Senator Reid, who has been on the floor a good deal today. I \nthink he summed up what was going on with regard to this particular \namendment because I think probably, without putting words in his mouth, \nhe was at least sympathetic to what Senator Hutchison was trying to do. \nBut this is what Senator Reid said:\n\n       But this is not the way to treat a very important matter. I \n     am very upset. I am going to do everything that I can to make \n     sure the President, if in fact this bill passes, will veto it \n     if we start conducting business in this way.\n\n  Basically he had indicated, I believe, that while he had some \nunderstanding and sympathy on the issue, he thought this was no way to \nbe doing business.\n  As a result of the overturning of the Chair, the appropriations \nprocess has certainly lost some of its legitimacy and has been \ncomplicated by the number of amendments, and their variety--and I am \ngoing to cite some amendments that were offered. The appropriations \nprocess is a very important part of our constitutional duty to the \nFederal Government. Yet with each passing year since this vote in 1995, \nit gets more difficult to get our appropriations bills through because \nof all the legislating that occurs on the appropriations bills.\n  Let me emphasize, while I thought that most of the comments from the \nDemocratic side today were very partisan, I don't view this as \npartisan. It should not be. The discussions we have had across the \naisle over the past 4 years have been that this was a mistake; we ought \nto work together to change it. But let me give a recent example. This \npast week on the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill, I do not \nknow how many amendments showed up on that bill, probably a hundred or \nso. I know of at least one specific example. I will not cite the \nspecific bill because that Senator would know what I was talking about \nand would not feel that it would be appropriate that I cite his \nparticular bill, but it was a whole bill that had not been introduced, \nhad not been referred to committee, had not been reviewed by the \ncommittee, and would significantly change the way a process works in \nthe Federal Government. That was going to be offered to the \nappropriations bill. That Senator was on my side of the aisle.\n  So I really question that that is the way Senators would want this \nbody to work, where whole bills will be cut out of whole cloth and \nbrought to the floor of the Senate in a Senator's hand and he or she \nwill say: I want this bill added to the appropriations bill.\n  That is no way to legislate. We should not be doing that. But that is \nthe kind of thing that has been happening since we had this ruling and \nthen the appeal of the ruling of the Chair in 1995 that set this new \nprecedent.\n  The Senator from California was here earlier today commenting on \nthis. Yet when this vote took place, she said:\n\n\n[[Page S9202]]\n\n\n       I think to come to this floor of the U.S. Senate and to add \n     an amendment to the Defense emergency supplemental bill that \n     deals with a very important and sensitive environmental \n     issue is simply not the right way to legislate.\n\n  Holy smoke, she is absolutely right. She said that on March 16, 1995. \nThat was not what I thought I heard her saying today. Maybe I \nmisinterpreted what was being said today. But that is the point. \nSenators will have an opportunity to offer amendments on other bills. \nThe point is made quite often in this body, unlike the House--and \nnobody wants to make the Senate the House--any Senator can come to the \nfloor on a bill involving, let's just say bankruptcy, and he or she can \noffer an amendment to deal with health care or can offer something to \ndo with the Forest Service. We do not have these strict germaneness \nrules. We do take up legislative issues.\n  But one of the reasons why the majority leader cannot bring more \nlegislative bills to the floor is because, in many instances, it has \ntaken so long to get through other issues such as juvenile justice or \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights or other appropriations bills; therefore, \nmaking it very difficult to bring up other important legislative issues \nsuch as the Federal aviation reauthorization bill, the bankruptcy bill \nthat I referred to, or the nuclear waste bill that has been reported \nout of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. It makes it more and \nmore difficult for anything to be done other than appropriations and \nreconciliation. And the reconciliation procession is very important \nbecause it is the only way you can get a bill dealing with taxes, for \ninstance, to the floor without it being threatened by a filibuster or \nall kinds of other Senate legislative maneuvers.\n  This is one where you bring it up, you have a specified period of \ntime, you have an amendment process, you go through those amendments, \nand then you have a vote. That process moves quite easily through here. \nRight now we are in a period where appropriations bills and \nreconciliation are about all we can get done.\n  There are complaints about filling up the tree. I have not gone back \nand done the research, but this process of so-called ``filling up the \ntree'' again is Senate language that is used to describe that all the \ndifferent opportunities to amend are filled with amendments. I didn't \ninvent that procedure. Other Senators who have been majority leader \ncertainly have used that. Senator Mitchell used it. Senator Byrd used \nit. That is a very legitimate tactic or process which can be used, one \nthat should not be used all the time, and one that has been used \nrelatively rarely, but it certainly is a legitimate thing the majority \nleader can do to focus debate and to get debate concluded in a \nreasonable period of time.\n  Let me give some examples of the kinds of things that have been tying \nup the Senate since we have been without the ability to strike them \ndown by using rule XVI. First of all, it seems to me if you look at \nhistory, probably there has been an increasing number of amendments \nwhich have been offered on these appropriations bills. It seems now it \nis quite often within the range of 80 to 100 or 120 amendments on just \nabout anything that comes along. Every Senator dumps his out basket on \nthe floor of the Senate with every amendment he or she has ever dreamed \nof and some of the things with which we have to deal on appropriations \nbills, where it clearly would have been legislating on an \nappropriations bill, dealing with grasshopper research, lettuce genetic \nbreeding, peach tree short life, tomato wilting, the feasibility of \nusing poultry litter as possible fuel. Other examples are: removing of \ncomputer games from Government computers, repainting of water towers, \nswimming pool construction, the study of green tree snakes. These may \nbe legitimate agriculture issues, but with others, they certainly would \nbe considered to be frivolous in nature in terms of being offered as \namendments on appropriations bills.\n\n  While we have those examples, the ones that are the most startling \nand striking to me are the ones where whole bills or major amendments \nare offered on the floor of the Senate to appropriations bills that \nclearly is legislating on an appropriations bill, that do not apply in \nany way in terms of substance, where the committees have not been \nallowed to act, where the committee chairman has not had any input. It \nis time we bring this process under control. On more than one occasion, \nthe exchanges between the Democratic leader and the majority leader \nhave indicated that there has been a willingness or a desire on both \nsides to begin bringing this under control.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at how this happened. A lot of people on \nboth sides of the aisle at the time it happened did not realize the \nsignificance of it and, secondly, said at the time: Yes, this is \nprobably a mistake.\n  It has been a tool the Democrats have used over the past 4 years, and \nthat is the way it works in the Senate. When you have a precedent, then \nSenators have a right to take advantage of it until a new one is set or \nuntil the Senate decides it is going in some other direction. There is \nnothing unusual about that at all.\n  We should reinstate this rule XVI. We should look at a number of \nrules and budget procedures we have. We have appropriators who have \ncome to me and expressed concern about this. People with a long history \nof paying attention to the rules of the Senate and the budget \nprocedures and the appropriations bills, such as Senator Domenici and \nSenator Stevens and others, have said we need to get this back on \ntrack, we need to change the way we are doing business.\n  I hope we can get through the appropriations process this year as \nsoon as possible, so we can do some of these other bills that are very \nimportant to our country, so Senators will have an opportunity to fully \ndebate and discuss these issues and offer amendments to issues that are \noutside the appropriations process.\n  I hope we will have time to work with serious leaders in the Senate \nwho are worried about the budget process, who are worried about the \nrules, and have some debate on the floor and make some changes. There \nis no desire at all to set up a Rules Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives sense, but there is a desire by this majority leader, \nas by every majority leader, to find a way to move the process and the \nlegislation through the Senate.\n  We did a marvelous job last week, if you look at it. It did not look \npretty at various times, but last week we did pass reorganization of \nthe Department of Energy. After probably a month of resisting doing the \nfundamental reorganization we need at the Department of Energy to stop \nthe leaks of our very important nuclear secrets to China or anybody \nelse, we finally got it to a vote last Tuesday, and the vote was, I \nthink, 96-1--overwhelmingly bipartisan.\n  One might ask: Why did it take you so long? That is the way the \nSenate works sometimes. We have to think about it; we have to have \ndebate; we work out some amendments. Also, it might be that nobody \nwanted to be on record as being against reorganization of the \nDepartment of Energy. Again, it was dragged out, and we had problems \ngetting to the intelligence authorization bill. We even had to have a \ncloture vote to get to the intelligence authorization bill, the bill \nthat provides for the intelligence information for our Federal \nGovernment, for the CIA.\n\n  I did not want to have to file a cloture motion on that, but I was \ntold, in effect, that the Democrats were going to filibuster the motion \nto proceed. That meant the Democrats were going to filibuster even \ntaking up the bill because they were not ready to debate the \nreorganization of the Department of Energy, I guess. I did not quite \nunderstand it. In order to get to a very important, very sensitive \nissue such as the intelligence authorization, the intelligence \ncommunity of our Federal Government, which is such an important part of \nthe defense of this country, the majority leader of the Senate had to \nfile a cloture motion to even take up the bill for its consideration. \nIf a change of heart had not happened, I would have had to file a \nsecond cloture motion to get to the substance of the bill.\n  The pontificating we do sometimes around here, the posturing about, \noh, we are cut off--what is a leader supposed to do when told the \nmotion to proceed to a bill is going to be filibustered? At that point, \nI have to take action to move a bill, such as the intelligence \nauthorization, forward. When the smoke cleared, it passed. We got that \nbill done.\n\n[[Page S9203]]\n\n  We got to the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill, a bill that \nquite often takes days, sometimes weeks, sometimes longer than weeks, \nwith lots of amendments offered. As a matter of fact, with the \ncooperation of both sides of the aisle, on Thursday night at \napproximately 9:45 that legislation was passed.\n  Today I went over and shook the hand of Senator Reid of Nevada and \nsaid: It would not have happened without your aggressive work in \nclearing amendments that could be accepted, in getting amendments \nwithdrawn that really did not need to be offered.\n  We did it on both sides of the aisle. I went to Republicans and said: \nYou do not want to do this here. And Senator Daschle did the same thing \non the Democratic side of the aisle. That is how one works through the \nappropriations bills because many of these amendments had no business \nbeing offered at that hour on that bill and on those subjects with no \nconsideration being given by the committees or by the chairmen.\n  If we can reinstate rule XVI today, we will see our appropriations \nbills able to go through without as much dilatory action or without as \nmany amendments that really are strictly legislation on appropriations \nbills. I do believe that on both sides of the aisle Members know this \nprecedent needs to be put back in place.\n  Will it cure all the problems? No. As a matter of fact, Senators may \njust use other dilatory tactics, and if they can find a way to do that \nor if they can appeal the ruling of the Chair, maybe the precedent will \nbe reversed again. That will be the will of the body. I will have no \ngreat concern about that. Then we can move on from this to the next \nstep.\n  Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd have proposed amendments that will \ngo beyond what reinstating this particular rule XVI will do. I hope we \nwould take a look at that before this year is out.\n\n  So I may have to come back later on to respond in wrapup on some of \nthese issues. But I do, again, refer you to the Shakespeare quote from \nHamlet: I do think you ``protest too much'' as we work to reinstate a \nprecedent that we all know will serve the institution quite well.\n  Mr. REID. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield. You have no time; you have used it all \ntoday. We understand you had a lot of speakers. I would like to reserve \nas much of our time as possible for other Senators who wish to come to \nthe floor to speak on this subject on our side.\n  Having said that, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you.\n  I say to my friend, for whom I have the utmost respect, I know how \nhard you work trying to move things along. I have tried to be as much \nhelp as I can be. But from the most junior Member of the Senate, \nSenator Bayh, to the most senior Member on this side, Senator Byrd, \nthere has been a general belief today that we need to do more \nlegislating, with fewer quorum calls; some more debate needs to take \nplace. So I hope my friend understands the belief of the membership of \nthe minority that we need to do more legislating.\n  I also say to my friend that I have asked--in colloquies here with \nMembers from the majority who came to speak today--how is it logically \nconsistent that you can vote to change rule XVI and not vote to change \nrule XXVIII? And they all three said--I only asked three the question--\nit is not logical to do that.\n  I hope that the majority would take a very close look at rule XXVIII \nto see to it that we do not wind up with a situation like we wound up \nin last fall, with a 1,500-page bill that just a few people developed.\n\n  So I hope, I repeat, that the Senator will listen to the spirit of \nthe debate today. It was not acrimonious. I think it was constructive \ncriticism. We all love the Senate. You are the leader. We recognize \nthat. But we need to move along and do more legislating as the Senate, \nwe think, should be legislating.\n  I thank you very much for yielding.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, having been majority leader in the 95th and \nthe 96th and again in the 100th Congress, I want to assure the \ndistinguished majority leader that I have experienced all of his \ntroubles, all of his problems. And this business of having to deal with \na filibuster on a motion to proceed is nothing new around here. That \nhas been the case for decades. So the distinguished majority leader is \nnot experiencing something that I did not experience or that other \nleaders did not experience.\n  The motion to proceed to the civil rights bill of 1964 was debated 2 \nweeks. That was just the motion to proceed. And the bill itself was \nbefore the Senate 77 days. It was actually debated 57 days, including 6 \nSaturdays. All in all, including the time that it took to get up the \nmotion to proceed, and the time to deal with the bill itself, and then \nincluding, I believe it was, 9 days following cloture before the vote \non passage occurred on the bill, it took 103 days--103 calendar days--\nto deal with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  I was the only non-Southern Democrat--the only non-Southern \nDemocrat--to vote against that bill. And I was against cloture on it. \nOther than Senator Hayden and Senator Bible, I was the only non-\nSouthern Democrat to vote against cloture. So I have been through all \nthese travails and trials that the majority leader has experienced. And \nI empathize with him and sympathize with him, because I have been \nthere, too. But it is nothing new to be confronted with a possible \nfilibuster on a motion to proceed. I had to deal with that many times.\n  Mr. LOTT. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. The distinguished Senator has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Didn't the Senator occasionally file a cloture motion on a \nfilibuster of a motion to proceed?\n  Mr. BYRD. I did.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is what I have had to do on occasion, too. And \nsometimes the majority leader might decide not to do that, to go ahead.\n  Mr. BYRD. This leader did so on occasion. But this leader did not do \nit all the time, nor did this leader fill the tree all the time. I \nfilled the tree a few times, very few times, but not all the time.\n  I do not call up many amendments here. I am not one of those whom the \ndistinguished majority leader has in mind when he talks about Senators \ncalling up many amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is right.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not do that often. But Senators do have the right to \noffer amendments. The distinguished majority leader has his problems. I \nknow them. I know them well. I sympathize with him and want to work \nwith him and want to help him.\n  I call attention to the fact that there are 63 Senators in this body \nwho never served in this body when I was majority leader--63. I said \nthis morning that more than a third, but it was actually almost two-\nthirds of the Members of this body were not here when I was majority \nleader.\n  I was glad to hear the Senator quote Shakespeare. Let me quote from \nShakespeare also:\n\n     'Tis in my memory lock'd\n     And you yourself shall keep the key of it.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I certainly will always want to cooperate with the \ndistinguished leader when I can. I have to say I think there is too \nmuch partisanship in this Senate, on both sides, far more partisanship \nin the Senate than there was when I came here. I would urge again that \nthe distinguished Majority Leader let Democrats call up amendments and \nthat he call up legislative bills, and thereby give Senators a chance \nto call up their amendments so that they will not have to resort to \noffering them on appropriations bills.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, could I respond to some of the comments \nSenator Byrd has made?\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LOTT. Because there are several points you have made to which I \nwould like to respond.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LOTT. We have other Senators who may want to speak, but I did not \nwant to interrupt if you were about to make a point. But I do want to \ncomment on some of those issues that you mentioned.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the Senator will proceed.\n  Mr. LOTT. First of all, with regard to the partisanship, as a matter \nof fact, I\n\n[[Page S9204]]\n\nthink I would have to disagree with the Senator from West Virginia. I \nhave not been in the Senate nearly as long as he has, but I have been \nworking with Congress for 30 years--30 years. I am 57. I came here when \nI was 26. I was a staff member for 4 years; 16 years in the House. I \nsaw partisanship at its worst in the House when I was a Member and part \nof an oppressed minority in the House.\n  I have been in the Senate for going on 11 years. I really do not feel \nthat much partisanship. I feel a real warmth toward a number of \nDemocrats. And I thought it was just this year, just a short time ago, \nthat we came through a historic impeachment trial in which we stood in \nthese aisles--this center aisle here--together and said, this was a \ntough task; it was a constitutional requirement we had a duty to do. We \nperformed our duty, and whether you agreed with the end result or not, \nmost folks felt it was done fairly and not with shrill partisanship.\n  Even when we disagree on substantive issues, I think the Senate is \nalmost the only place in this city where it does not get to be shrill \npartisanship. I see the distinguished ranking member from New York of \nthe Finance Committee. The Finance Committee is probably the most \nbipartisan, nonpartisan committee in the entire Congress. We do not \nalways come out with a bipartisan bill, but usually we report a bill \nthat has votes from both sides of the aisle. That was the case just \nlast week on the tax bill; a couple Democrats voted with the \nRepublicans.\n  I don't believe that is partisanship, No. 1. The reason I think it \ndoesn't get that shrill is because we are sensitive to each other's \nneeds to be heard, to our individual needs. We have tried to be a \nSenate that understands that Senators have families, and I think just \nthat relationship helps because Members are not exhausted and mad at \neach other. I want to continue to further that.\n  In terms of giving the Democrats a chance, while there has been a lot \nof hollering about it, the fact is, you have been getting a pretty good \nchance. As a matter of fact, on the juvenile justice bill, I could have \ngone through all kinds of contortions and gyrations to try to block \nthat, but I thought it was a bill that came out of the Judiciary \nCommittee on a bipartisan basis after 3 years of work, and we ought to \ntake it up.\n  Did I like the way it went on a week more than I had been told it \nwould take to get it done? No. As the Senator from West Virginia said, \nthe Senate had to work its will, and there were more amendments cooking \nout there. I didn't run around out here trying to block them. Some of \nmy colleagues said I should have done that. We worked our will.\n  We wrangled around on the Patients' Bill of Rights for almost a year. \nWe could have done that bill last fall, but we couldn't come to \nagreement. We came to agreement. We took the bill up. We got it done.\n  Now, there were some speeches made the day before we completed that \nbill about how terrible the process was, but the night we got it done, \nSenators on both sides stood up and said: Well, I don't like all this \nand it wasn't perfect, but basically we got our fair shot, and we got \nour work done.\n  As far as giving people the chance, I have a list, two pages of bills \nthat have been done this year that are not appropriations bills. We did \nthe first concurrent budget resolution on time, only the second time in \n25 years. We provided small business loan guarantees to small \nbusinesses that have year 2000 problems. We passed a national missile \ndefense bill, which the President signed just the other day. And by the \nway, in his statement with his signing it, he misstated what the bill \ndid. We passed a soldiers' and sailors' pay raise bill. We passed \neducation flexibility. We had some Democrats who worked on that all the \nway. The President was saying all the way: I will veto it; I will veto \nit. Finally we got it done and he signed it. We passed the water \nresources bill. This is an area where we haven't passed an \nauthorization bill, I think, in 5 years. We have passed it. The House \nhas passed it, and after a lot of work, we actually got it into \nconference. Juvenile justice, we passed that through. The majority \nleader is trying to get to conference on that. We are going to have to \nhave a bipartisan effort to get to conference.\n  Defense authorization; energy bill package; financial modernization, \na bill that has been coming for 10 years-- people didn't think the \nSenate would have any chance to pass a financial modernization bill. We \ngot it through the Senate. Hopefully, we will get it through. The list \ngoes on in terms of Senators being able to have amendments on \nauthorizations bills and getting important authorization bills through.\n  While the majority leader has to sometimes say we ought to be doing \nmore, the fact of the matter is, we have been doing pretty good this \nyear. I invite my colleagues and the public to take a look at this two-\npage list of bills. As a matter of fact, we have already passed eight \nappropriations bills. We are probably a week or maybe a bill or two \nbehind where we ought to be on appropriations, but in recent history, \nthat is pretty good progress. I would like to keep that going.\n  In terms of filling up the tree, again, I didn't invent this idea. In \nfact, I think I first saw it when Senator Mitchell used it. But Senator \nDole used it on the 1985 budget resolution. Senator Byrd used it in \n1977 on the energy deregulation bill. In fact, to study the brilliant \nuse of the rules of the Senate, I have gone back and read and reread \nthat particular bill and how Senator Byrd handled it. Of course, as I \nrecall, I think Senator Baker was probably working with you on that \nissue, but I know it was tough. You had to have vote after vote after \nvote after vote to break basically an amendment filibuster.\n  Mr. BYRD. Which bill was that?\n  Mr. LOTT. The energy deregulation bill, of 1977, during the Carter \nyears. As I recall Senator Metzenbaum and others were resisting in \nevery way possible. Senator Byrd filled up the tree on the Grove City \nbill in 1984, and the campaign finance bill in 1988, Senator Byrd \nfilled up the tree there--there were eight cloture votes on that \nparticular bill--and then on the emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill in 1993.\n  Sometimes I thought it was a brilliant move. Sometimes I thought it \nwas the right thing; sometimes I didn't.\n  But the Senator is right, the majority leader has a job to do. \nSometimes it is not easy. Sometimes it is quite difficult. But I think \nit is important that he continues to try to encourage the Senate \nforward and do it in such a way that when he leaves at the close of \nbusiness on Monday, the 26th, he will be able to come back the 27th and \nwork with every Senator the next day.\n\n  I wanted to respond on some of those comments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Surely.\n  Mr. BYRD. The majority leader was not on the floor earlier when I \nsaid that as the majority leader, I resorted to filling the tree a few \ntimes. So what the distinguished majority leader said doesn't reveal \nanything that is new and doesn't really reveal anything that I haven't \nmyself already said today. I did that. I may have been the first one to \nfill up the tree in my service in the Senate--I am not sure--but I did \ndo that on a few occasions, but only on a very few occasions. I didn't \nmake it a practice.\n  I also compliment the majority leader, and have done so on several \noccasions, for his judicious and very fair handling of the impeachment \ntrial. I think the Senate did itself honor and did well by virtue of \nthe fact that both leaders put the welfare of the Senate and the \nwelfare of the country ahead of political party. I complimented the \nmajority leader at that time, and I do again. He demonstrated real \nstatesmanship on that occasion.\n  Let me just say, again, what I said earlier this morning about \npolitical party. It is important to me, but I have never felt that \npolitical party is the most important thing. The Senate is more \nimportant than any political party. Many things are more important than \npolitical party. I have said that. But during my tenure as the majority \nleader, I always tried to protect the rights of the minority. Many \ntimes I made a point of it. I tried to protect the rights of the \nminority because that is a great part of what this forum is all about, \nprotection of minority rights.\n  I can also say that Senator Stevens and I did work together to come \nup\n\n[[Page S9205]]\n\nwith some proposals that would have improved our situation, I think. We \ncame up with a resolution containing several rules changes, with the \nunderstanding of the distinguished majority leader and with his full \nknowledge. I wanted it to be called up and debated and acted upon, but \nit is still in the Rules Committee. Nothing has ever been done about \nit.\n  Our concern, going back to rule XVI, is this: Under the earlier \noperation of Rule XVI, a point of order could be made against \nlegislation on an appropriations bill. If the question of germaneness \nwas raised, the matter was submitted to the Senate for an immediate \nvote. The Senate voted on it. If the Senate decided on that vote that \nthe House had already opened the door to legislation on an \nappropriations bill, the Senate certainly had a right to respond by \nfurther amendment.\n  The problem now is, we are calling up appropriations bills that come \nout of the Senate Appropriations Committee. They are Senate \nappropriations bills. No point of order can be made that they \nconstitute legislation on appropriations bills. There is no question of \ngermaneness. If we go back to rule XVI, unless we take up the House \nappropriations bills, we cannot make the point of germaneness against a \nSenate appropriations bill. That is our problem.\n  Senators right now, myself included, who voted to uphold the Chair on \nthat occasion and stay with rule XVI, are concerned about going back to \nit now because we are normally acting on Senate appropriations bills, \nnot House Appropriations bills. I have to applaud Senator Stevens. He \nis one of the best Appropriations Committee chairmen I have served \nwith, and he seeks to take advantage of the time and get something \ndone. We have Senate hearings and we mark up regular appropriations \nbills and then we act on them on the floor. When the House bill comes \nover to the Senate we substitute the text of the Senate bill in lieu of \nthe House bill. That is all well and good. It saves time. But it does \naway with the opportunity to raise the question of germaneness. The \nquestion of germaneness cannot be raised unless we bring the House \nAppropriations bill up and the House has previously opened the door to \nlegislation. I hate to vote against going back to rule XVI; I would \nlike to go back to it.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, I had the impression earlier \nthat Senator Stevens wanted to reinstate rule XVI, and I actually had \nthe impression that the Senator from West Virginia also wanted to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I did. But as I explained this morning, it is the only way \nSenators, in many instances--the majority leader has mentioned the \njuvenile justice bill and he has mentioned----\n  Mr. LOTT. The Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, the Patients' Bill of Rights. Those are bills that he \nallowed the Senate to work its will on. The product that came out at \nthe end was a product of the will of the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could, if the Senator will allow----\n  Mr. BYRD. If I might finish my sentence, the majority leader has the \nfloor, but I hope he lets me respond to the point he is making. We \nmajority leaders like to finish our points, you know.\n  Mr. LOTT. I get awfully excited when a point is made that I feel like \nI need to respond to. I will withhold until the Senator finishes his \nstatement.\n  Mr. BYRD. I have always been a majority leader willing to hear the \nother man respond. He mentioned two or three bills, and those are good \nexamples of the work the Senate can do when it is given the opportunity \nto offer amendments and take time on the bill. I hope that we do more \nof that.\n  My reason for voting, as I will later today, against going back to \nthat rule is two or threefold. One is, the majority who had the votes \nthen overturned the rule. The majority, which has the votes now, will \nreinstitute it. In the future, I am wondering if the situation will \narise when it will be to the majority's benefit again and it will use \nits vote to overturn the rule again. But the reason I will vote against \nit today is because Senators on this side, according to my \nobservations--and I don't make much of a big to-do often here--but \nSenators on this side of the aisle are simply not given the right to \nact on legislative bills much of the time, so they have no other resort \nbut the appropriations bills. Therefore, I think I have to vote against \nreinstituting the rule.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I might respond to that, I think what is \ninvolved here is Democrats want to dictate the schedule around here. \nThe Democrats want to dictate what the schedule is. When you say yes, \njuvenile justice and the Patients' Bill of Rights are examples of the \nway it can be done around here, it is because those were bills on which \nthere was pressure to bring them up, not in the order that had been \nplanned. But is the Senator saying, for instance, that the Democrats \ndidn't also support or were not involved in these other bills that \nactually had bipartisan support, such as the national missile defense, \nwhich Senator Inouye was a cosponsor of; the soldiers and sailors pay \nraise bill, which had bipartisan support; education flexibility, which \nhad bipartisan support; water resources, which passed unanimously, and \ndefense authorization? These are not bills that I bring up because they \nare bills Republicans want; these are bills that are in the interest of \nthe country.\n  Mr. BYRD. The majority leader is preeminently correct. He is talking \nabout bills that can be brought up in which both sides have had an \nopportunity to give and take and offer amendments, so the country \nbenefits.\n  Mr. LOTT. The list is very long here. I don't quite understand what \nthe complaint is.\n  Mr. BYRD. If I wanted to point to a list, I could point to a list of \nbills on this calendar that is very long that haven't been taken up.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is partially because of the amount of time that has \nbeen taken up with other bills that were not scheduled. Bankruptcy, for \ninstance, has been bumped several times because it took longer. The \nwill of the Senate was to take longer in the debate of other bills. \nThere is the case of the nuclear waste legislation, which the Senate \npassed a couple years ago. Now the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee has come up with a bill that is very different. I think maybe \nit could have even broader support than the previous bill, which I \nthink got about 63, 64, or 65 votes, or was going to have that many.\n  So the point is, the majority has to try to bring up bills in which \nthere is broad interest and that have support--things such as the State \nDepartment and Defense Department authorizations. My goodness, if we \ndon't authorize the legislation for the Department of Defense, we can't \nget the appropriations bill, or it causes all kinds of problems. A lot \nof what I bring up is dictated by, frankly, what the Constitution \nrequires, or what has to be done to keep the Government operating in an \nappropriate way.\n  Here is a bill, the Workforce Incentives Improvement Act, which had \nproblems when it came out of committee. They were worked on and this \nbill passed, I think, probably overwhelmingly, if not unanimously. It \nis one that was a high Democratic priority, but also had the support of \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member. The Y2K \nbill was a bill that had bipartisan support out of Judiciary and also \nout of a second committee, where you had Democrats involved in both \ninstances. Yet it took us weeks to get that bill done. I think we had \nto go through three cloture votes to get that bill done, which the \nPresident signed into law.\n  Mr. BYRD. But if it is an important bill, what is wrong with taking 3 \nweeks?\n  Mr. LOTT. Because if you take 3 weeks on a bill like Y2K liability \nlimits, which should have gone through here relatively quickly, that \nmakes it more difficult to call up other bills that Senators would also \nlike to consider.\n  I think maybe the Senator and I are involved in a discussion of \nscheduled events and rules which is important to us and important to \nthe way the body works. I think the main thing we need to be saying to \nthe American people is that we are going to work together to try to get \nour business done. By the way, the length of speech doesn't necessarily \nmean that the merit is all that great.\n  In terms of bipartisanship, I think I have proven several times, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S9206]]\n\nworking with the administration in 1996 and 1997 to get Medicare \nreform, tax cuts for working Americans, budget restraint, welfare \nreform, illegal immigration reform, health care portability--we have \nworked in a lot of areas in a bipartisan way across the aisle and \nacross the Capitol and with the administration. I would like for us to \ncontinue doing that. I am one of the few Members--to show just how \nnonpartisan or bipartisan I am, I came to the city thinking I was a \nDemocrat, but I was elected as a Republican. So I served on both sides \nof the aisle.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. I certainly don't want to appear to be trying to take \nanything away from the distinguished majority leader, who has \naccomplished many things. I compliment him, and I have done so many \ntimes. I have spoken behind his back as well as to his face that he has \nmany attributes that I admire. But surely the distinguished majority \nleader didn't mean what he said when he said the Democrats were trying \nto dictate the scheduling. This Democrat doesn't do that, and the \nmajority leader knows that. This Democrat has no such intention, and I \ndon't think the Democrats here, who are in the minority, would attempt \nto try to dictate the schedule.\n  The Democrats, as I observe them, are trying to stand up for their \nrights, and they certainly have the right to debate and the right to \noffer amendments. I have no interest in taking over the schedule here. \nBut I do have an interest in the Senate. I think the Senate has gone \ndownhill. I think it is too partisan, and I don't think the minority \nhas been given the right to call up amendments. I have seen the \ndistinguished majority leader call up a bill and immediately put a \ncloture motion on it. I have done that a few times, too, my friend, but \nI never made it a practice to do it day after day and time after time. \nYou can search my record if you want to, but I also have a memory. I \nwas majority leader here, as I say, before 63 of the current Senators, \nincluding the majority leader, got here. I am pretty well informed \nabout what has gone on before.\n  I am not here to attack the majority leader today. I admire him. I \ncount him as my friend. As far as I am concerned, he will remain that \nway. But I think the Senate is being hurt. I don't want the Senate to \nbe hurt. I think the American people want their work done.\n\n  I had the same problem that the Senator is talking about. I called \nour Democratic Senators one day into my office, and I said: Now, I'll \ntell you what I am going to do. We are going to have a week's or ten-\nday break every 4 weeks here. We are going to go home and talk to our \npeople.\n  I got a big hand of applause.\n  Then I said: Now, the other side of that coin is, we are going to be \nhere 5 days a week, and we are going to work 5 days a week. And we are \ngoing to have votes 5 days a week, on Mondays as well as on Fridays.\n  I first offered the carrot, and then I offered the stick, and it \nworked.\n  I am the one--I am the culprit--who started this business of having \nbreaks every 4 or 5 weeks. But I also kept the Senate here. Not \neverybody on this side of the aisle liked me for it. As I said, it is \nnot the quality of life around here that counts to me; as long as I am \nthe majority leader, it is the quality of work that counts.\n  I have been through all of that. We got the work done. Senators were \nable to call up their amendments. They were able to get votes on them. \nLook at the Record of the 100th Congress. You will see a good record.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, when the Senator was talking about the \nrights of the minority, I thought it was I speaking. I remembered my \nsaying the same thing. In fact, I was sitting right over there. I think \nthere were only three desks there. I remember pleading with Senator \nMitchell, who was standing right there, the majority leader. I believed \nI was being oppressed and that the minority rights were not being \nhonored.\n  I remember also sitting right over there pleading with the Senator \nfrom Texas, who was chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Bentsen, \nto offer an amendment. As I recall, it had something to do with \nuniversity loans or scholarships. I remember being prohibited from \noffering that amendment.\n  I know when you are in the minority you are not always happy with the \nway you are treated. But I think we need to work together to try to not \nhave that be the all-consuming viewpoint around here, and I don't think \nit has.\n  I remember how rough it was being in the minority. I was there for 21 \nyears. I didn't like it at all. I like the majority much better. But I \nthink you have to try to be reasonable on both sides of the aisle. That \nis why I have been a little bit shocked today by the tone of the debate \nwhich I was watching. Although I was not participating in it, I thought \nI had to come out here and, in effect, explain what happened--explain \nwhat this really means, and a little bit to defend my honor.\n  But I appreciate what the Senator has said. I know he has been \nhelpful since I have been the majority leader. I am sure he will help \nus try to get our work done in the future as he has done in the past.\n  If I could, let me ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator allow me once more?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would, but I would point out that we only have a few \nminutes left. I need to hold a few minutes. I see Senator Chafee may \nwant to speak.\n  I will yield one more time.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator cannot quote one time today, or before today, \nin which I said anything that would or could be properly interpreted as \nimpugning his honor. I would not do that. If he can cite one time, I \nwill apologize for it right now.\n  Mr. LOTT. I wouldn't, couldn't, and would never expect to even try.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Byrd.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the votes in regard to the scope \namendment and the vote on adoption of S. Res. 160 occur at 5:30 p.m. in \nstacked sequence with 2 minutes of debate between each vote and the \nfinal vote in the sequence being the cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President. I strongly support S. Res. 160, and urge \nmy colleagues to vote for this important measure.\n  If this resolution is approved, it will restore Rule XVI of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate--a rule which, in one form or another, has \nserved the Senate well since 1850. By restoring Rule XVI, Senators will \nagain have at their disposal a procedural tool--a point of order--which \ncan be raised against legislative amendments to appropriations \nmeasures. Though this point of order can be waived by a simple \nmajority, it nonetheless reinstates an important procedural safeguard \nto discourage this harmful practice of legislating on appropriations \nbills.\n  Since 1995, when the Senate voted in effect to overturn Rule XVI, we \nhave witnessed a proliferation of so-called ``legislative riders'' on \nappropriations bills. Regrettably, much of this activity has been aimed \nat undermining our environmental laws. However, no authorizing \ncommittee's turf is safe without firm dividing lines clearly to \ndifferentiate the functions performed by these two types of committees.\n  Authorizing committees are responsible for developing and overseeing \nthe laws and programs which fall within their respective jurisdictions. \nThe Appropriations Committee is then tasked with establishing \nappropriate funding levels on an annual basis for each of these \nprograms, based upon the availability of discretionary resources.\n  Shortly, the Senate is scheduled to consider the Fiscal 2000 Interior \nand Related Agencies Appropriation Bill. Unfortunately, this measure is \nladen with legislative riders. By singling these provisions out, I do \nnot mean to suggest that they are not deserving of our consideration. \nTo the contrary, these provisions should be thoroughly examined--but \nnot in the context of the appropriations process.\n  The authorizing committees, which have the substantive expertise, are \nthe proper fora within which to consider and evaluate these provisions. \nHowever, as most of us know, by attaching a rider to an appropriations \nbill, one\n\n[[Page S9207]]\n\navoids having to defend it from the public scrutiny that comes with the \nauthorizing committee process. Moreover, as part of must-pass annual \nfunding bills, these often objectionable provisions are virtually \nassured of being signed into law, despite any misgivings a President \nmight have.\n\n  In addition to miring the appropriations process in controversy, the \nability to attach legislative riders to annual spending bills also \nundermines the power of the authorizing committees to advance \nauthorizing legislation. In fact, appropriations riders have, in some \ncases, made it difficult to reauthorize some government programs.\n  Thus, Mr. President, the public interest is not well-served by the \npractice of including legislative provisions in appropriations bills. \nUnfortunately, reinstatement of Rule XVI will not fully address this \nproblem because the point of order--this is important to note--only \napplies to legislative amendments which are offered on the floor, and \nnot to legislative provisions added during committee action.\n  In the days when the Senate Appropriations Committee took up and \namended House-passed appropriations measures, all of the Committee's \nchanges were considered amendments. Today, as a general matter, the \nSenate Appropriations Committee develops its own original bills. Thus, \nthe Rule XVI point of order does not apply to legislation added during \nthe committee process--rather only to legislative amendments that are \noffered on the floor.\n  In other words, in a bill coming from the Appropriations Committee \nyou can have, in effect, a legislative rider. That is there. As we are \nproposing it, as I understand it, the reinvigoration of rule XVI only \napplies to those legislative measures that are added on the floor.\n  Thus, while S. Res. 160 is an important first step, it does not go \nfar enough. In order to fully protect the interests of the authorizing \ncommittees, the Rule XVI point of order should be made applicable to \nlegislative provisions which have been added to appropriations bills \nduring committee action.\n  For this reason, we should not only restore Rule XVI, but also \nstrengthen it, as Senators Stevens and Byrd have proposed in S. Res. 8, \nwhich they introduced earlier this year. As the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Senate Appropriations Committee, these Senators know \nbetter than most of us that legislative riders have hindered their \nability to secure timely passage of the 13 annual spending bills. Their \nproposal would subject all legislation contained in appropriations \nmeasures--regardless of whether added on the floor or in committee--to \nthe Rule XVI point of order.\n  Thus, while I will vote for S. Res. 160, I will continue to press my \ncolleagues to further strengthen Rule XVI by adopting S. Res. 8.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1343\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1343.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following:\n       The presiding officer of the Senate shall apply all \n     precedents of the Senate under Rule XXVIII in effect at the \n     conclusion of the 103rd Congress.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this amendment addresses what we consider \nto be one of the major procedural problems facing Senators today. It \nhas to do with what is referred to here as the scope of conference.\n  For those who may be watching this debate and are not totally \nfamiliar with parliamentary procedure, after a bill is passed in the \nHouse and passed in the Senate, the bill goes to conference. Here the \nHouse- and Senate-passed bills, two separate pieces of legislation, are \nmelded into one in a way that hopefully will be acceptable to members \nfrom both Chambers of Congress. Only one bill can become law. The \nconference report represents an agreement between the House and the \nSenate as to what specific proposals ought to be included in a single \npiece of legislation.\n  It has always been the case that when a bill comes to conference, if \nthere is something in the House bill that is not in the Senate bill, or \nsomething in the Senate bill that is not in the House bill, a vote is \ntaken and a decision made about the propriety of including that \nprovision for the final version in the conference agreement.\n  At no time, up until recent years, was there ever consideration given \nto a situation where if a provision did not appear in either the House \nor Senate versions, could it even be considered in the conference.\n  However, a decision was made by the majority to allow original \nlegislative provisions to be taken up in the conference, that is \nlanguage that may not have even been debated in either body let alone \nreceived a recorded vote.\n  As a result of this decision made by the majority, we can go into \nthis conference--whose purpose it is to work out the differences \nbetween the House and the Senate--and completely bypass the relevant \nauthorizing and appropriations committees. In a sense, this decision \nset up a ``super'' legislative committee that makes up its mind \noftentimes without the benefit of House or Senate hearings, without the \nbenefit of action in any House or Senate committee, and without a vote \non either the House or Senate floor. It is an amazing set of \ncircumstances.\n  We have seen that happen over and over again. The most consequential \nincident occurred at the end of the last session when the White House \nand a relatively small group of Senate and House conferees made \ndecisions that were not based on any actions taken in either body of \nCongress.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer, after it happened on October 20, \naddressed this issue as eloquently and as succinctly as any Member I \nhave heard. If my colleagues haven't had the opportunity to hear what \nhe said, I think this excerpt states it so well:\n\n       I don't believe the Founding Fathers of this country ever \n     intended for a few Members and staff to make more than one \n     half of a trillion dollars worth of arbitrary, closed-door \n     decisions for the rest of us, for America--almost one-third \n     of the Federal budget--and then present them to all other \n     Senators and Representatives, men and women, elected by the \n     people of this country, by the taxpayers, and then say take \n     it or leave it, an up-or-down vote.\n\n\nSo said the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The Senator from Utah said something similar and equally on point. \nSenator Hatch, on the same day on the Senate floor, said:\n\n       We should all be concerned about the perception this \n     backward procedure--one in which we are considering \n     conference reports on bills that have not even passed the \n     Senate yet--will set a precedent for the future. Mr. \n     President, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \n     will join me in a sweeping denunciation of this as anything \n     other than a one-time event.\n\n  I wish this had been a one-time event. Unfortunately, it happens over \nand over and over. It is a complete emasculation of the process our \nFounding Fathers had set up. It has nothing to do with the legislative \nprocess.\n  If you were going to write a book on how a bill becomes a law, you \nwould need several volumes. In fact, if the consequences were not so \nprofound, some could say you would need a comic book because it is \nalmost hilarious to look at the lengths we have gone to thwart and \nundermine and, in an extraordinary way, destroy a process that has \nworked so well for 220 years.\n  This amendment simply says let's get real. If we mean what we say, \nand if we truly want to end this amazing process, now is our chance. \nThis is the opportunity. I am very hopeful our colleagues will support \nour effort to put democracy back into the legislative process, to \nensure the committees, authorizing and appropriating, have an \nopportunity to express themselves and to ensure every single Senator on \nthe\n\n[[Page S9208]]\n\nSenate floor has an opportunity to express himself or herself.\n  As I noted earlier, the dictatorial, take-it-or-leave-it approach \nreferred to by the two Republican Senators is, unfortunately, not a \none-time event. It has happened over and over. If we are serious about \nmaking changes, I cannot think of anything that ought to change more \nquickly and with broader bipartisanship than this. We will have an \nopportunity.\n  I appreciate very much the eloquence, leadership, and interest in \nmaking changes expressed by our colleagues over the course of many \ndifferent occasions, occasions just as egregious as the one last \nOctober. On each of these occasions, Senators have been denied their \nbasic rights as elected Representatives of the people of their State, \nand a mockery has been made of our legal and legislative process.\n  This is a very critical amendment. We will have an opportunity to \nvote on it in 15 minutes. I hope we make the right decision. I hope it \nis a bipartisan decision. I hope we can do it in a way that will allow \nus the opportunity, once and for all, to put common sense and some \nsemblance of order into our conference process and the conference \nreports that we are called to vote on after the process has been \ncompleted.\n  Mr. President, I will speak just briefly about the underlying matter; \nthat is rule XVI. I appreciate very much the effort made by the \nassistant Democratic leader. He has managed our time so exceptionally \nwell. I am grateful to him once more for the extraordinary effort he \nhas made in making sure colleagues have the opportunity to express \nthemselves and to orchestrate our response to arguments made by our \ncolleagues on the other side. I think the record clearly shows what the \nDemocratic position was several years ago when our colleagues \noverturned the ruling of the Chair. We had said at the time that rule \nXVI was there for a reason. We believe rule XVI existed because there \nis an authorizing and an appropriating process. What has happened since \nthat vote is interesting. What has happened is the Senate has become \nmore like the House of Representatives than I believe it has, probably, \never been in our Nation's history.\n  The House of Representatives has a very tight process by which \namendments are considered. There has to be a Rules Committee. The Rules \nCommittee decides, on each and every piece of legislation, how many \namendments are offered. The majority dominates the Rules Committee, as \nwe know, by a two-thirds to one-third ratio. When Democrats were in the \nmajority, when I was in the House, I thought what an incredible power \nthat is. For the Rules Committee, with its membership ratio tilted so \nheavily in favor of the majority, to decide means the majority gets its \nway virtually every single time. Only on rare occasions do a \ncombination of minority and majority Members of the House join forces \nto thwart the will of the majority. That does not happen very often.\n\n  The Founding Fathers, in their wisdom, saw fit not to have a Rules \nCommittee in the Senate in that same sense of the word. We do have a \nRules Committee. It is very important and carries out some functions \nthat are in large measure directly related to how this Senate operates. \nHowever the committee does not dictate how the Senate floor operates. \nThere is no gatekeeper when it comes to legislation. The gatekeeper is \nall of us, 60 votes.\n  Yet, what do we see now all too frequently? On virtually every single \npiece of legislation that comes to the Senate floor, the bill is filed, \nthe so-called parliamentary tree is filled, and cloture votes are \nscheduled. Why would we be opposed to that? We are opposed to that \nbecause once there is no opportunity for us to offer amendments--\nwhether they are directly germane to the bill or not--we are precluded \nfrom being full partners as legislators. We are precluded from the \nopportunity to express ourselves, to make alterations, to offer \nsuggestions, to have the kind of debate on public policy that I think \nour Founding Fathers understood.\n  As a result of all of this, we have become increasingly concerned \nabout what is happening to the Senate as an institution, as well as \nwhat it is doing to the Democratic Members who want very much to be a \npart of the legislative process as full-fledged Senators. So our vote \nis in large measure a protest of the extraordinary ways the legislative \nprocess has been altered now for the last several years; a process I do \nnot believe our Founding Fathers ever anticipated; a process that is \nvery much in keeping with the attitude and the mentality created by the \nRules Committee in the House of Representatives. That is not what we \nwere supposed to be.\n  People who want those kinds of rules ought to run and get elected to \nthe House of Representatives. They ought not want to serve in the \nSenate. The Senate is a different body. Who was it who said the Senate \nis a saucer within which emotions and the rage of the day cool. \nLegislation oftentimes can be passed directly through the House of \nRepresentatives. It is only after they have been deliberative and \nthoughtful and considerate of a lot of different issues, and a \nsupermajority, sometimes on controversial issues, having been \nsupported, do we ultimately allow a bill to be passed in the Senate.\n  So this vote is about the institution. It is about protecting \nSenators' rights to be full-fledged Members of this body. It is about \nwhether we, as Senators, want to be more like the House or more like \nwhat the Founding Fathers envisioned in the first place--full-fledged \nU.S. Senators with every expectation we can represent our people, we \ncan represent our ideas and our agenda in whatever opportunity presents \nitself legislatively. Our Democratic and Republican colleagues \ncertainly should support that notion.\n  Our Republican colleagues used it many times to their advantage when \nthey were in the minority. We simply want the same opportunity to do it \nnow.\n  My colleagues will be voting against this overturning of the ruling \nof the Chair in large measure because we still are not confident the \nmajority is prepared to open up the legislative process as it was \ndesigned to be open up the process to allow amendments, open up and \ngive us the opportunity to work with them to fashion legislation that \nwill create a true consensus on whatever bill may be presented.\n\n  We will have two votes at 5:30 p.m. The first will be the vote on \nwhether or not legislation that has never been considered in the House \nor the Senate ought to be included in a conference report. Democrats \nsay no; no, we should not allow that.\n  The second vote will be about whether we permit Members of the Senate \nto offer legislation, whether it is on appropriations or authorization \nbills, without the encumbrance of a Rules Committee, a right that, by \nall description, was anticipated by the Founding Fathers.\n  I hope we can adopt the amendment I have offered. I hope we will \nreject the overturning of the Chair on rule XVI. I hope we can work \ntogether to accomplish more in a bipartisan fashion in a way that will \nallow all Senators to be heard and to contribute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I noted that Senator Daschle used a \nquotation from a statement I made last fall concerning the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 1990 in his arguments for his \namendment to S. Res. 160.\n  I am flattered that he felt my words were of such import that he had \nthem blown up to poster size and displayed them for all to see. I wish \nhe would do that with all of my speeches.\n  In this case, however, I just wish he had quoted the entire \nstatement. Although I, like many of our colleagues, expressed genuine \nfrustration with the unusual process that resulted in the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill, my statement also defends it as necessary to \nprevent a devastating government shutdown. I regret that Senator \nDaschle took this excerpt out of context. Those who read my entire \nstatement will see that it provides a much different position than what \nthe Minority Leader suggests by excerpting this small section.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment to the bill add the following:\n       The bill will become effective 4 days after enactment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, I have \nfilled the tree on the juvenile justice bill with the text of the \nSenate bill in an effort to send this bill to conference. The cloture \nvote on the pending amendment will occur on Wednesday morning.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the cloture vote occur at 9:45 a.m. on \nWednesday and that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is interesting to note, Mr. President, that after a lot \nof concern or even complaints about the process of filling up the tree, \nhere I am having to do that in order to go to conference. In this case, \nI am sure the Democrats and the Republicans support this effort so we \ncan get this legislation to conference for its consideration. This is a \nperfect example of the majority leader sometimes having to use this \ntype of technique.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I came to the floor last Wednesday to \ndemonstrate the seriousness with which Senate Democrats take the \nmatters included in S. 254, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill. I \ntook the extraordinary step of propounding a unanimous-consent request \nto move the Senate to a House-Senate conference. I talked to the \nMajority Leader and the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in advance \nof making the unanimous-consent request. I noted the history of this \nmeasure and the need to move to conference expeditiously if we are to \nhave these programs in place before school resumes in the fall in the \ncourse of my colloquy with the Majority Leader last week.\n  The Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, S. 254, passed the Senate \nafter 2 weeks of open debate and after significant improvements over \ntwo months ago, on May 20, by a strong bipartisan vote of 73-25. More \nthan one month ago, on June 17, the House passed its version of \njuvenile justice legislation but chose not to take up the Senate bill \nand insert its language, as is standard practice to move Congress \ntoward a conference and final passage of legislation.\n  Instead, what the House did was wait until last week to send the \nSenate a ``blue slip'' returning S. 254 to the Senate on the ground \nthat it contains what they consider a ``revenue provision'' that did \nnot originate in the House. The provision they point to is the \namendment to S. 254 that would amend the federal criminal code to ban \nthe import of high capacity ammunition clips. Whatever the merits of \nthat particular provision--and I will simply say that I did not support \nit--it appeared to me that the House had resorted to a procedural \ntechnicality to avoid a conference on juvenile justice legislation.\n  Two weeks ago, Republican leaders of the House and Senate were \ntalking about appointing conferees by the end of that week. Instead, \nthey took no action to move us toward a House-Senate conference but, \ninstead, were moving us away from one. By propounding the unanimous \nconsent last week, I was trying on behalf of congressional Democrats, \nto break the logjam. The unanimous consent would have cured the \nprocedural technicality and would have resulted in the Senate \nrequesting a conference and appointing conferees without further delay.\n  While I regret that Republican objection was made to my request last \nWednesday, I note that it was repropounded by the Majority Leader the \nnext day. I thank the Majority Leader for that. Unfortunately, even \nthen, objection was made and the process is being extended from \nliterally seconds into days and possibly weeks before we can conference \nthis important matter.\n  Today, the Senate takes the first step outlined in my unanimous \nrequest, proceeding to take up the House-passed bill. Senators can \ncooperate in taking the additional steps outlined in my consent request \nto get to a conference and the Senate could proceed to appoint its \nconferees and request a conference without further delay, today. \nAlternatively, Senators can exercise their procedural rights to \nobstruct each step of the way and require a series of cloture petitions \nand votes. I hope that in the interests of school safety and enacting \nthe many worthwhile programs in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, \nthey will begin to cooperate. The delay is costing us valuable time to \nget this juvenile justice legislation enacted before school resumes \nthis fall. This is just plain wrong.\n  I spoke to the Senate before the July 4th recess about the need to \npress forward without delay on this bill. I contrasted the inaction on \nthe juvenile justice bill with the swift movement on providing special \nlegal protections to certain business interests. In just a few months, \nbig business successfully lobbied for the passage of legislation to \nprotection themselves against any accountability for actions or losses \ntheir products may cause to consumers. By contrast, some are dragging \ntheir feet and now actively obstructing the House and Senate from \nmoving to appoint conferees on the juvenile justice bill that can make \na difference in the lives of our children and families.\n  New programs and protections for school children could be in place \nwhen school resumes this fall. All of us--whether we are parents, \ngrandparents, teachers, or policy makers are puzzling over the causes \nof kids turning violent in our country. The root causes are likely \nmultifaceted. Nevertheless, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill is a \nfirm and significant step in the right direction. The passage of this \nbill shows that when this body rolls up its sleeves and gets to work, \nwe can make significant progress. But that progress will amount to \nnaught if the House and Senate do not conference and proceed to final \npassage on a good bill.\n  Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned this \nsummer about school violence over the last two years and worried about \nthe situation they will confront this fall. Each one of us wants to do \nsomething to stop this violence. There is no single cause and no single \nlegislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our \nschools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do \nour part. It is unfortunate that the Senate is not moving full speed \nahead to seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile \njustice legislation.\n  I want to be assured that after the hard work we all put into \ncrafting a good juvenile justice bill, that we can go to a House-Senate \nconference that is\n\n[[Page S9211]]\n\nfair, full, and productive. We have worked too hard in the Senate for a \nstrong bipartisan juvenile justice bill to simply shrug our shoulders \nwhen the House returns a juvenile justice bill rather than proceeding \nto a conference and a narrow minority in the Senate would rather we do \nnothing. I will be vigilant in working to maintain this bipartisanship \nand to press for action on this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9211-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

GEN. PAUL V. HESTER, USAF\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today to \nrecognize one of the finest officers in the United States Air Force, \nMajor General Paul V. Hester. On July 30th, General Hester will leave \nhis current job as Director of the Air Force Office of Legislative \nLiaison to take over the important posts of Commander, United States \nForces, Japan; Commander, 5th Air Force; and Commander, United States \nAir Forces, Japan. During his time here in Washington--particularly \nwith regard to his work on Capitol Hill--General Hester personified the \nAir Force core values of integrity, selfless service and excellence in \nall things. Many Senators and Staff enjoyed the opportunity to interact \nwith him on a variety of important issues and came to appreciate his \nmany talents. Today it is my privilege to recognize some of Paul's many \naccomplishments since he entered the military 27 years ago, and to \ncommend the superb service he provided the Air Force, the Congress and \nour Nation.\n  Paul Hester entered the Air Force through the Reserve Officer \nTraining Corps from my alma mater, the University of Mississippi. While \nat ``Ole Miss'', he completed both bachelor's and master's degrees in \nBusiness Administration. He earned his pilot wings in December of 1971 \nat Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi and was then assigned to Davis-\nMonthan Air Force Base, Arizona, where he flew the A-7D Corsair. A \nshort time later, he was deployed to Southeast Asia where he \ndistinguished himself flying combat missions and earned five Air Medals \nfor outstanding airmanship and courage. Over his career, General Hester \ndemonstrated his skill in other fighter aircraft, including the F-4, F-\n15 and F-16, and logged more than 2,600 hours of flying time.\n  General Hester's exceptional leadership skills were always evident to \nhis superiors and he repeatedly proved himself in numerous select \ncommand positions. While stationed at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, \nhe served as the commander of the 94th Fighter Squadron, Captain Eddie \nRickenbacker's famed ``Hat in the Ring Gang.'' He was also the first \nCommander of the 18th Operations Group, Kadena Air Base, Japan; \nCommander of the 35th Fighter Wing at Misawa Air Base, Japan, and prior \nto his assignment here in Washington, Commander of the 53rd Wing, Eglin \nAir Force Base, Florida. At each and every one of these important \nposts, Paul Hester inspired the airmen under his command to achieve \ntheir best, and ensured our forces were sharpened and ready to \nundertake our warfighting commitments.\n  Paul Hester also excelled in a variety of key staff billets. He \nserved in the Air Force Directorate of Plans at the Pentagon, and he \nwas a member of the Commanders' Action Group, Headquarters Tactical Air \nCommand, Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. He experienced joint duty as \nboth the J-5 Division Chief to the Joint Staff and as the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff representative to the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, Vienna, Austria. As a Lieutenant Colonel, he was \nselected as the Chief of the Air Force's Legislative Liaison Office to \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. His performance in that important \nposition is the reason he was brought back as a Major General to lead \nthe entire legislative directorate for the Secretary of the Air Force.\n  During his service to the 105th and 106th Congresses, General Hester \nhas been the liaison to the Air Force on a variety of readiness issues \nand most recently, ALLIED FORCE operations in Kosovo. His clear, \nconcise, and timely information was instrumental in supporting our \ndeliberations of National Security matters. He was a crucial voice for \nthe Air Force in representing its many programs on the Hill. General \nHester's leadership, professional abilities and expertise enabled him \nto foster excellent working relationships that benefitted both the Air \nForce and the Senate. Throughout the time I have known Paul, I have \nbeen impressed with his skill in working with the Congress to address \nAir Force priorities.\n  We were all pleased to see that Paul was recently nominated by the \nPresident for his third star, which will be pinned on by the Air Force \nChief of Staff this Friday. I offer my congratulations to him, to his \nwife Lynda, and three children Leslie, Doug and Shelby. The Congress \nand the country applaud the selfless commitment his family has made to \nthe Nation in supporting his military career.\n  I know I speak for all my colleagues in expressing my heartfelt \nappreciation to General Hester. He is a credit to both the Air Force \nand our great Nation. We wish our friend the best of luck and are \nconfident of his continued success in his new command.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9211-4", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9211-S9212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A REFLECTION ON JOHN F. KENNEDY JR.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, of the half-dozen great journalists who \nwrote of the Kennedy era, as we think of that Presidency, none was \ncloser to those involved, where they had come from, who they were, who \nthey wished to be than Martin F. Nolan of the Boston Globe. He has done \nso once again, in a moving reflection of the deaths of John F. Kennedy, \nJr., his wife and her sister, entitled ``Life Goes on, but it'll Never \nbe the Same.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that his reflections be printed in the \nCongressional Record\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        [From the Boston Globe]\n\n               Life Goes on, but it'll Never be the Same\n\n                          (By Martin F. Nolan)\n\n       When Sander Vanocur, the former NBC correspondent, first \n     heard the news, he recalled what John O'Hara, the Irish-\n     American novelist, said on a hot July day in 1937. ``They \n     tell me that George Gershwin is suddenly dead at 38. That's \n     what they tell me, but I don't have to believe it if I don't \n     want to.''\n       The composer and songwriter died of a brain tumor, a \n     celebrity death which, like many, caused shock, disbelief, \n     and grief among thousands, even millions, who had never met \n     him.\n       The death of John F. Kennedy Jr. is different because of \n     Americans' attitude about history. However imperfectly, they \n     knew that the young man who perished with his wife and \n     sister-in-law while approaching Martha's Vineyard was ``a \n     part of history.''\n       The prayers, the sadness, the flowers in TriBeCa all flow \n     to a clan whose rise to glory began on the margins of \n     American society, an underdog dynasty. John F. Kennedy Jr. \n     was born 17 days after his father became the first Roman \n     Catholic president amid the\n\n[[Page S9212]]\n\n     fears of millions that the White House would be an outpost of \n     the Vatican. Friday, as his life is celebrated at a Mass at \n     St. Thomas More Church is New York City, anti-Catholicism has \n     almost vanished in America.\n       The Kennedy saga covers most of the century. John F. \n     ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald was elected to the US House of \n     Representatives in 1894. One of his grandsons, John, became \n     president; two more, Edward and Robert, became senators; and \n     two of his great-grandsons, Joseph and Patrick, also have \n     served in the House. A half-dozen Frelinghuysens from New \n     Jersey have served in Congress, but only four from another \n     Dutch dynasty, the Roosevelts. The grandchildren of Franklin \n     Delano Roosevelt have known little political fame.\n       The future has always been Kennedy country and the greatest \n     Kennedy success could lie among its women. Caroline Kennedy \n     Schloseberg has been a key decision maker on many matters, \n     including her father's library. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, \n     the lieutenant governor of Maryland, may possess as much \n     charm and savvy as her father, Robert, her uncles and \n     cousins, and even her grandfather.\n       The much-photographed Kennedys have been reviled and \n     revered. In a society anxious about ``family values,'' theirs \n     has been on exuberant display for four decades, along with \n     those of the Bouviers, Shakels, Bennetts, Smiths, Lawfords, \n     and Shrivers. (A large family means many in-laws.)\n       In a nation of small families, size matters. When Edward \n     Kennedy barely escaped death in the crash of a small plane in \n     1964, his brother Robert visited him and remarked in that \n     ruefully wry Kennedyesque way, ``I guess the reason my mother \n     and father had so many children was that some of them would \n     survive.''\n       Edward Kennedy, the ninth of nine, is, at 67, the sole \n     surviving son, the patriarch, and an all-too-accomplished \n     eulogist. The Kennedys' famous fatalism was once expressed by \n     President Kennedy's citation of a French fisherman's prayer: \n     ``Oh God, thy sea is so great and my boat is so small.'' \n     Thursday's burial was private and at sea off Cape Cod, that \n     slip of land of which Henry David Thoreau said in 1865: ``A \n     man may stand there and put all America behind him.''\n       The America John F. Kennedy Jr. leaves behind is one in \n     which the median age is younger than his at his death. The \n     vast majority of his fellow citizens have no contemporary \n     memory of his father's violent death in 1963 nor that of his \n     uncle in 1968. The grief of the Kennedys has been vivid in \n     the nation's tribal memory as only a photograph or a video \n     image, but no less vivid for being so.\n       Stanley Tretick, who died last week at 77, was a \n     photographer for Look magazine. One of his most famous \n     pictures was of the President Kennedy's young son climbing \n     through a desk in the Oval Office. ``The Kennedys are great, \n     but you have to do things their way,'' Tretick once said.\n       The Kennedys stage-managed their own public image in the \n     days before 24-hour cable channels and the vast hordes of \n     paparazzi that their fame and glamour enticed. The Hyannis \n     Port family compound this week has been a logo for media \n     fascination with one family's grief.\n       The old Latin liturgy once included an Augustinian \n     admonition, ``Vita mutatur non tollitur''--``Life is changed \n     not taken away.'' That belief sustains those of faith, in \n     addition, there's always the Irish wake tradition of stories \n     and memories, happy and sad.\n       Arthur N. Schlessinger Jr. wrote in ``A Thousand Days'' of \n     how a young assistant secretary of labor, Daniel Patrick \n     Moynihan, reacted to President Kennedy's death. ``I don't \n     think there's any point in being Irish if you don't know that \n     the world is going to break your heart eventually. I guess \n     that we thought we had a little more time,'' Moynihan said. \n     ``Mary McGrory said to me that we'll never laugh again. And I \n     said, `Heavens, Mary. We'll laugh again. It's just that we'll \n     never be young again.' ''\n       Across America and the world, many people feel a lot less \n     young than they did a week ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9212-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, last week the Senate passed S. 1217, the \nCommerce, Justice, State appropriations bill. I want to take a minute \nnow to express my serious concerns about the low level of funding for \nembassy security contained in the bill.\n  Just about one year ago, two United States embassies in East Africa \nwere destroyed by terrorist bombs, killing hundreds of people and \ninjuring thousands. The bombings underscored the great vulnerability of \nour diplomatic missions. In response, Congress promptly provided $1.4 \nbillion in emergency funding to rebuild the two embassies and to take \nother urgent steps to bolster security at overseas missions.\n  Soon thereafter, two panels were convened by the Secretary of State \nto review the bombings. The two commissions were chaired by retired \nAdmiral William Crowe, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nand former Ambassador to the United Kingdom. The Crowe commissions \nrecommended that the U.S. government devote $1.4 billion per year for \neach of the next ten years to security.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation before the Senate falls far short of \nwhat the Crowe commissions recommended. The bill appropriates just $300 \nmillion for security in the State Department operations accounts, and \njust $110 million for security in the capital account. But of this \nlatter amount, only $36 million is provided for construction or \nrenovation of new embassies--$264 million below the President's \nrequest. Moreover, the bill rescinds $58 million in previously-\nappropriated funds in this same account. Neither the bill nor the \nCommittee report explains how these funds will be restored to meet \ncontinuing and future needs.\n  Finally, the bill denies the Administration's request for $3.6 \nbillion in advance funding for capital projects for Fiscal Years 2001 \nto 2005. The Department based this request on bitter experience. In the \nmid-1980s, after a commission chaired by Admiral Bobby Inman \nrecommended massive increases in embassy security, Congress initially \nresponded by providing significant funding and significant promises. \nBut as the years passed, security became a second-order priority; the \nrequested funding for security was denied by Congress, and some of the \nmoney that had been allocated for security was either rescinded by \nCongress or redirected to other priorities. By the mid-1990s, the Inman \nCommission report was collecting dust on government bookshelves, its \nrecommendations barely recalled, and funding for security had been \nreduced considerably.\n  So, understandably, the State Department is skeptical that the grand \npromises made in the wake of the embassy bombings will be fulfilled. \nWith considerable justification, the State Department experts have told \nCongress that it can best move forward on a sensible and rational \nconstruction program if it can be assured in advance of the necessary \nfunds. Otherwise, the Department of State rightly fears, we will see a \nrepeat of the experience after the Inman Commission.\n  The Committee on Foreign Relations, and then the full Senate, \nresponded to this plea by providing a $3 billion authorization over \nfive years in S. 886, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. But that \nwas just the first step. The authorization will be useless without \nappropriations. Unfortunately, the Committee on Appropriations has \nignored the State Department's request in this bill.\n  I believe this bill breaks faith with the bold promises that were \nmade in the wake of the embassy bombings last summer. We need to do \nmuch, much more to protect our dedicated public servants working \noverseas. I strongly urge the chairman and ranking member to look for \nadditional resources to fund this important account, without \ncompromising the other important foreign affairs accounts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9212-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9212-S9213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE HATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the most significant amendments \nadopted by the Senate in consideration\n\n[[Page S9213]]\n\nof the Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary Appropriations Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2000 is the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. I commend \nSenator Kennedy for his leadership in this effort and on this bill, and \nI am proud to have been an original cosponsor. This legislation amends \nthe federal hate crimes statute to make it easier for federal law \nenforcement officials to investigate and prosecute cases of racial and \nreligious violence. It also focuses the attention and resources of the \nfederal government on the problem of hate crimes committed against \npeople because of their sexual preference, gender, or disability.\n  Violent crime motivated by prejudice demands attention from all of \nus. It is not a new problem, but recent incidents of hate crimes have \nshocked the American conscience. Just this month, an adherent of a \nwhite supremacist group killed two people and wounded nine others in a \nshooting rampage in Illinois and Indiana that was apparently motivated \nby racial and religious hate. Billy Jack Gaither, 39, was beaten to \ndeath in Alabama because he was gay. Matthew Sheppard, 21, was left to \ndie on a fence in Wyoming because he was gay. James Byrd, Jr., 49, a \nfather of three, was dragged to his death behind a pickup truck in \nTexas because he was black. These are sensational crimes, the ones that \nfocus public attention. But there also is a toll we are paying each \nyear in other hate crimes that find less notoriety, but with no less \nsuffering for the victims and their families.\n  It remains painfully clear that we as a nation still have serious \nwork to do in protecting all Americans from these crimes and in \nensuring equal rights for all our citizens. The answer to hate and \nbigotry must ultimately be found in increased respect and tolerance. \nBut strengthening our federal hate crimes legislation is a step in the \nright direction. Bigotry and hatred are corrosive elements in any \nsociety, but especially in a country as diverse and open as ours. We \nneed to make clear that a bigoted attack on one or some of us \ndiminishes each of us, and it diminishes our nation. As a nation, we \nmust say loudly and clearly that we will defend ourselves against such \nviolence.\n  All Americans have the right to live, travel and gather where they \nchoose. In the past we have responded as a nation to deter and to \npunish violent denials of civil rights. We have enacted federal laws to \nprotect the civil rights of all of our citizens for more than 100 \nyears. This continues that great and honorable tradition.\n  Several of us come to this issue with backgrounds in local law \nenforcement. We support local law enforcement and work for initiatives \nthat assist law enforcement. It is in this vein as well that I support \nthe Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which has received strong bipartisan \nsupport from state and local law enforcement organizations across the \ncountry.\n  The bill has been materially improved since its introduction on March \n16th. At that time, I questioned whether the bill was sufficiently \nrespectful of state and local law enforcement interests and cautioned \nagainst federalizing prohibitions that may already exist at the state \nand local level. The Senate-passed bill includes a new certification \nrequirement, which provides that the Federal government may only step \nin where the State has not assumed jurisdiction, the State has \nrequested that the federal government assume jurisdiction, or the \nState's actions are likely to leave unvindicated the Federal interest \nin eradicating bias-motivated violence. I am satisfied that this \nprovision will ensure that the Hate Crimes Prevention Act operates as \nintended, strengthening Federal jurisdiction over hate crimes as a \nback-up, but not a substitute, for state and local law enforcement.\n  The Hate Crimes Prevention Act gives us a formidable tool for \ncombating acts of violence motivated by race, color, national origin, \nreligion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. I urge its speedy \npassage into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9213-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9213-S9214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE QUARTERLY MAIL COSTS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise today to thank Chairman Gregg \nand Senator Hollings for accepting an amendment I offered to the FY2000 \nCommerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill that will provide $500,000 \nfor a truck safety program in New Jersey. This critical initiative will \nallow the State Police to finally purchase much needed portable scales \nand accompanying computer equipment that will enable them to better \nmonitor and control large trucks that utilize local roads.\n  This amendment was necessary because more than 5,300 people, \nincluding 660 children, died in highway crashes with big trucks last \nyear, and the number of carriers on local roads throughout the nation \ncontinues to rise. This problem has become particularly acute in New \nJersey. For example, Route 31 in the northwest part of the state \npreviously accommodated several hundreds trucks a day. That number has \nnow grown to well over 3,000 trucks a day, and four people have died in \ntruck related accidents on this road in the past 24 months.\n  In order to increase safety through improved enforcement efforts, I \nintroduced this amendment to provide the New Jersey State Police with \nthe modern equipment necessary to effectively regulate these oversized \nvehicles. This additional funding will be used to purchase almost 120 \nnew mobile truck scales and 60 mobile data computers. The current \nscales, which often break down and require heavy, outdated batteries, \nwill be replaced with lighter scales that are maintenance free. The new \ncomputers, which can be mounted in trooper's vehicles, would allow the \npolice direct access to the Commercial Vehicle Information Safety \nNetwork and enable them to perform immediate checks on truckers who are \nviolating the law.\n  This new equipment will go a long way towards keeping these oversized \ncarriers off of smaller, undivided local roads and will send a strong \nmessage that we remain committed to protecting our communities.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a sense of the \nSenate amendment regarding the recent unilateral action of the EU \neffectively banning hushkitted and re-engineered aircraft from \noperating in European Union states. If this rule is implemented on May \n1, 2000 it will have a discriminatory impact on U.S. carriers and \nequipment manufacturers, not to mention setting a bad precedent for \naction by countries or groups of countries outside of the established \nInternational Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards-setting \nprocess.\n  This legislation was adopted by the EU on April 29, 1999, but \nimplementation was delayed until May 2000 to\n\n[[Page S9215]]\n\nallow U.S. and EU representatives to work out the framework of a new, \nmore stringent global aircraft noise standard within ICAO. The Federal \nAviation Administration and the State Department have been in \nnegotiations with the EU on the eventual withdraw of this unfair and \ndiscriminatory statute.\n  Many of my colleagues have seen recent efforts by the European Union \nto gain the upper hand over the United States in matters of trade. \nAviation has proven to be no different. And this is deeply troubling, \nbecause aviation is not only a primary source of a favorable balance of \ntrade for the United States, but, because of its global reach, \nrepresents an area where international standards are crucial to \nfacilitating that commerce among nations. Yet, as I stated earlier, the \nEU has acted to preempt U.S. air carriers and carriers from other parts \nof the world from serving points in Europe with certain hushkitted or \nre-engineered aircraft. This restriction applies even though those \naircraft fully comply with Stage 3 international noise standards \nadopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).\n  This European regulation, although its implementation has been \ndeferred until May 2000, has already created financial hardships for \nU.S. aerospace manufacturers and airlines. It must be withdrawn or we \nwill see a continued impact on U.S. jobs and profits. Modifying the \nrule or deferring its implementation for an added period of time will \nnot offer the relief needed by U.S. aviation interests--the financial \nmarkets simply do not respond favorably to uncertainty. The U.S. \ngovernment has engaged in extensive discussions with the European \nCouncil for the past year, without achieving a commitment to a repeal \nof this rule, which I might add expressly protects European aviation \ninterests. The time has come to achieve a timely resolution of this \nproblem through action.\n  The Sense of the Senate resolution I offer today cites the need for \ncomplying with international standards in the aviation arena and \nhighlights the problems the rule is causing for U.S. manufacturers and \noperators. Failing an early commitment by the Europeans to withdraw \nthis arbitrary and discriminatory rule, the resolution calls upon the \nDepartment of State to initiate an Article 84 proceeding before ICAO. \nIt is my understanding that this type of proceeding is not a sanctions \nmechanism, but instead affords a process that provides an opportunity \nfor the international aviation body to rule on whether this regulation \ncomplies with international aviation standards.\n  This Sense of the Senate further calls upon other agencies of the \nexecutive branch to use the tools at their disposal as well to achieve \nthe early repeal of this rule. There is a broader point to be made as \nwell, which is that, without restoring credibility to the international \naviation standards process, we can have little or no confidence about \nany future international standards adopted by the international \naviation community through ICAO. That is a very dangerous precedent for \nthe global aviation environment in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9215-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9215-S9216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MAYOR'S PETITION ON THE NOX SIP CALL\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, last year, EPA finalized the \nNOX SIP call, forcing 22 states to submit plans to meet \nmandated reductions of nitrogen oxide (NOX) emissions. Our \nnation's mayors are concerned that the SIP call will have adverse \neffects on brownfields redevelopment and economic growth.\n  Earlier this year, the National Conference of Black Mayors and the \nU.S. Conference of Mayors held their annual conferences. Over 100 \nmayors from around the country signed a petition calling on the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to provide utility energy providers \nwith maximum flexibility and the leadtime necessary to avoid higher \nenergy costs to municipalities and local communities, including \nindustrial and residential consumers.\n  The mayors are asking U.S. EPA to reconsider how the deadlines set in \nthe NOX SIP call could affect electricity reliability in \nurban and rural areas. In essence our mayor's are saying that any new \nprograms to control NOX emission must be weighed against \npotential economic adverse implications.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Court of Appeals issued a stay of EPA's \nNOX SIP call pending a decision on the lawsuit brought by \nstates. Nonetheless, the Mayors' petition represents a commonsense plea \nto EPA that, should the agency move forward to implement NOX \nreductions, that it do so in a way that allows for compliance in a \ncost-effective manner that does not adversely impact economic growth or \nsignificantly increase utility prices to consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the petition be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                PETITION\n\n              EPA Ozone Transport NOX SIP Call\n\n       As part of its Ozone Transport initiative, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has finalized a \n     rulemaking forcing States to submit Implementation Plans \n     (SIPs) to meet mandated reductions of oxides of nitrogen \n     (NOX) emissions in the Agency's effort to control \n     inter-state ozone transport impacts. The rule focuses on 22 \n     mid-eastern States, with the likelihood that EPA will expand \n     the application of the rule to several additional States.\n       Several States have joined in litigation challenging the \n     EPA rule on grounds that it is contrary to congressional \n     intent, an abuse of Agency discretion and disregards \n     traditional Federal/State relationships. EPA has even taken \n     the unprecedented step of threatening to impose its own \n     Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) in the absence of \n     acceptable State action. Several additional States are \n     considering whether to file an amicus brief in support of the \n     Complaint. The U.S. Court of Appeals recently stayed EPA's \n     NOX SIP Call pending appeal of the Court's \n     decision setting aside EPA's new Ozone and Particulate Matter \n     standards.\n       One element of the rule would force local utilities to \n     control NOX emissions at levels unprecedented to \n     date. The reductions are of a magnitude that will require \n     capital intensive technology with likely significant pass-\n     through costs to energy consumers. The unavoidable \n     consequence will be higher energy costs to municipalities and \n     local communities, including industrial and residential \n     consumers alike. As rural and urban communities seek \n     investment to spur economic growth, the shadow of higher \n     energy costs could have significant adverse effects on \n     Brownfields redevelopment and rural/urban revitalization \n     generally.\n       The EPA compliance deadline are so stringent that electric \n     utilities could be forced to shut down generating plants to \n     install the necessary control equipment within a very short \n     time. This could result in a temporary disruption of \n     electricity supply.\n       Significant NOX emissions reductions will \n     continue to be realized under existing mobile and stationary \n     control programs as the Clean Air Act continues to be \n     implemented thus minimizing the need, if any, for such \n     potentially disruptive requirements as called for in the EPA \n     NOX rule. This is especially true for local areas \n     in the mid-east that are dealing effectively with ozone \n     compliance challenges. Any new control programs, before being \n     implemented, must be weighed against the potential adverse \n     implications for local rural and urban communities.\n       Accordingly, by our signatures below, we collectively call \n     on EPA to reconsider the NOX rule in light of \n     these concerns. In light of the Court's stay of the \n     NOX SIP Call, at a minimum, we urge EPA to provide \n     maximum flexibility to and address lead-time needs of utility \n     energy providers so as to minimize potential adverse economic \n     consequences to local rural and urban communities. Further, \n     we call on EPA to restore balance and cooperation between \n     states and EPA so that States can comply with the rule while \n     protecting their rights to determine the best methods of \n     doing so.\n       Finally, we direct that copies of this Petition be provided \n     to the President, the Vice President, Members of Congress, \n     Governors and other local officials as are appropriate.\n       Alabama: Moses, Walter S.

IV, sec. 3, United States Constitution, \n     provides that the United States Congress shall make all \n     needed regulations governing lands belonging to the United \n     States; and\n       Whereas many of the United Nations' designations include \n     private property inholdings and contemplate ``buffer zones'' \n     of adjacent land; and\n       Whereas some international land designations such as those \n     under the United States Biosphere Reserve Program and the Man \n     and Biosphere Program of the United Nations Scientific, \n     Educational, and Culture Organization operate under \n     independent national committees such as the United States \n     National Man and Biosphere Committee that have no legislative \n     directives or authorization from the Congress; and\n       Whereas these international designations as presently \n     handled are an open invitation to the international community \n     to interfere in domestic economies and land use decisions; \n     and\n       Whereas local citizens and public officials concerned about \n     job creation and resource based economies usually have no say \n     in the designation of land near their homes for inclusion in \n     an international land use program; and\n       Whereas former Assistant Secretary of the Interior George \n     T. Frampton, Jr., and the President used the fact that \n     Yellowstone National Park had been designated as a ``World \n     Heritage Site'' as justification for intervening in the \n     environmental impact statement process and blocking possible \n     development of an underground mine on private land in Montana \n     outside of the park; and\n       Whereas a recent designation of a portion of Kamchatka as a \n     ``World Heritage Site'' was followed immediately by efforts \n     from environmental groups to block investment insurance for \n     development projects on Kamchatka that are supported by the \n     local communities; and\n       Whereas environmental groups and the National Park Service \n     have been working to establish an International Park, a World \n     Heritage Site, and a Marine Biosphere Reserve\n\n[[Page S9220]]\n\n     covering parts of western Alaska, eastern Russia, and the \n     Bering Sea; and\n       Whereas, as occurred in Montana, such designations could be \n     used to block development projects on state and private land \n     in western Alaska; and\n       Whereas foreign companies and countries could use such \n     international designations in western Alaska to block \n     economic development that they perceive as competition; and\n       Whereas animal rights activists could use such \n     international designations to generate pressure to harass or \n     block harvesting of marine mammals by Alaska Natives; and\n       Whereas such international designations could be used to \n     harass or block any commercial activity, including pipelines, \n     railroads, and power transmission lines; and\n       Whereas the President and the executive branch of the \n     United States have, by Executive Order and other agreements, \n     implemented these designations without approval by the \n     Congress; and\n       Whereas the United States Department of Interior, in \n     cooperation with the Federal Interagency panel for World \n     Heritage, has identified the Aleutian Island Unit of the \n     Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge, Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge, Cape Krusenstern National Monument, Denali \n     National Park, Gates of the Arctic National Park, and Katmai \n     National Park as likely to meet the criteria for future \n     nominations as World Heritage Sites; and\n       Whereas the Alaska State legislature objects to the \n     nomination or designation of any World Heritage Sites or \n     Biosphere Reserves in Alaska without the specific consent of \n     the Alaska State Legislature; and\n       Whereas actions by the President in applying international \n     agreements to lands owned by the United States may circumvent \n     the Congress; and\n       Whereas Congressman Don Young introduced House Resolution \n     No. 901 in the 105th Congress entitled the ``American Land \n     Sovereignty Protection Act of 1997'' that required the \n     explicit approval of the Congress prior to restricting any \n     use of the United States land under international agreements; \n     and\n       Whereas Congress Don Young has reintroduced this \n     legislation in the 106th Congress as House Resolution No. \n     883, which is entitled the ``American Land Sovereignty \n     Protection Act''; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature supports House \n     Resolution 883, the ``American Land Sovereignty Protection \n     Act,'' that reaffirms the constitutional authority of the \n     Congress as the elected representatives of the people over \n     the federally owned land of the United States and urges the \n     swift introduction and passage of such act by the 106th \n     Congress; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature objects to the \n     nomination or designation of any sites in Alaska as World \n     Heritage Sites or Biosphere Reserves without the prior \n     consent of the Alaska State Legislature.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Bill Clinton, President of the United States; Honorable Al \n     Gore, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and President \n     of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Trent Lott, Majority Leader \n     of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable J.

and\n       Whereas the residents of the North Slope Borough, within \n     which the coastal plain is located, are supportive of \n     development in the ``1002 study area''; and\n       Whereas oil and gas exploration and development of the \n     coastal plain of the refuge and adjacent land could result in \n     major discoveries that would reduce our nation's future \n     need for imported oil, help balance the nation's trade \n     deficit, and significantly increase the nation's security; \n     and\n       Whereas domestic demand for oil continues to rise while \n     domestic crude production continues to fall with the result \n     that the United States imports additional oil from foreign \n     sources; and\n       Whereas development of oil at Prudhoe Bay, Kuparuk, \n     Endicott, Lisburne, and Milne Point has resulted in thousands \n     of jobs throughout the United States, and projected job \n     creation as a result of coastal plain oil development will \n     have a positive effect in all 50 states; and\n       Whereas Prudhoe Bay production is declining by \n     approximately 10 percent a year; and\n       Whereas, while new oil field developments on the North \n     Slope of Alaska, such as Alpine, Badami, and West Sak, may \n     slow or temporarily stop the decline in production, only \n     giant coastal plain fields have the theoretical capability of \n     increasing the production volume of Alaska oil to a \n     significant degree; and\n       Whereas opening the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge now allows sufficient time for planning \n     environmental safeguards, development, and national security \n     review; and\n       Whereas the oil and gas industry and related state \n     employment have been severely affected by reduced oil and gas \n     activity, and the reduction in industry investment and \n     employment has broad implications for the state's work force \n     and the entire state economy; and\n       Whereas the 1,500,000-acre coastal plain of the refuge \n     comprises only eight percent of the 19,000,000-acre refuge, \n     and the development of the oil and gas reserves in the \n     refuge's coastal plain would affect an area of only 2,000 to \n     7,000 acres, which is less than one-half of one percent of \n     the area of the coastal plain; and\n       Whereas 8,000,000 of the 19,000,000 acres of the refuge \n     have already be set aside as wilderness; and\n       Whereas the oil industry has shown at Prudhoe Bay, as well \n     as at other locations along the Arctic coastal plain, that it \n     can safely conduct oil and gas activity without adversely \n     affecting the environment or wildlife populations; and\n       Whereas the state will ensure the continued health and \n     productivity of the Porcupine Caribou herd and the protection \n     of land, water, and wildlife resources during the exploration \n     and development of the coastal plain of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge, Alaska; and\n       Whereas the oil industry is using innovative technology and \n     environmental practices in the new field developments at \n     Alpine and Northstar, and those techniques are directly \n     applicable to operating on the coastal plain and would \n     enhance environmental protection beyond traditionally high \n     standards; Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Alaska State Legislature, That the Congress \n     of the United States is urged to pass legislation to open the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, \n     to oil and gas exploration, development, and production, and \n     that the Alaska State Legislature is adamantly opposed to \n     further wilderness or other restrictive designation in the \n     area of the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge, Alaska; and be it further\n       Resolved, That that activity be conducted in a manner that \n     protects the environment and uses the state's work force to \n     the maximum extent possible.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Bill Clinton, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     Al Gore, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and \n     president of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Bruce Babbitt, \n     Secretary of the Interior; the Honorable Dennis Hastert, \n     Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; the Honorable \n     Trent Lott, Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate; to the \n     Honorable Ted Stevens and the Honorable Frank Murkowski, U.S. \n     Senators, and the Honorable Don Young, U.S. Representative, \n     members of the Alaska delegation in Congress; and to all \n     other members of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of \n     Representatives serving in the 106th United States Congress.\n\n  The following petitions and memorials were laid before the Senate and \nwere referred or ordered to lie on the table as indicated on July 26, \n1999:\n\n       POM-270. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of New Hampshire relative to oxygenate additives \n     for gasoline; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                        House Joint Resolution 9\n\n       Whereas, the federal Clean Air Act has required that \n     oxygenates be added to gasoline for the purpose of reducing \n     air pollution and, in particular, ground-level ozone and \n     carbon monoxide; and\n       Whereas, automobile improvements over the last several \n     years have considerably reduced the benefits of oxygenates \n     for controlling carbon monoxide emissions by eliminating much \n     of the carbon monoxide which would be emitted in the absence \n     of oxygenates; and\n       Whereas, automobile improvements over the last several \n     years have likewise considerably reduced the benefits of \n     oxygenates for controlling hydrocarbon emissions; and\n       Whereas, substantial evidence has been developed over the \n     last few years that, in much of the country, the formation of \n     ground-level ozone is not significantly dependent upon \n     amounts of hydrocarbon emissions; and\n       Whereas, questions have been raised as to whether one \n     oxygenate in common use,\n\n[[Page S9222]]\n\n     methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), is degrading water quality to an \n     extent that more than offsets its limited and decreasing \n     benefits for air pollution control; and\n       Whereas, the threat that MTBE poses to the water resources \n     of New Hampshire could be lessened in the short term by \n     substituting conventional gasoline, which contains a much \n     lower concentration of MTBE, for reformulated gasoline in the \n     4 southern counties (Hillsborough, Merrimack, Rockingham, and \n     Strafford) required by federal regulation to use reformulated \n     gasoline; and\n       Whereas, such gasoline substitution is not possible in New \n     Hampshire without the Environmental Protection Agency \n     granting the state a waiver to do so; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate and house of representatives in \n     general court convened:\n       That Congress should eliminate the oxygenate requirements \n     of the federal Clean Air Act without imposing any new federal \n     requirements to reduce air pollution; and\n       That the Environmental Protection Agency should \n     expeditiously grant New Hampshire the short-term waivers \n     necessary to permit the substitution of conventional gasoline \n     for reformulated gasoline, without requiring substitute air \n     emission reduction strategies as part of the state's air \n     pollution implementation plan; and\n       That such gasoline substitution should be allowed prior to \n     the completion of the ongoing, long-term comparative risk \n     studies that will eventually identify the relative health and \n     environmental costs and benefits of using gasoline \n     formulations that have reduced MTBE levels; and\n       That when a better understanding has been reached of the \n     comparative risks of different gasoline formulations, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency should utilize incentive-\n     based programs, rather than command-and-control measures, to \n     further reduce MTBE levels in gasoline, provided that such \n     reduction is consistent with the comparative risk analyses; \n     and\n       That copies of this resolution be sent by the house clerk \n     to the President of the United States, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the chairpersons of committees of the \n     United States Congress having jurisdiction over the Clean Air \n     Act, the Administrator of the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency, and each member of the New Hampshire \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-271. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of New Hampshire relative to federal air pollution \n     programs, to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                        House Joint Resolution 2\n\n       Whereas, the federal Clean Air Act has in the past \n     allocated pollution allowances, which are items of commercial \n     value, to pollution sources based on emissions existing on \n     arbitrary baseline dates, where higher emissions equated to \n     being granted more allowances; and\n       Whereas, such a policy has rewarded dirtier operators by \n     allocating to them more allowances than their cleaner \n     competitors, and further, has unfairly served to punish \n     operators who have happened to install expensive air \n     pollution controls shortly before the baseline dates; and\n       Whereas, these past actions have made it more difficult to \n     encourage polluters to reduce emissions prior to regulatory \n     deadlines; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the senate and house of representatives in \n     General Court convened:\n       That future federal air pollution legislation should avoid \n     using baseline pollution as a basis for allocation of \n     allowances or other items of commercial value, or any future \n     reduction requirements; and\n       That to the extent that the federal government chooses to \n     continue to use baseline emissions to determine allowance \n     allocation and future reduction requirements, either to \n     individual polluters or to states, that it choose a baseline \n     date far enough in the past in order that recently-improved \n     sources are not placed at a competitive disadvantage against \n     dirtier competitors that have not made such investments and \n     have smaller capital and operating costs as a result; and\n       That such care with baselines be used not only for sulfur \n     dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions, but also for any other \n     emissions which the federal government may subsequently \n     choose to control with allowance-based mechanisms; and\n       That copies of this resolution be sent by the house clerk \n     to the President of the United States, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, the chairpersons of committees of the \n     United States Congress having jurisdiction over the Clean Air \n     Act, the Administrator of the United States Environmental \n     Protection Agency, and each member of the New Hampshire \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-272.

I ask unanimous consent that the text \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States--Macau Policy \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2 FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings and declarations`\n       (1) The Congress recognizes that under the Joint \n     Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China and the Government of the Republic of Portugal on the \n     Question of Macau, dated April 13, 1987--\n       (A) the People's Republic of China and the Republic of \n     Portugal have agreed that the People's Republic of China will \n     resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macau on December 20, \n     1999, and until that time, Portugal will be responsible for \n     the continuing administration of Macau;\n       (B) the People's Republic of China has guaranteed that, on \n     and after December 20, 1999, the Macau Special Administrative \n     Region of the People's Republic of China, will continue to \n     enjoy a high degree of autonomy on all matters other than \n     defense and foreign affairs;\n       (C) the People's Republic of China will implement a ``one \n     country, two systems'' policy with respect to Macau, under \n     which Macau will retain its current legal, social, and \n     economic systems until at least the year 2049;\n       (D) provision is made for the continuation in force of \n     bilateral and multilateral agreements implemented as of \n     December 20, 1999, and for the ability of the Macau Special \n     Administrative Region to conclude new agreements.\n       (2) The Congress supports the full and complete \n     implementation of the provisions of the Joint Declaration.\n       (3) The Congress supports the policies and objectives set \n     forth in the Joint Declaration.\n       (4) It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (A) continued economic prosperity in Macau furthers United \n     States interests in Asia and in our relationship with the \n     People's Republic of China;\n       (B)(i) support for principles of democracy is a fundamental \n     tenent of United States foreign policy, and as such, will \n     also play a central role in United States policy toward \n     Macau, now and after December 19, 1999; and\n       (ii) safeguarding the human rights of the people of Macau \n     is of great importance to the United States and is directly \n     relevant to United States interests in Macau;\n       (iii) a fully successful transition in the exercise of \n     sovereignty over Macau must safeguard those human rights; and\n       (iv) human rights also serve as a basis for Macau's \n     continued economic prosperity.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act--\n       (1) prior to December 20, 1999, the term ``Macau'' means \n     the Portuguese Dependent Territory of Macau, and on and after \n     December 20, 1999, the term ``Macau'' means the Macau \n     Special Administration Region of the People's Republic of \n     China;\n       (2) the term ``Joint Declaration'' means the Joint \n     Declaration of the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China and the Government of the Republic of Portugal on the \n     Question of Macau, dated April 13, 1987; and\n       (3) the term ``laws of the United States'' means provisions \n     of law enacted by the Congress.\n\n                            TITLE I--POLICY\n\n     SEC. 101. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should play an active role before, \n     on, and after December 20, 1999, in assisting Macau in \n     maintaining its confidence and prosperity, its unique \n     cultural heritage, and the mutually beneficial ties between \n     the people of the United States and the people of Macau; and\n       (2) through its policies, the United States should assist \n     Macau in maintaining a high degree of autonomy in matters \n     other than defense and foreign affairs as guaranteed by the \n     People's Republic of China and the Republic of Portugal in \n     the Joint Declaration, particularly with respect to such \n     matters as trade, commerce, law enforcement, finance, \n     monetary policy, aviation, shipping, communications, tourism, \n     cultural affairs, sports, and participation in international \n     organizations, consistent with the national security and \n     other interests of the United States.\n\n           TITLE II--THE STATUS OF MACAU IN UNITED STATES LAW\n\n     SEC. 201. CONTINUED APPLICATION OF UNITED STATES LAW.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any change in the exercise \n     of sovereignty over Macau, and subject to subsections (b) and \n     (c), the laws of the United States shall continue to apply \n     with respect to Macau, on and after December 20, 1999, in the \n     same manner as the laws of the United States were applied \n     with respect to Macau before such date unless otherwise \n     expressly provided by law or by Executive order under section \n     202.\n       (b) International Agreements.--For all purposes, including \n     actions in any court of the United States, the Congress \n     approves of the continuation in force on and after December \n     20, 1999, of all treaties and other international agreements, \n     including multilateral conventions, entered into before such \n     date between the United States and Macau, or entered into \n     force before such date between the United States and the \n     Republic of Portugal with respect to, or as applied to, \n     Macau, unless or until terminated in accordance with law. If, \n     in carrying out this title, the President determines that \n     Macau is not legally competent to carry out its obligations \n     under any such treaty or other international agreement, or \n     that the continuation of Macau's obligations or rights under \n     any such treaty or other international agreement is not \n     appropriate under the circumstances, the President shall \n     promptly notify the Committee on International Relations of \n     the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate concerning such determination, and \n     shall take appropriate action to modify or terminate such \n     treaty or other international agreement.\n       (c) Export Controls.--Notwithstanding subsection (a) or any \n     other provision of law, within 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act the President--in close consultation \n     with the relevant committees of the Congress--shall establish \n     with respect to Macau, such export control policies and \n     regulations as he determines to be necessary to protect fully \n     the national security interests of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 202. PRESIDENTIAL ORDER.\n\n       (a) Presidential Determination.--On or after December 20, \n     1999, whenever the President determines that Macau is not \n     sufficiently autonomous to justify treatment under a \n     particular law of the United States, or any provision \n     thereof, different from that accorded the People's Republic \n     of China, the President may issue an Executive order \n     suspending the application of section 201(a) to such law or \n     provision of law. The President shall promptly notify the \n     Committee on International Relations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate concerning any such determination.\n       (b) Factor for Consideration.--In making a determination \n     under subsection (a) with respect to the application of a law \n     of the United States, or any provision thereof, to Macau, the \n     President should consider the terms, obligations, and \n     expectations expressed in the Joint Declaration with respect \n     to Macau.\n       (c) Publication in Federal Register.--Any Executive order \n     issued under subsection\n\n[[Page S9225]]\n\n     (a) shall be published in the Federal Register and shall \n     specify the law or provision of law affected by the order.\n       (d) Termination of Suspension.--An Executive order issued \n     under subsection (a) may be terminated by the President with \n     respect to a particular law or provision of law whenever the \n     President determines that Macau has regained sufficient \n     autonomy to justify treatment under the law or provision of \n     law in question. Notice of any such termination shall be \n     published in the Federal Register.\n\n     SEC. 203. RULES AND REGULATIONS.\n\n       The President is authorized to prescribe such rules and \n     regulations as he considers appropriate to carry out this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 204. CONSULTATION WITH CONGRESS.\n\n       In carrying out this title, the President shall consult \n     appropriately with the Congress, in particular with:\n       (a) the Committee on International Relations, and the \n     Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (b) the Committee on Foreign Relations, and the Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the Senate.\n\n                    TITLE III--REPORTING PROVISIONS\n\n     SEC. 301.

A bill to amend the National Historic Preservation Act to \nreauthorize that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senators \nAkaka and Cleland to introduce this legislation that would extend the \nauthorization for appropriations for the National Historic Preservation \nFund, as established by the Historic Preservation Act amendments of \n1976. On September 30, 1997, the authorization for deposits into the \nHistoric Preservation Fund from revenues due and payable to the United \nStates under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act expired. So we \nintroduce this legislation with the purpose of reauthorizing the \ndeposits at the same level of $150 million annually through the year \n2005.\n  As you are aware, and others in this Chamber, this fund account \nsupports roughly one-half of the cost of the Nation's historic \npreservation programs. State governments contribute the other half. \nThis is a partnership that is working--preserving our communities, \ncreating jobs, and providing opportunities for this partnership to \nflourish.\n  States and certain local governments and Native American tribes carry \nout our historic preservation programs under the act for the Secretary \nof the Interior and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation. This \nprogram involves the identification of historic places, working with \nproperty owners in nominating significant places to the National \nRegister, consulting with Federal agencies on projects that may \nadversely impact historic places, advising investors on important tax \ncredits for the rehabilitation of historic buildings, and offering \ninformation and educational opportunities to the private and public \nsectors on historic preservation.\n  This program is made possible through the Historic Preservation Fund, \nand it contributes significantly, as I have said, to community \nrevitalization and to economic development.\n  We believe it is extremely worthwhile, it is a program that works, \nand we must reauthorize this fund so the State historic preservation \noffices and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation may continue \nthis important work.\n  I would just like to state for the Record some very brief examples of \nhow this has worked around the Nation.\n  One example is from my hometown in New Orleans. The Maginnis Cotton \nMill, which was constructed in 1884, was the largest textile \nmanufacturing plant in the South. It was once a ``model institution'' \nemploying 450 workers. The Maginnis Mill remained the largest in the \nSouth until it closed in 1944. Over 50 years had passed before\n\n[[Page S9226]]\n\nany restorative work was done to the mill.\n  In 1996, while maintaining the original ascetic integrity of this \nenormous complex in downtown New Orleans, the Historic Restoration \nGroup, Inc., converted the old mill into 267 apartments. It has now \nbeen completed. It is a beautiful renovation project. It is now the \nhome for 267 residents and their families, and it has increased the \nhousing in that area by 26 percent. The building, which has been called \na ``freeze frame'' of the development of the city, has greatly \nincreased property values in that area, not to mention the surrounding \narea.\n  Another example is Chinatown, Honolulu. Once nearly engulfed with \nhigh-rise redevelopment, Chinatown today is protected by a requirement \nthat new construction be reviewed by a design commission. Tools used \ninclude a National Register of Historic Places nomination, Advisory \nCouncil on Historic Preservation review, and the preservation tax \nincentives.\n  Another example is the Indianapolis Union Railway Station. A $40 \nmillion rehabilitation project over a decade drew on several Federal \nfunding programs and extensive consultation with the State and has \nspurred other adjacent rehabilitations. The station now serves as a \nfestival marketplace with hotel and transportation facilities.\n  Another example is Formosan Termite Control. A threat to the Vieux \nCarre and other historic districts in the South, the Formosan termite \nis immune to common treatment. A Historic Preservation Fund grant is \nenabling Louisiana State University to study ways of improving \ndetection and eradication of the pest.\n  Another example is Ledbetter Heights low-income housing, Shreveport. \nSection 8 housing designation and the preservation tax incentives were \nused to purchase and rehabilitate shotgun houses in the St. Paul's \nBottoms Historic District. Shreveport Landmarks, Inc., cooperated with \na tenants' council in the process.\n  There are literally hundreds of other examples of successful \nrenovation projects that would not be possible without the Historic \nPreservation Fund. From Hawaii to Maine, from Louisiana to North \nDakota, and all in between, there are places in urban and rural areas \nthat have greatly benefited by the presence of this fund.\n  So I introduce this legislation tonight. I look forward to finding \nthe funding for not just a one-time appropriation. As you know, S. 25 \nis a bill that seeks to find a permanent source of funding for many \nimportant environmental and wildlife conservation projects. Perhaps our \nNational Historic Fund could become part of that so this permanent \nsource of funding could go on to our cities and our communities so they \nwould have a steady stream of revenue to continue to improve these \nareas in our communities, both in urban and rural parts of our Nation.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I join my colleague, Senator Landrieu, in introducing \nlegislation to reauthorize the Historic Preservation Fund and the \nAdvisory Council on Historic Preservation. As my colleagues may know, \nthe authorization for the Historic Preservation Fund expired on \nSeptember 30, 1997, and the authorization for the Advisory Council \nexpires on September 30, 2000. This bill would reauthorize the fund and \nthe Council through fiscal year 2005.\n  There is a growing backlog of preservation needs throughout our \ncountry that is not being met. To ensure that this situation is not \nexacerbated, and to address these shortfalls on a long-term basis, the \nHistoric Preservation Fund should be reauthorized at the earliest \nopportunity.\n  The National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was amended in 1976 to \nestablish the Historic Preservation Fund. Administered by the National \nPark Service, the Fund provides grants-in-aid to States, certified \nlocal governments, and outlying areas. The National Historic \nPreservation Act provides that $150 million from Outer Continental \nshelf oil and gas receipts is deposited in the Fund each year. The \nrevenue remains available in the Fund until appropriated by Congress. \nSince September 30, 1997, no additional deposits from OCS revenues into \nthe Fund have been authorized.\n  Reauthorization of the Historic Preservation Fund is critical because \nit provides for the continuation of grants used by States, Tribes, \nNative Hawaiians, Alaska Natives, and local governments to pay the \ncosts of surveys, comprehensive historic preservation plans, National \nRegister nominations, brochures and educational materials, as well as \narchitectural plans, historic structure reports, and engineering \nstudies necessary to repair listed properties.\n  Since 1968, over $800 million in grant funds has been awarded to 59 \nStates, territories, local governments, Native Hawaiian organizations, \nIndian tribes, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation. In \nFiscal Year 1998, the States received a total of $29.4 million in \nhistoric preservation grants-in-aid, an average allocation of $524,000, \nwhich typically is matched by $350,000 in non-federal matching share \ncontributions.\n  During 1998, States surveyed 14.9 million acres of historic resources \nand added 185,100 properties to their inventories. Also in 1998, States \nsubmitted 1,602 nominations to the National Register of Historic Places \nand reviewed 89,000 Federal projects for compliance with Section 106 of \nthe National Historic Preservation Act. In Hawaii, over 38,000 \nproperties are maintained on the state's inventory of known historic \nproperties.\n  Besides providing grants-in-aid, the Historic Preservation Fund also \nadministers a grant program for Native Hawaiians, Indian Tribes, and \nAlaska Natives for cultural heritage programs. The Tribal Preservation \nProgram has directly assisted over 170 tribes through the award of 259 \ngrants.\n  For example, the Hopi Tribe in Arizona received a grant to document \nthe rock art sites at Antelope Mesa, resulting in 100 sites being \nincluded in their Cultural Resources Management Plan. In Alaska, the \nNative Village of Venetie drafted a historic preservation plan for \nVenetie and Arctic Village utilizing a grant from the \nHistoric Preservation Fund. The Seneca Nation of Indians in New York \nused a grant to develop educational materials for their school children \nusing oral interviews with tribal elders.\n\n  In all, more than $9 million in grant funds has been used to assist \ntribes in assuming State Historic Preservation Office responsibilities, \nin drafting preservation ordinances, implementing cultural resource \nmanagement plans, identifying and protecting historic sites, and \nconducting preservation needs assessments.\n  In addition, the Fund provides matching grants to Historically Black \nColleges and Universities to preserve threatened historic buildings \nlocated on their campuses. Funding for preservation projects has been \nused at Fisk University and Knoxville College in Tennessee; Miles \nCollege, Talladega College, Selma University, Stillman College, \nConcordia College in Alabama; Allen University, Claflin College, \nVoorhees College in South Carolina; and Rust College and Tougaloo \nUniversity in Mississippi.\n  In addition to the Historic Preservation Fund, Congress created the \nAdvisory Council on Historic Preservation under the National Historic \nPreservation Act of 1966. As an independent federal agency, in \ncooperation with the Secretary of the Interior, the Council is the \nmajor policy advisor to the Federal government on historic \npreservation. The Council administers programs including, but not \nlimited to, the Historic Preservation Fund, the National Register, and \nprograms of the National Trust. The Council also reviews the policies \nof Federal agencies in implementing the National Historic Preservation \nAct, conducts training and educational programs, and encourages public \nparticipation in historic preservation. The Council's authorization \nexpires in Fiscal Year 2000.\n  The Council's role in working with Federal agencies to support the \nNational Historic Preservation Act is essential for protecting this \ncountry's historical resources. The Council coordinates many different \npreservation programs. The Council works with the Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's HOME program for affordable housing, promotes \npreservation of historic properties during natural disasters, and \npromotes preservation and reuse of historic properties during military \nbase closures. The Council, working with State and local governments \nthrough State Historic Preservation Officers, has significantly \nenhanced our ability to preserve our national heritage.\n\n[[Page S9227]]\n\n  Both the Historic Preservation Fund and the Advisory Council \ncontribute to ongoing Federal, Native Hawaiian, Tribal, State, local \nand private partnerships in historic preservation. Matching funds are \ncontributed by the States and local and private partners to enhance the \ninvestment in our historic heritage. Federal and State funding for \nhistoric preservation creates jobs, promotes economic development, and \nhelps leverage commitments from private and public sources.\n  Historic sites in our country are tangible reminders of our diverse \nand rich heritage and provide us with a sense of continuity with our \npast. The Historic Preservation Fund has provided numerous \nopportunities for preserving our country's irreplaceable historic and \narcheological resources. For example, in Hawaii, preservation projects \nin the Oahu Market in Chinatown and at the Mission Houses were funded \nthrough Historic Preservation Fund grants. Similarly, New Hampshire \nused preservation funding to assist with the transformation of the 1925 \nGoffstown High School into an apartment complex for the town's older \ninhabitants. The Alaska Gold Rush Centennial was developed as a \nheritage tourism initiative of the Alaska State Historic Preservation \nOffice using historic preservation funds to establish State-community \npartnerships. Also, the Save America's Treasures program funded by the \nHistoric Preservation Fund has provided grants for preservation \nprojects of national scope and significance, including restoration of \nthe Star-Spangled Banner and the Declaration of Independence.\n\n  A similar bill introduced by the Senator from Louisiana (Ms. \nLandrieu) passed the Senate last year by unanimous consent but was not \nacted on by the House. I hope that the legislation we are offering \ntoday--a simple reauthorization of the Fund and Council through 2005--\ncan be adopted expeditiously.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation \nOfficers, the National Alliance of Statewide Preservation \nOrganizations, the National Coordinating Committee for the Promotion of \nHistory, Preservation Action, the Society for American Archaeology, and \nthe American Historical Association. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis measure as well.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1435. A bill to amend section 9 of the Small Business Act to \nprovide for the establishment of volunteer mentoring programs; to the \nCommittee on Small Business.\n\n\nlegislation to establish a volunteer mentoring program for the sbir and \n                             sttr programs\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, small businesses are the biggest job \nproducers in our economy and technology is an increasingly important \ncomponent to those growth figures. Contributing to that continued high \ntechnology job growth is a high technology procurement program that \nallows small and innovative high technology companies to bid on some of \nthe federal government's research and development proposals. The Small \nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) program gives these small \ntechnology companies a tool to compete in the big leagues by giving \nthem fairer access to federal research and a way to finance that \nresearch in order to commercialize it. It also gives the federal \ngovernment access to highly innovative companies that can custom design \nand develop specialized technology for an agency's specific needs--\nsomething bigger companies may not be able to do as well.\n  The SBIR program does this by mandating that each federal agency with \na research and development budget that is contracted to outside vendors \nin excess of $100 million designate 2.5 percent of this budget for \nawards to small businesses. Currently there are 10 federal agencies \nparticipating in the SBIR program. A smaller component of this program \nis the Small Business Technology Transfer program (STTR), which allows \n5 agencies to allocate three twentieths of one percent of these funds \nto small businesses that partner with non-profit institutions to do the \nresearch and development.\n  The SBIR program creates jobs, increases our capacity for \ntechnological innovation and boosts our international competitiveness. \nAccording to an April 1998 GAO study, about 50 percent of SBIR research \nis commercialized or receives additional research funding. That's a \npretty good success rate. It's also a great example of federal agencies \nworking together with small businesses to develop technologies to solve \nspecific problems and fill government procurement needs in a cost \neffective way.\n  The SBIR and STTR programs are successful programs and we can make \nthem even more successful by establishing a volunteer mentoring \nprogram. Such a program would partner CEOs of small high technology \ncompanies that have successfully completed a SBIR or STTR program with \nsmall businesses in low participation areas to guide them through the \nprocess, increasing their chances for success and, ultimately, the \ncommercialization of their research.\n  Many states believe they can do better regarding the number of SBIR \nawards their small businesses win. Since the SBIR and STTR programs are \nhighly competitive and merit-based programs and should remain so, I \nbelieve the best way to increase participation is through outreach and \nmentoring. My bill would target its mentoring program to low \nparticipation areas which receive a disproportionately low number of \nSBIR awards as compared with other areas in the state or in the \ncountry.\n  Michigan is just one example of a state which has many low \nparticipation areas within it that could improve their participation in \nthe program. In 1997 Michigan small businesses nevertheless won 102 \nSBIR awards worth a total of $24.6 million, ranking it 14th nationally. \nBut Michigan should be doing better. Based on its population, Michigan \nranks 8th nationally, not 14th as it does in number of SBIR awards. I \nbelieve the volunteer mentoring program I am proposing will help small \nhigh technology businesses from those areas within Michigan and around \nthe country that lack access to research universities, venture capital \nor other resources to increase their chances of participating \nsuccessfully in this program.\n  Last summer, the Senate Small Business Committee held an SBIR \noversight hearing to begin to develop a hearing record in preparation \nfor SBIR's reauthorization. At that hearing, GAO presented a study \nfavorably reviewing the program. It pointed out, however, that because \nagencies are adhering to the program requirements that they not use \nSBIR funds to pay for the administrative costs of the program, this \nfunding restriction has limited their ability to provide some needed \nadministrative support. For example, some agencies reported they do not \nhave the necessary funds to provide personnel to act as mentors to \ntheir SBIR companies or engage in activities that could possibly \nincrease the program's success in phase III. GAO also said the lack of \nadministrative support means agencies are unable to provide SBIR \nparticipants with much-needed training in business skills. A volunteer \nmentoring program could fill this void.\n\n  Also at that hearing, a number of Senators expressed a desire to see \nmore geographical distribution of SBIR awards and hearing witnesses \nsuggested this could be addressed through outreach to make more high \ntechnology small businesses aware of the program. A natural complement \nto reaching out to new companies to tell them about the SBIR and STTR \nprograms is the establishment of a mentoring program to increase their \nodds for success in those programs.\n  Many SBIR-company CEOs have benefitted from the program, are \ncommitted to its success and have told me they want to give something \nback. They propose doing this in the way of mentoring small businesses \nthat are new to the SBIR process. The bill I am introducing today would \nestablish a program to coordinate that process and reimburse volunteer \nmentors for their out-of-pocket-expenses. It would also address the \ndesire to expand participation in the program by targeting the \nmentoring to low participation areas.\n  I am pleased to have the Senate Small Business Committee Ranking \nMember, John Kerry, join me as an original cosponsor of this bill. My \nlegislation also has the support of key members of the SBIR community.\n\n[[Page S9228]]\n\n  My bill would establish a Mentoring program where past SBIR and STTR \nrecipients partner with new applicant companies in low participation \nareas to help guide them through the process and increase their chances \nof success. A small business's failure to obtain a phase I or Phase II \naward may have nothing to do with the capability of its technology but \nrather is often a result of a lack of understanding the government \nprocurement process and procedures. This mentoring program would help \nbring new companies into the SBIR program from areas that have not \ntraditionally participated at high rates. It would also increase Phase \nIII awards and commercialization of the technology being developed.\n  Specifically, my bill would establish a competitively bid volunteer \nmentoring grant program for the SBIR and STTR programs. The Small \nBusiness Administration would be responsible for administering the \nprogram. Organizations representing SBIR and STTR awardees could apply \nfor grants ranging from $50,000 -$200,000 to participate in the \nprogram. Qualifying organizations would match small businesses in low \nparticipation areas new to the SBIR/STTR process with CEOs and others \nof small, high technology companies that have successfully completed \none or more SBIR/STTR contracts, grants or cooperative agreements. The \n``volunteer mentors'' would be reimbursed only for their out-of-pocket \nexpenses. Their time, energy and know-how would be donated free-of-\ncharge. The program would be authorized at $1 million per year to cover \nadministration of the program and reimbursement of volunteer mentors \nfor their out-of-pocket expenses.\n  There are a number of effective organizations and entities \nrepresenting SBIR and STTR companies that would be eligible to apply \nfor the program. This legislation is intended to attract organizations \nsuch as the Small Business Technology Coalition, various regional \ngroups or entities working with SBIR companies as well as some \ntechnology oriented specialized Small Business Development Centers, and \nothers. Some of these eligible entities and organizations may even \nchose to partner together in a collaborative effort to apply to the \nprogram.\n  The SBIR program, originally established in 1982 and reauthorized and \nexpanded in 1992, expires in fiscal year 2000. This highly competitive \nprogram has a well deserved reputation for success and has enjoyed \nbipartisan support over the years. I hope my bill can be included in \nthat reauthorizing legislation to improve what is already a successful \nprogram giving small high technology companies access to federal \nresearch and development and the federal government access to some of \nthe world's best innovation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters of \nendorsement for the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    Small Business\n\n\n                                         Technology Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: The Small Business Technology Coalition \n     (SBTC) wishes to express its support for your ``mentoring'' \n     bill to amend the reauthorization of the Small Business \n     Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. The amendment would \n     provide much needed support to small business in ``low \n     participating areas'' applying for grants under the SBIR \n     program.\n       As you know, the amendment would establish a competitively \n     bid volunteer mentoring grant program for the SBIR. The Small \n     Business Administration would be responsible for \n     administering the program. Organizations representing SBIR \n     awardees could apply for grants ranging from $50,000 to \n     $200,000 to participate in the program. Qualifying \n     organizations would match small businesses new to the SBIR \n     process with CEOs and other of small, high-technology \n     companies that have been successful SBIR award winners. These \n     ``volunteer mentors'' would be reimbursed only for their out-\n     of-pocket expenses incurred while mentoring, not for their \n     time. The program would be authorized at $1 million per year \n     to cover administration of the program and reimbursement of \n     volunteer mentors for their out-of-pocket expenses.\n       As the nation-wide trade association of small high tech \n     business CEOs, SBTC can attest to the value of a mentoring \n     program to help small businesses new to the SBIR process. \n     SBTC members have hands-on experience and know the importance \n     of expert technical assistance in locating venture capital, \n     seeking Phase III partners and commercialization. SBTC speaks \n     for the small high tech business community and knows through \n     experience that mentoring is a key to success in the SBIR \n     process.\n       The anticipated result of your amendment would be an \n     increase in SBIR awards to businesses in areas which \n     traditionally have had low numbers of awards. With the \n     passage of this amendment, businesses in certain areas that \n     do not have access to research or venture capital for \n     example, could connect with companies with demonstrated \n     expertise in those fields. Successful mentoring in these low \n     participating areas would broaden the geographic and \n     demographic distribution of SBIR awards.\n       As the leading industry association representing the \n     interest and needs of small, emerging, research-intensive, \n     technology-based companies, we support your amendment to help \n     small businesses in rural areas succeed in the SBIR program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeff Noah.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Small Business Legislative Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: On behalf of the Small Business \n     Legislative Council (SBLC), I urge you to support an \n     amendment to the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) \n     reauthorization to be offered by Senator Levin. The purpose \n     of the amendment is to create a ``mentoring'' program to \n     encourage small businesses in states not currently \n     benefitting from the SBIR program to participate.\n       As you know, the SBIR program is a ``win-win'' program. The \n     federal government obtains necessary research and small \n     businesses obtain the opportunity to develop commercially \n     feasible products and processes.\n       SBLC is a permanent, independent coalition of eighty trade \n     and professional associations that share a common commitment \n     to the future of small business. Our members represent the \n     interest of small businesses in such diverse economic sectors \n     as manufacturing, retailing, distribution, professional and \n     technical services, construction, transportation, tourism and \n     agriculture.

Mr. President, today I join my colleague from \nMichigan, Senator Levin, in introducing the Small Business Innovation \nResearch (SBIR) and Small Technology Transfer (STTR) Volunteer \nMentoring Program. This bill seeks to increase, through company-to-\ncompany mentoring, the number of SBIR awards given to small businesses \nlocated in areas, known as ``low participation areas,'' where \nhistorically few awards have been made in proportion to other areas of \nthe country.\n  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a great \nexample of how government and business can work together to advance the \ncause of science and a healthy economy. The results have been dramatic \nfor small, high-technology companies participating in the program. \nSince 1983 when the program was started, some 16,000 small, high-\ntechnology firms have received more than 46,000 SBIR research awards \nthrough 1997, totaling $7.5 billion.\n  Complementing the SBIR program, we have the Small Business Technology \nTransfer (STTR) program, another important R opportunity for small \nbusinesses. It was established to provide a strong incentive for small \nbusinesses and technical experts at research institutions to team up \nand move ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace.\n  Technological advancement is a key element of economic growth. \nAccording to a recent Congressional Research Service Report, Small, \nHigh Tech Companies and Their Role in the Economy: Issues in the \nReauthorization of the Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Program, \n``technical progress is responsible for up to one-half the growth of \nthe U.S. economy and is one of the principle driving forces for \nincreases in our standard of living.''\n  As Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business Committee, and a \nSenator representing a state with one of the most active hi-tech \nindustries in the country, I am always interested in new initiatives, \nor improving existing ones, to develop and nurture technology-based \ncompanies throughout the region and the nation.\n  The SBIR program has been good to my home state of Massachusetts. So \ngood that we are the second largest recipient of SBIR awards in the \ncountry. In 1997, Massachusetts' small, hi-tech firms won 702 awards, \ntotaling $164 million. But it's not by coincidence--it's because we \nhave the right mix of small high-tech companies, an active venture \ncapital community, and a cluster of universities that understand the \nbenefits of technology transfer, attract academic research funds and \ngraduate a highly qualified workforce.\n  Similarly, a variation of that combination is also what cultivates \nand supports innovative hi-tech companies in states such as California, \nVirginia and Ohio that have historically been among the largest \nrecipients of SBIR awards.\n  We on the Senate Small Business Committee have the tough job of \ncrafting a solution that helps small businesses in states that don't \nhave this infrastructure. However, we should not change the program's \nreliance on competition. Merit is the only way to maintain the \nintegrity of the research. Only one in seven or eight Phase I proposals \nis awarded. The highly competitive nature of SBIR awards is one of the \nmain reasons the program has been so popular and successful.\n  One of the experiments working around the country is mentoring--\nexperienced SBIR award winners helping SBIR applicants navigate the \nprocess. For example, Innovative Training Systems (ITS) in Newton, \nMass., mentored Pro-Change Behavior Systems out of West Kingston, RI, \nwhen it applied for its first SBIR award. ITS specializes in health \ncare multi-media programs such as smoking prevention and cessation for \nhigh school students and has gotten several SBIR awards from the \nNational Institutes of Health (NIH). Pro-Change also specializes in \nhealth care multi-media for health behavior change and needed help \ngetting an SBIR award for cancer prevention from NIH. Pro-Change says, \namong many things, the mentoring helped by explaining the rating system \n(it learned to target resources to those aspects of the proposal that \ncounted most) and by saving the company time and reducing confusion on \nthe financial and business requirements behind a proposal. As a \nrepresentative for Pro-Change said, ``SBIR mentoring leads to long-\nlasting business partnerships, spawning exciting new ventures.''\n  Mentoring may not be exclusively responsible for Pro-Change's success \nin getting its first SBIR award, but it played an important role. Just \nlook at the numbers. The process is highly competitive, with only one \nin seven or eight Phase I proposals getting funded. Furthermore, this \ncompany got another award in Rhode Island, a state where only six \nawards were given in 1997. Since that first award in 1998, Pro-Change \nhas gone on to apply for three more Fast-Track Phase II proposals and \none Phase I proposal to NIH. We can and should replicate and facilitate \nthis process.\n  This bill would elevate and reinforce that informal mentoring by \nauthorizing competitive grants, ranging from $50,000 to $200,000, to \nany entity that represents small businesses that participate in SBIR or \nSTTR programs. The entity would be obligated to match experienced, \nsuccessful SBIR or STTR award winners with small businesses located in \nlow SBIR-participation areas--advising and guiding them from \napplication to award to project completion.\n  Though it will be up to the SBA Administrator to define what areas \nreceive a disproportionate amount of awards, this bill is intended to \nhelp states such as such as Maine and Montana, which received only five \nawards in 1997, and rural pockets of states such as Michigan and \nMassachusetts which do well overall in the program but get the \nconcentration of awards in university towns or the largest city.\n  Because founders of hi-tech companies are often more scientific \ninventors than business experts, the mentor companies could help with \nmanagement assistance, proposal writing, commercialization or venture \ncapital networking. The mentor companies would be volunteers, but would \nbe eligible for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, authorized \ntravel and reasonable bills for telephone calls and faxes. And like the \nvolunteers in SBA's successful volunteer business counselor program, \nthe Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), SBIR mentor volunteers \nwould get automatic liability coverage.\n  I know the Committee on Small Business will have a roundtable on \nAugust 4th to discuss with program managers, SBIR companies and SBIR \nadvocates how to increase the low number of awards given in certain \nstates, and I look forward to hearing comments on this bill and on any \nalternative programs.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to thank Senator Levin for his work \non this bill and ask that a letter of support from the Small Business \nTechnology Coalition be included for the Record.\n\n[[Page S9230]]\n\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                    Small Business\n\n\n                                         Technology Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1999.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: The Small Business Technology Coalition \n     (SBTC) urges you to cosponsor Senator Levin's amendment to \n     the reauthorization of the Small Business Innovation Research \n     (SBIR) Program. The amendment would provide much needed \n     support to small businesses applying for grants under the \n     SBIR program.\n       Senator Levin's amendment would establish a competitively \n     bid volunteer mentoring grant program for the SBIR. The Small \n     Business Administration would be responsible for \n     administering the program. Organizations representing SBIR \n     awardees could apply for grants ranging from $50,000 to \n     $500,000 to participate in the program. Qualifying \n     organizations would match small businesses new to the SBIR \n     process with CEOs and other of small, high-technology \n     companies that have been successful SBIR award winners. These \n     ``volunteer mentors'' would be reimbursed only for their out-\n     of-pocket expenses incurred while mentoring, not for their \n     time. The program would be authorized at $1 million per year \n     to cover administration of the program and reimbursement of \n     volunteer mentors for their out-of-pocket expenses.\n       As the nation-wide trade association of small high tech \n     business CEOs, SBTC can attest to the value of a mentoring \n     program to help small businesses new to the SBIR process. \n     SBTC members have hands-on experience and know the importance \n     of expert technical assistance in locating venture capital, \n     seeking Phase III partners and commercialization. SBTC speaks \n     for the small high tech business community and knows through \n     experience that mentoring is a key to success in the SBIR \n     process.\n       The anticipated result of Senator Levin's amendment would \n     be an increase in SBIR awards to businesses in states which \n     traditionally have had low numbers of awards. With the \n     passage of this amendment, businesses in certain states that \n     do not have access to research or venture capital for \n     example, could connect with companies with demonstrated \n     expertise in those areas. Successful mentoring in these \n     states would broaden the geographic and demographic \n     distribution of SBIR awards.\n       As the leading industry association representing the \n     interest and needs of small, emerging, research-intensive, \n     technology-based companies, we urge you to cosponsor Senator \n     Levin's amendment and help businesses in rural areas compete \n     in the SBIR program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Jeff Noah,\n                                       Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 1436. A bill to amend the Agricultural Marketing Transition Act to \nprovide support for United State agricultural producers that is equal \nto the support provided agricultural producers by the European Union, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n           amending the agricultural marketing transition act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce new, permanent farm \nlegislation. I think virtually everyone from farm country understands \nthat our farmers have been hit by a triple whammy--the triple whammy of \nbad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. The results are catastrophic.\n  In my home State of North Dakota, one of the most agricultural States \nin the Nation, our farmers are being pressured as never before. They \nare in a cost price squeeze that is almost unprecedented. The results \nwill be the loss of thousands of farm families unless there is a \nFederal response.\n  I think most of us know we need to have a disaster response because \nprices have collapsed, and adverse weather conditions continue across \nthe country. So it is critically important that we take short-term \nsteps to address what is happening in farm country.\n  A disaster bill is not enough. We need more than that. We also need \nto respond with a long-term change in farm policy.\n  If I could direct the attention of my colleagues and others who might \nbe watching to this chart, when I talk about the triple whammy of bad \nprices, bad weather, and bad policy, this shows what has happened to \nprices over the last 53 years. The blue line shows what has happened to \nwheat prices; the red line to barley. As a viewer can see, we are now \nat the lowest level for these commodities in constant dollars in 53 \nyears.\n  We are witnessing a price collapse that is almost unprecedented. That \nis putting enormous pressure on our producers.\n  In addition to that, in my State we have been hit by almost a 5-year \npattern now of bad weather--weather that is overly wet in my State; \nother parts of the country it is overly dry. In North Dakota, we have 3 \nmillion acres that have not even been planted this year. On top of bad \nprices and bad weather, we are also hit by bad policy because the last \nfarm bill put us at a very severe disadvantage with our major \ncompetitors, the Europeans.\n  The EU trumps the U.S. in farm support. This chart shows just with \nrespect to wheat and corn for 1999--the red bar is what the Europeans \nprovide their producers on wheat; the blue bar what we are doing in the \nUnited States. You can see, they are trumping us by 38 percent. In \nother words, their support is 38 percent higher in wheat, 46 percent \nhigher in corn.\n  It does not end there because the Europeans are also badly \noutspending us with respect to export subsidy. This shows for 1998--the \nlast year for which we have full figures--this is the European Union in \nred: $5 billion a year of support for subsidies. This is the United \nStates: $104 million.\n  For that 1 year alone, the Europeans are outspending us, are \noutgunning us, 50 to 1. It is no wonder that our farmers are at a \ndisadvantage. We, in effect, are saying to our farmers: You go out \nthere and compete against the French farmer, the German farmer; and \nwhile you're at it, you take on the French Government and the German \nGovernment, as well.\n  That is not a fair fight.\n  If we look worldwide at agricultural export subsidies, what we see is \nthat the European Union accounts for 84 percent of agriculture \nsubsidies worldwide. The United States has 1.4 percent. We are \noutgunned 60 to 1 by that measure.\n  Whether it is 50 to 1 or 60 to 1, the hard reality is, the U.S. \nproducers are not in a fair fight. Something must be done to respond.\n  If we look back at the policy change that was made in the farm bill--\nour last farm bill--what we see is there was a dramatic cut in the \nlevel of support for our producers.\n  Under the previous farm bill, the 1990 farm bill, we were getting on \naverage $10 billion a year of support for our farmers. That was cut in \nhalf to $5 billion--that at the very time our major competitors are \nspending $50 billion a year to support their producers. So $50 billion \nfor Europe; $5 billion for the United States.\n  It is not a fair fight. The result is, our farmers are losing the \nbattle. I call this ``unilateral disarmament.'' We would never do that \nin a military confrontation. Why have we done it in a trade \nconfrontation? The results are the same: They win; we lose. The chief \nnegotiator for the Europeans told me several years ago: Senator, we \nbelieve we are in a trade war in agriculture with the United States. He \nsaid: Senator, we believe at some point there will be a cease-fire. We \nbelieve there will be a cease-fire in place, and we want to occupy the \nhigh ground. And the high ground is market share.\n\n  How well that strategy and plan are working, because the Europeans, \nin just the last few years, have moved from being major importers to \nbeing major exporters. They have gone from being the biggest importing \nregion in the world to being the biggest exporting region in the world, \nand they have done it the old-fashioned way--they have gone out and \nbought these markets.\n  In the last 10 years alone, they have spent $500 billion, and now \nthey are starting to get a return on that investment, because in the \nlast trade negotiation, what happened? Europeans have a higher level of \nsupport than we do. They are at a higher level. We are at a lower \nlevel. Was there a closing of the gap? Not at all. Instead, the \nconclusion was equal percentage reductions on both sides--36 percent in \nexport subsidies, 24 percent in domestic support. The result is that \nour farmers were again left in a second position.\n  If it happens again in the trade talks that are to begin this fall, \nour farmers will be put in a position of perhaps falling off the cliff, \nbeing put in a position that they cannot possibly survive.\n  Some say let's let the market work. I am all for letting the market \nwork. But that is not what is happening in world agriculture. What is \nhappening in world agriculture is, the Europeans are spending enormous \nsums of money\n\n[[Page S9231]]\n\nto win a dominant position. They believe that is a position they can \npreserve because they think the United States is unwilling to fight \nback.\n  We have to prove them wrong. We have to demonstrate that the United \nStates is not going to roll over, is not going to surrender, is not \ngoing to give up, that we intend to fight for these markets to achieve \na level playing field so our farmers have a chance to compete. Our \nfarmers can compete against anyone anywhere, but they can't compete \nagainst the governments of the European Union. That is not a fair \nfight.\n  We can see the pattern because while we have cut support for our \nproducers and the Europeans have had a 50- to 60-to-1 edge on us with \nrespect to export subsidy, the value of our farm exports has dropped \nlike a rock. We have gone from $60 billion a year as recently as 1996 \nto, this last year, $49 billion. At the same time, if we look at the \nEuropean pattern, we see they have gone from being a major importer to \na major exporter. They have a strategy; they have a plan. It is \nworking. If we don't fight back, we are going to wake up after this \nnext round of negotiations and we are going to find that the United \nStates is falling off the cliff. We are going to find literally \nthousands of our farm families consigned to failure. That is the \nmessage I have received in farm meeting after farm meeting all across \nmy State.\n  I asked our Trade Representative: What is our leverage in the next \nround of trade talks? The truth is, we have no leverage because the \nEuropeans are occupying the high ground. They are waiting for the \ncease-fire, the cease-fire in place. They are waiting to win this \nvictory. They are confident the United States will not fight back. We \nhave to prove them wrong. We have to demonstrate that the United States \nis not willing to cede these markets.\n\n  This chart shows what has happened to just one commodity, wheat. This \nblue line is European exports; the red line is American exports. You \ncan see the trend line for the United States is down, down, down--lots \nof zigzags along the way, but the trend line is straight down; the \nEuropean trend line, straight up. They have had a little setback \nrecently, but you can see they have gone from being in a totally \ninferior position, a more than two-to-one gap between us to our \nadvantage, to their now being in the dominant position, and they have \naccomplished this in less than 20 years.\n  That is what my FITE legislation is all about. It says: Let's fight \nback. Let's send a message the United States is not going to wave the \nwhite flag of surrender. The United States intends to fight for these \nmarkets. The United States intends to give our farmers a fair chance to \ncompete. That is what this legislation does.\n  These charts show it. FITE levels the playing field for wheat. Under \nour proposal, as I described before, Europe is at $5.20 in wheat, we \nare at $3.22. We would level the playing field. If they are going to \nprovide $5.20, we will provide $5.20. We do the same thing on corn. We \neven the score on corn. They are at $4.85 today. We are at $2.25 a \nbushel on corn. If they want to stay at $4.85, we will match them; we \nwill meet them in the competition. We will take them on head to head, \ndollar for dollar, so we don't surrender these markets and find \nourselves in an inferior position.\n  Not only do we even the score with respect to support to producers, \nwe even the score with respect to export subsidy, because in the FITE \nbill we provide $4 billion a year of support for export subsidy, \nbecause we believe that will send a message to the Europeans that the \nUnited States intends to fight. This would put us in a strong position \nfor the talks this fall because right now we have no leverage.\n  The question is, How do we respond?\n  I have a series of letters from groups endorsing the FITE \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent to have them printed in the Record \nat this point.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       North Dakota Association of\n\n\n                                  Rural Electric Cooperatives,\n\n                                        Mandan, ND, July 26, 1999.\n     Senator Kent Conrad,\n     Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Senator Conrad: As president of the North Dakota \n     Association of Rural Electric Cooperatives, I want to commend \n     you for bringing forth your ``FITE'' proposal in response to \n     the current farm crisis.\n       In our program, we know this ag crisis is real. We deal, \n     every month, with the stranded assets of people leaving the \n     land--giving up the dream of making their living and raising \n     their families on the land.\n       Your Farm Income and Trade Equity Act is a thoughtful, fair \n     and solid response to the crisis. You've correctly identified \n     in this proposal that unfair trade subsidies and rock-bottom \n     commodity prices are at the root of this crisis. Your FITE \n     proposal provides a solution to this problem.\n       You can count on North Dakota's RECs to help get this \n     legislation through the Congress and on the President's desk \n     for his signature. We need action, and this FITE proposal \n     makes a great deal of sense to us. We'll help however we can.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Adolph Feyereisen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      North Dakota\n\n\n                                National Farmers Organization,\n\n                                        Marion, ND, July 21, 1999.\n     Senator Kent Conrad,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: The North Dakota National Farmers \n     Organization is happy to endorse your introduction of FITE \n     (Farm Income and Trade Equity Act of 1999).\n       I must also add that on behalf of NDNFO members, we \n     appreciate your efforts to help correct the severe income \n     problems we are experiencing in rural America and \n     particularly in North Dakota.\n           Good luck and thanks,\n                                                    Ralph Danuser,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Durum Growers Assn.,\n\n                                                    July 23, 1999.\n     Senator Kent Conrad,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Senator Conrad: The US Durum Growers Association would like \n     to congratulate and thank you for introducing the Farm Income \n     and Trade Equity Fairness Investment Transition Act farm \n     package. Your work in developing a comprehensive farm program \n     that would finally put US producers on equal footing with \n     European farmers is to be complimented.\n       As you know, commodity prices are extremely low. That is \n     particularly true of durum, which is substantially lower than \n     the average prices of recent years. The low farm prices have \n     pushed the northern plains economy, which is very dependent \n     on durum production, into a near depression-like state. The \n     support levels that you are proposing in the FITE legislation \n     would enhance durum farmers' profitability and in turn, \n     contribute to the revitalization of the rural economy.\n       The USDGA has a long standing policy in support of \n     increasing marketing loans and we are pleased that your farm \n     program proposal offers that as a base of support. The \n     additional payment over the loan rate to equalize the \n     subsidies received by US and European producers helps ensure \n     a competitive environment in the world trade of durum.\n       The FITE is the only proposal to date that puts US \n     producers at a competitive position with the farmers in the \n     European Union. The support offered by this bill will provide \n     the US with negotiating power needed in this fall's WTO \n     talks.\n       Thank you for your work in formulating and introducing the \n     bill, the US Durum Growers Association pledges to work with \n     you to gain acceptance for this bill in Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Mark Birdsall,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Milk Producers Association\n\n\n                                        of North Dakota, Inc.,\n\n                                       Manning, ND, July 22, 1999.\n     Senator Kent Conrad.\n       Dear Senator Conrad: We the Milk Producers Association of \n     N.D. support your effort to make positive changes in Congress \n     to help our Nations family farmers.

Kirby Josephson, chairman of the \n     NDBA Ag Committee from Litchville, ND, stated that ``ag \n     lenders in North Dakota will support your efforts to improve \n     farm income.

Senator Conrad is \n     taking a bold approach to restoring farm income.''\n       Respondents indicated that they believe the Export \n     Enhancement Program has been under utilized. However, some \n     concerns were expressed with the 10 percent conservation set \n     aside and the fact that this legislation may encourage \n     overproduction and discourage crop diversification.\n       Please keep NDBA advised of your efforts and the status of \n     this legislation and please feel free to call if you need any \n     further clarification on the position taken by the North \n     Dakota Bankers Association.\n           Cordially,\n                                               James D.

We have support from the North Dakota Farmers Union, the \nNorth Dakota Association of Rural Electric Co-ops, the North Dakota \nNFO, the U.S. Duram Growers Association, the Milk Producers Association \nof North Dakota, the American Renewable Oil Association, the North \nDakota Bankers Association, the Central Power Electric Cooperative \nBoard of Directors, the Square Butte Electric Cooperative, the North \nDakota Rural Development Council, and even a resolution of support from \nthe Midwestern Legislative Conference of the Council of State \nGovernments that, while not endorsing the specifics of this \nlegislation, specifically endorsed the concept in which they say:\n\n       The Midwestern Legislative Conference favors legislation \n     that would include support to American producers which would \n     put prices received for crops on an even par with those of \n     our European Union competitors.\n\n  Mr. President, the Midwest Council of State Governments has it right. \nWe simply cannot permit our farmers to be left at a competitive \ndisadvantage. We must fight back. That is what the FITE legislation \nwill do.\n  We have had an unprecedented outpouring of support in North Dakota. \nIn addition to those who have sent written comments, the North Dakota \nWheat Commission has gone on record supporting this legislation. We \nhave many more who are considering resolutions of support. I am hopeful \nthat this will start a ground swell that will spread across the country \nand send a message that the United States does not intend to give up \nour agricultural dominance. That would be a mistake. It would be one we \nwould live to regret. We are very close now to these negotiations this \nfall. If we don't alter dramatically the negotiating environment, we \nare going to lose. Make no mistake about it. We are going to lose.\n  It doesn't have to be that way. It should not be that way. But it is \nin our hands. We have a choice to make. Do we fight back, or do we give \nup?\n  At a time of unprecedented economic prosperity in this country, it \nwould be a travesty for us to have lost the world\n\n[[Page S9233]]\n\nagricultural trade battle because we were unwilling at this critical \nmoment to respond. I hope we don't let this opportunity pass us by.\n  Some people watching me say: Well, why should we help farmers?\n  I believe farm families are the backbone of strength for this \ncountry. They are absolutely fundamental to America's success. They \nhave long been the dominant source of our trade surpluses. Overall, we \nrun massive trade deficits. But in agriculture, we have run trade \nsurpluses. It has been one of two sectors of this economy that has run \ntrade surpluses, and we are right at the brink of losing that. That \nwould be a tragedy for this country--not just because of the dollars or \njust because of the economics, but because of what it would mean to the \nfundamental strength of this country.\n  In Europe, they made a decision. They decided they wanted to have \npeople out across the land. They didn't want everybody forced into the \ncities, so they made it possible for people to prosper in the rural \nparts of Europe. Perhaps their being hungry twice before informed those \ndecisions. But whatever the reason, you can travel through the French \ncountryside and the German countryside and it is prosperous; they are \ndoing well. But go through the countryside of my State and what you see \nis an area that is in economic decline. It is not just in North Dakota; \nit is all across the heartland of America.\n  The question is, Are we going to let it go? You know, it would be one \nthing if it were a fair competition. It would be one thing if it were \nsimply the fact that our farmers weren't as competitive or as efficient \nas our competitors. But that is not the case. It is not the case. The \nfact is, our farmers are as competitive and as efficient as any in the \nworld. What is hurting them is that other nations are willing to fight \nfor their producers, and we have been in retreat.\n  We have to decide what kind of country we want to have. Do we want \neverybody to move to town? Or do we want people out across the land? \nEurope has made a decision that they want people out across the \ncountryside, and they have made it possible economically to be there. \nNow the choice comes to us. The hour is late because these negotiations \nwill start this fall, and if we don't do something to change the rules \nof the game, our side is going to lose. It doesn't have to be that way. \nIt should not be that way. But we have choices to make in this Chamber, \nand across in the other Chamber, about what is going to be the policy \nof America, what is going to be our position.\n  I hope very much that we will decide we are going to give our farmers \na fighting chance. I hope very much that we are going to make a \ndecision that the best policy is to have people out across the land, \nnot to have everybody come to the cities. I hope very much we are going \nto conclude that it is in our national interest, just as the Europeans \nhave concluded that it is in their interest, to give farmers a fighting \nchance. There is no way they are going to win this battle when the odds \nare stacked against them: 10-to-1, 50-to-1, that is the unevenness of \nthe fight our farmers are in now. It is in our hands; it is our \ndecision.\n  I hope very much that we can start across this country a move to say: \nLet's fight back. Let's put our farmers on a level playing field. Let's \nrearm our negotiators. Let's prepare for this battle. Let's not lose. \nLet's win a victory that would make a difference for hundreds of \nthousands of farm families across America and the cities and towns that \nare dependent upon them and, at the end of the day, for a country that \nneeds them.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN:\n  S. 1437. A bill to protect researchers from compelled disclosure of \nresearch in Federal courts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n          thomas jefferson researcher's privilege act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to introduce the Thomas Jefferson Researcher's Privilege Act. \nThis bill protects the rights of researchers in their work. This is an \nissue that Professor Robert O'Neil of the University of Virginia Law \nSchool has done much to advance, and I am extremely grateful for all \nhis assistance.\n  Two points, followed by a coda, if I may. The first point is that the \nThomas Jefferson Act gets to the heart of the first amendment and the \nprinciples that our nation was founded on. This Act would protect \nresearchers from the compelled disclosure of their research, studies, \ndata, surveys, etc. Too often researchers are forced to turn over this \ninformation in open courts. This interrupts their research and makes it \nnearly impossible for them to finish and publish their research. If \nresearchers are unable to publish their findings, then the flow and \ndissemination of information are choked off. This runs counter to the \nessence of the first amendment.\n  We need a uniform standard that protects the work of researchers. \nSome courts have ruled in favor of researchers while others have ruled \nagainst them. We need consistency in this field, where researchers feel \ncomfortable to produce their research and do not have to fear that it \nwill be taken from them. This bill will provide that consistency and \ncomfort.\n  To the second point. We have reached a time in our society where we \nhave to decide between what should be shared and what should be \nprotected. In this case, it is very important to society as a whole to \nprotect a researcher's notes and data before they are ready to be \nreleased. It is from these data and research that ideas and thoughts \nare formed, ideas that will eventually help man and society progress. \nIf a researcher's data are released prematurely, then their ideas may \nnever bear fruit. In the long run, protecting a researcher's data will \nonly lead to more information and ideas in the future. This is what the \nfirst amendment is all about.\n  No one describes the utility of free speech and the dissemination of \noriginal ideas better than John Stuart Mill. In On Liberty, he argues \nthat neither government nor a public acting informally may legitimately \nuse coercion to stifle free expression, and the reason he gives is a \nutilitarian, or at least a consequentialist one. If the opinion is \nright, the human race is deprived of it; if wrong, they are deprived of \nthe opportunity to reinforce--through surviving a challenge--their \nunderstanding of what is right. The quashing of opinion is therefore, a \nmuch more far-reaching evil than the mere loss of something valuable to \nthe individual, for it deprived society at large of something of \nbenefit. This is exactly what happens when researchers are forced to \nturn over their work prematurely and prevented from developing and \nsharing their thoughts. The Thomas Jefferson Bill would help rectify \njust this situation.\n  I conclude by saying that I could think of no better namesake for \nthis bill than Thomas Jefferson, our third president and author of the \nDeclaration of Independence. A philosophical statesman rather than a \npolitical philosopher, he contributed to democracy and liberalism a \nfaith rather than a body of doctrine. By his works alone he must be \nadjudged one the greatest of all Americans, while the influence of this \nenergizing faith cannot be measured.\n  One of Jefferson's greatest contributions to our nation was his \nprotection and advocacy of free speech. From the Declaration of \nIndependence to the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom to the \nfounding of the University of Virginia, he was a passionate proponent \nof education, human liberty, and free thought. He wrote: ``If nature \nhas made any one thing exclusive property, it is the idea, which an \nindividual may exclusively possess . . .; but the moment it is \ndivulged, it forces itself into the possession of everyone . . .'' \nJefferson, always a step or several steps ahead of his age, understood \nthe importance of the freedom of speech in the development of an \nindividual and a nation.\n  It is only appropriate that the Thomas Jefferson Researcher's \nPrivilege Act be introduced in the month of July, when our nation \ndeclared its independence, and be named after Thomas Jefferson, one of \nour greatest political thinkers and one of our greatest advocates of \nthe free mind.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Thomas Jefferson Researcher's \nPrivilege Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9234]]\n\n                                S. 1437\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) at the outset of the 20th century, the States adopted a \n     separate justice system for juvenile offenders;\n\n[[Page S9239]]\n\n       (2) violent crimes committed by juveniles, such as \n     homicide, rape, and robbery, were an unknown phenomenon then, \n     but the rate at which juveniles commit such crimes has \n     escalated astronomically since that time;\n       (3) in 1994--\n       (A) the number of persons arrested overall for murder in \n     the United States decreased by 5.8 percent, but the number of \n     persons who are less than 15 years of age arrested for murder \n     increased by 4 percent; and\n       (B) the number of persons arrested for all violent crimes \n     increased by 1.3 percent, but the number of persons who are \n     less than 15 years of age arrested for violent crimes \n     increased by 9.2 percent, and the number of persons less than \n     18 years of age arrested for such crimes increased by 6.5 \n     percent;\n       (4) from 1985 to 1996, the number of persons arrested for \n     all violent crimes increased by 52.3 percent, but the number \n     of persons under age 18 arrested for violent crimes rose by \n     75 percent;\n       (5) the number of juvenile offenders is expected to undergo \n     a massive increase during the first 2 decades of the twenty-\n     first century, culminating in an unprecedented number of \n     violent offenders who are less than 18 years of age;\n       (6) the rehabilitative model of sentencing for juveniles, \n     which Congress rejected for adult offenders when Congress \n     enacted the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, is inadequate and \n     inappropriate for dealing with many violent and repeat \n     juvenile offenders;\n       (7) the Federal Government should encourage the States to \n     experiment with progressive solutions to the escalating \n     problem of juveniles who commit violent crimes and who are \n     repeat offenders, including prosecuting such offenders as \n     adults, but should not impose specific strategies or programs \n     on the States;\n       (8) an effective strategy for reducing violent juvenile \n     crime requires greater collection of investigative data and \n     other information, such as fingerprints and DNA evidence, as \n     well as greater sharing of such information--\n       (A) among Federal, State, and local agencies, including the \n     courts; and\n       (B) among the law enforcement, educational, and social \n     service systems;\n       (9) data regarding violent juvenile offenders should be \n     made available to the adult criminal justice system if \n     recidivism by criminals is to be addressed adequately;\n       (10) holding juvenile proceedings in secret denies victims \n     of crime the opportunity to attend and be heard at such \n     proceedings, helps juvenile offenders to avoid accountability \n     for their actions, and shields juvenile proceedings from \n     public scrutiny and accountability;\n       (11) the injuries and losses suffered by the victims of \n     violent crime are no less painful or devastating because the \n     offender is a juvenile; and\n       (12) the prevention, investigation, prosecution, \n     adjudication, and punishment of criminal offenses committed \n     by juveniles, and the rehabilitation and correction of \n     juvenile offenders are, and should remain, primarily the \n     responsibility of the States, to be carried out without \n     interference from the Federal Government.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to reform Federal juvenile justice programs and \n     policies in order to promote the emergence of juvenile \n     justice systems in which the paramount concerns are providing \n     for the safety of the public and holding juvenile wrongdoers \n     accountable for their actions, while providing the wrongdoer \n     a genuine opportunity for self-reform;\n       (2) to revise the procedures in Federal court that are \n     applicable to the prosecution of juvenile offenders; and\n       (3) to encourage and promote, consistent with the ideals of \n     federalism, adoption of policies by the States to ensure that \n     the victims of violent crimes committed by juveniles receive \n     the same level of justice as do victims of violent crimes \n     that are committed by adults.\n\n     SEC. 3. SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this \n     Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any \n     person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and \n     the application of the provisions of such to any person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected thereby.\n                    TITLE I--JUVENILE JUSTICE REFORM\n\n     SEC. 101. SURRENDER TO STATE AUTHORITIES.\n\n       Section 5001 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking the first undesignated paragraph and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``Whenever any person who is less than 18 years of age is \n     been arrested and charged with the commission of an offense \n     (or an act of delinquency that would be an offense were it \n     committed by an adult) punishable in any court of the United \n     States or of the District of Columbia, the United States \n     Attorney for the district in which such person has been \n     arrested may forego prosecution pursuant to section \n     5032(a)(2) if, after investigation by the United States \n     Attorney, it appears that--\n       ``(1) such person has committed an act that is also an \n     offense or an act of delinquency under the law of any State \n     or the District of Columbia;\n       ``(2) such State or the District of Columbia, as \n     applicable, can and will assume jurisdiction over such \n     juvenile and will take such juvenile into custody and deal \n     with the juvenile in accordance with the law of such State or \n     the District of Columbia, as applicable; and\n       ``(3) it is in the best interests of the United States and \n     of the juvenile offender.''.\n\n     SEC. 102.

GRANTS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF VIOLENCE RELATED \n                   STRESS TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that a child's brain is \n     wired between the ages of 0-3. A child's ability to learn, \n     develop healthy family and social relationships, resist peer \n     pressure, and control violent impulses depends on the quality \n     and quantity of brain stimulation he receives. Research shows \n     that children exposed to negative brain stimulation in the \n     form of physical and sexual abuse and violence in the family \n     or community causes the brain to be miswired making it \n     difficult for the child to be successful in life. \n     Intervention early in a child's life to correct the miswiring \n     is much more successful than adult rehabilitation efforts.\n       (b) In General.--The Secretary shall award grants, enter \n     into contracts or cooperative agreements to public and \n     nonprofit private entities, as well as to Indian tribes, \n     Native Hawaiians, and Alaska Native nonprofit corporations to \n     establish national and regional centers of excellence on \n     psychological trauma response and to identify the best \n     practices for treating psychiatric and behavioral disorders \n     resulting from children witnessing or experiencing such \n     stress.\n       (c) Priorities.--In awarding grants, contracts or \n     cooperative agreements under subsection (a) related to the \n     identifying best practices for treating disorders associated \n     with psychological trauma, the Secretary shall give priority \n     to programs that work with children, adolescents, adults, and \n     families who are survivors and witnesses of child abuse, \n     domestic, school, and community violence, and disasters.\n       (d) Geographical Distribution.--The Secretary shall ensure \n     that grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements under \n     subsection (a) with respect to centers of excellence are \n     distributed equitably among the regions of the country and \n     among urban and rural areas.\n       (e) Evaluation.--The Secretary shall require that each \n     applicant for a grant, contract or cooperative agreement \n     under subsection (a) submit a plan as part of his application \n     for the rigorous evaluation of the activities funded under \n     the grant, contract or agreement, including both process and \n     outcomes evaluation, and the submission of an evaluation at \n     the end of the project period.\n       (f) Duration of Awards.--With respect to a grant, contract \n     or cooperative agreement under this section, the period \n     during which payments under such an award will be made to the \n     recipient may not be less than 3 years. Such grants, contract \n     or agreement may be renewed.\n       (g) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the General Accounting Office \n     shall prepare and submit to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives a \n     report concerning whether individuals are covered for post-\n     traumatic stress disorders under public and private health \n     plans, and the course of treatment, if any, that is covered.\n       (h) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this section for fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal \n     years.\n     TITLE IV--VOLUNTARY MEDIA AGREEMENTS FOR CHILDREN'S PROTECTION\n                   Subtitle A--Children and the Media\n\n     SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Children's Protection \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 402. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Television is seen and heard in nearly every United \n     States home and is a uniquely pervasive presence in the daily \n     lives of Americans. The average American home has 2.5 \n     televisions, and a television is turned on in the average \n     American home 7 hours every day.\n       (2) Television plays a particularly significant role in the \n     lives of children. Figures provided by Nielsen Research show \n     that children between the ages of 2 years and 11 years spend \n     an average of 21 hours in front of a television each week.\n       (3) Television has an enormous capability to influence \n     perceptions, especially those of children, of the values and \n     behaviors that are common and acceptable in society.\n       (4) The influence of television is so great that its images \n     and messages often can be harmful to the development of \n     children. Social science research amply documents a strong \n     correlation between the exposure of children to televised \n     violence and a number of behavioral and psychological \n     problems.\n       (5) Hundreds of studies have proven conclusively that \n     children who are consistently exposed to violence on \n     television have a higher tendency to exhibit violent and \n     aggressive behavior, both as children and later in life.\n       (6) Such studies also show that repeated exposure to \n     violent programming causes children to become desensitized to \n     and more accepting of real-life violence and to grow more \n     fearful and less trusting of their surroundings.\n       (7) A growing body of social science research indicates \n     that sexual content on television can also have a significant \n     influence on the attitudes and behaviors of young viewers. \n     This research suggests that heavy exposure to programming \n     with strong sexual content contributes to the early \n     commencement of sexual activity among teenagers.\n       (8) Members of the National Association of Broadcasters \n     (NAB) adhered for many years to a comprehensive code of \n     conduct that was based on an understanding of the influence \n     exerted by television and on a widely held sense of \n     responsibility for using that influence carefully.\n       (9) This code of conduct, the Television Code of the \n     National Association of Broadcasters, articulated this sense \n     of responsibility as follows:\n       (A) ``In selecting program subjects and themes, great care \n     must be exercised to be sure that the treatment and \n     presentation are made in good faith and not for the purpose \n     of sensationalism or to shock or exploit the audience or \n     appeal to prurient interests or morbid curiosity.''.\n       (B) ``Broadcasters have a special responsibility toward \n     children. Programs designed primarily for children should \n     take into account the range of interests and needs of \n     children, from instructional and cultural material to a wide \n     variety of entertainment material. In their totality, \n     programs should contribute to the sound, balanced development \n     of children to help them achieve a sense of the world at \n     large and informed adjustments to their society.''.\n       (C) ``Violence, physical, or psychological, may only be \n     projected in responsibly handled contexts, not used \n     exploitatively. Programs involving violence present the \n     consequences of it to its victims and perpetrators. \n     Presentation of the details of violence should avoid the \n     excessive, the gratuitous and the instructional.''.\n       (D) ``The presentation of marriage, family, and similarly \n     important human relationships, and material with sexual \n     connotations, shall not be treated exploitatively or \n     irresponsibly, but with sensitivity.''.\n       (E) ``Above and beyond the requirements of the law, \n     broadcasters must consider the family atmosphere in which \n     many of their programs are viewed. There shall be no graphic \n     portrayal of sexual acts by sight or sound. The portrayal of \n     implied sexual acts must be essential to the plot and \n     presented in a responsible and tasteful manner.''.\n       (10) The National Association of Broadcasters abandoned the \n     code of conduct in 1983 after three provisions of the code \n     restricting the sale of advertising were challenged by the \n     Department of Justice on antitrust grounds and a Federal \n     district court issued a summary judgment against the National \n     Association of Broadcasters regarding one of the provisions \n     on those grounds. However, none of the programming standards \n     of the code were challenged.\n       (11) While the code of conduct was in effect, its \n     programming standards were never found to have violated any \n     antitrust law.\n       (12) Since the National Association of Broadcasters \n     abandoned the code of conduct, programming standards on \n     broadcast and cable television have deteriorated \n     dramatically.\n       (13) In the absence of effective programming standards, \n     public concern about the impact of television on children, \n     and on society as a whole, has risen substantially. Polls \n     routinely show that more than 80 percent of Americans are \n     worried by the increasingly graphic nature of sex, violence, \n     and vulgarity on television and by the amount of programming \n     that openly sanctions or glorifies criminal, antisocial, and \n     degrading behavior.\n       (14) At the urging of Congress, the television industry has \n     taken some steps to respond to public concerns about \n     programming standards and content. The broadcast television \n     industry agreed in 1992 to adopt a set of voluntary \n     guidelines designed to ``proscribe gratuitous or excessive \n     portrayals of violence''. Shortly thereafter, both the \n     broadcast and cable television industries agreed to conduct \n     independent studies of the violent content in their \n     programming and make those reports public.\n       (15) In 1996, the television industry as a whole made a \n     commitment to develop a comprehensive rating system to label \n     programming that may be harmful or inappropriate for \n     children. That system was implemented at the beginning of \n     1999.\n       (16) Despite these efforts to respond to public concern \n     about the impact of television on children, millions of \n     Americans, especially parents with young children, remain \n     angry and frustrated at the sinking standards of television \n     programming, the reluctance of the industry to police itself, \n     and the harmful influence of television on the well-being of \n     the children and the values of the United States.\n       (17) The Department of Justice issued a ruling in 1993 \n     indicating that additional efforts by the television industry \n     to develop and implement voluntary programming guidelines \n     would not violate the antitrust laws. The ruling states that \n     ``such activities may be likened to traditional standard \n     setting efforts that do not necessarily restrain competition \n     and may have significant procompetitive benefits . . . . Such \n     guidelines could serve to disseminate valuable information on \n     program content to both advertisers and television viewers. \n     Accurate information can enhance the demand for, and increase \n     the output of, an industry's products or services.''.\n       (18) The Children's Television Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-\n     437) states that television broadcasters in the United States \n     have a clear obligation to meet the educational and \n     informational needs of children.\n       (19) Several independent analyses have demonstrated that \n     the television broadcasters in the\n\n[[Page S9270]]\n\n     United States have not fulfilled their obligations under the \n     Children's Television Act of 1990 and have not noticeably \n     expanded the amount of educational and informational \n     programming directed at young viewers since the enactment of \n     that Act.\n       (20) The popularity of video and personal computer (PC) \n     games is growing steadily among children. Although most \n     popular video and personal computer games are educational or \n     harmless in nature, many of the most popular are extremely \n     violent. One recent study by Strategic Record Research found \n     that 64 percent of teenagers played video or personal \n     computer games on a regular basis. Other surveys of children \n     as young as elementary school age found that almost half of \n     them list violent computer games among their favorites.\n       (21) Violent video games often present violence in a \n     glamorized light. Game players are often cast in the role of \n     shooter, with points scored for each ``kill''. Similarly, \n     advertising for such games often touts violent content as a \n     selling point--the more graphic and extreme, the better.\n       (22) As the popularity and graphic nature of such video \n     games grows, so do their potential to negatively influence \n     impressionable children.\n       (23) Music is another extremely pervasive and popular form \n     of entertainment. American children and teenagers listen to \n     music more than any other demographic group. The Journal of \n     American Medicine reported that between the 7th and 12th \n     grades the average teenager listens to 10,500 hours of rock \n     or rap music, just slightly less than the entire number of \n     hours spent in the classroom from kindergarten through high \n     school.\n       (24) Teens are among the heaviest purchasers of music, and \n     are most likely to favor music genres that depict, and often \n     appear to glamorize violence.\n       (25) Music has a powerful ability to influence perceptions, \n     attitudes, and emotional state. The use of music as therapy \n     indicates its potential to increase emotional, psychological. \n     and physical health. That influence can be used for ill as \n     well.\n\n     SEC. 403.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be referred to as the ``Criminal Use of \n     Firearms by Felons (CUFF) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Tragedies such as those occurring recently in the \n     communities of Pearl, Mississippi, Paducah, Kentucky, \n     Jonesboro, Arkansas, Springfield, Oregon, and Littleton, \n     Colorado are terrible reminders of the vulnerability of \n     innocent individuals to random and senseless acts of criminal \n     violence.\n       (2) The United States Congress has responded to the problem \n     of gun violence by passing numerous criminal statutes and by \n     supporting the development of law enforcement programs \n     designed both to punish the criminal misuse of weapons and \n     also to deter individuals from undertaking illegal acts.\n       (3) In 1988, the Administration initiated an innovative \n     program known as Project Achilles. The concept behind the \n     initiative was that the illegal possession of firearms was \n     the Achilles heel or the area of greatest vulnerability of \n     criminals. By aggressively prosecuting criminals with guns in \n     Federal court, the offenders were subject to stiffer \n     penalties and expedited prosecutions. The Achilles program \n     was particularly effective in removing the most violent \n     criminals from our communities.\n       (4) In 1991, the Administration expanded its efforts to \n     remove criminals with guns from our streets with Project \n     Triggerlock. Triggerlock continued the ideas formulated in \n     the Achilles program and committed the Department of Justice \n     resources to the prosecution effort. Under the program, every \n     United States Attorney was directed to form special teams of \n     Federal, State, and local investigators to look for gang and \n     drug cases that could be prosecuted as Federal weapon \n     violations. Congress appropriated additional funds to allow a \n     large number of new law enforcement officers and Federal \n     prosecutors to target these gun and drug offenders. In 1992, \n     approximately 7048 defendants were prosecuted under this \n     initiative.\n       (5) Since 1993, the number of ``Project Triggerlock'' type \n     gun prosecutions pursued by the Department of Justice has \n     fallen to approximately 3807 prosecutions in 1998. This is a \n     decline of over 40 percent in Federal prosecutions of \n     criminals with guns.\n       (6) The threat of criminal prosecution in the Federal \n     criminal justice system works to deter criminal behavior \n     because the Federal system is known for speedier trials and \n     longer prison sentences.\n       (7) The deterrent effect of Federal gun prosecutions has \n     been demonstrated recently by successful programs, such as \n     ``Project Exile'' in\n\n[[Page S9274]]\n\n     Richmond, Virginia, which resulted in a 22 percent decrease \n     in violent crime since 1994.\n       (8) The Department of Justice's failure to prosecute the \n     criminal use of guns under existing Federal law undermines \n     the significant deterrent effect that these laws are meant to \n     produce.\n       (9) The Department of Justice already possesses a vast \n     array of Federal criminal statutes that, if used aggressively \n     to prosecute wrongdoers, would significantly reduce both the \n     threat of, and the incidence of, criminal gun violence.\n       (10) As an example, the Department of Justice has the \n     statutory authority in section 922(q) of title 18, United \n     States Code, to prosecute individuals who bring guns to \n     school zones. Although the Administration stated that over \n     6,000 students were expelled last year for bringing guns to \n     school, the Justice Department reports prosecuting only 8 \n     cases under section 922(q) in 1998.\n       (11) The Department of Justice is also empowered under \n     section 922(x) of title 18, United States Code, to prosecute \n     adults who transfer handguns to juveniles. In 1998, the \n     Department of Justice reports having prosecuted only 6 \n     individuals under this provision.\n       (12) The Department of Justice's utilization of existing \n     prosecutorial power is 1 of the most significant steps that \n     can be taken to reduce the number of criminal acts involving \n     guns, and represents a better response to the problem of \n     criminal violence than the enactment of new, symbolic laws, \n     which, if current Departmental trends hold, would likely be \n     underutilized.\n\n     SEC. 803.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Violence Prevention \n     Training for Early Childhood Educators Act''.\n\n     SEC. 1302. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this title is to provide grants to \n     institutions that carry out early childhood education \n     training programs to enable the institutions to include \n     violence prevention training as part of the preparation of \n     individuals pursuing careers in early childhood development \n     and education.\n\n     SEC. 1303. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Aggressive behavior in early childhood is the single \n     best predictor of aggression in later life.\n       (2) Aggressive and defiant behavior predictive of later \n     delinquency is increasing among our Nation's youngest \n     children. Without prevention efforts, higher percentages of \n     juveniles are likely to become violent juvenile offenders.\n       (3) Research has demonstrated that aggression is primarily \n     a learned behavior that develops through observation, \n     imitation, and direct experience. Therefore, children who \n     experience violence as victims or as witnesses are at \n     increased risk of becoming violent themselves.\n       (4) In a study at a Boston city hospital, 1 out of every 10 \n     children seen in the primary care clinic had witnessed a \n     shooting or a stabbing before the age of 6, with 50 percent \n     of the children witnessing in the home and 50 percent of the \n     children witnessing in the streets.\n       (5) A study in New York found that children who had been \n     victims of violence within their families were 24 percent \n     more likely to report violent behavior as adolescents, and \n     adolescents who had grown up in families where partner \n     violence occurred were 21 percent more likely to report \n     violent delinquency than individuals not exposed to violence.\n       (6) Aggression can become well-learned and difficult to \n     change by the time a child reaches adolescence. Early \n     childhood offers a critical period for overcoming risk for \n     violent behavior and providing support for prosocial \n     behavior.\n       (7) Violence prevention programs for very young children \n     yield economic benefits.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MENTORING PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the well-being of all people of the United States is \n     preserved and enhanced when young people are given the \n     guidance they need to live healthy and productive lives;\n       (2) adult mentors can play an important role in ensuring \n     that young people become healthy, productive, successful \n     members of society;\n       (3) at-risk young people with mentors are 46 percent less \n     likely to begin using illegal drugs than at-risk young people \n     without mentors;\n       (4) at-risk young people with mentors are 27 percent less \n     likely to begin using alcohol than at-risk young people \n     without mentors;\n       (5) at-risk young people with mentors are 53 percent less \n     likely to skip school than at-risk young people without \n     mentors;\n       (6) at-risk young people with mentors are 33 percent less \n     likely to hit someone than at-risk young people without \n     mentors;\n       (7) 73 percent of students with mentors report that their \n     mentors helped raise their goals and expectations; and\n       (8) there are many employees of the Federal Government who \n     would like to serve as youth or family mentors but are unable \n     to leave their jobs to participate in mentoring programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the President should issue an Executive Order allowing \n     all employees of the Federal Government to use a maximum of 1 \n     hour each week of excused absence or administrative leave to \n     serve as mentors in youth or family mentoring programs.\n\n     SEC. 1625.

LOCAL ENFORCEMENT OF LOCAL ALCOHOL PROHIBITIONS \n                   THAT REDUCE JUVENILE CRIME IN REMOTE ALASKA \n                   VILLAGES.\n\n       (a) Congressional Findings.--The Congress finds the \n     following:\n       (1) Villages in remote areas of Alaska lack local law \n     enforcement due to the absence of a tax base to support such \n     services and to small populations that do not secure \n     sufficient funds under existing State and Federal grant \n     program formulas.\n       (2) State troopers are often unable to respond to reports \n     of violence in remote villages if there is inclement weather, \n     and often only respond in reported felony cases.\n       (3) Studies conclude that alcohol consumption is strongly \n     linked to the commission of violent crimes in remote Alaska \n     villages and that youth are particularly susceptible to \n     developing chronic criminal behaviors associated with alcohol \n     in the absence of early intervention.\n       (4) Many remote villages have sought to limit the \n     introduction of alcohol into their communities as a means of \n     early intervention and to reduce criminal conduct among \n     juveniles.\n       (5) In many remote villages, there is no person with the \n     authority to enforce these local alcohol restrictions in a \n     manner consistent with judicical standards of due process \n     required under the State and Federal constitutions.\n       (6) Remote Alaska villages are experiencing a marked \n     increase in births and the number of juveniles residing in \n     villages is expected to increase dramatically in the next 5 \n     years.\n       (7) Adoption of alcohol prohibitions by voters in remote \n     villages represents a community-based effort to reduce \n     juvenile crime, but this local policy choice requires local \n     law enforcement to be effective.\n       (b) Grant of Federal Funds.--(1) The Attorney General is \n     authorized to provide to the State of Alaska funds for State \n     law enforcement, judicial infrastructure and other costs \n     necessary in remote villages to implement the prohibitions on \n     the sale, importation and possession of alcohol adopted \n     pursuant to State local option statutes.\n       (2) Funds provided to the State of Alaska under this \n     section shall be in addition to and shall not disqualify the \n     State, local governments, or Indian tribes (as that term is \n     defined in section 4(e) of the Indian Self-Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (P.L. 93-638, as amended; 25 U.S.C. \n     450b(e) (1998)) from Federal funds available under other \n     authority.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--\n       (1) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out this section--\n       (A) $15,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;\n       (B) $17,000,000 for fiscal year 2001;\n       (C) $18,000,000 for fiscal year 2002.\n       (2) Source of sums.--Amounts authorized to be appropriated \n     under this subsection may be derived from the Violent Crime \n     Reduction Trust Fund.\n\n     SEC. 1629.

BOUNTY HUNTER ACCOUNTABILITY AND QUALITY \n                   ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) bounty hunters, also known as bail enforcement officers \n     or recovery agents, provide law enforcement officers and the \n     courts with valuable assistance in recovering fugitives from \n     justice;\n       (2) regardless of the differences in their duties, skills, \n     and responsibilities, the public has had difficulty in \n     discerning the difference between law enforcement officers \n     and bounty hunters;\n       (3) the availability of bail as an alternative to the \n     pretrial detention or unsecured release of criminal \n     defendants is important to the effective functioning of the \n     criminal justice system;\n       (4) the safe and timely return to custody of fugitives who \n     violate bail contracts is an important matter of public \n     safety, as is the return of any other fugitive from justice;\n       (5) bail bond agents are widely regulated by the States, \n     whereas bounty hunters are largely unregulated;\n       (6) the public safety requires the employment of qualified, \n     well-trained bounty hunters; and\n       (7) in the course of their duties, bounty hunters often \n     move in and affect interstate commerce.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``bail bond agent'' means any retail seller of \n     a bond to secure the release of a criminal defendant pending \n     judicial proceedings, unless such person also is self-\n     employed to obtain the recovery of any fugitive from justice \n     who has been released on bail;\n\n[[Page S9289]]\n\n       (2) the term ``bounty hunter''--\n       (A) means any person whose services are engaged, either as \n     an independent contractor or as an employee of a bounty \n     hunter employer, to obtain the recovery of any fugitive from \n     justice who has been released on bail; and\n       (B) does not include any--\n       (i) law enforcement officer acting under color of law;\n       (ii) attorney, accountant, or other professional licensed \n     under applicable State law;\n       (iii) employee whose duties are primarily internal audit or \n     credit functions;\n       (iv) person while engaged in the performance of official \n     duties as a member of the Armed Forces on active duty (as \n     defined in section 101(d)(1) of title 10, United States \n     Code); or\n       (v) bail bond agent;\n       (3) the term ``bounty hunter employer''--\n       (A) means any person that--\n       (i) employs 1 or more bounty hunters; or\n       (ii) provides, as an independent contractor, for \n     consideration, the services of 1 or more bounty hunters \n     (which may include the services of that person); and\n       (B) does not include any bail bond agent; and\n       (4) the term ``law enforcement officer'' means a public \n     officer or employee authorized under applicable Federal or \n     State law to conduct or engage in the prevention, \n     investigation, prosecution, or adjudication of criminal \n     offenses, including any public officer or employee engaged in \n     corrections, parole, or probation functions, or the recovery \n     of any fugitive from justice.\n       (c) Model Guidelines.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall develop \n     model guidelines for the State control and regulation of \n     persons employed or applying for employment as bounty \n     hunters. In developing such guidelines, the Attorney General \n     shall consult with organizations representing--\n       (A) State and local law enforcement officers;\n       (B) State and local prosecutors;\n       (C) the criminal defense bar;\n       (D) bail bond agents;\n       (E) bounty hunters; and\n       (F) corporate sureties.\n       (2) Recommendations.--The guidelines developed under \n     paragraph (1) shall include recommendations of the Attorney \n     General regarding whether--\n       (A) a person seeking employment as a bounty hunter should--\n       (i) be required to submit to a fingerprint-based criminal \n     background check prior to entering into the performance of \n     duties pursuant to employment as a bounty hunter; or\n       (ii) not be allowed to obtain such employment if that \n     person has been convicted of a felony offense under Federal \n     or State law;\n       (B) bounty hunters and bounty hunter employers should be \n     required to obtain adequate liability insurance for actions \n     taken in the course of performing duties pursuant to \n     employment as a bounty hunter; and\n       (C) State laws should provide--\n       (i) for the prohibition on bounty hunters entering any \n     private dwelling, unless the bounty hunter first knocks on \n     the front door and announces the presence of 1 or more bounty \n     hunters; and\n       (ii) the official recognition of bounty hunters from other \n     States.\n       (3) Effect on bail.--The guidelines published under \n     paragraph (1) shall include an analysis of the estimated \n     effect, if any, of the adoption of the guidelines by the \n     States on--\n       (A) the cost and availability of bail; and\n       (B) the bail bond agent industry.\n       (4) No regulatory authority.--Nothing in this subsection \n     may be construed to authorize the promulgation of any Federal \n     regulation relating to bounty hunters, bounty hunter \n     employers, or bail bond agents.\n       (5) Publication of guidelines.--The Attorney General shall \n     publish model guidelines developed pursuant to paragraph (1) \n     in the Federal Register.\n\n     SEC. 1631.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings--\n       (1) The Nation's highest priority should be to ensure that \n     children begin school ready to learn.\n       (2) New scientific research shows that the electrical \n     activity of brain cells actually changes the physical \n     structure of the brain itself and that without a stimulating \n     environment, a baby's brain will suffer. At birth, a baby's \n     brain contains 100,000,000,000 neurons, roughly as many nerve \n     cells as there are stars in the Milky Way, but the wiring \n     pattern between these neurons develops over time. Children \n     who play very little or are rarely touched develop brains \n     that are 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age.\n       (3) This scientific research also conclusively demonstrates \n     that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and \n     intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits \n     for children, families, and the Nation.\n       (4) Since more than 50 percent of the mothers of children \n     under the age of 3 now work outside of the home, society must \n     change to provide new supports so young children receive the \n     attention and care that they need.\n       (5) There are 12,000,000 children under the age of 3 in the \n     United States today and 1 in 4 lives in poverty.\n       (6) Compared with most other industrialized countries, the \n     United States has a higher infant mortality rate, a higher \n     proportion of low-birth weight babies, and a smaller \n     proportion of babies immunized against childhood diseases.\n       (7) National and local studies have found a strong link \n     between--\n       (A) lack of early intervention for children; and\n       (B) increased violence and crime among youth.\n       (8) The United States will spend more than $35,000,000,000 \n     over the next 5 years on Federal programs for at-risk or \n     delinquent youth and child welfare programs, which address \n     crisis situations that frequently could have been avoided or \n     made much less severe through good early intervention for \n     children.\n       (9) Many local communities across the country have \n     developed successful early childhood efforts and with \n     additional resources could expand and enhance opportunities \n     for young children.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Federal funding for early childhood development \n     collaboratives should be a priority in the Federal budget for \n     fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal years.\n\n     SEC. 1633. PROHIBITION ON PROMOTING VIOLENCE ON FEDERAL \n                   PROPERTY.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--A Federal department or agency that--\n       (1) considers a request from an individual or entity for \n     the use of any property, facility, equipment, or personnel of \n     the department or agency, or for any other cooperation from \n     the department or agency, to film a motion picture or \n     television production for commercial purposes; and\n       (2) makes a determination as to whether granting a request \n     described in paragraph (1) is consistent with--\n       (A) United States policy;\n       (B) the mission or interest of the department or agency; or\n       (C) the public interest;\n     shall not grant such a request without considering whether \n     such motion picture or television production glorifies or \n     endorses wanton and gratuitous violence.\n       (b) Exception.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to--\n       (1) any bona fide newsreel or news television production; \n     or\n       (2) any public service announcement.\n\n     SEC. 1634.

EXTENSION OF BRADY BACKGROUND CHECKS TO GUN SHOWS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) more than 4,400 traditional gun shows are held annually \n     across the United States, attracting thousands of attendees \n     per show and hundreds of Federal firearms licensees and \n     nonlicensed firearms sellers;\n       (2) traditional gun shows, as well as flea markets and \n     other organized events, at which a large number of firearms \n     are offered for sale by Federal firearms licensees and \n     nonlicensed firearms sellers, form a significant part of the \n     national firearms market;\n       (3) firearms and ammunition that are exhibited or offered \n     for sale or exchange at gun shows, flea markets, and other \n     organized events move easily in and substantially affect \n     interstate commerce;\n       (4) in fact, even before a firearm is exhibited or offered \n     for sale or exchange at a gun show, flea market, or other \n     organized event, the gun, its component parts, ammunition, \n     and the raw materials from which it is manufactured have \n     moved in interstate commerce;\n       (5) gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events at \n     which firearms are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n     provide a convenient and centralized commercial location at \n     which firearms may be bought and sold anonymously, often \n     without background checks and without records that enable gun \n     tracing;\n       (6) at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events \n     at which guns are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n     criminals and other\n\n[[Page S9290]]\n\n     prohibited persons obtain guns without background checks and \n     frequently use guns that cannot be traced to later commit \n     crimes;\n       (7) many persons who buy and sell firearms at gun shows, \n     flea markets, and other organized events cross State lines to \n     attend these events and engage in the interstate \n     transportation of firearms obtained at these events;\n       (8) gun violence is a pervasive, national problem that is \n     exacerbated by the availability of guns at gun shows, flea \n     markets, and other organized events;\n       (9) firearms associated with gun shows have been \n     transferred illegally to residents of another State by \n     Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers, \n     and have been involved in subsequent crimes including drug \n     offenses, crimes of violence, property crimes, and illegal \n     possession of firearms by felons and other prohibited \n     persons; and\n       (10) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n     clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to ensure, by enactment of this Act, that criminals \n     and other prohibited persons do not obtain firearms at gun \n     shows, flea markets, and other organized events.\n       (b) Definitions.--Section 921(a) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(35) Gun show.--The term `gun show' means any event--\n       ``(A) at which 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited \n     for sale, transfer, or exchange, if 1 or more of the firearms \n     has been shipped or transported in, or otherwise affects, \n     interstate or foreign commerce; and\n       ``(B) at which--\n       ``(i) not less than 20 percent of the exhibitors are \n     firearm exhibitors;\n       ``(ii) there are not less than 10 firearm exhibitors; or\n       ``(iii) 50 or more firearms are offered for sale, transfer, \n     or exchange.\n       ``(36) Gun show promoter.--The term `gun show promoter' \n     means any person who organizes, plans, promotes, or operates \n     a gun show.\n       ``(37) Gun show vendor.--The term `gun show vendor' means \n     any person who exhibits, sells, offers for sale, transfers, \n     or exchanges 1 or more firearms at a gun show, regardless of \n     whether or not the person arranges with the gun show promoter \n     for a fixed location from which to exhibit, sell, offer for \n     sale, transfer, or exchange 1 or more firearms.''\n       (c) Regulation of Firearms Transfers at Gun Shows.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 931.

FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Citizens have an individual right, under the Second \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution, to keep and bear \n     arms. The Gun Control Act of 1968 and the Firearms Owners \n     Protection Act of 1986 specifically state that it is not the \n     intent of Congress to frustrate the free exercise of that \n     right in enacting Federal legislation. The free exercise of \n     that right includes law abiding firearms owners buying, \n     selling, trading, and collecting guns in accordance with \n     Federal, State, and local laws for whatever lawful use they \n     deem desirable.\n       (2) The Internet is a powerful information medium, which \n     has and continues to be an excellent tool to educate citizens \n     on the training, education and safety programs available to \n     use firearms safely and responsibly. It has, and should \n     continue to develop, as a 21st century tool for ``e-\n     commerce'' and marketing many\n\n[[Page S9297]]\n\n     products, including firearms and sporting goods. Many web \n     sites related to these topics are sponsored in large part by \n     the sporting firearms and hunting community.\n       (3) It is the intent of Congress that this legislation be \n     applied where the Internet is being exploited to violate the \n     applicable explosives and firearms laws of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1663. PROHIBITIONS ON USES OF THE INTERNET.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 44 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 931.

PROTECTION OF SENIORS AND THE DISABLED IN FEDERAL \n                   FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) of the estimated more than 1,000,000 persons age 65 and \n     over who are victims of family violence each year, at least \n     \\2/3\\ are women;\n       (2) national statistics are not available on the incidence \n     of domestic or family violence and sexual assault against \n     disabled women, although several studies indicate that abuse \n     of disabled women is of a longer duration compared to abuse \n     suffered by women who are not disabled;\n       (3) in almost 9 out of 10 incidents of domestic elder abuse \n     and neglect, the perpetrator is a family member, and adult \n     children of the victims are the largest category of \n     perpetrators and spouses are the second largest category of \n     perpetrators;\n       (4) the number of reports of elder abuse in the United \n     States increased by 150 percent between 1986 and 1996 and is \n     expected to continue increasing;\n       (5) it is estimated that at least 5 percent of the Nation's \n     elderly are victims of moderate to severe abuse and that the \n     rate for all forms of abuse may be as high as 10 percent;\n       (6) elder abuse is severely underreported, with 1 in 5 \n     cases being reported in 1980 and only 1 in 8 cases being \n     reported today;\n\n[[Page S9301]]\n\n       (7) many older and disabled women fail to report abuse \n     because of shame or as a result of prior unsatisfactory \n     experiences with individual agencies or others who lack \n     sensitivity to the concerns or needs of older or disabled \n     individuals;\n       (8) many older or disabled individuals also fail to report \n     abuse because they are dependent on their abusers and fear \n     being abandoned or institutionalized;\n       (9) disabled women may fear reporting abuse because they \n     are fearful of losing their children in a custody case;\n       (10) public and professional awareness and identification \n     of violence against older or disabled Americans may be \n     difficult because these persons are not integrated into many \n     social networks (such as schools or jobs), and may become \n     isolated in their homes, which can increase the risk of \n     domestic abuse; and\n       (11) older and disabled Americans would greatly benefit \n     from policies that develop, strengthen, and implement \n     programs for the prevention of abuse, including neglect and \n     exploitation, and provide related assistance for victims.\n       (b) In General.--Part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime \n     Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended--\n       (1) in section 2001 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg)--\n       (A) in subsection (a)--\n       (i) by inserting ``, including older women and women with a \n     disability'' after ``combat violent crimes against women'';

Mr. President, education has been one of the \npredominant topics of discussion during the 106th Congress. As you \nknow, I have been vocal in my support of returning decision-making \nauthority to local educators who know best how to address the unique \nneeds of students in their communities. For too long, the federal \ngovernment has focused on bureaucrats and red tape rather than students \nand classrooms. In my travels to schools across Washington state, I \nhave heard from educators who are concerned that this burden of federal \nregulations and paperwork is restricting their ability to instruct \nchildren in a common-sense manner. I have had the pleasure of \ndiscovering a program which has found a way to thrive in an area which \nis particularly burdened with federal mandates and red tape--special \neducation. Accordingly, I am pleased to present an Innovation in \nEducation Award to the Hi-Point program at Franklin Pierce High School \nin Tacoma, WA.\n  I and many of my colleagues in the Senate have heard from \nconstituents about the effects of unfunded mandates on local \nclassrooms. In spite of the burden states and school districts face \nbecause of unfunded federal special education mandates, the Hi-Point \nprogram has found a way to maximize its staff and community support to \ncreate an exemplary program.\n  The key to Hi-Point's success lies with dedicated individuals whose \nzeal for their job and passion for success are infectious to those \naround them. Transition Specialist Brian Redman has displayed the kind \nof compassion, understanding, and drive to see what students can become \ndespite their limitations. In fact, Principal Rick Thompson refers to \nhim as a ``magician.'' Brian has been a Special Educator for over \ntwenty years and the Hi-Point program's success can be attributed \ndirectly to the expertise, patience, and skill with which he leads an \namazing team of coworkers. This teamwork includes weekly meetings by \nthe Student Services Team to communicate ``best practices,'' and to \nproduce ideas to meet the evolving needs of the students. The team \ncombines the knowledge of the school psychologist, teachers, and a \nbusiness teacher to ensure maximum preparation for those higher-\nfunctioning students who may be able to join the workforce.\n  An examination of the work done by the Hi-Point staff indicates the \nnumerous tasks required by those involved in\n\n[[Page S9302]]\n\nspecial education. Those duties include: budgets, transportation, \nmedications, individual study needs, parent contacts, and cooperation \nwith all school district officials.\n  Hi-Point also utilizes a nurse, a speech therapist, an occupational \ntherapist, and a physical therapist. While this combination of services \nis not unheard of in many schools across Washington state, and America, \nit is the creativity of the Hi-Point program in balancing the special \nneeds of its student population with limited budgets, legal \nrestrictions, and at times, intense demands from parents which make the \nsuccess of Hi-Point all the more striking.\n  Hi-Point programs, coordinated with community agencies, include: A \nPersonal Learning Lab for special needs students in need of support in \nregular curriculum classes. Basic Skills courses for developmentally \ndelayed students--to learn simple math, how to use a calculator, how to \nsign a check, and other such necessary tasks. Life Skills such as \nriding the bus, doing laundry, and cooking meals which are necessary to \nfunction in the community. Field Trips to the Zoo, Bowling Alley, and \nthe Grocery Store. Work Crews for Landscape and House Cleaning. An Auto \nDetailing program to serve as a training ground for students while \nproviding an economic service to the community.\n  Clearly, Hi-Point is not only maximizing its resources to meet the \nneeds of special needs students but is doing so in a creative manner \nwhich also maximizes the learning experience of students involved in \nthe program.\n  Too often the Federal Government has done more harm than good in \nefforts to reach into local classrooms. It is time we changed the focus \nof federal education programs back to students and learning and away \nfrom bureaucracy and process. The Hi-Point program is a shining example \nof the innovation that can be accomplished in spite of burdensome red \ntape. Imagine what educators like those at Hi-Point could accomplish \nwithout these unnecessary regulations--that is the true untapped \nresource in education today. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nrecognizing the outstanding work of the Hi-Point staff and in \nsupporting the common-sense idea that educators like Rick Thompson and \nBrian Redman deserve more say in Federal Eduation programs than \nWashington, DC, bureaucrats.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9302-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO MRS. PEARL SALOTTO\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge Mrs. \nPearl Salotto of Warwick, Rhode Island for her dedicated work in \nestablishing the ``Respect for Living Things Day'' in the state of \nRhode Island. Mrs. Salotto has established a number of programs in \nRhode Island including the D.J. Pet Assisted Therapy University \nCertificate Program, the D.J. Pet Assisted Therapy High School Program, \nand the D.J. Respect for Living Things Elementary School Program. Mr. \nPresident, I ask that Mrs. Salotto's op-ed on July 21st, 1999 in the \nProvidence Journal be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                        [The Providence Journal]\n\n                The Best Way To Remember DJ, Therapy Dog\n\n                           (By Pearl Salotto)\n\n       DJ, dog of joy, recently passed away peacefully within the \n     loving arms of her family. The smiling face of this big white \n     dog had become synonymous with professional Pet Assisted \n     Therapy (PAT), locally and nationally, because of her \n     enthusiasm for life and her unconditional love, because of \n     the countless people of all ages whose lives she touched, \n     because of the many programs as well as social-reform \n     initiatives that she inspired, because of the many dreams \n     that she helped turn into reality.\n       Anyone who recognizes that pets and people are good for \n     each other can turn this moment of sadness into a celebration \n     of DJ's life and commit to carrying on her legacy, \n     recognizing that she did more than her part in bringing about \n     a healthier, friendlier, and more peaceful world simply by \n     being herself.\n       DJ showed me, at a New York nursing home in 1998, how \n     residents could find a renewed joy of life through her loving \n     touch and thus inspired not only my university program but \n     also my vision that all universities should have PAT degree \n     programs so that ultimately all facilities could have \n     professional PAT as part of their treatment team.\n       DJ showed me, in my granddaughter's first-grade classroom \n     in New York in 1991, how a dog's strolling up and down aisles \n     and interacting with children could open up their hearts and \n     minds to their responsibilities to pets, people and \n     themselves.\n       DJ showed all of us the profound and life-changing impact \n     that her freely given love could have on Feinstein High \n     School students, giving them the ``heart-opening'' \n     opportunity to learn of the positive impact that animals can \n     have in all of our lives through their one-of-a-kind PAT \n     curriculum and the subsequent follow-up opportunity to share \n     their love with others through PAT Service Learning.\n       DJ showed me from the first day of our experiences together \n     that the bond between the therapy pet and the professional is \n     the ethical foundation of this profession, protecting the pet \n     in the field and providing the example from which all else \n     flows.\n       DJ and DJ-inspired programs have led to schoolchildren \n     writing and singing songs about respecting animals, other \n     people and themselves, Rhode Island Health Department \n     guidelines for pet therapy, an official state commission, \n     annual DJ Respect for Living Things Days on her birthday, May \n     8, several Rhode Island agencies having professional PAT \n     programs, the integration of PAT with Service Learning and \n     Windwalker Humane Coalition for Professional Pet Assisted \n     Therapy, among other programs.\n       Won't you join my children and grandchildren, friends and \n     colleagues, elementary school students of Central Falls, \n     Woonsocket, Providence and Feinstein High School students, \n     and students of all ages who knew and loved DJ, in doing all \n     in our power through all our words and deeds to help this \n     magical profession earn its rightful place in health care, \n     education, social services, and society as a whole, \n     spearheaded over the past 13 years by the smiling face and \n     extended paw of a big white dog named DJ?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9302-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO NACKEY SCRIPPS LOEB OF GOFFSTOWN ON HER RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Nackey Scripps Loeb, a remarkable person who has retired as \npresident and publisher of the Union Leader and New Hampshire Sunday \nNews newspapers.\n  I have been blessed with Mrs. Loeb's friendship since I began my \ncareer in politics more than 15 years ago. She, and her late husband \nBill, were an inspiration to me in the late 1970's and early 1980's, as \nwell as helped fight in the conservative revolution. After Bill's \ndeath, Nackey took over the Union Leader Corporation in 1981. She had \nsome big shoes to fill--Bill was an outspoken and controversial leader \nin both the newspaper industry and the world of politics. But Mrs. Loeb \ntook over with dedication, drive, determination and distinction. She \nproved that the knack for hard-hitting journalism does run in the \nfamily! Her editorials have been the cause of many political aspirants' \nsuccess or failure in their bid for public office.\n  Mr. President, I owe Mrs. Loeb a great deal of thanks for her \nguidance and continuous support during the years that I have held \npublic office. She supported my philosophy in times when many turned \ntheir backs. I respect and commend her commitment to doing what is \nright, even during the days when being a conservative was not ``in.'' \nHer husband once told me, ``stand for something or you stand for \nnothing.'' Nackey Loeb has always fought for the principles on which \nthe Union Leader, and the State of New Hampshire, were founded.\n  Nackey Loeb has guided the Union Leader into the twenty first century \nin several ways. She oversaw the move of production into a larger \nbuilding and the purchasing of more advanced press equipment. She has \nalso driven the Union Leader's involvement on the Internet. ``The \nPaper,'' as it is known, is nationally recognized and respected largely \nbecause of the efforts of Nackey Loeb.\n  Mrs. Loeb has been a powerful force in New Hampshire during her 18 \nyears as president and publisher of the Union Leader. Her vision, \nforthrightness and principled views are admired by all who know her and \nwill be sorely missed.\n  I would like to extend my best wishes to Nackey as she enjoys a \npeaceful time with her family. People like Mrs. Loeb help to maintain \nthe quality of life we enjoy in New Hampshire and make it a special and \nunique place to live. It is an honor to represent Nackey Loeb in the \nUnited States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9302-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9302-S9303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE EUROPEAN UNION'S HUSHKIT RULE\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by \nSenator Gorton regarding the European Union's (EU) rule affecting \nhushkitted and re-engined aircraft. This Sense of\n\n[[Page S9303]]\n\nthe Senate amendment will make clear to the Europeans that the United \nStates will not tolerate unfair, discriminatory restrictions on trade \nthat go against international principles and standards.\n  For those who are not familiar with the issue, I will provide a brief \nbackground. To comply with international aircraft noise standards, the \nU.S. aviation industry adopted so-called hushkit technology to bring \nits older aircraft into compliance. Some airlines also purchased new \nengines for their older aircraft. Even though these hushkitted and re-\nengined aircraft comply with the new international noise standard, the \nEU took legislative action to freeze the number of these aircraft \nwithin the EU Community at the 1999 level. Although the EU delayed \nfinal implementation of this rule for one year, this move has the \neffect of setting a more stringent noise standard in Europe.\n  Unfortunately, implementation of this rule is likely to have a \ndiscriminatory and costly impact on the United States aviation industry \nwithout any noise reduction benefits. The fact that this rule does not \nhave a similar effect on industries in the EU is troubling. It is my \nunderstanding that certain aspects of the rule were tailored to protect \nEuropean aviation interests. But one of the worst aspects of this rule \nis the terrible precedent that it sets for unilateral action by \ncountries or groups of countries outside of the established \ninternational standards-setting process.\n  Earlier this year I wrote to European officials to express my deep \nfrustration with their having chosen this particular, unilateral course \nof action to address the issue of aircraft emissions. Regulations such \nas the one at issue should be taken through the appropriate \ninternational channels, such as the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization. Adoption of this rule by the EU has effectively breached \na 50-year regime of global environmental rules in aviation.\n  A regional rule such as this one will undermine the ability of \nlesser-developed nations, the aerospace industry, airlines, and the \nUnited States to work toward international standards for more stringent \naircraft engine emissions, which is the purported rationale for the EU \nrule. I sincerely hope that the EU will come to realize the benefits of \na single, rational aviation regime for all nations.\n  The delay in implementation of the rule was granted as a result of a \nU.S. commitment to work in partnership with the EU within the \nestablished international process to develop a new, more stringent \nglobal aircraft noise standard. Since its adoption, the Federal \nAviation Administration has been working bilaterally with \nrepresentatives of the European Commission to develop an agreement to \nwork in partnership on resolving this matter to everyone's \nsatisfaction.\n  Despite the ongoing consultations, and regardless of the delay in \nimplementation of the rule, U.S. industry is being negatively impacted \nright now. Because the hushkit rule is on the books, the market assumes \nthat the rule will eventually come into effect. This has had a profound \nimpact upon many businesses. So it is important that this matter be \nresolved soon.\n  The Europeans must understand how important it is that the \nconsiderations of the United States are taken into account with respect \nto this matter. If progress is not made in the near future, calls for \ntaking strong action against the EU will grow. As a committed proponent \nof free trade, I am adamantly opposed to the EU rule. For the same \nreason, I do not support inappropriate retaliation on the part of the \nUnited States in this matter. Despite my opposition, however, the U.S. \nmay in fact retaliate, which could do harm to businesses and consumers \non both sides of the Atlantic.\n  Whether retaliatory in nature or not, the U.S. has many tools at its \ndisposal to address the matter if the EU proves to be intractable in \nits position. For example, the United States Trade Representative is \nconsidering preparation of a World Trade Organization case focusing on \nthe discriminatory aspects of the rule. Northwest Airlines has filed a \ncomplaint with Department of Transportation asking for retaliatory \nmeasures. Most recently, the U.S. aviation industry has asked the \ngovernment to take official action under the so-called Chicago \nConvention, which governs many aspects of international aviation, \nclaiming that the EU rule is not in compliance with international \nstandards.\n  I do not want this issue to become the subject of a trade war. But if \nthe EU fails to grasp the determined opposition of the U.S. aviation \nindustry to this rule, there may be serious repercussions. I hope that \nthis Sense of the Senate will begin to get the message to the EU that \nthis issue cannot remain unresolved for too much longer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9303-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNITION OF RASCHELLE FREEMAN, 5TH GRADE TEACHER\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, as the Senate debates education \nissues and initiatives, too often we talk in the form of numbers and \nstatistics rather than concrete examples of excellence or success in \nour schools. A 5th grade teacher in the town of East Wenatchee, \nWashington has come to my attention for her exemplary service to her \nschool, Lee Elementary, and to her community. Her name is Raschelle \nFreeman and I am pleased to present her with my Innovation in Education \naward.\n  Ms. Freeman's list of accomplishments is certainly impressive. This \nyear she was chosen as the Washington state recipient of the \nprestigious Christa McAuliffe Fellowship. Last January she was one of \n100 teachers nationwide to receive the Presidential Award for \nExcellence in Mathematics Teaching. This national recognition reflects \nthe respect and admiration of those who work with Ms. Freeman each day.\n  The Assistant Superintendent of the Eastmont School District, Ms. \nBeverly Jagla, says Ms. Freeman is the ``most effective'' educator she \nhas ever met--``She is energy personified.'' Ms. Jagla further \nemphasized Ms. Freeman's dedication as a member of the faculty team at \nLee Elementary as well as her great skill at mathematics instruction; a \ntalent so considerable that Ms. Freeman leads workshops for \nsuperintendents, administrators, principals, and other teachers around \nWashington state that emphasize ``best practices'' for successful math \neducation.\n  Lee Elementary's former Principal, Ms. Kathy West, noted that in her \n22 years in education she has never encountered a teacher who excelled \nin every instructional area. For example, this past year Ms. Freeman's \nclass put on a major theater production, complete with music and \ncostumes, that was so impressive students from other schools were bused \nin to see a performance. Ms. West also noted that 12 hour days are the \nnorm for Ms. Freeman as she juggles her many pursuits. In addition to \nthe time spent educating her students and peers, Ms. Freeman spends \ncountless hours writing grant applications to bring more money and \nresources to her school district.\n  The final testament to Ms. Freeman's devotion is the choice she made \nwith the $34,000 McAuliffe Award. The funds are intended to allow the \nrecipient to take time away from teaching to further his or her own \ncontinuing education. Ms. Freeman, however, chose to give the money to \nher school's Science Math with Accountability and Responsible \nTechnology (SMART) project. The SMART program integrates reading, \ntechnical writing, math, science, and technology into an innovative \nmodel that will be used to improve the learning of students throughout \nLee Elementary.\n  I have long been a supporter of greater flexibility for local \neducators. It is educators like Raschelle Freeman that demonstrate \nlocal communities really do know best. The Federal Government should \nprovide more flexibility to promote the work of educators like Ms. \nFreeman. I am proud to present her with my Innovation in Education \nAward, and I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing her \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/26/senate-section/article/S9303-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9303-S9304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 1427\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Research Investment \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GENERAL FINDINGS REGARDING FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Value of Research and Development.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to the value of research \n     and development to the United States:\n       (1) Federal investment in research has resulted in the \n     development of technology that saved lives in the United \n     States and around the world.\n       (2) Research and development investment across all Federal \n     agencies has been effective in creating technology that has \n     enhanced the American quality of life.\n       (3) The Federal investment in research and development \n     conducted or underwritten by both military and civilian \n     agencies has produced benefits that have been felt in both \n     the private and public sector.\n       (4) Discoveries across the spectrum of scientific inquiry \n     have the potential to raise the standard of living and the \n     quality of life for all Americans.\n       (5) Science, engineering, and technology play a critical \n     role in shaping the modern world.\n       (6) Studies show that about half of all United States post-\n     World War II economic growth is a direct result of technical \n     innovation; and science, engineering, and technology \n     contribute to the creation of new goods and services, new \n     jobs and new capital.\n       (7) Technical innovation is the principal driving force \n     behind the long-term economic growth and increased standards \n     of living of the world's modern industrial societies. Other \n     nations are well aware of the pivotal role of science, \n     engineering, and technology, and they are seeking to exploit \n     it wherever possible to advance their own global \n     competitiveness.\n       (8) Federal programs for investment in research, which lead \n     to technological innovation and result in economic growth, \n     should be structured to address current funding disparities \n     and develop enhanced capability in States and regions that \n     currently underparticipate in the national science and \n     technology enterprise.\n       (b) Status of the Federal Investment.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to the status of the \n     Federal Investment in research and development activities:\n       (1) Federal investment of approximately 13 to 14 percent of \n     the Federal discretionary budget in research and development \n     over the past 11 years has resulted in a doubling of the \n     nominal amount of Federal funding.\n       (2) Fiscal realities now challenge Congress to steer the \n     Federal government's role in science, engineering, and \n     technology in a manner that ensures a prudent use of limited \n     public resources. There is both a long-term problem--\n     addressing the ever-increasing level of mandatory spending--\n     and a near-term challenge--apportioning a dwindling amount of \n     discretionary funding to an increasing range of targets in \n     science, engineering, and technology. This confluence of \n     increased national dependency on technology, increased \n     targets of opportunity, and decreased fiscal flexibility has \n     created a problem of national urgency. Many indicators show \n     that more funding for science, engineering, and technology is \n     needed but, even with increased funding, priorities must be \n     established among different programs. The United States \n     cannot afford the luxury of fully funding all deserving \n     programs.\n       (3) Current projections of Federal research funding show a \n     downward trend.\n\n     SEC. 3. SPECIAL FINDINGS REGARDING HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings with respect to \n     health-related research:\n       (1) Health and economic benefits provided by health-related \n     research.--Because of health-related research, cures for many \n     debilitating and fatal diseases have been discovered and \n     deployed. At present, the medical research community is on \n     the cusp of creating cures for a number of leading diseases \n     and their associated burdens. In particular, medical research \n     has the potential to develop treatments that can help manage \n     the escalating costs associated with the aging of the United \n     States population.\n       (2) Funding of health-related research.--Many studies have \n     recognized that clinical and basic science are in a state of \n     crisis because of a failure of resources to meet the \n     opportunity. Consequently, health-related research has \n     emerged as a national priority and has been given \n     significantly increased funding by Congress in fiscal year \n     1999. In order to continue addressing this urgent national \n     need, the pattern of substantial budgetary expansion begun in \n     fiscal year 1999 should be maintained.\n       (3) Interdisciplinary nature of health-related research.--\n     Because all fields of science and engineering are \n     interdependent, full realization of the nation's historic \n     investment in health will depend on major advances both in \n     the biomedical sciences and in other science and engineering \n     disciplines. Hence, the vitality of all disciplines must be \n     preserved, even as special considerations are given to the \n     health research field.\n\n     [SEC. 4.] SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING THE LINK \n                   BETWEEN THE RESEARCH PROCESS AND USEFUL \n                   TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Flow of science, engineering, and technology.--The \n     process of science, engineering, and technology involves many \n     steps. The present Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology structure reinforces the increasingly artificial \n     distinctions between basic and applied activities. The result \n     too often is a set of discrete programs that each\n\n[[Page S9305]]\n\n     support a narrow phase of research or development and are not \n     coordinated with one another. The government should maximize \n     its investment by encouraging the progression of science, \n     engineering, and technology from the earliest stages of \n     research up to a pre-commercialization stage, through funding \n     agencies and vehicles appropriate for each stage. This \n     creates a flow of technology, subject to merit review at each \n     stage, so that promising technology is not lost in a \n     bureaucratic maze.\n       (2) Excellence in the american research infrastructure.--\n     Federal investment in science, engineering, and technology \n     programs must foster a close relationship between research \n     and education. Investment in research at the university level \n     creates more than simply world-class research. It creates \n     world-class researchers as well. The Federal strategy must \n     continue to reflect this commitment to a strong \n     geographically-diverse research infrastructure. Furthermore, \n     the United States must find ways to extend the excellence of \n     its university system to primary and secondary educational \n     institutions and to better utilize the community college \n     system to prepare many students for vocational opportunities \n     in an increasingly technical workplace.\n       (3) Commitment to a broad range of research initiatives.--\n     An increasingly common theme in many recent technical \n     breakthroughs has been the importance of revolutionary \n     innovations that were sparked by overlapping of research \n     disciplines. The United States must continue to encourage \n     this trend by providing and encouraging opportunities for \n     interdisciplinary projects that foster collaboration among \n     fields of research.\n       (4) Partnerships among industry, universities, and federal \n     laboratories.--Each of these contributors to the national \n     science and technology delivery system has special talents \n     and abilities that complement the others. In addition, each \n     has a central mission that must provide their focus and each \n     has limited resources. The nation's investment in science, \n     engineering, and technology can be optimized by seeking \n     opportunities for leveraging the resources and talents of \n     these three major players through partnerships that do not \n     distort the missions of each partner. For that reason, \n     Federal dollars are wisely spent forming such partnerships.\n\n     [SEC. 4.] SEC. 5. MAINTENANCE OF FEDERAL RESEARCH EFFORT; \n                   GUIDING PRINCIPLES.\n\n       (a) Maintaining United States Leadership in Science, \n     Engineering, and Technology.--It is imperative for the United \n     States to nurture its superb resources in science, \n     engineering, and technology carefully in order to maintain \n     its own globally competitive position.\n       (b) Guiding Principles.--Federal research and development \n     programs should be conducted in accordance with the following \n     guiding principles:\n       (1) Good science.--Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology programs include both knowledge-driven science \n     together with its applications, and mission-driven, science-\n     based requirements. In general, both types of programs must \n     be focused, peer- and merit-reviewed, and not unnecessarily \n     duplicative, although the details of these attributes must \n     vary with different program objectives.\n       (2) Fiscal accountability.--The Congress must exercise \n     oversight to ensure that programs funded with scarce Federal \n     dollars are well managed. The United States cannot tolerate \n     waste of money through inefficient management techniques, \n     whether by government agencies, by contractors, or by \n     Congress itself. Fiscal resources would be better utilized if \n     program and project funding levels were predictable across \n     several years to enable better project planning; a benefit of \n     such predictability would be that agencies and Congress can \n     better exercise oversight responsibilities through \n     comparisons of a project's and program's progress against \n     carefully planned milestones.\n       (3) Program effectiveness.--The United States needs to make \n     sure that government programs achieve their goals. As the \n     Congress crafts science, engineering, and technology \n     legislation, it must include a process for gauging program \n     effectiveness, selecting criteria based on sound scientific \n     judgment and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. The Congress \n     should also avoid the trap of measuring the effectiveness of \n     a broad science, engineering, and technology program by \n     passing judgment on individual projects. Lastly, the Congress \n     must recognize that a negative result in a well-conceived and \n     executed project or program may still be critically important \n     to the funding agency.\n       (4) Criteria for government funding.--Program selection for \n     Federal funding should continue to reflect the nation's 2 \n     traditional research and development priorities: (A) basic, \n     scientific, and technological research that represents \n     investments in the nation's long-term future scientific and \n     technological capacity, for which government has \n     traditionally served as the principle resource; and (B) \n     mission research investments, that is, investments in \n     research that derive from necessary public functions, such as \n     defense, health, education, environmental protection, and \n     raising the standard of living, which may include pre-\n     commercial, pre-competitive engineering research and \n     technology development. Additionally, government funding \n     should not compete with or displace the short-term, market-\n     driven, and typically more specific nature of private-sector \n     funding. Government funding should be restricted to pre-\n     competitive activities, leaving competitive activities solely \n     for the private sector. As a rule, the government should not \n     invest in commercial technology that is in the product \n     development stage, very close to the broad commercial \n     marketplace, except to meet a specific agency goal. When the \n     government provides funding for any science, engineering, and \n     technology investment program, it must take reasonable steps \n     to ensure that the potential benefits derived from the \n     program will accrue broadly.\n\n     [SEC. 5.] SEC. 6.

This could threaten \n     American dominance of high-technology industrial leadership.\n       [(e) Increase Funding.--In order to maintain and enhance \n     the economic strength of the United States in the world \n     market, funding levels for fundamental, scientific, and pre-\n     competitive engineering research should be increased to equal \n     approximately 2.6 percent of the total annual budget.\n       [(f) (d) Future Fiscal Year Allocations.--\n       (1) Goals.--The long-term strategy for research and \n     development funding under this section would be achieved by a \n     steady 2.5 percent annual increase above the rate of \n     inflation throughout a 11-year period.\n       (2) Inflation assumption.--The authorizations contained in \n     paragraph (3) assume that the rate of inflation for each year \n     will be 3 percent.\n       (3) Authorization.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     for civilian research and development in the agencies listed \n     in subsection (b)--\n       (A) $39,790,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;\n       (B) $41,980,000,000 for fiscal year 2001;\n\n[[Page S9306]]\n\n       (C) $42,290,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       (D) $46,720,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (E) [$49,290,000,000] $44,290,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (F) $52,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       (G) $54,870,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       (H) $57,880,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;\n       (I) $61,070,000,000 for fiscal year 2008;\n       (J) $64,420,000,000 for fiscal year 2009; and\n       (K) $67,970,000,000 for fiscal year 2010.\n       (4) Acceleration to meet national needs.--\n       (A) In general.--If the amount appropriated for any fiscal \n     year to an agency for the purposes stated in paragraph (3) \n     increases by more than 8 percent over the amount appropriated \n     to it for those purposes for the preceding fiscal year, then \n     the amounts authorized by paragraph (3) for subsequent fiscal \n     years for that agency and other agencies shall be determined \n     under subparagraphs (B) and (C).\n       (B) Exclusion of agency in determining other agency amounts \n     for next fiscal year.--For the next fiscal year after a \n     fiscal year described in subparagraph (A), the amount \n     authorized to be appropriated to other agencies under \n     paragraph (3) shall be determined by excluding the agency \n     described in subparagraph (A). Any amount that would, but for \n     this subparagraph, be authorized to be appropriated to that \n     agency shall not be appropriated.\n       (C) Resumption of regular treatment.--Notwithstanding \n     subparagraph (B), an agency may not be excluded from the \n     determination of the amount authorized to be appropriated \n     under paragraph (3) for a fiscal year following a fiscal year \n     for which the sum of the amounts appropriated to that agency \n     for fiscal year 2000 and all subsequent fiscal years for the \n     purposes described in paragraph (3) does not exceed the sum \n     of--\n       (i) the amount appropriated to that agency for such \n     purposes for fiscal year 2000; and\n       (ii) the amounts that would have been appropriated for such \n     purposes for subsequent fiscal years if the goal described in \n     paragraph (1) had been met (and not exceeded) with respect to \n     that agency's funding.\n       (D) No limitation on other funding.--Nothing in this \n     paragraph limits the amount that may be appropriated to any \n     agency for the purposes described in paragraph (3).\n       [(g)] (e) Conformance with Budgetary Caps.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, no funds may be made available \n     under this Act in a manner that does not conform with the \n     discretionary spending caps provided in the most recently \n     adopted concurrent resolution on the budget or threatens the \n     economic stability of the annual budget.\n       [(h)] (f) Balanced Research Portfolio.--Because of the \n     interdependent nature of the scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, the aggregate funding levels authorized by the \n     section assume that the Federal research portfolio will be \n     well-balanced among the various scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, and geographically dispersed throughout the \n     States.\n\n     [SEC. 6.] SEC. 7. PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL BUDGET REQUEST.\n\n       The President of the United States shall, in coordination \n     with the President's annual budget request, include a report \n     that parallels Congress' commitment to support Federally-\n     funded research and development by providing--\n       (1) a detailed summary of the total level of funding for \n     research and development programs throughout all civilian \n     agencies;\n       (2) a focused strategy that reflects the funding \n     projections of this Act for each future fiscal year until \n     2010, including specific targets for each agency that funds \n     civilian research and development;\n       (3) an analysis which details funding levels across Federal \n     agencies by methodology of funding, including grant \n     agreements, procurement contracts, and cooperative agreements \n     (within the meaning given those terms in chapter 63 of title \n     31, United States Code); and\n       (4) specific proposals for infrastructure development and \n     research and development capacity building in States with \n     less concentrated research and development resources in order \n     to create a nationwide research and development community.\n\n     [SEC. 7.] SEC. 8. COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTABILITY STUDY FOR \n                   FEDERALLY-FUNDED RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Director of the Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy, in consultation with the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget, shall enter into agreement \n     with the National Academy of Sciences for the Academy to \n     conduct a comprehensive study to develop methods for \n     evaluating Federally-funded research and development \n     programs. This study shall--\n       (1) recommend processes to determine an acceptable level of \n     success for Federally-funded research and development \n     programs by--\n       (A) describing the research process in the various \n     scientific and engineering disciplines;\n       (B) describing in the different sciences what measures and \n     what criteria each community uses to evaluate the success or \n     failure of a program, and on what time scales these measures \n     are considered reliable--both for exploratory long-range work \n     and for short-range goals; and\n       (C) recommending how these measures may be adapted for use \n     by the Federal government to evaluate Federally-funded \n     research and development programs;\n       (2) assess the extent to which agencies incorporate \n     independent merit-based review into the formulation of the \n     strategic plans of funding agencies and if the quantity or \n     quality of this type of input is unsatisfactory;\n       (3) recommend mechanisms for identifying Federally-funded \n     research and development programs which are unsuccessful or \n     unproductive;\n       (4) evaluate the extent to which independent, merit-based \n     evaluation of Federally-funded research and development \n     programs and projects achieves the goal of eliminating \n     unsuccessful or unproductive programs and projects; and\n       (5) investigate and report on the validity of using \n     quantitative performance goals for aspects of programs which \n     relate to administrative management of the program and for \n     which such goals would be appropriate, including aspects \n     related to--\n       (A) administrative burden on contractors and recipients of \n     financial assistance awards;\n       (B) administrative burdens on external participants in \n     independent, merit-based evaluations;\n       (C) cost and schedule control for construction projects \n     funded by the program;\n       (D) the ratio of overhead costs of the program relative to \n     the amounts expended through the program for equipment and \n     direct funding of research; and\n       (E) the timeliness of program responses to requests for \n     funding, participation, or equipment use.\n       (6) examine the extent to which program selection for \n     Federal funding across all agencies exemplifies our nation's \n     historical research and development priorities--\n       (A) basic, scientific, and technological research in the \n     long-term future scientific and technological capacity of the \n     nation; and\n       (B) mission research derived from a high-priority public \n     function.\n       (b) Alternative Forms for Performance Goals.--Not later \n     than 6 months after transmitting the report under subsection \n     (a) to Congress, the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, after public notice, public comment, and approval by \n     the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy \n     and in consultation with the National Science and Technology \n     Council shall promulgate one or more alternative forms for \n     performance goals under section 1115(b)(10)(B) of title 31, \n     United States Code, based on the recommendations of the study \n     under subsection (a) of this section. The head of each agency \n     containing a program activity that is a research and \n     development program may apply an alternative form promulgated \n     under this section for a performance goal to such a program \n     activity without further authorization by the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget.\n       (c) Strategic Plans.--Not later than one year after \n     promulgation of the alternative performance goals in \n     subsection (b) of this section, the head of each agency \n     carrying out research and development activities, upon \n     updating or revising a strategic plan under subsection 306(b) \n     of title 5, United States Code, shall describe the current \n     and future use of methods for determining an acceptable level \n     of success as recommended by the study under subsection (a).\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n       (2) Program activity.--The term ``program activity'' has \n     the meaning given that term by section 1115(f)(6) of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (3) Independent merit-based evaluation.--The term \n     ``independent merit-based evaluation'' means review of the \n     scientific or technical quality of research or development, \n     conducted by experts who are chosen for their knowledge of \n     scientific and technical fields relevant to the evaluation \n     and who--\n       (A) in the case of the review of a program activity, do not \n     derive long-term support from the program activity; or\n       (B) in the case of the review of a project proposal, are \n     not seeking funds in competition with the proposal.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out the study required by \n     subsection (a) $600,000 for the 18-month period beginning \n     October 1, 2000.\n\n     [SEC. 8.] SEC. 9.

GENERAL FINDINGS REGARDING FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Value of Research and Development.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to the value of research \n     and development to the United States:\n       (1) Federal investment in research has resulted in the \n     development of technology that saved lives in the United \n     States and around the world.\n       (2) Research and development investment across all Federal \n     agencies has been effective in creating technology that has \n     enhanced the American quality of life.\n       (3) The Federal investment in research and development \n     conducted or underwritten by both military and civilian \n     agencies has produced benefits that have been felt in both \n     the private and public sector.\n       (4) Discoveries across the spectrum of scientific inquiry \n     have the potential to raise the standard of living and the \n     quality of life for all Americans.\n       (5) Science, engineering, and technology play a critical \n     role in shaping the modern world.\n       (6) Studies show that about half of all United States post-\n     World War II economic growth is a direct result of technical \n     innovation; and science, engineering, and technology \n     contribute to the creation of new goods and services, new \n     jobs and new capital.\n       (7) Technical innovation is the principal driving force \n     behind the long-term economic growth and increased standards \n     of living of the world's modern industrial societies. Other \n     nations are well aware of the pivotal role of science, \n     engineering, and technology, and they are seeking to exploit \n     it wherever possible to advance their own global \n     competitiveness.\n       (8) Federal programs for investment in research, which lead \n     to technological innovation and result in economic growth, \n     should be structured to address current funding disparities \n     and develop enhanced capability in States and regions that \n     currently underparticipate in the national science and \n     technology enterprise.\n       (b) Status of the Federal Investment.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to the status of the \n     Federal Investment in research and development activities:\n       (1) Federal investment of approximately 13 to 14 percent of \n     the Federal discretionary budget in research and development \n     over the past 11 years has resulted in a doubling of the \n     nominal amount of Federal funding.\n       (2) Fiscal realities now challenge Congress to steer the \n     Federal government's role in science, engineering, and \n     technology in a manner that ensures a prudent use of limited \n     public resources. There is both a long-term problem--\n     addressing the ever-increasing level of mandatory spending--\n     and a near-term challenge--apportioning a dwindling amount of \n     discretionary funding to an increasing range of targets in \n     science, engineering, and technology. This confluence of \n     increased national dependency on technology, increased \n     targets of opportunity, and decreased fiscal flexibility has \n     created a problem of national urgency. Many indicators show \n     that more funding for science, engineering, and technology is \n     needed but, even with increased funding, priorities must be \n     established among different programs. The United States \n     cannot afford the luxury of fully funding all deserving \n     programs.\n       (3) Current projections of Federal research funding show a \n     downward trend.\n\n     SEC. 3. SPECIAL FINDINGS REGARDING HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings with respect to \n     health-related research:\n       (1) Health and economic benefits provided by health-related \n     research.--Because of health-related research, cures for many \n     debilitating and fatal diseases have been discovered and \n     deployed. At present, the medical research community is on \n     the cusp of creating cures for a number of leading diseases \n     and their associated burdens. In particular, medical research \n     has the potential to develop treatments that can help manage \n     the escalating costs associated with the aging of the United \n     States population.\n       (2) Funding of health-related research.--Many studies have \n     recognized that clinical and basic science are in a state of \n     crisis because of a failure of resources to meet the \n     opportunity. Consequently, health-related research has \n     emerged as a national priority and has been given \n     significantly increased funding by Congress in fiscal year \n     1999. In order to continue addressing this urgent national \n     need, the pattern of substantial budgetary expansion begun in \n     fiscal year 1999 should be maintained.\n       (3) Interdisciplinary nature of health-related research.--\n     Because all fields of science and engineering are \n     interdependent, full realization of the nation's historic \n     investment in health will depend on major advances both in \n     the biomedical sciences and in other science and engineering \n     disciplines. Hence, the vitality of all disciplines must be \n     preserved, even as special considerations are given to the \n     health research field.\n\n     SEC. 4. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING THE LINK BETWEEN THE \n                   RESEARCH PROCESS AND USEFUL TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Flow of science, engineering, and technology.--The \n     process of science, engineering, and technology involves many \n     steps. The present Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology structure reinforces the increasingly artificial \n     distinctions between basic and applied activities. The result \n     too often is a set of discrete programs that each support a \n     narrow phase of research or development and are not \n     coordinated with one another. The government should maximize \n     its investment by encouraging the progression of science, \n     engineering, and technology from the earliest stages of \n     research up to a pre-commercialization stage, through funding \n     agencies and vehicles appropriate for each stage. This \n     creates a flow of technology, subject to merit review at each \n     stage, so that promising technology is not lost in a \n     bureaucratic maze.\n       (2) Excellence in the american research infrastructure.--\n     Federal investment in science, engineering, and technology \n     programs must foster a close relationship between research \n     and education. Investment in research at the university level \n     creates more than simply world-class research. It creates \n     world-class researchers as well. The Federal strategy must \n     continue to reflect this commitment to a strong \n     geographically-diverse research infrastructure. Furthermore, \n     the United States must find ways to extend the excellence of \n     its university system to primary and secondary educational \n     institutions and to better utilize the community college \n     system to prepare many students for vocational opportunities \n     in an increasingly technical workplace.\n       (3) Commitment to a broad range of research initiatives.--\n     An increasingly common theme in many recent technical \n     breakthroughs has been the importance of revolutionary \n     innovations that were sparked by overlapping of research \n     disciplines. The United States must continue to encourage \n     this trend by providing and encouraging opportunities for \n     interdisciplinary projects that foster collaboration among \n     fields of research.\n       (4) Partnerships among industry, universities, and federal \n     laboratories.--Each of these contributors to the national \n     science and technology delivery system has special talents \n     and abilities that complement the others. In addition, each \n     has a central mission that must provide their focus and each \n     has limited resources. The nation's investment in science, \n     engineering, and technology can be optimized by seeking \n     opportunities for leveraging the resources and talents of \n     these three major players through partnerships that do not \n     distort the missions of each partner. For that reason, \n     Federal dollars are wisely spent forming such partnerships.\n\n[[Page S9308]]\n\n     SEC. 5. MAINTENANCE OF FEDERAL RESEARCH EFFORT; GUIDING \n                   PRINCIPLES.\n\n       (a) Maintaining United States Leadership in Science, \n     Engineering, and Technology.--It is imperative for the United \n     States to nurture its superb resources in science, \n     engineering, and technology carefully in order to maintain \n     its own globally competitive position.\n       (b) Guiding Principles.--Federal research and development \n     programs should be conducted in accordance with the following \n     guiding principles:\n       (1) Good science.--Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology programs include both knowledge-driven science \n     together with its applications, and mission-driven, science-\n     based requirements. In general, both types of programs must \n     be focused, peer- and merit-reviewed, and not unnecessarily \n     duplicative, although the details of these attributes must \n     vary with different program objectives.\n       (2) Fiscal accountability.--The Congress must exercise \n     oversight to ensure that programs funded with scarce Federal \n     dollars are well managed. The United States cannot tolerate \n     waste of money through inefficient management techniques, \n     whether by government agencies, by contractors, or by \n     Congress itself. Fiscal resources would be better utilized if \n     program and project funding levels were predictable across \n     several years to enable better project planning; a benefit of \n     such predictability would be that agencies and Congress can \n     better exercise oversight responsibilities through \n     comparisons of a project's and program's progress against \n     carefully planned milestones.\n       (3) Program effectiveness.--The United States needs to make \n     sure that government programs achieve their goals. As the \n     Congress crafts science, engineering, and technology \n     legislation, it must include a process for gauging program \n     effectiveness, selecting criteria based on sound scientific \n     judgment and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. The Congress \n     should also avoid the trap of measuring the effectiveness of \n     a broad science, engineering, and technology program by \n     passing judgment on individual projects. Lastly, the Congress \n     must recognize that a negative result in a well-conceived and \n     executed project or program may still be critically important \n     to the funding agency.\n       (4) Criteria for government funding.--Program selection for \n     Federal funding should continue to reflect the nation's 2 \n     traditional research and development priorities: (A) basic, \n     scientific, and technological research that represents \n     investments in the nation's long-term future scientific and \n     technological capacity, for which government has \n     traditionally served as the principle resource; and (B) \n     mission research investments, that is, investments in \n     research that derive from necessary public functions, such as \n     defense, health, education, environmental protection, and \n     raising the standard of living, which may include pre-\n     commercial, pre-competitive engineering research and \n     technology development. Additionally, government funding \n     should not compete with or displace the short-term, market-\n     driven, and typically more specific nature of private-sector \n     funding. Government funding should be restricted to pre-\n     competitive activities, leaving competitive activities solely \n     for the private sector. As a rule, the government should not \n     invest in commercial technology that is in the product \n     development stage, very close to the broad commercial \n     marketplace, except to meet a specific agency goal. When the \n     government provides funding for any science, engineering, and \n     technology investment program, it must take reasonable steps \n     to ensure that the potential benefits derived from the \n     program will accrue broadly.\n\n     SEC. 6. POLICY STATEMENT.\n\n       (a) Policy.-- This Act is intended to--\n       (1) assure a base level of Federal funding for basic \n     scientific, biomedical, and pre-competitive engineering \n     research, with this base level defined as a doubling of \n     Federal basic research funding over the 11 year period \n     following the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (2) invest in the future economic growth of the United \n     States by expanding the research activities referred to in \n     paragraph (1);\n       (3) enhance the quality of life and health for all people \n     of the United States through expanded support for health-\n     related research;\n       (4) allow for accelerated growth of agencies such as the \n     National Institutes of Health to meet critical national \n     needs;\n       (5) guarantee the leadership of the United States in \n     science, engineering, medicine, and technology; and\n       (6) ensure that the opportunity and the support for \n     undertaking good science is widely available throughout the \n     United States by supporting a geographically-diverse research \n     and development enterprise.\n       (b) Agencies Covered.--The agencies intended to be covered \n     to the extent that they are engaged in science, engineering, \n     and technology activities for basic scientific, medical, or \n     pre-competitive engineering research by this Act are--\n       (1) the National Institutes of Health, within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (2) the National Science Foundation;\n       (3) the National Institute for Standards and Technology, \n     within the Department of Commerce;\n       (4) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;\n       (5) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     within the Department of Commerce;\n       (6) the Centers for Disease Control, within the Department \n     of Health and Human Services;\n       (7) the Department of Energy (to the extent that it is not \n     engaged in defense-related activities);\n       (8) the Department of Agriculture;\n       (9) the Department of Transportation;\n       (10) the Department of the Interior;\n       (11) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (12) the Smithsonian Institution;\n       (13) the Department of Education;\n       (14) the Environmental Protection Agency; and\n       (15) the Food and Drug Administration, within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services.\n       (c) Damage to Research Infrastructure.--A continued trend \n     of funding appropriations equal to or lower than current \n     budgetary levels will lead to permanent damage to the United \n     States research infrastructure. This could threaten American \n     dominance of high-technology industrial leadership.\n       (d) Future Fiscal Year Allocations.--\n       (1) Goals.--The long-term strategy for research and \n     development funding under this section would be achieved by a \n     steady 2.5 percent annual increase above the rate of \n     inflation throughout a 11-year period.\n       (2) Inflation assumption.--The authorizations contained in \n     paragraph (3) assume that the rate of inflation for each year \n     will be 3 percent.\n       (3) Authorization.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     for civilian research and development in the agencies listed \n     in subsection (b)--\n       (A) $39,790,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;\n       (B) $41,980,000,000 for fiscal year 2001;\n       (C) $44,290,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       (D) $46,720,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (E) $49,290,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (F) $52,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       (G) $54,870,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       (H) $57,880,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;\n       (I) $61,070,000,000 for fiscal year 2008;\n       (J) $64,420,000,000 for fiscal year 2009; and\n       (K) $67,970,000,000 for fiscal year 2010.\n       (4) Acceleration to meet national needs.--\n       (A) In general.--If the amount appropriated for any fiscal \n     year to an agency for the purposes stated in paragraph (3) \n     increases by more than 8 percent over the amount appropriated \n     to it for those purposes for the preceding fiscal year, then \n     the amounts authorized by paragraph (3) for subsequent fiscal \n     years for that agency and other agencies shall be determined \n     under subparagraphs (B) and (C).\n       (B) Exclusion of agency in determining other agency amounts \n     for next fiscal year.--For the next fiscal year after a \n     fiscal year described in subparagraph (A), the amount \n     authorized to be appropriated to other agencies under \n     paragraph (3) shall be determined by excluding the agency \n     described in subparagraph (A). Any amount that would, but for \n     this subparagraph, be authorized to be appropriated to that \n     agency shall not be appropriated.\n       (C) Resumption of regular treatment.--Notwithstanding \n     subparagraph (B), an agency may not be excluded from the \n     determination of the amount authorized to be appropriated \n     under paragraph (3) for a fiscal year following a fiscal year \n     for which the sum of the amounts appropriated to that agency \n     for fiscal year 2000 and all subsequent fiscal years for the \n     purposes described in paragraph (3) does not exceed the sum \n     of--\n       (i) the amount appropriated to that agency for such \n     purposes for fiscal year 2000; and\n       (ii) the amounts that would have been appropriated for such \n     purposes for subsequent fiscal years if the goal described in \n     paragraph (1) had been met (and not exceeded) with respect to \n     that agency's funding.\n       (D) No limitation on other funding.--Nothing in this \n     paragraph limits the amount that may be appropriated to any \n     agency for the purposes described in paragraph (3).\n       (e) Conformance with Budgetary Caps.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, no funds may be made available under \n     this Act in a manner that does not conform with the \n     discretionary spending caps provided in the most recently \n     adopted concurrent resolution on the budget or threatens the \n     economic stability of the annual budget.\n       (f) Balanced Research Portfolio.--Because of the \n     interdependent nature of the scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, the aggregate funding levels authorized by the \n     section assume that the Federal research portfolio will be \n     well-balanced among the various scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, and geographically dispersed throughout the \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 7. PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL BUDGET REQUEST.\n\n       The President of the United States shall, in coordination \n     with the President's annual budget request, include a report \n     that parallels Congress' commitment to support federally-\n     funded research and development by providing--\n       (1) a detailed summary of the total level of funding for \n     research and development programs throughout all civilian \n     agencies;\n       (2) a focused strategy that reflects the funding \n     projections of this Act for each future fiscal year until \n     2010, including specific targets for each agency that funds \n     civilian research and development;\n       (3) an analysis which details funding levels across Federal \n     agencies by methodology of funding, including grant \n     agreements, procurement contracts, and cooperative agreements \n     (within the meaning given those\n\n[[Page S9309]]\n\n     terms in chapter 63 of title 31, United States Code); and\n       (4) specific proposals for infrastructure development and \n     research and development capacity building in States with \n     less concentrated research and development resources in order \n     to create a nationwide research and development community.\n\n     SEC. 8. COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTABILITY STUDY FOR FEDERALLY-\n                   FUNDED RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Director of the Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy, in consultation with the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget, shall enter into agreement \n     with the National Academy of Sciences for the Academy to \n     conduct a comprehensive study to develop methods for \n     evaluating federally-funded research and development \n     programs. This study shall--\n       (1) recommend processes to determine an acceptable level of \n     success for federally-funded research and development \n     programs by--\n       (A) describing the research process in the various \n     scientific and engineering disciplines;\n       (B) describing in the different sciences what measures and \n     what criteria each community uses to evaluate the success or \n     failure of a program, and on what time scales these measures \n     are considered reliable--both for exploratory long-range work \n     and for short-range goals; and\n       (C) recommending how these measures may be adapted for use \n     by the Federal government to evaluate federally-funded \n     research and development programs;\n       (2) assess the extent to which agencies incorporate \n     independent merit-based review into the formulation of the \n     strategic plans of funding agencies and if the quantity or \n     quality of this type of input is unsatisfactory;\n       (3) recommend mechanisms for identifying federally-funded \n     research and development programs which are unsuccessful or \n     unproductive;\n       (4) evaluate the extent to which independent, merit-based \n     evaluation of federally-funded research and development \n     programs and projects achieves the goal of eliminating \n     unsuccessful or unproductive programs and projects; and\n       (5) investigate and report on the validity of using \n     quantitative performance goals for aspects of programs which \n     relate to administrative management of the program and for \n     which such goals would be appropriate, including aspects \n     related to--\n       (A) administrative burden on contractors and recipients of \n     financial assistance awards;\n       (B) administrative burdens on external participants in \n     independent, merit-based evaluations;\n       (C) cost and schedule control for construction projects \n     funded by the program;\n       (D) the ratio of overhead costs of the program relative to \n     the amounts expended through the program for equipment and \n     direct funding of research; and\n       (E) the timeliness of program responses to requests for \n     funding, participation, or equipment use.\n       (6) examine the extent to which program selection for \n     Federal funding across all agencies exemplifies our nation's \n     historical research and development priorities--\n       (A) basic, scientific, and technological research in the \n     long-term future scientific and technological capacity of the \n     nation; and\n       (B) mission research derived from a high-priority public \n     function.\n       (b) Alternative Forms for Performance Goals.--Not later \n     than 6 months after transmitting the report under subsection \n     (a) to Congress, the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, after public notice, public comment, and approval by \n     the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy \n     and in consultation with the National Science and Technology \n     Council shall promulgate one or more alternative forms for \n     performance goals under section 1115(b)(10)(B) of title 31, \n     United States Code, based on the recommendations of the study \n     under subsection (a) of this section. The head of each agency \n     containing a program activity that is a research and \n     development program may apply an alternative form promulgated \n     under this section for a performance goal to such a program \n     activity without further authorization by the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget.\n       (c) Strategic Plans.--Not later than one year after \n     promulgation of the alternative performance goals in \n     subsection (b) of this section, the head of each agency \n     carrying out research and development activities, upon \n     updating or revising a strategic plan under subsection 306(b) \n     of title 5, United States Code, shall describe the current \n     and future use of methods for determining an acceptable level \n     of success as recommended by the study under subsection (a).\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n       (2) Program activity.--The term ``program activity'' has \n     the meaning given that term by section 1115(f)(6) of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (3) Independent merit-based evaluation.--The term \n     ``independent merit-based evaluation'' means review of the \n     scientific or technical quality of research or development, \n     conducted by experts who are chosen for their knowledge of \n     scientific and technical fields relevant to the evaluation \n     and who--\n       (A) in the case of the review of a program activity, do not \n     derive long-term support from the program activity; or\n       (B) in the case of the review of a project proposal, are \n     not seeking funds in competition with the proposal.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out the study required by \n     subsection (a) $600,000 for the 18-month period beginning \n     October 1, 2000.\n\n     SEC. 9.

Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has agreed \nto my amendment to restore funding for the United States Sentencing \nCommission. I am pleased that Senator Kennedy joined me as a cosponsor \nof this amendment in support of the Commission.\n  Our amendment to S. 1217 transfers $5 million from the Bureau of \nPrisons account to the U.S. Sentencing Commission account. As a result, \nthe Commission will be funded at $9,743,000 for FY 2000 instead of the \ncurrent level of only $4,743,000. This new funding is an increase of \n$300,000 compared to the Commission's FY 1999 appropriation of \n$9,487,000 but still substantially below the President's request of \n$10,800,000 for the Commission.\n  I understand the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Commerce, \nJustice, State Appropriations Subcommittee reduced funding for the \nCommission in part because of their frustration over the vacancy of all \nseven Commission members since October 31, 1998. I share that \nfrustration, but I am happy to report that the President announced last \nmonth his intent to nominate seven highly-qualified individuals to \nserve as Members of\n\n[[Page S9310]]\n\nthe Commission--Judge Diana E. Murphy, Judge Ruben Castillo, Judge \nSterling Johnson, Jr., Judge Joe Kendall, Professor Michael O'Neill, \nJudge William K. Sessions, III, and Mr. John R. Steer. I am proud to \nnote that Judge Sessions is a Vermonter and dear friend.\n  The Senate should act promptly to consider and confirm the nominees \nto the U.S. Sentencing Commission. This Commission has been struggling \nwithout a full slate of commissioners for more than a year. We should \nnot only put the Sentencing Commission back into business but we should \nrestore full funding so the Commission is able to fulfill its statutory \nmandate.\n  The Commerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill had significantly \ncut funding for the U.S. Sentencing Commission. In reducing funding for \nthis important commission, the Appropriations Subcommittee stated in \nits report that ``the carriage of justice has continued unabated in the \nabsence of commissioners.'' However, that is in direct contradiction to \nwhat the Chief Justice of the United States recently stated in his \nyear-end report for the federal judiciary. He stated, ``the fact that \nno appointments have been made to fill any one of these seven vacancies \nis paralyzing a critical component of the federal criminal justice \nsystem.''\n  The Sentencing Commission is such a critical component of the federal \ncriminal justice system because it establishes and maintains mandatory \nsentencing guidelines for over 51,000 criminal cases sentenced in the \nfederal courts each year. The Commission's most critical responsibility \ntoday is to adjust the guidelines to implement the important crime \nlegislation we enact every year. Let me emphasize this point: when we \nenact legislation that calls for increased criminal penalties, it is \nthe Commission's job to make sure that convicted defendants suffer the \nimpact. With no Commissioners since last year, the Commission has been \nunable to do this job, nor will it next year without new Commissioners \nand sufficient funding.\n  Let me give you a few examples of increased penalties we enacted \nthat, to this day, have not caused even one convicted defendant to stay \nin jail even one more day. Last year, in the Protection of Children \nfrom Sexual Predators Act, we required increased penalties for heinous \nsex abuse against our nation's young. To date, not one sexual predator \nhas been imprisoned for even one day longer. Why? Because the \nCommission cannot do its job. Nor will it next year without new \ncommissioners and sufficient funding.\n  Last year, we also passed legislation that required increased \npenalties for fraudulent telemarketers who prey upon another vulnerable \nsegment of our population, the elderly. Although the outgoing \nCommission did enact some temporary measures, they are scheduled to \nexpire this Fall. If they do, fraudulent telemarketers, once again, \nwill escape the intended consequences of our legislation. Why? Because \nthe Commission cannot do its job. Nor will it next year without new \nCommissioners and sufficient funding.\n  Last Congress, we also passed legislation that required increased \npenalties for copyright and trademark offenses to protect affected \nindustries from the rampant piracy that threatens job creation and \ncontinued economic growth. Once again, not one convicted offender has \nsuffered any increased punishment. Why? Because the Commission cannot \ndo its job. Nor will it next year without new Commissioners and \nsufficient funding.\n  So long as the Commission cannot do its job, convicted defendants \nwill also escape the impact of criminal laws we have enacted to combat \nother serious crimes: methamphetamine trafficking, firearms, phone \ncloning, and identity theft, just to name a few.\n  Recently, the Senate approved the juvenile justice legislation, S. \n254, that would require the Sentencing Commission to develop \ncomprehensive guidelines for juvenile offenders, so that we can stem \nthe rising tide of juvenile crime. How can the Commission accomplish \nthis vital and historic undertaking without Commissioners and \nsufficient funding?\n  We face other unintended, and potentially very costly, consequences \nof not getting the Commission fully operational soon. I understand that \ndefendants across the country are beginning to mount challenges to the \nlegality of the guidelines in the absence of Commissioners. Regardless \nof the merits, one can only imagine the paralyzing effects on the \ncriminal justice system if 51,000 defendants start raising this issue. \nThere are better ways to spend limited judicial and prosecutorial \nresources in fighting crime and enforcing the law than in defending \nagainst these claims.\n  Even in the absence of Commissioners, we should ensure that the \nCommission is fully funded so that the staff of the Commission may \ncontinue to perform its important work. The Commission has an ongoing \nstatutory obligation to amend the sentencing guidelines as necessary to \nrespond to enacted crime legislation, court decisions, and other \ndevelopments coming to its attention. While the Commission cannot vote \nto promulgate amendments to the guidelines without commissioners, even \nin their absence it is essential that Commission staff systematically \ncontinue to prepare all supporting material necessary so that incoming \ncommissioners may act to implement the will of Congress in short order.\n  Apart from the policy decision-making that only Commissioners may \nperform, the Commission has numerous routine statutory obligations on \nwhich Commission staff typically take the lead even when there is a \ncomplete slate of Commissioners. The Commission has an ongoing \nstatutory obligation to receive--and federal judges have a \ncorresponding statutory obligation to send--a report from the \nsentencing court with respect to every sentence imposed under the \nguidelines, to analyze and share the data in those reports, and use \nthat data to improve the guideline system. Commission staff analyze and \nenter into our comprehensive database over 50,000 of such cases and \nextract more than 260 pieces of information from each case annually. \nNext year, more than 50,000 cases that contain valuable information \nregarding sentencing practices, offenders, and deterrence will go \nwithout analysis if the Commission is not sufficiently funded for \nfiscal year 2000.\n  The Commission also has an ongoing statutory obligation to serve as \nthe lead instrumentality for training newly appointed judges and \nprobation officers, as well as prosecuting and defense attorneys, \nregarding application of the sentencing guidelines and related \nsentencing issues. Similarly, the Commission has an ongoing \nresponsibility to provide needed continuing education for all those who \nuse the sentencing guidelines to ensure that they are sufficiently \ninformed of recent amendments to the guidelines and significant court \ndecisions. Commission staff served as lead trainers to more than 2,500 \nindividuals at 47 training programs across the country in fiscal year \n1998. Next year, this need for training will go unmet if the Commission \nis not sufficiently funded for fiscal year 2000.\n  The Commission also has an ongoing statutory obligation to serve as a \nclearinghouse of information on sentencing-related topics and to stay \ncurrent on advancements in the knowledge of human behavior and the \ndegree to which the guidelines are achieving the purposes of sentencing \nsuch as deterrence and rehabilitation. Ongoing research on important \ntopics such as federal sentencing for crimes involving firearms, \nassociations between federal appellate decisions and offender race, \ntrends in sentences and offender characteristics in drug trafficking \ncases, and differing sentencing practices of federal immigration \noffenders by judicial district will not be completed if the Commission \nis not sufficiently funded for fiscal year 2000.\n  Finally, I would like to emphasize what the Chief Justice said. If we \nare going to have guidelines and require federal judges to impose \nguideline sentences, the Sentencing Commission must be empowered to do \nits work. And that means it needs both Commissioners and sufficient \nfunding to fulfill its critical role in the federal criminal justice \nsystem.\n  I appreciate the support of my colleagues to restore funding for the \nU.S. Sentencing Commission for the next fiscal year.\n\n[[Page S9311]]\n\n                           amendment no. 1352\n\n (Purpose: To modify the circumstances under which attorneys' fees in \n                Federal capital cases can be disclosed)\n\n       On page 73, between line 12 and 13, insert the following:\n       Sec. 306.--\n       (A) Section 3006A(d)(D)(vi) of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding after the word ``require'' the \n     following: ``, except that the amount of the fees shall not \n     be considered a reason justifying any limited disclosure \n     under 18 U.S.C.

PROTECTION OF SENIORS AND THE DISABLED IN FEDERAL \n                   FAMILY VIOLENCE PREVENTION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) of the estimated more than 1,000,000 persons age 65 and \n     over who are victims of family violence each year, at least \n     \\2/3\\ are women;\n       (2) national statistics are not available on the incidence \n     of domestic or family violence and sexual assault against \n     disabled women, although several studies indicate that abuse \n     of disabled women is of a longer duration compared to abuse \n     suffered by women who are not disabled;\n       (3) in almost 9 out of 10 incidents of domestic elder abuse \n     and neglect, the perpetrator is a family member, and adult \n     children of the victims are the largest category of \n     perpetrators and spouses are the second largest category of \n     perpetrators;\n       (4) the number of reports of elder abuse in the United \n     States increased by 150 percent between 1986 and 1996 and is \n     expected to continue increasing;\n       (5) it is estimated that at least 5 percent of the Nation's \n     elderly are victims of moderate to severe abuse and that the \n     rate for all forms of abuse may be as high as 10 percent;\n       (6) elder abuse is severely underreported, with 1 in 5 \n     cases being reported in 1980 and only 1 in 8 cases being \n     reported today;\n       (7) many older and disabled women fail to report abuse \n     because of shame or as a result of prior unsatisfactory \n     experiences with individual agencies or others who lack \n     sensitivity to the concerns or needs of older or disabled \n     individuals;\n       (8) many older or disabled individuals also fail to report \n     abuse because they are dependent on their abusers and fear \n     being abandoned or institutionalized;\n       (9) disabled women may fear reporting abuse because they \n     are fearful of losing their children in a custody case;\n       (10) public and professional awareness and identification \n     of violence against older or disabled Americans may be \n     difficult because these persons are not integrated into many \n     social networks (such as schools or jobs), and may become \n     isolated in their homes, which can increase the risk of \n     domestic abuse; and\n       (11) older and disabled Americans would greatly benefit \n     from policies that develop, strengthen, and implement \n     programs for the prevention of abuse, including neglect and \n     exploitation, and provide related assistance for victims.\n       (b) In General.--Part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime \n     Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended--\n       (1) in section 2001 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg)--\n       (A) in subsection (a)--\n       (i) by inserting ``, including older women and women with a \n     disability'' after ``combat violent crimes against women'';
