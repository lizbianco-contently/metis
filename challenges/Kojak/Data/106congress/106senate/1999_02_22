Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOhio, Mr. Voinovich, is recognized to read Washington's Farewell \nAddress.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n\nTo the people of the United States:\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence\n\n[[Page S1674]]\n\ninvite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and \nunnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \nprecarious.\n\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who in\n\n[[Page S1675]]\n\nany quarter may endeavor to weaken its hands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism.--But this leads at length to a more \nformal and permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of \nsome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by\n\n[[Page S1676]]\n\nforce of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be \nquenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a \nflame, lest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a \nsincere friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake \nthe foundation of the fabric?\n\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or justifications. \nIt leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the\n\n[[Page S1677]]\n\ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike for another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course--in order to give to trade a stable \ncourse, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the \ngovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best \nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \ntemporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as \nexperience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, \nthat it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from \nanother--that is must pay with a portion of its independence for \nwhatever it may accept under that character--that by such acceptance, \nit may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \nnominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not \ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate \nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which \nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\n\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO.

Mr. President, today I speak in memory of Raymond Scott \nBates, one of the dear members of our own Senate family who recently \ndeparted this life.\n\n     Let Fate do her worst, there are relics of joy,\n     Bright dreams of the past, which she cannot destroy;\n     Which come, in the night-time of sorrow and care,\n     And bring back the features that joy used to wear.\n     Long, long be my heart with such memories filled,\n     Like the vase in which roses have once been distilled,\n     You may break, you may shatter the vase, if you will,\n     But the scent of the roses will hang round it still.\n\n  These words, written by Thomas Moore, are so fitting this afternoon, \nas I, in my limited and feeble way, attempt to pay honor and tribute to \nthe life of Scott Bates, a man whom we all admired and respected, and \nwho was taken from our midst, virtually in the twinkle of an eye, and \nwithout warning.\n  It was on the evening of February 5 that the pallid messenger \nbeckoned Scott to depart this life. We can believe that he awakened to \nsee a more glorious sunrise with unimaginable splendor above a \ncelestial horizon, and that he yet remembers us as we remember him, for \nwe have the consolation that has come down to us from the lips of that \nancient man of Uz, whose name was Job, ``Oh that my words were written \nin a book and engraved with an iron pen, and lead in the rock forever, \nfor I know that my Redeemer liveth and that in the latter day He shall \nstand upon the earth.''\n  When Erma and I lost our dear grandson, Michael, now almost 17 years \nago, I felt that Michael was resting and at peace in the arms of God, \nand deep within my soul I was aware that Michael knew of my grief. He, \ntoo, was taken from us suddenly and without warning, and he left us \nwithout a wave of a hand or without saying goodbye, and so Erma and I \nknow what this family is going through. We, too, have walked through \nthe valley of the shadow of death. And Erma and I join in saying to \nScott's family today, Scott knows of your grief.\n  I have known Scott Bates since the very first day that he became a \nmember of the Senate family. I watched him grow. I watched him as he \nincreased in knowledge and in his love for the Senate. Often, when I \nwas the Democratic Leader in the Senate, and many times since, I had \nthe occasion to call upon Scott for help. He was always ready, always \ncourteous, always accommodating. From time to time, we talked about the \nSenate and how it was different from what it used to be. He was a \nSenate employee whose time in the Senate extended beyond the tenure of \nmany of the Members of this body, and, like many of the men and women \nwho have toiled here in the Senate over the years, Scott appreciated \nthe Senate, loved it, and understood it, better even than many of its \nown Members loved and understood it. His contributions to the Senate \nhave been many and notable.\n  Although public service in general and careers in Washington have, in \nsome quarters, fallen out of favor, I believe that Scott Bates' life \nand work experience present a compelling case against the current \ncynicism about the many fine people who serve in the Senate in various \ncapacities. Their names are never in the newspapers, they experience \nfew public kudos, and yet they work as long hours, probably longer, \nthan we do. They are dedicated, they are capable, they are patriotic \nindividuals who represent the best that America has to offer from all \nover this Nation.\n  Scott was one of those rare individuals about whom no unkind and \nungenerous word was ever, ever spoken by anyone who knew him.\n  He personified what we politicians like to refer to as ``family \nvalues.'' He lived them. He was active in his church, and he loved his \nwife, Ricki, and their three lovely children--Lisa, Lori, and Paul.\n  As all of us know, one of Scott's official duties as legislative \nclerk was to call the roll of the Senate during votes and during quorum \ncalls. Thousands of times--thousands of times, I have heard him call my \nname: ``Mr. Byrd''. Now the thread of life is cut; the immortal is \nseparated from the mortal; and that rich voice which was wont to fill \nthe walls of the Senate Chamber, is hushed in eternal silence. But \nwhile the portals of the tomb have closed upon the remains of a gifted \nmember of the Senate family, the grave is powerless to hold in its \nbosom the spirit of man.\n  In the words of William Jennings Bryan, ``if the Father stoops to \ngive to the rose bush, whose withered blossoms float upon the autumn \nbreeze, the sweet assurance of another springtime, will he refuse the \nwords of hope to the sons of men when the frosts of winter come? If \nmatter, mute and inanimate, though changed into a multitude of forms \ncan never be destroyed, will the imperial spirit of man suffer \nannihilation when it has paid a brief visit like a royal guest to this \ntenement of clay? No, I am sure that He who, notwithstanding His \napparent prodigality, created nothing without a purpose, and wasted not \na single atom in all His creation, has made provision for a future life \nin which man's universal longing for immortality will find its \nrealization. I am sure that we shall live again,'' as sure as I am that \nwe live today, and I am also sure that someday I shall hear the voice \nof a new angel, calling my name again, this time on the heavenly rolls: \n``Mr. Byrd.''\n  To Lisa, to Lori and to Paul, I think your father would have wanted \nme to say, live as he taught you to live and strive always to make him \nproud, because he knows.\n  On Saturday afternoon, we gathered in a church in Vienna. It was a \nlarge church, a Presbyterian Church. Our Senate Chaplain was there. He \nhad arranged the program, and he did a marvelous job. The Vice \nPresident came, the President of the Senate, the head of our Senate \nfamily. Senator Byron Dorgan was there. Senator Chuck Robb was there. \nSenator Gregg was there. Former Senator Robert Dole was there. And \nthere was a host of friends. The church was filled. The balcony was \nfilled. It was a great outpouring of generous tribute and love for \nScott Bates.\n  Although I had known Scott for 30 years, I had never known him as I \ncame to know him last Saturday afternoon when I heard Lisa and Lori and \nPaul speak of their father. Then and only then did I realize what a \ntruly great family this was. Only then did I realize what a father's \nlove could be for his two daughters and his son. And only then did I \nrealize what a deep and abiding and living love Scott's children had \nfor him. His wife Ricki was there. She had been brought in, and she lay \nthere\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\non a cot, she having not yet recovered from the injuries she sustained \nwhen the accident occurred.\n  It was evident that this was a family in which there was real love \nand in which the presence of God made itself manifest, because this was \nnot something that just came about overnight. I will never forget the \nsight of those children speaking about their father and their mother \nand then seeing them, after they had spoken to the audience, go to \ntheir mother and kiss her on the cheek. Scott must have been pleased \nwith it all.\n  I count it as a great honor to have been invited by Scott's family to \nspeak during that hour. To Lisa and Lori and Paul, I think your father \nwould want me to say to you, live as he taught you to live and strive \nalways to make him proud. He knows.\n  To his legion of friends, I say that Scott's life was a blessing, a \nblessing to each of us who knew him. May we strive to be like him that \nwe may be more worthy for, indeed, here was a man. When comes such \nanother?\n  To his wife Ricki, Erma and I say, the love of your children and your \nfriends and the mercies of an omnipotent God can, over the passage of \ntime, be an anodyne to your grief. Be assured, Ricki, love is timeless, \nlove is endless and Scott will be with you always.\n  And sometimes in the quietness of an evening or in the clear silence, \nas you gaze upon the lustre of the Morning Star, you may hear someone \nwhisper:\n\n     If I should ever leave you whom I love\n     To go along the silent way, grieve not\n     Nor speak of me with tears,\n     But laugh and talk of me\n     As if I were beside you, for who knows\n     But that I shall be, oftentime?\n\n     I'd come, I'd come, could I but find a way,\n     But would not tears and grief be barriers?\n\n     And when you hear a song I used to sing\n     Or see a bird I love,\n     Let not the thought of me be sad,\n     For I am loving you, just as I always have.\n\n     You were so good to me,\n     So many things I wanted still to do,\n     So many, many things to say to you.\n\n     Remember that I did not fear,\n     It was just leaving you, I could not bear to face;\n     We cannot see Beyond . . . But this I know:\n     I loved you so.\n     `Twas Heaven here with you.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me, on behalf of the entire Senate, \nthank the distinguished Senator, Mr. Byrd, for those wonderful words. I \nattended the memorial service for Scott Bates on Saturday and heard \nSenator Byrd deliver those reflections. And I guess there is no one in \nthe Senate who could have done what Senator Byrd regularly does in \nexpressing the collective will of the Senate.\n  With the passing of Scott, we lost a wonderful member of the Senate \nfamily. And Senator Byrd, not just on this occasion but on virtually \nall occasions like this, reaches out and touches others in a very \nspecial way.\n  I recall when my daughter died that Senator Byrd reached out to me \nand offered me a piece of prose that still sits in my top desk drawer. \nSenator Hatch sent me a white leather-bound Bible that still rests \nbehind my desk for reference. That is what the Senate is like. It is \nnot so much about Republicans and Democrats; it is about people who \nwork together, who have a passionate interest in serving this country.\n  And it is not just those who are elected who have that passionate \ninterest. There are a myriad of wonderful, qualified, committed, \ndedicated staff persons who work in this building who make this \ndemocracy of ours work. And losing Scott Bates was a tragic loss for \nall of us.\n  Frankly, I did not know Scott particularly well. I knew him as a fun \nperson to banter and visit and joke with from time to time and knew his \nsonorous voice as he called the roll. And I knew him as a very special \nmember of the Senate family. But I believe on Saturday I got to know \nhim well through his family.\n  Senator Byrd described the memorial service. I would say, as just one \nvisitor to that memorial service, how wonderful it would be if all of \nus could leave such a family behind, as Scott did. His two daughters \nand the son who spoke at that memorial service are remarkable young \npeople who will contribute much to our country. That is the lasting \ntribute to Scott.\n  So let me again, on behalf of the entire Senate, thank Senator Byrd \nfor his presentation on Saturday. And, coincidentally, I had asked him \nthis morning if I could have a copy of his presentation. He said he \nwould be putting it in the Senate Record. Now all of the Senators will \nbe able to share, with him, the words that he offered on our behalf on \nSaturday.\n  Mr. President, I would like, by consent, to be able to be recognized \nto speak on a different subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised there are 35 minutes \nremaining on the Senator's side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1678-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1679-S1682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE SENATE PROCESS AND FEDERAL BUDGET SURPLUSES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think you can hear a collective sigh of \nrelief around the Capitol Building now that the impeachment trial--only \nthe second in the history of our country--is complete and we can turn \nour thoughts to other issues, turn our energies to other enterprises.\n  Most of us seek election to the U.S. Senate--whether it be from West \nVirginia or North Dakota or Arizona--because we feel passionately about \npublic issues. And there are many, many public issues--both here at \nhome and around the world--that should and will command our attention.\n  Recently I told my colleagues a short story about Teddy Roosevelt. I \nwant to talk today about a couple of issues, and it is probably \nappropriate to start with Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt lost both \nhis wife and his mother on the same day in different rooms of his home. \nAnd he was so stricken with grief that he decided to do something \ndifferent with his life. He decided to go west for some while and see \nif he could find himself again.\n  Teddy Roosevelt had some resources, so when he made his decision to \ngo west, he decided to go to the Badlands of North Dakota. He knew that \nin the Badlands there were cowboys, and so, I am told, he went to \nBrooks Brothers and ordered a cowboy suit to be made for him. And \nBrooks Brothers made a cowboy suit for Teddy Roosevelt. He got a bowie \nknife, a sterling silver bowie knife with an ivory handle, I \nunderstand, that had his name on it, and it said ``Tiffany's.'' He \nbought it at Tiffany's. And he got silver spurs, and on the rowel of \neach spur were engraved his initials.\n  So when the train stopped in North Dakota for Teddy Roosevelt to \ndisembark, to go to live in the Badlands and raise horses and cattle, \nthis fellow stepped off the train wearing his Brooks Brothers cowboy \nsuit and a pair of rimless glasses, with his bowie knife from \n``Tiffany's,'' and his sterling silver engraved spurs.\n  The cowboys in the Badlands thought, ``What on Earth has landed here \nin Medora, ND''--this man they called four-eyes, with his rimless \nglasses and his funny Brooks Brothers cowboy suit and his sterling \nsilver spurs. They made fun of him, poked fun at the way he looked. And \nthen, as the story goes, in the Badlands saloon in Medora, ND, one \nunlucky cowboy goaded him too far and wanted to pick a fight with him.\n  It took only a matter of minutes, apparently, for this rather unusual \nlooking character from the East, with his Brooks Brothers cowboy suit, \nto knock this local cowboy senseless in the Badlands saloon. Then the \nrest of the cowboys had a different impression of this fellow. Yes, he \nlooked a little different, but he had some real mettle. They knew a \nlittle something about him. And Teddy Roosevelt, of course, went on to \ncarve a rather rich chapter of his life ranching in the Badlands of \nNorth Dakota.\n  I told my colleagues that story some while ago because we are all \nkind of different. We gather here in the U.S. Senate, 100 of us, coming \nfrom different parts of the country with different philosophies. We \neven dress differently from time to time. And so we come to this place, \nthis place of debate in our democracy, from all kinds of different \nperspectives. But we respect each other. We do not make fun of each \nother. We know that each arrives here with a passion and a mission on \nbehalf of those who sent us here to do the best we can for this \ncountry.\n  We do not settle our disputes with saloon fights. We do it through \ndebate.\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\n We respect the other person's view. We might disagree with it in a \nvery aggressive way, but we respect each other. And through the process \nof public debate, the give and take, the process of democracy works.\n  Now we turn our attention from an impeachment trial, which I think \nwas difficult for every single Member of this Senate and for the \ncountry, to other issues--health care, a Patients' Bill of Rights; \neducation and how we improve our schools; what we do to strengthen \nSocial Security and Medicare; and more.\n\n  There are two enduring truths about the last quarter century for \neveryone who serves in the Senate. One is that we have experienced a \ncold war that consumed a substantial amount of our energy, time, and \nresources; the second is that we have had crippling Federal budget \ndeficits. Both of those enduring truths have now changed. The cold war \nis over and the Federal deficits are no more. The Soviet Union is gone, \nthe cold war is over. That changes a great deal of our international \nissues and attention. The crippling Federal budget deficits that used \nto grow year after year are gone and we now see predictions and \nprojections that year after year we will experience Federal budget \nsurpluses.\n  Since those two enduring truths have changed, I want to focus on one \naspect of them today, and that is the reason I came to the Senate \nfloor. We have people who now say that because the Federal budget \ndeficits are going to turn into Federal budget surpluses, let us very \nquickly propose returning $500 or $600 billion in tax cuts to the \nAmerican people over the next 10 years.\n  I want to talk about the merit of that. It would be a tragic mistake, \nin my judgment, for this Congress to decide that--at the first sight of \nbudget surpluses, after a long, dark period of mushrooming Federal \nbudget deficits that have accumulated to a $5.5 trillion Federal debt--\nwe should try to outbid each other on who can return more tax money to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  I think the greatest gift that we could give to America's children \nwould be to decide that when we turn the corner and experience real \nbudget surpluses, we begin during good times to reduce the Federal \ndebt. There can be no greater gift to America's children than for us, \nduring good economic times, to begin reducing the crushing Federal \ndebt. That debt, as I said, stands at $5.5 trillion.\n  I have a chart that shows what kind of surpluses we are expected to \nexperience over the next 10 years, recognizing of course that none of \nus can know with certainty what will happen next week, next month, or \nnext year. The budget surplus, which is the top line of this chart--and \nthese figures came from the Congressional Budget Office--amounts to \nmore than $2.5 trillion over 10 years. That doesn't mean very much to \nme because that is not a real surplus. It is a surplus that is made \npossible by the use of the Social Security trust funds which, in my \njudgment, cannot be used to calculate a budget surplus. The second line \nof the chart calculates what happens to our surplus if you take the \nSocial Security trust funds and set it aside--which ought to be done--\nfor the purpose of saving it for the time when it is needed as the baby \nboomers will retire. The real surplus, then, begins in the year 2001.\n  In 1993, when President Clinton took office, he inherited a budget \ndeficit that year of about $300 billion. That has turned around \ndramatically. We have in this country experienced wonderful news with \nan improving economic outlook in this country. So we have gone from \nabout a $300 billion deficit to a $7 billion deficit in the upcoming \nfiscal year--almost a balanced budget. The next year the budget will be \nin balance, even without counting Social Security trust funds, and that \nis the prediction for every year thereafter for the following eight \nyears.\n  The question is, What do we do as a result of that? We have people \nrushing through the door saying, let me propose a $650 billion income \ntax cut. Some say a 10-percent across-the-board income tax cut. Aside \nfrom the merits on that issue, I happen to think that the crushing tax \nburden is not the income tax, but the increasing payroll taxes that \nAmerican workers have had to pay. Most working families in this country \npay more in payroll taxes than they pay in Federal income taxes.\n  My point is this: As we begin to construct a new fiscal policy rooted \nwith the understanding that we no longer face crippling budget \ndeficits, let us start to think about our priorities. The easy politics \nwould be to say, let's just give a lot of tax cuts, let's talk about \nacross-the-board tax cuts. But a much more responsible approach, in my \njudgment, would be to say during good economic times it is required for \nus to begin the long process of reducing the Federal debt. Now, if that \nis a priority--and I hope it will be for the majority of the Members of \nthe Senate, reducing America's debt during good economic times--that \nshould be, in my judgment, complemented by our understanding that the \nSocial Security system also needs shoring up. We must reserve some of \nour projected surplus to make that system whole and well and solvent \nfor the long term.\n\n  I want to make a point about Social Security because some people \nwring their hands and gnash their teeth because of the problems we have \nwith Social Security. These are not big problems. The Social Security \nproblem--to the extent there is one--is born of success. One hundred \nyears ago, you were expected to live to age 48 in this country; today, \nthe life expectancy is almost 78. We have increased life expectancy by \n30 years. People live longer and better lives for a lot of reasons. \nThat is success. Does that cause some strain to the Social Security \nsystem? Of course it does, but it is born of success. And let us not \nwring our hands about that. We can easily resolve these issues.\n  Third, in addition to reducing the Federal debt during good economic \ntimes with this budget surplus and making certain that we are \nresponsible for making Social Security solvent for the long term, the \nproposal that the President and some others have offered, to use any \nadditional tax cuts outside of that for the purpose of providing \nincentive for savings, makes a lot of sense to me. Encouraging personal \nprivate savings in this country, which the President proposed through \nUSA accounts--and there are other approaches--seems to me to make a lot \nof sense in terms of creating the foundation for long-term, solid \neconomic growth for the next two, three and four decades.\n  Having said all that, let me make this point: We in this country have \nthe strongest economy in the world right now. I studied economics in \ncollege and then I taught economics in college very briefly. That \nexperience hasn't hindered me, but nonetheless I taught some economics. \nOne of the things you teach in economics is that there are two \nprinciples you strive to achieve in an economy--stable prices and full \nemployment.\n  In our country's current economy, we have virtually no inflation and \nwe have nearly full employment. And we--at a time when the Asian \neconomy is weak, when the Russian economy has collapsed, when the \nBrazilian economy is weak--have the strongest economy in the world. Is \nit by accident? I don't think so. I don't happen to think that \nRepublicans or Democrats have the answer either. It is not as if, \nsomewhere down in the engine room of this ship of state, there is an \nengine with dials and knobs and a lever, and if we can just find the \nright dials and knobs and levers to pull and push, the right amount of \ntax cuts, the right amount of spending, the right amount of M1, that \nsomehow the ship of state will do fine. I don't happen to think the \nengine room works that way.\n  Economies have everything to do with the confidence of the people. \nWhen people are confident about the future, they make individual \ndecisions such as: I will buy a car; I will buy a house; I will make \nthis investment because I am confident about the future. They make \nthose kinds of decisions based on their confidence. That creates the \nfoundation for an economy.\n  When people are not confident about the future, they say, I will not \nmake that purchase; I will defer buying an automobile; I will defer \nbuying this home because I am not so confident about the future.\n  So it is the confidence of the people upon which this economy rests. \nAll of the indices show the American people are confident about the \nfuture because the President and the Congress together--I am talking \nabout all Members of the Congress coming together--\n\n[[Page S1681]]\n\nhave made some good decisions in recent years, decisions that say \ndeficits matter, and we are going to tame them.\n  That isn't to say that we shouldn't continue to invest--even as we \ntame the Federal budget deficits. We are going to invest in the kinds \nof things that will make this a bigger, better, stronger country. We \nhad, as the Senator from West Virginia will recall, a vigorous debate \nin the last Congress about a highway bill. Some around here were just \nwringing their hands about the amount of money we were going to spend \non highways.\n  The money that we are going to spend on highways, coming from the \ngasoline tax collected at the gas pump when people fill up their cars \nwith gasoline, is going to go into improving America's infrastructure--\nbuilding roads, repairing bridges, and generally making us a better \ncountry. It is an investment in our country, just as it is an \ninvestment in young people to improve schools. It is an investment in \nour future. Ben Franklin once said, ``Anyone who puts their purse in \ntheir head will never lose their purse.'' That is what education is \nabout. Education is an investment in our children.\n  We have made a lot of thoughtful decisions in the last 6 or 8 years; \nfrankly, it can go well beyond that. We can go back to the 1950s when \nwe talk about roads and think of the decision that President Eisenhower \nand the Republicans and Democrats in Congress made about an interstate \nhighway system. You could ask yourself, could anybody in this country \njustify building a four-lane interstate between Fargo, ND, and Beach, \nND, all those hundreds of miles where there aren't a great deal of \npeople? You could have had one of the watchdog organizations pull that \napart in the fifties and say, ``Look what they are spending where not \nmany people are living.'' But President Eisenhower and Congress said \nthat we are going to link this country together with the interstate \nhighway system. Transportation is universal.\n  We have done a lot of good things, and a lot is left to be done. As \nwe deal with fiscal policy and especially with the question of tax cuts \nand budget surpluses, I hope we can make thoughtful and good decisions \nfor the long-term future of this country. I think very strongly that \nthe first priority is for us, during good economic times, to reduce the \nFederal debt. The second priority is to say we owe it to the Social \nSecurity system to make it whole. The third priority says let's \nencourage private savings through tax cuts because that strengthens \nAmerica in the future as well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \ncomments. They are timely and they are very persuasive to me. I join \nwith him in expressing hope that we will apply these surpluses to \nreducing the national debt--after, of course, shoring up Social \nSecurity. And we have to think of Medicare, also.\n  I have been in politics now 53 years. The easiest vote that I ever \ncast was a vote to cut taxes. It didn't require any courage on my part. \nAnd likewise, one of the most difficult votes is a vote to increase \ntaxes. We have to do that from time to time.\n  Now, if Congress passes legislation to provide for tax cuts --and \nthere may be some areas of tax cuts that I can very well support--but \ngenerally speaking, if we do, of course, the legislation that Congress \nenacts to do that would be permanent legislation, will it not, until \nchanged? So if after a while--not 10 years hence, as the distinguished \nSenator has shown on his graph, but 5 years hence, or 4 years hence, 3 \nyears hence--we hit upon hard times, then what? Would the reduced taxes \ncontinue, unless Congress legislated to increase them again? Would \nthey, may I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The answer, I say, to that is once you change the Tax \nCode, that change is generally permanent unless altered. We have had \nthe experience before of a very aggressive appetite to reduce taxes, \nonly to discover that we run into a recession, experience very \nsignificant Federal budget deficits, and then the confidence of the \npeople about the future tends to erode and you have a further economic \ncontraction.\n\n  I say to the Senator from West Virginia, one of the things that I \nthink is very important is to the extent that there would be tax cuts \nfollowing a reduction in Federal debt and shoring up Social Security, I \nhope that it will be triggered by the actual experience of the surplus. \nIf you don't have a mechanism to trigger the tax cuts, what will happen \nultimately will be an economic slowdown--nobody has repealed the \nbusiness cycle--and experience significant budget deficits.\n  Mr. BYRD. Then it would be incumbent upon us to make difficult \ndecisions and act to increase the revenue again.\n  Well, I join with the Senator. I think he performs a great service in \ncalling to our attention and to the attention of the American people \nthe options we face. I hope that Congress will think long and carefully \nabout what we do. We are in a happy situation, but who knows how long \nthe situation will remain happy. I see Alan Greenspan down in that \nengine room, and he is entitled to a good many compliments from all of \nus for the good work that he has done, the vision that he has \ndisplayed. But I join with the Senator and I hope he will help to lead \nus as we move forward in the coming days and use his good economics. I \nthink I had about one semester of economics when I was in high school, \nand that is about it. But the Senator from North Dakota has had \nexcellent training, a fine education in that field. I am going to \ncontinue to listen to him and look to him for leadership as we go \nforward. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I \nraise this issue today only because it will be one of perhaps five or \nsix significant issues we will debate in the coming months. I do not \nthink that my idea is exclusively good and that there are no other good \nideas out there. I have great respect for others here who might \ndisagree strongly with my view on these issues. I want to, as we begin \nthis debate, at least stake out the ground that some of us would feel \nstrongly about--debt reduction and other responsible actions in fiscal \npolicy.\n  I look forward to this. This has been a tough 6 or 7 weeks as we have \nstarted this session because of the impeachment trial. Most of us come \nhere relishing the idea and fostering the appetite for debate about the \npublic issues that really matter to this country in economics, health \ncare, and education. So I look forward to it in the coming days and \nweeks.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I don't want to prolong this, but would he respond to this \nquestion: How do our massive trade deficits play into this whole \nequation?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, as the Senator knows, I have felt very strongly \nabout our trade deficits. The one area of our economic performance that \nis very troubling is the area of trade indebtedness that continues now \nto mushroom. In fact, just in the last week, we saw an announcement \nthat we have experienced the largest trade deficit in the country's \nhistory. I am particularly concerned about our merchandise deficits, \nbecause that reflects the deficits in terms of the goods that you \nproduce, not services and because it is an indicator of the health of \nthe manufacturing economy.\n  I don't think you can remain a world economic power unless you have a \nvibrant, strong manufacturing sector. I am very concerned about the \ntrade deficits, and I have spent a great deal of time talking to our \nTrade Ambassador and this administration.\n  I think our trade policies need adjustment. It is not that I don't \nbelieve we shouldn't have expanded trade around the world; of course we \nshould. But this country needs to stand up for its own economic \ninterests in a thoughtful and useful way. We need to stand up for our \ninterests with respect to the Chinese, the Japanese, the Europeans, and \nothers to say that our market is open to your goods, it is wide open, \nbut only on the condition that trade between our country and yours is \nfair.\n  During the first 25 years after the Second World War, we could have \nforeign policy masquerading as trade policy, or the reverse, and we \ncould beat anybody on the globe in international trade with one hand \ntied behind our\n\n[[Page S1682]]\n\nback. But that has changed. We face formidable competitors in \ninternational trade. And the corporations who do the business around \nthis world now separate themselves from nationalist interests, and they \nare simply interested in finding out where they can produce the \ncheapest and where they can sell for the best price. Often that \nmismatch means you can produce more cheaply if you find a Third World \ncountry in which you can produce and dump chemicals into the streams, \npollutants into the air, and pay kids 14 cents an hour. You don't have \nall of the encumbrances you have producing in an industrialized \ncountry. You can produce whatever it is you are producing and ship it \nto Chicago, Pittsburgh, Charleston or Fargo.\n  The dilemma of all of that is the bifurcation of production and the \nmeans to purchase, which creates this trade deficit between countries. \nThe trade deficit is a very serious economic problem. It is one of the \nfew blemishes that exists on this complexion of good economic news. And \nwe must begin to address it. I know that most people want to ignore it. \nThey don't want to talk about it.\n  Interestingly enough, some of the economists in this town have always \nsaid that NAFTA and free trade are good. They said, ``You know, our \ntrade deficit is just a function of fiscal policy deficits. You won't \nhave a trade deficit if you ever get the budget balanced.'' Guess what \nhas happened? We have gotten the deficit under control and our trade \ndeficits are still mushrooming. I really should, as a public service, \nrewrite the textbook, because the answers are now apparently wrong. In \nfact, we should get their names--some of the best economists in time \nwho have said that--and I should get their quotes and bring them to the \nfloor.\n  So those are the things that we need to have a thoughtful discussion \nabout.\n  I appreciate the Senator from West Virginia raising the issue. He and \nI coauthored a piece of legislation, which is now law, that created a \ntrade deficit review commission. It is my hope that the commission will \nsoon begin meeting and sift through all of these policy areas and \nhopefully make recommendations to Congress in an expeditious way to \nallow us to get some new ideas and some new energy and new perspectives \non this very critical issue. The commitment of the Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, to passing that trade deficit review commission \nlegislation--which is, as I said, now law--is very important and very \nhelpful to this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator for responding to \nmy questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1679-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1682-S1683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNFINISHED IMPEACHMENT BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I hadn't intended to speak today, but given \nthe fact that we have a little bit of time, I thought I would share one \nof the things that is on my mind as we come back to work following the \nPresidents' Day recess and almost a month of impeachment proceedings, \nwhich is what we were doing the last time I sat at this desk a week \nago.\n  There is one bit of unfinished business relating to the impeachment \nproceedings. Because the President was not removed from office, a lot \nof my constituents, over the course of this last week--people I visited \nwith throughout the State of Arizona during the Presidents' Day \nrecess--wondered what would happen, what would the precedent be, what \nwould the standard be in court proceedings? What was the lesson, in \nother words, to be learned from the fact that the President was not \nremoved?\n  I had to stop and think about what I was answering them with. I said: \nWe should not take from that the fact that you can lie or that you can \nobstruct justice, that you can engage in conduct that is designed to \nsubvert justice, to take the law into your own hands. That would be the \nwrong lesson. I spoke to schoolkids. One of the questions that kept \nrecurring was: If the President is not punished, then won't that lower \nthe standard for the rest of the country in the future?\n  My response, I think, is that we have to go back to what Henry Hyde \nwas talking about when he first appeared before the Senate at the \nbeginning of the impeachment trial, and that we need to talk to the \nAmerican people about this as a piece of unfinished business. The \nSenate trial has come to a conclusion; the President will remain in \noffice; the impeachment proceeding is behind us. And that is all as it \nshould be. But it seems to me that because there is a perception that \nthe President was not punished--I will come back to that in just a \nmoment--that, therefore, somehow there will be a different standard \napplied in the future, perhaps in sexual harassment or sexual \ndiscrimination cases specifically, but more broadly within the criminal \njustice system.\n  I think the piece of unfinished business is for all of us to commit \nourselves to the proposition that the rule of law will not be \ndiminished in the United States, that not only the lawyers and the \njudges in the judicial process but also all Americans, parents and \nteachers, talking to our children, and all of us working within \nwhatever part of society we work, will recommit ourselves to the rule \nof law in the United States and ensure that this case does not create a \nbad precedent; that we treat this case, rather, as an aberration, as \nthe exception that proves the rule, as a situation which is unique \nbecause it involved one person, the President, and an impeachment \nproceeding which is unique under our Constitution; but that we not \naccept it as a precedent that you can, as I said, take the law into \nyour own hands, subvert justice, and then get away with it.\n  In one sense, President Clinton has not really gotten away with his \nbad conduct. He was impeached by the House of Representatives, he was \ntried in the Senate, and half of the Senate voted on one of the \narticles to remove him from office. History will certainly judge that \nhis reputation has been diminished as a result of his conduct. And for \na person in political life, a President in particular, that is \ncertainly some degree of punishment. In addition to that, the trust of \nhis office has been diminished and he clearly has suffered some public \nopprobrium as a result of his conduct.\n  Therefore, I think what we have to do is tell young people that, even \nthough his conduct was not perceived by two-thirds of the Senate as \nsufficiently serious to warrant his removal from office, it does not \nmean that he wasn't punished. So, in that sense, the lesson to be \nlearned is there will be bad consequences from bad action but they may \nnot be the most severe consequences that can attach to the action.\n  In one of the schools I spoke to, I said, ``You have a yearbook here, \ndon't you?'' And they said, ``Yes.''\n  And I said, ``Suppose you did something pretty bad, but it wasn't \nquite bad enough to be kicked out of school. But the yearbook has your \npicture on it and it says below it: This person lied and did something \nbad in class and everybody thought he should not be trusted anymore. \nBut it wasn't quite serious enough to kick him out of school.''\n  I said, ``That would be a pretty bad thing, for everybody who reads \nthat yearbook for 50 years later to see that written under your picture \nin the yearbook. But it's not quite bad enough to throw you out of \nschool.''\n  So, let's understand that what has happened to the President here is \nnot good, it is bad, because he did something wrong. I am sure that \npeople on both sides of the aisle will concede that his conduct was \ninappropriate. So in that sense he has been punished.\n  But in a larger sense, because he was not removed from office, there \nis still this perception hanging out there that perhaps the rule of law \nhas been diminished; that now it is no longer the case that one will be \nable to prosecute for perjury or obstruction of justice; that perhaps \nin a sexual harassment or discrimination case there will be some new \nprecedent established, the ``Clinton standard,'' that you can actually\n\n[[Page S1683]]\n\nwalk very close to the line of telling the whole truth, and if you \nchoose not to do it and you are clever enough about the way you phrase \nthings, maybe you will be able to escape punishment. Perhaps people who \nwere punished for perjury in sexual discrimination cases ought to be no \nlonger punished under those same circumstances.\n\n  That is what I am saying is our unfinished business. Every one of us \nwho has something to say about it should say: No, this case does not \nstand for that. This was the President of the United States whom the \nSenate chose not to remove from office, the most severe thing that \ncould occur to a President. And there were a lot of reasons for that. \nSome of our colleagues felt it would simply be too much of a disruption \nfor our country. Some thought that the particular activity in this case \nwas just not quite serious enough to warrant his removal.\n  Those of us who disagreed with that did so, among other reasons, \nbecause we believed that allowing the President to remain in office \nwould subvert the rule of law; that this would be used as an excuse for \npeople to lie in the future; that there would not be as much adherence \nto the precedents in the past, of ensuring that people who take the law \ninto their own hands are appropriately punished. That is one of the \nreasons that many of us voted guilty in this case.\n  But I think even though we did not prevail and the President was not \nremoved, that everyone in the Chamber would agree--all 100 of us would \nagree--that we do not want this case to stand for the proposition that \nyou can subvert justice by impeding discovery or by lying, by giving \nfalse testimony; that you cannot do those things and expect that the \nrule of law in the future will be any less severe with respect to its \nconsequences.\n  As I said, this case must be deemed the exception that proves the \nrule because of its unique circumstances. In every way that those of us \nwho are permitted to do so, we must uphold the rule of law in the \ncountry.\n  Specifically, that means we must teach this to our young people. We \nmust talk about it as lawmakers here, when we speak to the local Lions \nClub or local Rotary Club, wherever we may be speaking, that lawyers \nand judges in the country must strictly adhere to the law. Anyone who \nappears before a court as a litigant must themselves strictly adhere to \nthese principles and never violate the law as it exists. And anyone who \nteaches with respect to what this means should take the position that \nit does not mean that one can take the law into one's own hands and \nsucceed in subverting justice simply because of what did or did not \nhappen to the President of the United States in this particular case.\n  The rule of law is important to this country because it distinguishes \nus from almost every other country in the world. There are certainly \nother countries in which one can expect to get relatively fair justice, \nbut in the United States we consider ourselves unique. We have, for \nover 210 years, protected the rule of law in this country. We have \nensured that even the least among us can get equal justice under law. \nAnd this country has done a great deal to ensure that principle is \ntrue, whether it is in the Federal courts or the local courts of the \ncountry; whether it is with respect to the rich and the powerful and \nthe famous or, as I said, the least among us. In our system, the law \napplies equally to everyone.\n  We must ensure that remains the case. How many of us would want to \nsubmit our lives or our fortunes to the justice system--oh, let's just \ntake one of the many countries south of us, for example--in the \nsouthern hemisphere? Or in Russia today, where one cannot even engage \nin commerce because there is not a rule of law which ensures that \ndispute resolution in commercial dealings will be done fairly? How many \nof us would want to be accused of a crime in one of those societies and \nhave to defend ourselves or be sued in one of those societies and be \nassured that we would be dealt with in a fair way? In many of those \ncountries today, unless you have the ability to bribe someone or to pay \nsomeone off, you cannot be assured of fair justice.\n  In the United States today, even though we do not want to go to \ncourt, every one of us knows that if we have to go to court, we can at \nleast expect that we will be dealt with fairly because truth-telling is \nat the bottom of the judicial process and truth-telling will be \nenforced.\n  It will be maintained because it will be enforced, and we can point \nto many cases in which people who lied are now serving in jail because \nof their perjury.\n  That is why it is important to maintain the rule of law in our \ncountry. That is what the rule of law is all about. That is why it is \nimportant, and that is why we have to sustain it.\n  So, Mr. President, as I reflected on what my constituents were asking \nme, as I talked to them over the course of this last Presidents' Day \nrecess in Arizona, and I thought about the importance of the rule of \nlaw in the United States to each one of us, and the questions that had \nbeen raised as a result of the fact that the President was not removed \nfrom office, I dedicated myself to talking about this, to writing about \nit, and to ensuring my constituents back home and, hopefully, people \naround the country will understand how important it is for all of us \nover the next weeks, months, and years to ensure that the rule of law \nis not diminished, is not subverted as a result of the Senate's action \nwith respect to the impeachment of President Clinton.\n  One could draw that conclusion, but we must not permit that \nconclusion to be drawn. It is up to us to maintain the rule of law in \nthe United States, and I believe that because of the dedication to the \nprinciple of the rule of law and the fact that everyone in this country \nwishes it to remain strong, and the fact that all 100 of us in this \nChamber, I am certain, and the Members in the House of Representatives \nas well, are dedicated to that proposition and do not want to see the \nresult of this case diminish the rule of law; that all of us will \nrededicate ourselves to that principle and will do everything we can \nover the course, as I said, of the ensuing months and years to ensure \nthe rule of law in this country remains strong and we will continue to \nprovide in this country, as we have in the past over 200 years, equal \njustice for all.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, my distinguished colleague and ranking \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee desires to make a \nrequest.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Virginia.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Gary Leeling of the \nArmed Services Committee staff be permitted privileges of the floor \nduring debate on S. 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, it is the intention of the Senator from \nVirginia, in his capacity as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nto make an opening statement regarding this very important piece of \nlegislation. I shall be followed by my distinguished colleague, the \nranking member, and then we ask other Members, particularly those on \nthe committee, to join us in the Chamber such that we can, hopefully, \nthis afternoon in a very material and constructive way, begin the \nSenate's deliberation on this absolutely critical piece of legislation.\n  Today, the Senate begins consideration of S. 4, the Soldiers', \nSailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. The bill is \nan integral part of the national security element of the Republican \nagenda, I might say, Madam President, that Senator Lott and other \nleaders announced in the January 19 timeframe of this year.\n  Last fall, Senator Lott, in an excellent exchange of letters with the \nPresident and Republican chairmen, identified key problems with the \nmilitary pay levels and the military pay system. Following this \nexchange of letters, the Armed Services Committee held hearings on \nSeptember 29, 1998, and again on January 5, 1999, the first business \nthis year, in which General Shelton and the service chiefs described \nthe many problems--underline ``many''--military services are \nexperiencing because of the years of shortfalls in funding.\n  During these hearings, particular emphasis was put on readiness, the \nretention of highly trained people and the inability--very critical, \nMadam President--the inability today of the military services to \nachieve their recruiting goals; that is, the young men and young women \nin their very first step, often their first job, full-time job, they \nhave ever had. We have experienced here in the past year substantial \nshortfalls, and one of the many purposes of this bill is to try to \naddress that problem.\n  I say with a great sense of pride that the Joint Chiefs, individually \nand collectively, showed great courage in their presentations both last \nSeptember and again this January. They spoke candidly of the problems \nborne by the men and women in the military today and how increased \ndefense funding was needed in order to begin to alleviate these serious \nproblems. General Shelton and the service chiefs urged the President \nand the Congress to support a military pay raise that would begin to \naddress the inequities between military pay and civilian wages and to \nresolve the inequity of what is known as the Redux retirement system.\n  Senators Lott, McCain and Roberts took the initiative and showed \nleadership in developing early drafts of this legislation. These \nSenators worked within the Armed Services Committee to craft a bill \nthat would address the problems identified by the Joint Chiefs in a \ncomprehensive and responsible manner. When the Armed Services Committee \nreported this bill out on February 2, 1999, 18 of 20 members of that \ncommittee voted in favor of the bill. The two remaining members voted \npresent, and we will hear from them. I don't say that by way of \ncriticism. They have their own views. And one, of course, is my \ndistinguished friend and colleague, the ranking member.\n  S. 4 will provide military personnel a 4.8-percent pay raise on \nJanuary 1, 2000, and will require that future military pay raises be \nbased on the Annual Employment Costs Index plus one-half a percent. The \nbill restructures the military pay tables to recognize the value of \npromotions and to weight the pay raise toward mid-career, \nnoncommissioned officers and officers where retention is most critical. \nThe Joint Chiefs testified that there is a pay gap between military and \nprivate sector wages of approximately 14 percent. This bill moves \naggressively to close this gap and ensure military personnel are \ncompensated in an equitable manner.\n\n  The bill provides military personnel who entered the service after \nJuly 1, 1986, the option to revert to the previous military retirement \nsystem that provided a 50-percent multiplier to their base pay averaged \nover their highest 3 years, and includes cost of living adjustments or \nto accept in the alternative a $30,000 bonus and remain under the Redux \nretirement system.\n  The Joint Chiefs testified that the Redux retirement system is \nresponsible for an increasing number of mid-career military personnel \ndeciding to leave the service. S. 4 will offer these highly trained \npersonnel an attractive incentive to continue to serve a full career.\n  Now, Madam President, in total fairness on this, and to be very \ncandid, there are differences of opinion on the manner in which this \nbill approaches the retirement system, both the 50 percent and the \n$30,000 bonus. General Shelton, in particular, has counseled me on \nseveral occasions in a very friendly and forthright way, expressing \nsome of his concerns, and, indeed, he has written me on these points. \nSo we are going to have to consider very carefully in the course of our \nfloor deliberations here in the next few days exactly what those \nconcerns are and is this bill drafted correctly.\n  Now, to continue, we will establish a thrift savings plan that will \nallow service members to save up to 50 percent of their base pay before \ntaxes and will permit them to directly deposit their enlistment and \nreenlistment bonuses into their thrift savings plan.\n  In a separate section, the bill authorizes service Secretaries to \nmatch the thrift savings plan contributions of those service members \nserving in critical--and the operative word here is ``critical''--\nspecialties for a period of 6 years in return for a 6-year service \ncommitment--those specialties, primarily high-tech specialties, which \ntoday are, in the job market, among the strongest committed to young \npeople to come into the private sector. And the Department of Defense \nhas to have a compensation package so that we can fairly compete with \nthese offers from the private sector and to fairly treat those who have \ngone through this arduous period of technical training, to fairly treat \nthem in recognition of their abilities in this high-tech arena. This is \na powerful tool to assist the services in retaining key personnel in \nthe most critical specialties.\n  Senator McCain, on another part of this bill, was the key proponent \nof an initiative that would authorize a special subsistence allowance \nto assist the most needy junior military personnel who are eligible for \nfood stamps under other programs. This allowance would provide those \nfamilies an additional $180 a month and would reduce the number of \nmilitary families on the food stamp rolls.\n  Now, that is an important initiative likewise that will require a \ngood deal of deliberation on this floor because there are some concerns \nabout it in the Department of Defense. But I think it is a bold \ninitiative and we don't want, to the extent we can avoid it, to have \nthe young men and women of the Armed Forces having to rely on food \nstamps to support their families.\n  During the markup of S. 4 in the Armed Services Committee, we \nincorporated several provisions from S. 169, a bill introduced by \nSenator Cleland and cosponsored by the Democratic members of the \ncommittee. The committee agreed to include a series of provisions that \nwill enhance the current Montgomery GI bill benefit. These enhancements \nwill eliminate the $1,200 annual cost-share by service members, will \nincrease educational benefits payments, will permit monthly benefit \npayments to be paid in a lump sum at the beginning of a semester or \nschoolterm, and, finally, will at the discretion of the service \nSecretary permit the service member to transfer educational benefits to \nhis or her dependents. Now, Madam President, if the Senate will indulge \nme in just a personal recollection, I am privileged to stand here as a \nU.S. Senator from\n\n[[Page S1689]]\n\nVirginia I think solely as a consequence of my very modest active duty \nin the closing months of World War II, and then once again during the \nKorean service. That modest service of active duty enabled me to have \nthe GI bill, which gave me, first, my degree in general engineering, \nfollowed then, for service in the Korean conflict, by a degree in law. \nSo this Senator wants to support in every way the same opportunities \nthat were accorded to me, which enabled me to achieve the goals that I \nset for myself, for this next generation. So I salute Senator Cleland \nand I hope we can find a means to finance this very important \ninitiative by this extraordinary soldier, citizen, and now Senator from \nthe great State of Georgia.\n\n  I want to make it clear to my colleagues that enhancing Montgomery GI \nbill benefits is a matter before the committee and we have so notified \nthe committee. The Armed Services Committee included these legislative \nprovisions, which were recommended in the recent report of the \nCommission on Service Members and Veterans Transition Assistance, \nbecause these increased benefits will certainly be strong incentives \nfor continued military service. I am confident that Senator Specter \nand, indeed, Senator Rockefeller and others will bring to the attention \nof the Senate in these few days of deliberation their views on this \npart of my bill.\n  When the Armed Services Committee reported S. 4 to the Senate, the \nCBO cost estimate was not available. I have now received the estimate \nfor S. 4 from the Congressional Budget Office, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that this last estimate be made part of the Record, together \nwith an analysis made by our own staff which in many ways simplifies \nthe comprehensive report of this important piece of work.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 1999.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 4, the Soldiers', \n     Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Barry B. Anderson,\n                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n\ns. 4--soldiers', sailors', airmen's, and marines' bill of rights act of \n                                  1999\n\n       Summary: S. 4 would increase various elements of \n     compensation for current and former members of the armed \n     forces. Specifically, it would increase pay for military \n     personnel, provide a special allowance for low-income \n     members, increase retirement benefits for certain members, \n     increase educational benefits, and allow members on active \n     duty to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan.\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, enactment \n     of the bill would raise discretionary spending by about $1.1 \n     billion in 2000 and $13.8 billion over the 2000-2004 period. \n     In 2009, those costs would total about $6.5 billion. Because \n     the increase in retirement benefits would apply only to \n     members who entered the service after July 1986, annual costs \n     would continue to rise for a few years after 2009. Additional \n     benefits earned under the proposal between August 1, 1986, \n     and the effective date would add about $4.5 billion to the \n     unfunded liability of the military retirement trust fund.\n       Because the bill would affect direct spending and revenues, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. Increased educational \n     benefits and higher annuities for certain military retirees \n     would increase direct spending by about $765 million a year \n     over the 2000-2004 period. In 2009 direct spending costs \n     would total about $2.6 billion. The annual direct spending \n     costs for military retirement would eventually be about 11 \n     percent higher than spending under current law. Greater use \n     of education benefits under the bill would raise long-run \n     costs by about $3 billion a year. By allowing servicemembers \n     to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan, the bill would \n     lower revenues by $311 million over the 2000-2004 period and \n     about $141 million by 2009.\n       Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes from \n     the application of that act any legislative provisions that \n     are necessary for the national security. That exclusion might \n     apply to the provisions of this bill. In any case, the bill \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 4 is shown in Table 1, assuming that \n     the bill will be enacted by October 1, 1999.

The current law amounts for 2000-2009 assume that\n  appropriations remain at the 1999 Level. If they are adjusted for inflation, the base amounts would rise by about $2,500 million per year, but the\n  estimated changes would remain as shown.\n \nSources: Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n     Retirement benefits\n       S. 4 contains provisions that would allow current members \n     to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan and increase \n     retirement benefits for members who entered the service after \n     July 31, 1986, and are covered under the system known as \n     REDUX.\n       Background. The Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986 \n     (REDUX) governs the retirement of military personnel who \n     initially entered the armed forces after July 31, 1986. Under \n     REDUX a retiree's initial annuity ranges from 40 percent to \n     75 percent of the individual's highest three years of basic \n     pay. Retirees with 20 years of service will receive 40 \n     percent, and the fraction will grow with each additional year \n     of service and reach the maximum at 30 years of service. When \n     the retiree is 62 years old, the annuity is raised in most \n     cases to equal 2.5 percent of the average of the highest 36 \n     months of basic pay for each year of service up to maximum of \n     75 percent. Also, under REDUX cost-of-living adjustments \n     (COLAs) equal the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) \n     less 1 percentage point. However, when the retiree reaches \n     age 62 the annuity is raised to reflect all of the CPI growth \n     until that point, but thereafter annual COLAs continue to \n     equal the CPI less one percentage point.\n       Current law provides two different formulas for other \n     individuals who become eligible for nondisability retirement \n     benefit but are not covered by REDUX. Military personnel who \n     first became members of the armed forces before September 8, \n     1980, receive retired pay equal to a multiple of their \n     highest amount of basic pay; the multiple is 2.5 percent for \n     every year of service up to 75 percent. Retirees who first \n     became members of the armed forces between September 8, 1980, \n     and July 31, 1986, receive retired pay based on the average \n     of the highest 36 months of basic pay and the multiplier of \n     2.5 percent for each year of service. Annuities for both of \n     these groups are fully adjusted for changes in the CPI.\n       Repeal of REDUX/Optional Lump-Sum Bonus. Under section 201, \n     members who under current law would retire under REDUX would \n     face a choice upon reaching 15 years of service. They could \n     elect to receive a lump-sum bonus of $30,000 and retire under \n     the REDUX plan or they could forgo that payment and upon \n     retirement receive annuities under the plan in effect for \n     retirees who first became members of the armed forces between \n     September 8, 1980, and July 31, 1986. CBO estimates that \n     total costs to DoD under the provision would total about $674 \n     million in 2000 and average about $1.4 billion a year through \n     2009.\n       Accrual Costs. Prior to 2009 the primary budgetary impact \n     would stem from the payments that DoD would make to the \n     military retirement trust fund. The military retirement \n     system is financed in part by payments from appropriated \n     funds to the military retirement trust fund based on an \n     estimate of the system's accruing liabilities. Repealing \n     REDUX would increase payments from the military personnel \n     accounts to the military retirement fund (a DoD outlay in \n     budget function 050) to finance the increased liability to \n     the fund resulting from additional years of service under \n     a more generous system.\n       CBO estimates that the resulting increase in discretionary \n     spending from the accrual payments would average about $0.8 \n     billion by 2004 and about $1.0 billion over the next 10 \n     years. The costs to DoD would increase each year because not \n     all military personnel are covered by REDUX. Under current \n     law the percentage of the force covered by REDUX will grow \n     until everyone in the force will have entered military \n     service after July 31, 1986.\n       Accrual costs depend on many factors, including \n     endstrengths, projected years of service at the time of \n     retirement, grade structure or salary history, and projected \n     rates of military pay raises, inflation, and interest rates. \n     CBO's assumptions are consistent with the ones used recently \n     by DoD's actuaries. The estimates also assume that in the \n     long run annual pay raises are 4.0 percent, changes in the \n     CPI are 3.5 percent a year, and interest rates for the trust \n     fund's holdings of Treasury securities are 6.5 percent \n     annually. CBO's assumptions about how many individuals would \n     choose lump-sum payments instead of a higher retirement \n     annuity are explained in the following paragraph.\n       Lump-sum Payments. In addition, CBO estimates that DoD \n     would spend about $500 million a year for the lump-sum \n     payments, assuming that 50 percent of enlisted personnel and \n     about 40 percent of officers would elect to receive the lower \n     annuity in retirement. That estimate is based on DoD's \n     experience under two buy-out programs in recent years. The \n     Voluntary Separation Incentive (VSI) and the Special \n     Separation Benefit (SSB) were two programs that DoD used \n     extensively during the 1992-1996 period. VSI was a payment \n     over a period of years, and SSB was a lump-sum payment that \n     had a lower present value than VSI. About 86 percent of \n     enlisted personnel selected SSB, and about half of the \n     officers did. Because the present value of forgoing the \n     annuity reduction under REDUX is significantly greater than \n     $30,000 and because that difference tends to be greater than \n     the difference between VSI and SSB, CBO assumes that smaller \n     fractions of officers and enlisted personnel would opt for \n     the lump-sum payment than chose SSB. The members who would be \n     affected by this provision entered service in 1986; thus, \n     they would not be eligible for the lump-sum payment until \n     2001.\n       Direct Spending Under Section 201. Section 201 would also \n     increase direct spending from the military retirement trust \n     fund by $1 million in 2000 and by about $233 million over the \n     2000-2009 period. The outlay impact before 2006 is primarily \n     due to higher cost-of-living allowances for individuals who \n     receive a disability annuity. Starting in 2006 the impact is \n     almost all due to regular retirements. In the long run, \n     direct spending for military retirement would be about 11 \n     percent higher than under current law.\n       Thrift Savings Plan. Section 202 would allow members of the \n     uniformed services on active duty for a period of more than \n     30 days to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP). \n     Contributions would be capped at 5.0 percent of basic pay \n     plus any part of special or incentive pay that a member \n     receives. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the \n     revenue loss caused by deferred income tax payments would \n     total $10 million in 2000, $103 million in 2004, and about \n     $141 million by 2009.\n       Special Retention Initiative. Under section 203, the \n     Secretary of Defense could make additional contributions to \n     TSP for military personnel in designated occupational \n     specialties or as part of an agreement for an extended term \n     of service. CBO estimates that the discretionary costs from \n     the resulting agency contributions to TSP would total $2 \n     million in 2000 and would increase to $28 million by 2004, \n     based on DoD's use of similar authority to award bonuses for \n     enlistment or reenlistment.\n     Compensation of military personnel\n       S. 4 contains two sets of provisions that would affect \n     compensation for those currently serving in the military. One \n     would increase annual pay raises and change the table \n     governing pay according to grade and years of service. The \n     other would increase compensation to members who would \n     otherwise be eligible for food stamps.\n       Pay Increases. Sections 101 and 102 contain provisions that \n     would provide across-the-board and targeted pay raises. \n     Across-the-board pay raises would be a total of 4.8 percent \n     in 2000 and 0.5 percent above the Employment Cost Index (ECI) \n     in future years. Because those raises would be 0.5 percent \n     above the full ECI raise called for in current law, CBO \n     estimates that incremental cost would be about $197 million \n     in 2000 and average about $1.7 billion over the 2000-2009 \n     period. The estimate is based on current projections of \n     military strength levels and its distribution by pay grade.\n       Additional pay raises would be targeted at personnel in \n     specific grades and with certain years of service. The \n     changes to the military pay table would increase basic pay by \n     about $189 million in 2000 and an average of about $860 \n     million annually over the 2000-2009 period, based on the pay \n     schedule and pay raises specified in the bill as well as \n     current projections of military strength levels and its \n     distribution by pay grade.\n       Special Subsistence Allowance. Section 103 would create a \n     new allowance through 2004 for military personnel who qualify \n     for food stamps. Eligibility for the allowance would \n     terminate if the member no longer qualified for food stamps \n     due to promotions, pay increases, or transfer to a different \n     duty station. In addition, a member would not be eligible for \n     the allowance after receiving it for 12 consecutive months, \n     although they would be able to reapply. CBO estimates that \n     the allowance would increase personnel costs by roughly $13 \n     million in 2000 and $26 million annually through 2004, \n     based on information from DoD on the number of military \n     personnel who currently receive food stamps.\n       CBO estimates that most of the 11,000 personnel in grades \n     E-5 or below will remain on food stamps and apply for the \n     special subsistence allowance. However, the additional $180 \n     of monthly income would replace the average household's \n     monthly food stamp benefit by $54, resulting in savings of \n     about $7\n\n[[Page S1691]]\n\n     million each year in the Food Stamp program over the 2001-\n     2004 period. The special subsistence allowance might also \n     serve as an incentive for eligible but nonparticipating \n     military personnel to apply for food stamps. CBO estimated \n     that 1,500 additional service members who participate in the \n     Food Stamp program in an average month at an annual cost of \n     $2 million. Thus, this provision is estimated to result in a \n     net savings to the Food Stamp program of $3 million in 2000 \n     and $5 million each year over the 2001-2004 period.\n     Veterans' readjustment benefits\n       As shown in Table 3, the bill contains four provisions that \n     would raise direct spending for veterans' readjustment \n     benefits, specifically the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB).\n       Rates of Assistance. Section 301 would raise the rate of \n     educational assistance to certain veterans with service on \n     active duty. Participating veterans who served at least three \n     years on active duty would receive as much as $600 a month \n     instead of $528 a month as under current law. Similar \n     veterans with at least two years of active duty would be \n     eligible for a maximum benefit of $488 a month, an increase \n     of $59 dollars a month. Under section 301, the cost-of-living \n     allowance scheduled for 2000 would not occur. CBO estimates \n     that this provision would increase direct spending by over \n     $100 million a year over the next 10 years, based on current \n     rates of participation in this program.\n       Termination of Member Contributions. Section 302 would \n     eliminate the contribution that MGIB participants pay under \n     current law. Unless members elect not to participate in the \n     MGIB, current law requires a contribution of $1,200 toward \n     the program. Based on current rates of participation, which \n     is nearly universal, CBO estimates that this provision would \n     result in forgone receipts of about $195 million a year.\n       Accelerated Payments. Section 303 would permit veterans to \n     receive a lump-sum payment for benefits they would receive \n     monthly over the term of their training, for example, a \n     semester in college or the period of a course's instruction \n     for other forms of training. CBO estimates that this \n     provision would increase direct spending in 2000 by about \n     $134 million and by about $27 million in 2001. Increased \n     costs would occur initially as payments from one fiscal year \n     are made in the preceding year. There would be no net effect \n     in subsequent years because in a given year payments shifted \n     to the preceding year would be offset by payments shifted \n     from the following year. CBO estimates that about 50 \n     percent of MGIB beneficiaries would elect to receive an \n     accelerated payment in 2000 and that a total of 60 percent \n     would make that election in 2001 and later years. The \n     estimate is also based on current rates of participation \n     in this program.\n\n    TABLE 3.--ESTIMATED COSTS OF PROVISIONS AFFECTING VETERANS' READJUSTMENT BENEFITS IN S. 4, AS REPORTED BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES\n                                                    [Outlays by fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 Category                     1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008      2009\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                     DIRECT SPENDING\n \nSpending Under Current Law for Veterans'       1,374     1,366     1,372     1,385     1,397     1,400     1,405     1,411     1,424     1,446     1,472\n Readjustment Benefits....................\n                                           =============================================================================================================\nProposed Changes:\n    Rates of Assistance...................         0        98       100       101       103       104       105       106       108       110       113\n    Member Contributions..................         0       197       195       195       195       195       195       195       195       195       195\n    Accelerated Payments..................         0       134        27         0         0         0         0         0         0         0         0\n    Transfer of Entitlement...............         0       110       281       577       592       630       805     1,129     1,612     1,899     2,200\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Subtotal--Proposed Changes..........         0       539       603       873       890       929     1,105     1,430     1,915     2,204     2,508\n                                           =============================================================================================================\nSpending Under S. 4 for Veterans'              1,374     1,905     1,975     2,258     2,287     2,329     2,510     2,841     3,339     3,650     3,980\n Readjustment Benefits....................\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Transfer of Entitlement. Section 304 would provide DoD with \n     the authority to allow military personnel to transfer their \n     entitlement to MGIB benefits to any combination of spouse and \n     children. CBO expects that DoD would use the authority in \n     2000 to enhance recruiting and retention and that the benefit \n     would be limited to current members of the armed forces and \n     those who might join for the first time. Over the first five \n     years almost all of the estimated costs would stem from \n     transfers to spouses, who would tend to train on a part-time \n     basis. Transfers to members' children are estimated to begin \n     in 2004, and spending for children's education would account \n     for more than half of the program's cost beginning in 2006. \n     CBO estimates that the provision would raise costs by about \n     $110 million in 2000, about $2.2 billion over the first five \n     years, and about $9.8 billion over the 2000-2009 period. In \n     the long run, costs would rise to about $3 billion a year. If \n     the benefit were awarded to current veterans. CBO estimates \n     that the costs would be a couple of billion dollars higher \n     over the 2000-2009 period.\n       CBO assumes that about 35 percent of all MGIB participants \n     would transfer their entitlement to their spouses and \n     children. Currently, about half of all MGIB participants do \n     not use their benefits, thus about 70 percent of the \n     remaining half are expected to transfer it. CBO estimates \n     that about a third of the transfers would be to spouses and \n     that eventually about 200,000 spouses each year would receive \n     a benefit for part-time training, averaging about $2,700 in \n     fiscal year 2000. CBO estimates that in the long run over \n     500,000 children of members or former members would use the \n     educational assistance each year but that level would not be \n     reached until about 2013. Full-time students would receive \n     about $5,400 in 2000 under the bill.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-\n     as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts. The net changes in outlays and \n     governmental receipts that are subject to pay-as-you-go \n     procedures are shown in the following table. For the purposes \n     of enforcing pay-as-you-go procedures, only the effects in \n     the current year, the budget year, and the succeeding four \n     years are counted.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              By fiscal years, in millions of dollars--\n                                           -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              1999      2000      2001      2002      2003      2004      2005      2006      2007      2008      2009\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in outlays........................         0       537       599       870       887       927     1,108     1,435     1,940     2,270     2,633\nChanges in receipts.......................         0       -10       -44       -67       -86      -103      -113      -120      -127      -134      -141\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: Section 4 of \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes from the \n     application of that act any legislative provisions that are \n     necessary for the national security. That exclusion might \n     apply to the provisions of this bill. In any case, the bill \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On September 28, 1998, CBO prepared \n     a cost estimate for a proposal to repeal the Military \n     Retirement Reform Act of 1986 (REDUX). This estimate relies \n     on many of the same actuarial assumptions, models, and \n     estimates from the Office of the Actuary at DoD that CBO used \n     in the earlier estimate. However, this estimate also reflects \n     the provisions of S. 4 that would offer certain members an \n     option to stay under the REDUX system and that would raise \n     the pay base applicable to computing the costs of military \n     retirement.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Cost: The estimates for \n     defense programs were prepared by Jeannette Deshong (military \n     and civilian personnel) and Dawn Sauter (Military retirement \n     and veterans' benefits). They can be reached at 226-2840. \n     Valerie Baxter prepared the estimates for food stamps. She \n     can be reached at 226-2820.

Van de Water, Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                            The Cost of S. 4\n\n\n                              Major Points\n\n       Majority of the discretionary incremental increase in S. 4 \n     over the Administration's plan is due to the larger pay \n     raises after FY 00, (4.4% in S. 4 versus 3.9% in the budget \n     request).\n       Direct spending in S. 4 is attributable to changes in the \n     Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB).\n       Revenue loss in S. 4 is due to the institution of a \n     military Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).\n       The direct spending and the loss of revenues makes S. 4 \n     subject to a budget point of order.\n       Background. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has \n     provided a cost estimate of S. 4, The Soldiers' Sailors', \n     Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 and the cost \n     for the Administration's pay raise and retirement plan. In \n     developing the cost of the Administration's plan, CBO used \n     two different sets of economic assumptions, making a direct \n     comparison to S. 4 difficult. One cost estimate developed by \n     CBO, costs the Administration's plan using lower ECIs than \n     what is currently reflected in the budget request (this plan \n     is listed as CBO's ECIs). The second cost estimate of the \n     Administration's plan reflects the budget request (this plan \n     is\n\n[[Page S1692]]\n\n     listed as OMB's ECIs). The basic difference between the two \n     CBO estimates is the size of the military pay raise after \n     fiscal year 2000. Currently, the fiscal year 2000 defense \n     budget request programs future raises at 3.9%. CBO believes \n     that an ECI in the future will be lower and this could lower \n     future pay raises to 3.2%.\n       Using the pay raise that is currently in the budget request \n     (3.9%), provides for a more direct comparison to S. 4. If \n     ECIs are lowered in the future, subsequent budget requests \n     will reflect this new economic assumption. Summary of the \n     costs for the Administration's plan and S. 4 are below. More \n     detailed CBO cost estimates are attached.\n\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         FY00        FYDP      FY 00-09\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nS. 4:\n  Discretionary Spending............      1.075      18.146      40.826\n  Direct Spending...................       .537       4.928      13.206\n  Loss of Revenues..................

Madam President, the CBO estimates that enactment of S. 4 \nwill raise discretionary spending by about $1.1 billion in fiscal year \n2000 and $13.8 billion over the 2000-2004 time period. There are, of \ncourse, direct spending and forgone tax revenue issues that we will \nhave to overcome. I have been working with Senator Domenici, Senator \nStevens, and others to address these issues in the budget resolution \nand the defense authorization bill, which are ongoing deliberations.\n  The important perspective to consider here is that, even though this \nbill is expensive, the alternative is unacceptable. I wish to stress \nthat: The alternative is unacceptable. We, simply, as a nation--the \nleader of the world, with the strongest and the largest armed force of \nany nation in the world, an armed force which is deployed overseas, \nnow, in many places, preserving freedom and trying to secure freedom \nfor others--we simply cannot allow the best military force in the world \nto wither and atrophy. We must be prepared to pay the price in dollars \nto fulfill our constitutional duties ``To raise and support Armies,'' \nand ``To provide and maintain a Navy.'' As I and other Members of the \nSenate--and that is of course taken from the Constitution. And \nsubsequent thereto we have the Air Force, and of course the Marines \nhave been with us forever, but that is the wording out of the \nConstitution.\n  As I and the other Members of the Senate have visited military bases \nhere in the United States, in Bosnia, and in other deployment areas, we \nhave found that our young service men and women and their families are \ndoing a tremendous job, under adverse conditions in many cases--\ntremendous stress on the family--and how proud we are, particularly of \nthe many wives and others in the families who make this system work. It \nis a family matter.\n  In order to demonstrate to these highly trained and dedicated \nmilitary personnel that we appreciate their sacrifices and \ncontributions, we must move quickly to pass this legislation. Such \naction will permit military personnel and their families to make the \ndecision, hopefully, to continue to serve and will assist the military \nservices in recruiting the high-quality force we have worked so hard to \nachieve. And that means front-end acquisition at the recruiting \nstations.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation and again \nsalute those of my colleagues who were the early pioneers--Senators \nLott, McCain, Roberts, and others--and I am proud to join with them \ntoday in presenting this bill to the Senate.\n  Also, Madam President, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate \na very important letter which arrived here just late Friday from the \nSecretary of Defense. I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 19, 1999.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: I am following up on the comments General \n     Shelton and I made concerning S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', \n     Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 during our \n     posture hearing before your committee. First, let me thank \n     you for your early action to endorse the President's \n     initiative to improve compensation for our military \n     personnel. I fully appreciate the desire of the Committee to \n     take the lead for the Senate on these important matters. \n     Unfortunately, there are a number of elements of the bill \n     which cause concern and the Department has not had an \n     opportunity to testify on this bill and outline concerns. So \n     I am taking this opportunity to present to you our \n     reservations.\n       Again, let me emphasize that I sincerely appreciate your \n     endorsing key elements of the Department's proposal, \n     including: (1) a large across-the-board pay raise increase \n     for military service members; (2) substantial increases in \n     retirement benefits, such that all members can receive a \n     retirement pay that is 50% of their average high salary at 20 \n     years, vice 40% for many members; and (3) reform of the \n     military pay tables, including increased raises for \n     promotions. I especially appreciate your endorsement of pay \n     table reform which more than anything will correct pay \n     inequities. These three items are fully funded in the defense \n     budget I submitted last month.\n       S. 4 propose even larger pay raises, higher cost-of-living \n     adjustments, and other items which are not in the budget I \n     submitted. I estimate that these additional items will cost \n     $7 billion in discretionary funding through FY2005. I am \n     concerned that until there is a budget resolution that sets \n     the defense budget level, this bill constitutes an unfunded \n     requirement on the Department. Absent an increase in the \n     topline for Defense, these items will only displace other key \n     elements of our program. It could be counterproductive and \n     completely contrary to our mutual desire not to undercut our \n     modernization effort and other readiness priorities. For \n     these reasons, it is imperative to proceed within the regular \n     authorization process and after we have agreement on a budget \n     topline.\n       S. 4 also contains expanded education benefits for veterans \n     and their dependents that would incur costs in addition to \n     the $7 billion noted above. These benefit proposals stem in \n     part from the just-released Report of the Congressional \n     Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition \n     Assistance. The Department was not asked to testify before \n     the Senate Armed Services committee on S. 4 and the Senate \n     Veterans Affairs Committee held only one hearing on the \n     commission's report. As the Department had only a limited \n     opportunity to review and comment on the commission's \n     recommendations, I believe that the commission's significant \n     policy changes contained in S. 4 warrant additional study. \n     Implementing these expanded levels would equate to a 36% \n     increase before inflation within one year. I believe the \n     impact of last year's increases should be considered before \n     enacting further changes.\n       I appreciate the Committee's intent to address the \n     legitimate needs of servicemembers regarding pay and \n     retirement. However, I am concerned that S. 4 could have the \n     opposite effect by raising hopes that cannot be fulfilled \n     until the final budget number is set. Resolving these \n     questions within the normal authorization and budget \n     processes is by far the most desirable approach.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Bill Cohen.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. ``Dear John,'' writes our former colleague Senator Cohen,\n\n       I am following up on the comments General Shelton and I \n     made concerning S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and \n     Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 during our posture \n     hearing before your committee.

So I am taking this \n     opportunity to present to you our reservations.\n\n  On the question of the opportunity to testify, of course we had the \ntwo hearings, one in September and again this January, so there was a \ngreat deal of testimony that was used directly in formulating this \nbill. However, the subcommittee, under the distinguished chairman \nSenator Allard, will be meeting this week to take up further hearings \non the bill.\n\n       Again, let me emphasize that I sincerely appreciate your \n     endorsing key elements of the Department's proposal, \n     including: (1) a large across-the-board pay raise increase \n     for military service members; (2) substantial increases in \n     retirement benefits, such that all members can receive a \n     retirement pay that is 50% of their average high salary at 20 \n     years, vice 40% for many members; and (3) reform of the \n     military pay tables, including increased raises for \n     promotions, I especially appreciate your endorsement of pay \n     table reform which more than anything will correct pay \n     inequities.

For these reasons, it is \n     imperative to proceed within the regular authorization \n     process and after we have agreement on a budget topline.\n\n  That is constructive criticism, but at the same time I think it is \nvery important, and again I commend our leadership, that we lay this \nbill down today to send a signal to the men and women of the Armed \nServices that the U.S. Senate on the first bill, really, to be taken up \nin this new Congress--that is the type of priority that we attach their \npay, retirement, and other benefits.\n\n       S. 4 also contains expanded education benefits for veterans \n     and their dependents that would incur costs in addition to \n     the $7 billion noted above.

As the Department had only a limited \n     opportunity to review and comment on the commission's \n     recommendations, I believe that the commission's significant \n     policy changes contained in S. 4 warrant additional study.\n\n  I assure my good friend, Secretary Cohen, that study is ongoing and \nwill be thoroughly debated here in the coming days.\n\n       Implementing these expanded levels would equate to a 36% \n     increase before inflation within one year. I believe the \n     impact of last year's increases should be considered before \n     enacting further changes.\n       I appreciate the Commission's intent to address the \n     legitimate needs of servicemembers regarding pay and \n     retirement.

But nevertheless, we are going to forge ahead and \ndo our very best to achieve the basic goals for which he, I think, very \ncourteously applauds us as a committee and those Members who have \nworked on it.\n  Madam President, following his letter, I would like to put in a \nletter by the military coalition which, again, draws the debate lines \non these several points that I have raised. I will perhaps refer to \nthis later, but at this time, I want to yield the floor so my \ndistinguished colleague can give his remarks.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the staff members of \nthe Committee on Armed Services, appearing on the list which is \nappended hereto, be extended the privilege of the floor during the \nconsideration of S. 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, Members of this body are keenly aware of \nthe demands we place on our troops, the circumstances in which they \nlive and work and the fact we often pay them less and expect them to do \nfar more than employers in the private sector.\n  I commend Secretary Cohen, General Shelton, and the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff for recognizing that military recruitment and retention has begun \nto suffer and for acting forcefully to address this problem.\n  The fiscal year 2000 defense budget includes funding for an across-\nthe-board increase in military salaries, targeted pay raises to better \nreward performance, and a change to the military retirement system to \nplace service members who entered after 1986 on a footing more \ncomparable to those who entered the service at an earlier date. These \nchanges should help provide fairer compensation to our men and women in \nuniform, and we should act together to enact them into law.\n  The bill before us contains provisions similar to those proposed by \nSecretary Cohen's budget, but there are several ways in which the \nbenefits offered by S. 4 are even more generous. It includes the \nfollowing: First, the administration proposal contains a 4.4-percent \nacross-the-board pay increase. S. 4 contains a 4.8-percent pay raise.\n  Second, the administration budget assumes, but does not require, pay \nraises of 3.9 percent a year for the remainder of the FYDP. S. 4 \nmandates in permanent law raises of .5 percent more than the employment \ncost index.\n  Third, the administration proposal would restore the same 50 percent \nof base pay for post-1986 retirees as for pre-1986 retirees. S. 4 would \nprovide the same change while also restoring the more generous pre-1986 \nfull CPI COLAs. Under S. 4, post-1986 retirees could accept a one-time, \nlump-sum payment of $30,000 and opt out of this generous retirement \nsystem.\n  Fourth, S. 4 authorizes active duty service members to participate in \nthe Thrift Savings Plan for Federal employees. The administration \nproposal contained no similar provision.\n  Fifth, S. 4 contains a special allowance for service members who are \neligible to receive food stamps. The administration proposal contained \nno similar provision.\n  And sixth, S. 4 contains provisions first proposed by Senator Cleland \nand consistent with the recommendations of the Congressional Commission \non Service Members and Veterans Transition Assistance to improve the \neducational benefits provided to service members through the GI bill. \nThe administration proposal contained no similar provision.\n  I have some concerns about a number of these provisions, but there is \nlittle doubt that they would substantially improve the pay and benefits \navailable to members of the Armed Forces. The GI bill provisions, in \nparticular, should provide substantial incentives to help address the \ncurrent recruiting and retention problems facing the military services, \nwhile offering our men and women in uniform an educational opportunity \nin the proudest tradition of our country.\n  For this reason, I agree with the sponsors of the bill that we should \ndo what we can to make these benefits a reality. So on that question, I \nhope there is no Member of this body, and I know there is no member of \nthe Armed Services Committee not in agreement that we should do what we \ncan to make these benefits in S. 4 a reality.\n  But the question is, How can we best make that happen. Do we best \nserve the interests of the troops by bringing this bill to the floor \nfor consideration before we have passed a budget resolution and before \nwe know whether money will be available to pay for this bill? Do we \nbest serve our troops by separating the pay and the benefits issues \nfrom the rest of the authorization, even if that can force us to delay \nimprovements in living and working conditions, and even if that forces \nus to postpone the introduction of new equipment? Or would we better \nserve the interest of our troops by considering the provisions of this \nbill in our normal authorization process after the budget resolution \nhas been passed and we have had an opportunity to conduct hearings on \nthe specifics of the proposal in our Personnel Subcommittee?\n  Madam President, I want to alert my colleagues that regardless of \nwhether we pass this bill now or later, we will have to face up to some \nsignificant issues down the road. Our military leaders have told us \nthat they want us to change the military retirement system, but the \nproposals in S. 4 are very different from their proposal. Indeed, \nSecretary Cohen and General Shelton recently testified that they would \nsupport the added benefits in this bill only if--and I emphasize only \nif--they are paid for without cutting into other defense programs. At \nthis point in the legislative cycle, before we have agreed upon a \nbudget, we cannot give them that assurance, and we cannot give our \ntroops that assurance.\n  For this reason, the Secretary of Defense wrote the committee last \nFriday to express strong concerns about whether this bill could be paid \nfor without an adverse impact on national defense. My good friend, \nSenator Warner, has read the letter, but I am just going to focus on a \ncouple of paragraphs in that letter because of Secretary Cohen's \nconcerns about whether this bill could be paid for without an adverse \nimpact on the national defense.\n  Here is what Secretary Cohen wrote in part:\n\n       S. 4 proposes even larger pay raises, higher cost-of-living \n     adjustments, and other items which are not in the budget I \n     submitted. I estimate that these . . . items will cost $7 \n     billion in discretionary funding through\n\n[[Page S1694]]\n\n     FY2005. I am concerned that until there is a budget \n     resolution that sets the defense budget level, this bill \n     constitutes an unfunded requirement on the Department. Absent \n     an increase in the topline for Defense, these items will only \n     displace other key elements of our program. It could be \n     counterproductive and completely contrary to our mutual \n     desire not to undercut our modernization effort and other \n     readiness priorities. For these reasons, it is imperative to \n     proceed within the regular authorization process and after we \n     have agreement on a budget topline.\n\n  And further on, Secretary Cohen said the following:\n\n       I appreciate the committee's intent to address the \n     legitimate needs of servicemembers regarding pay and \n     retirement. However, I am concerned that S. 4 could have the \n     opposite effect by raising hopes that cannot be fulfilled \n     until the final budget number is set. Resolving these \n     questions within the normal authorization and budget \n     processes is by far the most desirable approach.\n\n  Madam President, this is an expensive bill. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that the enhanced pay in benefits provided for in S. 4 \nwill cost almost $12 billion more than the administration proposal over \nthe next 6 years. The increases over the President's budget include \nadded costs of $5.6 billion for the more generous pay raises in the \nbill, $1.2 billion for the enhanced retirement and Thrift Savings Plan \nprovisions, $100 million for the special subsistence allowance, and \n$4.9 billion for the new GI bill provisions.\n\n  For several reasons, it would appear possible that these estimates \nmay be understated.\n  First, the CBO estimate assumes that 50 percent of the enlisted \npersonnel and about 40 percent of officers would elect to receive a \n$30,000 lump-sum bonus in lieu of a higher annuity in retirement. \nHowever, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has raised serious \nconcerns about the $30,000 buyout, and testified that the Chiefs will \nrecommend that the troops opt instead for the more expensive retirement \nannuity.\n  Second, while the current law governing military pay raises includes \na discretionary formula, setting the COLA at .5 percent below the rate \nof inflation, allowing the President to take into account a broad array \nof factors, this bill would establish a mandatory COLA at .5 percent \nabove the rate of inflation forever. The CBO estimate addresses the \nchange in the anticipated formula, but because CBO estimates are \nlimited to a narrow budget window, that estimate does not address the \nadded cost to the pay raise that goes on without any time limit \nwhatsoever.\n  And third, and finally, if Congress stands by the historic concept of \npay equity and provides annual pay increases for civilian employees of \nthe Federal Government equal to those proposed in this bill for members \nof the military services, the Department of Defense would face a \nsubstantial bill for increased civilian pay as well; and, of course, \nour overall budget outside of the Department of Defense would also have \na substantial bill for increased civilian pay as well.\n  Madam President, little consideration appears to have been given to \nhow we will pay for these increased benefits. At least three 60-vote \npoints of order could be made against this bill under the provisions of \nthe Budget Act--because it would exceed mandatory spending allocations, \nit would reduce revenues, and it would increase the deficit. That stark \nfact should demonstrate that we are considering this bill outside the \nnormal legislative cycle. There could be serious consequences to acting \non a major spending authorization for fiscal year 2000 and beyond \nseparate from the authorization bill of which it is a part and before \nwe have even considered the budget resolution for fiscal year 2000.\n  Do we intend to revise the budget agreement to pay for this bill? If \nso, where will the money come from? Will we take it out of surplus? Or \nwill we make some as yet unspecified cuts in the already tight budget \nfor domestic programs to pay for it? At this early point in the \nlegislative cycle, we simply do not know. We can only say that unlike \nthe administration's pay and retirement proposal, which was fully paid \nfor in the President's budget, this bill represents a promise to the \ntroops that may or may not be possible to redeem.\n  If the defense budget is not substantially increased, and if the bill \nbefore us is adopted by the House and becomes law, we would need to cut \nthe readiness and modernization accounts to offset the costs of this \nbill. As the Secretary of Defense has pointed out, such cuts coming at \na time when our senior military leadership have already expressed \nconcerns about our readiness could have a serious impact on our \nnational security. For this reason, the Secretary of Defense and the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that they would support \nthe increased benefits contained in the bill only if the additional \nmoney does not come out of other defense programs.\n\n  Now that is really the key to this. Will these benefits, which we all \nwould like to see put in place, come from other defense programs or \nwill there be a new budget agreement? We do not know. We should know \nbefore we act on this bill; but we are not going to know. This bill \ncomes to the floor without knowing the answer to that critical \nquestion: whether or not these benefits are going to come out of other \ndefense programs or whether there will be a new budget agreement which \nlifts the cap for defense.\n  When Secretary Cohen and General Shelton testified before the Armed \nServices Committee on February 3, the Secretary stated that any further \nincreases to military pay and benefits should be considered in \nconjunction with the defense authorization bill. And here is what the \nSecretary said:\n\n       [W]e do have to propose this as a package, because if we \n     raise expectations unrealistically and we cannot fulfill them \n     we have done a disservice to our troops. Secondly, if we are \n     going to take it out of the readiness accounts and \n     procurement, we have also done a disservice. So the package \n     that we have put together we think makes sense and we hope \n     that any variation will be paid for, period.\n\n  That is pretty stark and pretty succinct. It comes from our top \nmilitary leadership that ``we hope that any variation will be paid for, \nperiod.'' The increases in this bill above the increases in the \nPresident's budget are not paid for in this bill. The Secretary of \nDefense says, ``we hope that any variation will be paid for, period.''\n  Now, we are not doing the troops a favor if we say that we are going \nto increase their benefits but then do not follow through with the \nappropriation that is necessary to increase their benefits. I do not \nthink there is a member of the Armed Services Committee or a Member of \nthis body who does not believe we should increase the benefits as much \nas we can to our troops. They deserve it. But we are doing this in a \nvacuum, separate from the defense authorization bill. And that opens \nthe possibility that we would be passing a bill which says we will give \nyou these extra benefits but then down the line when it comes to an \nappropriations process or a budget process there is no added funds for \ndefense, and then either these benefits are not funded later on, which \nwould be terrible after we promised them, or we will take the increase \nout of readiness or modernization or out of housing or some other \nneeded aspect of our defense budget.\n  So I believe that every Member of this body would like to support the \nimproved pay and benefits that would be afforded to our men and women \nin uniform by this bill. And the question is not whether this \nadditional step is a desirable one--it is--but we should take it only \nif we can pay for it. And we have to know whether or not we are going \nto be able to pay for it or else we could be doing damage to morale \ninstead of increasing the needed benefits for our troops.\n  So, for this reason, I may offer an amendment at an appropriate time \nto express the sense of the Senate that the provisions of this bill are \nsubject to further consideration in the authorization and the \nappropriation process, after we have agreed on a budget resolution and \na determination can then be made whether sufficient funds are available \nto pay for the bill and a sufficient determination could be made as to \nwhat impact those changes will have, if any, on needed readiness and \nmodernization programs in the Department of Defense.\n\n  I believe that approach would give us an opportunity both to do what \nthis bill does, which is to send an early message to the troops, which \nthe sponsors of the bill have suggested, while at the same time \ndemonstrating some care and some caution by indicating, consistent with \nthe request from the Secretary of Defense, which is now in the Record, \nthat the bill will receive further consideration as part of this\n\n[[Page S1695]]\n\nyear's defense authorization bill, after we have passed a budget and \nafter we know how much money will be available for national defense.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I think the argument has been framed. My \nfriend and colleague points up his desire to follow the procedures that \nhe and I followed for 21 years as a member of the Armed Services \nCommittee. But, Madam President, I accept responsibility for bringing \nup this bill early and encouraging our leadership to give me their \nsupport. And here is the reason. Let me just give you one example of \nthe problems we are seeing in our military today.\n  During fiscal year 1998, the military lost 1,641 more pilots than \nthey expected.\n  They very carefully planned for a certain amount of attrition through \nretirements at the end of 20 years--or whenever it may be--and for \nthose persons who decided not to make the military a career, it was \ntime to accept other challenges. Those figures show you have to retain \na certain percentage in each of those key pay grades of pilots in order \nto keep the airplane flying, in order to fulfill the missions abroad. \nPresident Clinton has sent the men and women of the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States abroad more than any other President in the history of \nthis great Nation. We need these people, particularly the airmen. We \nare 1,641 airmen short.\n  Let's translate that into dollars. The average cost to train a \nmilitary pilot is about $5.8 million. To replace 1,600 pilots will cost \nthe Department of Defense over $9 billion--repeat, $9 billion. If the \nenhanced benefits within this bill--the subject of criticism by my \ncolleague--can reduce the unprogrammed losses of pilots by even one-\nthird, we will have more than made up for the additional costs of S. 4 \ncompared to what the Department of Defense bill sent up. There is an \nexample.\n  If you need one more, it is right here. Last year, the Army missed \nthe recruiting goals by about 800. The Navy missed their recruiting \ngoals by 7,000. So far this year, the Army has failed to meet the first \nquarter of this new fiscal year goals by 2,500. According to the Army's \nown estimates, they will in 1999--unless this bill and other signals \nthat we send change the course--they will in 1999 have 10,000 fewer \nrecruits than what they need to man the forces all over the world.\n  What does that mean, Madam President? That means that some soldier \nmust stay that added time overseas on an assignment, away from his \nfamily, or be recalled from his assignment here in the United States to \ngo overseas and replace another, more often than he or she ever \nanticipated. As a result, these people are getting out of the middle \npay grades and the youngsters aren't coming in.\n\n  I will take responsibility for bringing up this bill. I will take \nresponsibility for going in for the high figures for this pay increase. \nYes, we will accept that, because in any negotiation that I have to \nundertake with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, I want to go in with a top figure, \nhoping I can do better than what the administration came up with in \ntheir pieces of legislation.\n  These are the problems we are facing, the real problems--shortfalls, \nshortfalls, shortfalls--resulting in loss of time with family, fewer \nskills, and the inability to attract and find young men and women to \ncome into the services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I agree with my good friend from Virginia \nin terms of the need to both attract and retain people. It is also \nimportant that we pay for the benefits in this bill.\n  We are not doing anybody a favor if we say we are going to increase \nthe pay, and then we cut their housing. We are not doing anybody a \nfavor if we say there will be an added pay increase to what the \nPresident proposes, and then cut flying hours and steaming hours so \nthat people don't have the training that they want as members of the \nmilitary.\n  I don't know of anybody who is more keenly aware of the need to both \nrecruit and retain people than our Secretary of Defense. I can't think \nof anybody other than the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Joint \nChiefs themselves who are more keenly aware of these shortfalls. That \nis why we have these increases in the President's budget. But the \nSecretary of Defense, who is responsible for increasing recruitment and \nretention, has proposed a budget to us which he believes will do just \nthat. He says in his letter to both the chairman and to me:\n\n       . . . it is imperative to proceed within the regular \n     authorization process and after we have agreement on a budget \n     topline.\n\n  The reason he said that is because, ``It could be counterproductive \nand completely contrary to our mutual desire not to undercut our \nmodernization effort and other readiness priorities'' to do otherwise.\n  So in terms of the benefits in this bill, I am not one who is \ncriticizing the benefits in this bill at all. I commend these benefits. \nI just want to pay for them. That is the only issue. Whether we are \ngoing to pay for these benefits or we are just going to say in a bill \nthat these benefits are going to be increased, without knowing where \nthe increase is coming from, without knowing whether the budget \nresolution is going to put more money in for defense, without knowing \nwhether or not these increases in benefits, this pay, and retirement \nare going to come out of readiness, modernization, housing, or where \nthey will come from in there is not a top line.\n  The benefits, it seems to me, are appropriate. But paying for them is \nessential, or else we are going to unleash two things. One is false \nhopes, which will then be dashed, which is, it seems to me, the worst \nof all worlds--false hopes in our uniformed military people that they \nwill be getting a pay raise larger than the one proposed by the \nPresident. Or we are going to be carrying through with the provisions \nof this bill, and unless there is an increase in the top line, we will \nbe seeing a degradation in readiness or modernization or housing or \nother important needs, both of the Nation and of our uniformed military \npersonnel.\n\n  So I am very supportive of the benefits in this bill. What I am \npointing out is the missing part of this bill. This is half a bill. \nThis isn't a full bill. This is half of the bill. This is increasing \nthe benefits but it is not saying how we will pay for those benefits. \nIt is half the ledger without the other half of the ledger. That is the \nproblem with this bill.\n  It seems to me what we should do is what the Secretary of Defense has \nsuggested, which is to make these benefits part of the overall \nauthorization bill, which is where they belong and where, \ntraditionally, they have always been lodged and where they have always \nbeen considered.\n  We, hopefully, can provide these benefits. I hope and pray we can \nprovide these benefits. They are useful benefits. But we have to pay \nfor them or else we are not doing the responsible and thoughtful thing. \nWe must pay for them as the Secretary of Defense has urged us to do. \nOtherwise, in his words,\n\n       I am concerned that S. 4 could have the opposite effect by \n     raising hopes that could not be fulfilled until the final \n     budget number is set.\n\n  And the ``opposite effect'' that he is referring to is addressing the \nlegitimate needs of service members regarding pay and retirement.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent Doug Flanders of \nmy staff have floor privileges during the entire debate on the Senate \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I express my appreciation to my \ncolleagues, particularly the Senator from Colorado, for giving me a \nmoment to\n\n[[Page S1696]]\n\nget over to the floor before he begins his address.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \nfloor consideration of S. 4, Herb Cupo, a congressional fellow from the \nDepartment of the Navy, be granted floor privileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, as a cosponsor of S. 4, the Soldiers', \nSailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999, I am \npleased that we are moving forward on this legislation.\n  S. 4 provides the resources to begin to reverse the steady downward \nspirals we have seen in military retention and recruiting.\n  S. 4 provides significant pay raises, improved retirement pay, and \nenhanced GI bill benefits. It is an important step--one of several--\nthat the Congress must take this year to help the military pull out of \nwhat the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs describes as ``a nosedive that \nmight cause irreparable damage to this great force.'' It is also a \nstrong signal to our most important military asset--our men and women \nin uniform, and their families--that we are serious about taking care \nof them.\n  Being a cosponsor, however, hasn't alleviated my concern that we may \nbe moving too quickly on this legislation. This bill has substantial \nbudgetary implications, many of which we are only beginning to \nquantify.\n  Specifically, we don't know yet exactly what this bill will cost, nor \nwhether it is structured to best fix ongoing retention and recruiting \nproblems. Moreover, we haven't yet taken the time to assess where any \nadditional defense dollars should be spent in the broader context. For \nexample, if we put some of these additional funds toward new equipment, \nwe could improve our ability to fight in future wars, and by providing \nour troops with higher quality, more reliable equipment, we also \nimprove recruiting and retention. This is just one of many examples of \nwhy I believe--as the ranking member of the committee believes--that it \nis important to think through any defense budget increases in a \nstrategic and not just a piecemeal manner.\n  Now, one way to improve the bill to ensure that we are improving \nrecruiting and retention in a more direct and cost-effective manner is \nto closely align any pay increases with problem specialties. Along with \nSenators Cleland and Kennedy, I intend to offer a ``Special and \nIncentive Pay Amendment'' to S. 4, which I filed on February 3.\n  This amendment targets certain smaller categories of military service \nwhere our retention challenges are particularly daunting, categories \nwhere we recruit highly skilled personnel, provide them costly \ntraining, and then fight to induce these individuals to remain on \nactive duty when they face uniquely difficult or dangerous missions, \ncoupled with powerful financial incentives to leave the military for \nthe civilian sector. Examples include career enlisted fliers, Navy \nSEALS, and Navy surface warfare officers.\n\n  Only 25 percent of our surface warfare officers remain on active duty \nthrough their department head tour, which normally comes between the \nsixth and eighth year of commissioned service. During the drawdown, \nthis wasn't a particular problem, but now with smaller numbers of ships \nin the fleet, we simply don't have the officers to maintain and man \ncritical at-sea billets.\n  In the Navy SEAL community, attrition has increased over 15 percent \nin the past 3 years, while demand for these highly trained individuals \nby our warfighting CINCs has increased sharply.\n  In fiscal year 1998, manning in another category of highly trained \nand difficult individuals--Navy divers--was below 85 percent. That same \nyear, only about 60 percent of our military career linguists met or \nexceeded the minimum requirements in listening or reading proficiency. \nA host of retention problems exist for nuclear-qualified officers and \nenlisted personnel as well.\n  The amendment does several things. It establishes a special pay for \nsurface warfare officers and Navy SEALS to encourage them to remain in \nthe service at critical points. It provides added incentive pay for our \nNavy and Air Force enlisted aircrews. Several existing bonuses are \nincreased, including those for divers, nuclear qualified officers, \nlinguists, and other critical specialties. Finally, the enlisted bonus \nceiling is increased.\n  These are critical remedies for critical specialties. The Nation \nsimply can't afford to continue to pay as much as we do to recruit and \ntrain these talented individuals only to see them leave the service out \nof frustration over the inadequacies of their pay and benefits.\n  Madam President, this special and incentive pay amendment to S. 4 is \nexactly the kind of targeted ``fix'' Congress can and should support, \nand I hope our colleagues will support it when we bring S. 4 up for the \nvotes.\n  I also intend to offer an amendment to modify existing title 37 \nlegislation with respect to the bonuses we pay to our career aviation \nofficers.\n  The impact of poor officer retention has been particularly hard on \nour pilot communities. For example, overall Navy pilot retention \ndecreased to 39 percent in fiscal year 1997 and further declined to 32 \npercent in fiscal year 1998. This trend is expected to continue for the \nforeseeable future.\n  While continuation of midlevel officers represents the greatest \naviation retention challenge, there has also been an increase in \nresignations of more senior aviators, particularly due to intense \ncompetition from private industry. To address these problems, the \nservices have identified a requirement for greater flexibility with \ntheir principal aviation retention shaping tool known as aviation \ncontinuation pay, or ACP.\n  The amendment that I have just described would allow the services to \ndo just that. ACP is currently limited to 14 years, and only covers \nofficers in the grades 0-5 and below. This amendment would pay ACP up \nto 25 years, and expand eligibility one grade to cover officers at the \n0-6 level. The maximum aviation continuation payment allowed for each \nyear of additional obligation would go up from $12,000 to $25,000.\n  Finally, the provision recognizes the aggregate retention needs of \nthe services by eliminating the requirement to annually define critical \naviation specialties.\n  These refinements to title 37, along with other innovative \ncompensation initiatives this body will consider, should begin to \nreverse the steady downward trends in aviation retention by allowing \neach service to tailor compensation programs to meet their specific \nretention challenges and accommodate their unique career path \nrequirements.\n  I might add that both of these amendments I have referred to have the \nfull support of the Department of Defense.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor. Again, I thank my \ndistinguished colleague from Colorado for his courtesy.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, S. 4, The Soldiers', Sailors', \nAirmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999, may be the most \nsignificant national security legislation approved by the Senate this \nyear. It will provide the basis for major improvements in the welfare \nof our military personnel and their families, recruiting and retention \nand, in turn, the readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  Although I was a cosponsor of the bill introduced by the leadership, \nthe bipartisan bill reported out by the Armed Services Committee is a \nstronger piece of legislation because it includes a provision revising \nthe benefits under the Montgomery GI bill. This provision proposed by \nSenator Cleland will be a major recruiting incentive and provide \nsignificant educational benefits to our military personnel and \nindirectly to families.\n  Madam President, despite initial criticism by some officials in the \nDepartment of Defense, the provision in the bill providing an option to \nthe career service member to choose a $30,000 bonus and stay in REDUX \nor a 50 percent retirement is gaining support among the military \ncommunity. The initial criticism that by choosing the bonus over full \nretirement would short\n\n[[Page S1697]]\n\nchange the individual was based on incomplete data. The fact is that a \nSergeant First Class in the Army who retires at 20 years under REDUX, \nwho invested the bonus five years earlier in a tax deferred stock fund, \nwould gain $46,000 more in lifetime benefits than an identical retiree \nunder the full retirement plan.\n  Madam President, I understand there are concerns, which I share, \nregarding the potential cost of the bill. Although we have to consider \ncost, we must also remember that we have the best all-volunteer \nmilitary in the World. If we are to maintain that caliber force, we \nmust be prepared to pay for it. I support the bill before us and urge \nthe Senate to demonstrate bipartisan support for the bill and for our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines.\n  Madam President, as a final comment, I want to congratulate our new \nChairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, and the \nMajority Leader, Senator Lott, for designating S. 4 as the first bill \nconsidered by the Committee and the Senate. This gesture sends a strong \nmessage to our military personnel that they and our national security \nare foremost in the Senate's interest.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nChamber of Commerce of the United States of America on this subject be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\n                                Washington, DC, February 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Strom Thurmond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thurmond: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the \n     world's largest business federation, representing more than \n     three million businesses and organizations of every size, \n     sector, and region, strongly urges you to support S. 4, the \n     Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights \n     Act of 1999.\n       After many years of defense spending cuts, it is now time \n     to reverse the trend and begin focusing on appropriate \n     measures to ensure the United States Military is able to \n     recruit and retain skilled military personnel. Under the \n     provisions of S. 4, the basic pay for members of the \n     uniformed services would increase by 4.8%, effective January \n     1, 2000.\n       The U.S. Chamber is concerned about military retention and \n     readiness because without these fundamental aspects of a \n     strong National Security policy, the continued prosperity of \n     the United States economy would be threatened. Within this \n     policy, the United States must stem the erosion of qualified \n     personnel from our armed forces to ensure an adequate level \n     of readiness. Although S. 4 will not address all aspects of \n     military retention, it will send a strong signal that the \n     United States recognizes and appreciates the critical work of \n     members of the United States Military. Thank you in advance \n     of your support for S. 4.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice president,\n                                               Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina \nfor his remarks, and I appreciate the leadership he has shown over the \nyears on the issues that are important to the Armed Services Committee, \non which I serve with him. It is an honor to serve on the committee \nwith both he and Senator Warner as chairman.\n  First, I want to commend the Chairman for his efforts. Senator \nWarner's leadership on ushering S. 4 to the Senate floor has been \nsignificantly important. Without his insistence and courage to move \nahead, we could not be where we are today on this bill.\n  I'm glad this is the first bill to come before the Senate, not just \nfor substantive reasons but for the message we are sending to our men \nand women in uniform. They put their lives on the line everyday for our \nfreedom and they need to know they will receive what they earn. We need \nto continually send the message that we care about them and the \nfamilies they have to leave while on duty.\n  Unfortunately, I believe this message has not been sent during the \nlast six years. From the Secretary of Defense down, we have been \nhearing the difficulty the services have had in recruiting and \nretaining their service personnel, and complaints about the gap between \nthe military and civilian pay. During the last six years, the defense \nbudget has decreased 25 percent in real economic terms, while at the \nsame time our troops have been sent abroad 45 times--and this doesn't \ninclude the latest journey into Kosovo. I do not now want to argue the \nneed for all these deployments, but I will say that we cannot keep \nasking our armed services to do more and more while giving them less \nand less. This trend must be reversed and fast. S. 4 is the first step \nin changing this downward trend. But, better pay and benefits is only \none step in improving the quality of life for our soldiers. Soon, we \nmust address the problems of frequent deployments, prolonged absences, \nreadiness shortfalls and the other myriad problems facing our military \nor else all the important changes in this bill will be lost.\n  The first problem I want to address is the issue of pay. If we want \nto keep the best and brightest then we need to pay them at levels \nfavorable with salaries in the private sector. The current pay gap is \nanywhere between 5.5 to 13.5 percent and is projected to exceed 15 \npercent by the year 2005. Pay raises have lagged behind the average \nprivate sector raises for 12 of the last 16 years. I agree with \nSecretary Cohen and General Shelton when they say that we can never pay \nour military personnel enough, but we can pay them too little--and that \nis what has been done over the last decade.\n  S. 4 provides a much needed 4.8 percent pay raise, the first major \nraise since 1982. I point out that the 4.8-percent pay raise is the \nfirst major pay raise since 1982.\n\n  This may not erase the pay gap problem, but at least it is a start to \ngiving the military what they deserve for the long hours they provide \nin the defense of our Nation.\n  One horrendous example of this low pay is the enlisted soldiers on \nfood stamps. The first time I heard that we had military personnel on \nfood stamps I was outraged. Thanks to Senator McCain's and Senator \nRoberts' efforts, S. 4 will address this problem.\n  According to the Department of Defense, over 11,000 service members \nare eligible to receive food stamps. Almost as staggering as this \nproblem was the response given to it by the administration. According \nto a 1997 AP story in the Colorado Springs Gazette newspaper, Pentagon \nspokesman Kenneth Bacon said, ``It's too bad, but it's a function of \nthe size of their family more than anything else.'' He said that the \nproblem has been around for decades. He said today, ``More soldiers are \nmarried and have families than in the past.''\n  While I agree with size of the families being a factor, I disagree \nthat this is just ``too bad.'' It is wrong and must be addressed \nimmediately. But since that statement in 1997, the administration has \ndone nothing to fix the problem. That is why I am happy that S. 4 will \nno longer just say ``too bad.'' This bill will provide $180 per month \nsubsistence pay for enlisted personnel in grades E-5 and below who \nvoluntarily demonstrate an eligibility for food stamps. The allowance, \nalong with the pay raise, is estimated to help nearly 10,000 military \npersonnel climb above the food stamp wage scale.\n  Also, a January 31, 1999, Denver Post article highlights another \nproblem associated with low pay, and that is retaining highly trained \npersonnel. The 3d Space Operations Squadron, whose personnel fly our \nmilitary satellites from Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, \nhas starting salaries of $13,000. However, it should be of no surprise \nthat these highly trained personnel are being coaxed to leave the \nmilitary for the private sector with starting salaries of over $50,000. \nWhile there is no way the military can compete with salaries such as \nthese, a pay raise will help ease the problems of keeping these \npersonnel.\n  The article also points out that the 3rd Space Operation has a \nturnover as high as 45 percent. With the commercial space industry \nbooming, especially in Colorado, many of these companies will pay top \ndollar for these young men and women who haven't even been certified on \nsatellites but have the highly technical training. This results in \nhigher spending in order to train the new people for the vacant slots.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis Denver Post article.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1698]]\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Jan. 31, 1999]\n\n    Satellite Savvy Draws Dollars--Air Force Training in Big Demand\n\n                            (By Erin Emery)\n\n       Schriever Air Force Base.--Airman Faith Boyd is a 20-\n     something mom with a high school diploma and a job in which \n     making a mistake can have life-and-death consequences for \n     warriors in the field.\n       Boyd works behind the razor-sharp fences at Schriever Air \n     Force Base, a place that some people say has the feel of a \n     top-secret Area 51. Here, on the barren plains 15 miles east \n     of Colorado Springs, the nation's Department of Defense \n     satellites--about 60 of them worth $40 billion--are \n     controlled.\n       Boyd, 23, works in an air-conditioned room full of \n     computers with other Generation Xers. She's assigned to the \n     3rd Space Operations Squadron, where the mission is weighted \n     in responsibility. The job: manage and maintain satellites \n     that relay communications for the military.\n       Starting salary: $13,000 a year.\n       In two years, though, when Boyd's four-year commitment to \n     the Air Force is completed, headhunters who recruit for \n     companies like Lockheed-Martin, Motorola and Boeing will wine \n     and dine her and try to coax her to leave the Air Force for a \n     job in the private sector.\n       Starting salary: $55,000 annually.\n       ``I do feel lucky,'' said Boyd, who also helps teach \n     newcomers to be satellite systems operators.\n       The robust commercial space industry is a $51 billion \n     enterprise worldwide that is expected to triple in size by \n     2006. As it continues to grow, so will demand for people who \n     can control the satellites.\n       ``You've heard of this guy Bill Gates?'' Col. Mike Kelly, \n     deputy commander of the 50th Space Operations Group at \n     Schriever said of the head of Microsoft. ``He's putting up \n     Teledesic. He's going to fly a constellation of 288 \n     satellites, the `Internet in the Sky,' and he's going to need \n     some people to fly them.''\n       One of the places that recruiters will look is Schriever, \n     at 2 SOPS and across the hall, at the 3rd Space Operations \n     Squadron, where young people are controlling the Global \n     Positioning System, a constellation of satellites that relay \n     highly accurate navigational information. Last year, turnover \n     was as high as 45 percent, said Maj. Lee-Volker Cox, \n     operations flight commander. Some of that turnover \n     represented people transferring to other jobs in the \n     military.\n       ``I think that probably the biggest retention issue facing \n     Space Command is the growth of the civilian space industry,'' \n     said Capt. Paul Hermann, a 1990 Air Force Academy graduate \n     who works in 2nd Space Operations Squadron. ``There is no \n     place for those companies to go and get qualified people to \n     do jobs.''\n\n\n                         experience hard to get\n\n       There are about 560 satellites in space, and 1,000 more are \n     scheduled to be launched in the next decade.\n       Schriever Air Force Base is one of the few places in the \n     world where young people can get hands-on experience flying \n     satellites.\n       ``When you're looking for people in the satellite control \n     business, that certainly is one of the places where you want \n     to look,'' said Paul Unger, a vice president of Chicago-based \n     A T Kearney Executive Search, which recruits people for \n     executive jobs in the satellite industry. ``It's one of those \n     disciplines that you really have to be a by-the-book person. \n     You have to be very disciplined to follow procedures, but you \n     have to be able to snap into action and solve very complex \n     problems that, at times, don't have by-the-book solutions.''\n       But while companies are dangling big dollars in front of \n     people, the Air Force is doing everything it can to keep \n     them--except pay them $55,000 salaries.\n       The Air Force is offering a $4,000 signing bonus to people \n     who agree to work in jobs like Boyd's and enlist for six \n     years instead of four.\n\n\n                         weighing the benefits\n\n       Air Force officials are stressing the multitude of benefits \n     offered in the service that may not be found in the private \n     sector: free day care, free legal service and free membership \n     to a base fitness center, Plus, airmen can get college \n     credits for completing technical training and they get a \n     stipend toward tuition to earn a college degree.\n       Across the military services, a 4.4 percent pay increase--\n     the largest pay increase for service members in several \n     years--kicks in Jan. 1, 2000.\n       Only five years ago, there wasn't much opportunity in the \n     Air Force for enlisted people like Boyd. Officers out-\n     numbered enlisted personnel three to one; now it is the other \n     way around.\n       The Air Force has standardized the procedures--the commands \n     that airmen type into computers--for contacting what people \n     in the industry call ``birds.''\n       ``The procedures say, `If this happens, do this,' '' said \n     Capt. Porf Dubon, who writes instructions for satellite \n     operators.\n       Standardizing procedures has resulted in dramatic changes \n     in personnel, mainly in their ages.\n       ``There can be nights when probably the oldest person is 25 \n     or 26 years old,'' said Dubon, 32. ``There can be nights when \n     you'll have a crew of 18- to 20-year-olds here by themselves.\n       Some team members have college degrees, while others have \n     high school diplomas.\n       After joining the Air Force, airmen take a test that \n     measures aptitude for various professions. Those who have a \n     knack for electronics get the opportunity to come to \n     Schriever and learn to fly satellites. After six months of \n     school--eight hours a day--they go to work controlling \n     satellites but are shadowed by someone with more experience \n     until they become certified satellite systems operators.\n\n\n                          headhunters calling\n\n       Sgt. James Butler, 30, who trains people to be satellite \n     systems operators, said headhunters call him about twice a \n     week.\n       While some companies are offering $55,000 to do the same \n     job he does in the Air Force, if Butler willing to move, he \n     could make $65,000 or more in Virginia or Maryland.\n       ``No degree, just experience,'' Butler said. ``We've had \n     calls from people who will pay $40,000 a year and the people \n     haven't run ops yet, they're not even certified but they've \n     had the training.''\n       Even though Butler, who has been in the Air Force for 11 \n     years, could practically double his salary if he took a job \n     with a private firm, he'll probably stay put. He has only \n     nine years until retirement.\n       The military is trying to improve its retirement plan so \n     that personnel who entered after 1986 will get 50 percent of \n     their basic pay after 20 years of service, not the current 40 \n     percent.\n       Though $55,000 a year looks pretty good, retirement at age \n     39 looks even better.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. The retention problem is not just felt at space command \nbut cuts across all the services. Secretary Cohen, General Shelton, and \nall the service secretaries and chiefs say that the men and women are \nour greatest assets, but, unfortunately, we are losing our greatest \nassets in mass numbers.\n  I ask the rhetorical question of whether we would let our planes and \nships disappear. Then why should we stand by and let this happen? \nPlanes, ships, tanks, guns, and the rest are useless without properly \ntrained personnel.\n  The Air Force has stated they are 855 pilots short this year and \nexpect to be short 2,000 pilots by the year 2002. This leaves the Air \nForce with less experienced pilots and higher training costs. Their \nenlisted retention is no better.\n  I would like to refer the Members of the Senate to a chart that I \nhave drawn up here which points out the enlisted retention rate for \n1998. The first term reenlistment goal is 55 percent, but in 1998 it \nwas only 54 percent. The second term reenlistment goal is 75 percent \nbut only achieved 69 percent. The career goal is 95 percent while only \ngetting 93 percent reenlistment. This is the first time that the Air \nForce has failed to meet its retention goals in all three categories \nsince 1981.\n  Some may believe these numbers are acceptable, but each and every \npercentage loss hurts the war-fighting skills and readiness across the \nboard for the Air Force.\n  For the Navy, we only have to look at the recent examples of the USS \nEnterprise. While deployed in the gulf, the USS Enterprise was short \nnearly 600 sailors.\n  I look again to another chart where we talk about the Navy 1998 \nofficer retention rates: surface warfare officers retention, only 25 \npercent, against a steady state need of 38 percent. Like the Air Force, \nthe Navy aviator retention was 39 percent in 1997 and further dropped \nto 32 percent in 1998, which falls short of the 35-percent level \nrequired to fill critical department head and flight leader positions. \nSubmarine officers had a 27-percent retention rate, which is far short \nof the 38 percent needed in fiscal year 2001 in order to meet the \nstated manning requirements. For the vaunted SEAL forces, their rates \nhave fallen to a dismal 58 percent from a historical level of over 80 \npercent.\n  The only good news comes from the Army and the Marines. These \nbranches have met their retention goals but have said that they are \nhaving major problems in critical war-fighting skill areas which must \nbe addressed to stay at current readiness.\n  All of these numbers are not to glaze people's eyes over but to open \nsome eyes to the problems our military is facing. These retention \nproblems are real and must be addressed. Inadequate retention only \nheightens the problems of longer deployments, increased frequency of \ndeployment, and longer work hours due to less personnel.\n  This not only places our military in precarious and dangerous \nsituations, but places great stress on their families and loved ones.\n  S. 4 addresses these problems through pay table reforms that focus\n\n[[Page S1699]]\n\nthe emphasis on those retention problem areas--midcareer NCOs and \nofficers. It will reward promotion and achievement over longevity with \nbumps in pay ranging from 4.8 percent to 10.3 percent. Plus, we provide \nnew incentives to the services to address their other specific problem \nretention areas.\n  According to the Pentagon, another retention problem, and one of the \nmajor complaints, is the current Redux retirement system for those who \nentered service after 1986. I understand the repeal of the current \nsystem is one area that is problematic for some Senators. But we have \ntaken the Secretary, the JCS, and all the service secretaries and \nchiefs at their word that Redux needs to be repealed. No matter how one \ncomes down on this issue, if the retirement system is a retention \nproblem, it simply cannot be ignored. That is why S. 4 addresses the \nproblem in what I believe is a responsible manner. Service personnel \nwho entered the military on or after August 1, 1986, will be given the \noption to return to the pre-1986 retirement system of 50 percent of \nbase pay for the average of the 3 highest years or take a $30,000 bonus \nto stay in the Redux system, which is 40 percent of the 3 high years.\n  In addition, the bill allows service members to participate in the \nThrift Savings Plan by placing up to 5 percent of their pretax base pay \ninto one, or any combination, of the TSP's funds --the G, or government \nsecurities fund; the F, or bond fund; the C, or common stock fund.\n  Further, the bill allows service members to place any enlistment, \nreenlistment, and the $30,000 lump-sum bonuses into their TSP.\n  Unlike General Shelton, I don't find the $30,000 bonus an insult, but \nan innovation in providing more market base and higher yielding--a \nhigher yielding retirement fund.\n  To show you how this can work, here is a chart from an article in the \nArmy Times. It is the third chart I am showing here on the floor where \nit shows the various pay grades and how the retirement options might be \naffected through those pay grades.\n  If we look at E-6 with 20 years, the Redux was $378,394; pre-1986 it \nwas $489,942; but then we go to the Redux/bonus and then the buildup in \nthe bond fund is substantial, the buildup shown on the chart would be \n$477,174; and if the Redux was invested in a higher yield fund such as \nthe stock fund, we would look at somewhere around $553,826.\n  These figures have been projected on this chart through the various \ngrades of E-7 for 20 years, E-7 for 23 years, E-8 for 28 years, and E-9 \nfor 30 years, with the concomitant change in bonus, and how those \ndollars would build up within those funds, and they are substantial.\n  I think it is an innovative and very interesting approach to dealing \nwith the retirement and retention problems of our military services.\n  Another interesting aspect from this article is, according to the \nRetired Officers Association, for every service member who accepted \nthis bonus, the Government will save about $66,000 per member. In the \nend, the service men and women could have a higher retirement, while at \nthe same time saving the Government money. Insulting? No. Innovative? I \nsay yes.\n  On a side note, I want to give credit to our very able committee \nstaffer, Charlie Abell, for this idea and congratulate him for this \ninnovation. Some ask, ``Will they use this bonus wisely?'' I believe if \nwe can ask our military men and women to take care of billion-dollar \nequipment and put their lives on the line for us, we should be able to \ntrust them with their own money.\n  Second, as everyone knows, financial counseling is a must for anyone \nwho plans for retirement. I hope the military is currently providing \nthese services. Let's give the military the option and ability to \ncontrol their own retirement and best fit it to their needs.\n  A final effort in this bill is to use Government matching funds for \nTSP accounts or Thrift Savings Plan accounts as a retention tool. We \ngive the service Secretaries the flexibility to offer up to 5 percent \nmatching contributions for 6 years in return for a 6-year commitment in \nskill areas that they deem necessary. This gives the services the \nability to fix their own needs with all the tools available to them.\n  Finally, I want to touch on the problem of recruitment. All we have \nto do is look to the front page of the February 17, 1999, Washington \nPost. The below-the-fold headline reads, ``Military Lags in Filling \nRanks.'' In the story, Army Secretary Caldera says that the Department \nof Defense needs to allow the Army to recruit more high school dropouts \nwith GEDs to make up the 10,000-soldier shortfall this year.\n  At this time, I ask unanimous consent to have the Washington Post \narticle printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 17, 1999]\n\n                     Military Lags in Filling Ranks\n\n                            (By Dana Priest)\n\n       Army Secretary Louis Caldera argued yesterday that the \n     Defense Department should allow the Army to recruit more high \n     school dropouts with equivalency diplomas to help make up a \n     projected shortfall of as many as 10,000 soldiers this year.\n       Caldera's idea, which would require a change in standard \n     adopted five years ago, reflects growing alarm within the \n     Army, Navy and Air Force that they are failing to attract \n     enough recruits from the new generation of young adults and \n     that the shortage will only get worse if the trend is not \n     reversed.\n       ``Frankly, right now we have rules that don't make sense,'' \n     he said. The rules have ``put us in a box that really hurts. \n     Every day we turn away people who want to join.''\n       Like the Air Force and Navy, the Army is facing the worst \n     peacetime recruiting shortfall in its history. Of the major \n     services, only the Marines have attracted a sufficient number \n     of recruits in recent years.\n       Contributing factors include a strong economy, fewer \n     surviving military veterans to act as role models for their \n     sons and daughters, and a less adventurous mission as the \n     services adjust to the post-Cold War world without a clearly \n     defined enemy.\n       Caldera said the Army should adopt other means of testing a \n     potential recruit's abilities and should allow in more high \n     school dropouts who have passed high school equivalency \n     tests.\n       ``The Army is an institution that should not write off \n     young people in America who need a second chance,'' he added \n     at a breakfast with defense reporters. ``The military should \n     not be the one that slams the door of opportunity in your \n     face.''\n       Under Defense Department policy, 10 percent of new recruits \n     are allowed to be high school dropouts who have passed the \n     high school equivalency test and score well on armed services \n     entrance exams. But for many years, especially during the \n     downsizing of the 1990s, the services set much higher \n     standards in practice. They either required that all new \n     recruits have high school diplomas or allowed in only a few \n     with the equivalent of a diploma.\n       But as downsizing bottomed out several years ago and the \n     economy got stronger, recruiting stations went empty.\n       The Army fell 2,300 short of its recruiting goal in the \n     first quarter of fiscal year 1999 and Caldera said the \n     projected shortfall could go as high as 10,000 this year.\n       The Navy faced 6,900 empty positions last year. Although it \n     has reached its goal in the first quarter of fiscal year \n     1999, last month it announced it will increase from 5 to 10 \n     percent the number of high school dropouts it accepts.\n       The Air Force, which has faced a severe pilot shortage for \n     several years, projected it will be 2,000 pilots short of the \n     13,641 it says it needs by 2002. In addition, the Air Force \n     had a shortfall of 421 in its enlisted ranks for the first \n     quarter of this fiscal year and continued to slip in the \n     second quarter, said Air Force officials.\n       ``We're coming up on the greatest shortage we've ever had \n     in peacetime,'' said Lt. Col. Russ Frasz, an Air Force \n     recruiting official.\n       The services have responded to the problem with signing \n     bonuses, retention bonuses and more money for college \n     education. They have also put thousands more recruiters into \n     the field and tens of millions of dollars into new \n     advertising campaigns.\n       The Navy, for example, put 500 more recruiters on the \n     streets last year, opened 150 new recruiting stations and \n     increased its advertising budget this fiscal year from $58 \n     million to $70 million.\n       What it got in return was 9,012 new sailors, nearly 800 \n     more than it needed. But that was only for the first quarter \n     of the year and, given the shortfall in recent years, no one \n     in the Navy is relaxed about the future.\n       ``We are getting back on track but there is still hard work \n     to do,'' said Rear Adm.

Madam President, if you look at this chart we see the \nproblems the services are having in recruiting. This is the fourth \nchart on the floor that I have provided.\n  In 1998 the Army fell almost 800 recruits short of their goal, and \nare over 2,000 recruits short of their first quarter goal.\n  If we look at the Air Force, the Air Force's 1998 number was 600 \nrecruits short of their goal and over 400 recruits short in the first \nquarter.\n  Also, for the first time ever the Air Force will advertise on \ntelevision to increase their lagging numbers.\n  The Navy's 1998 shortfall was 6,892 recruits. While it met its first \nquarter, they had to raise their high school dropout rate acceptance \nfrom 5 percent to 10 percent.\n  These are troubling numbers and these numbers are one of the reasons \nwhy the Personnel Subcommittee, which I chair--my good friend, Senator \nCleland, is the ranking member--has called for its first hearing to \nfocus on recruitment and retention problems. We cannot allow our armed \nservices to become hollow due to the lack of personnel. The best way to \nensure that we recruit and retain the best and brightest is to pay them \nthe wages they deserve and provide the benefits to keep them.\n  While S. 4 does not directly address recruitment, it does make \nchanges which we believe will assist our military recruiters. Beyond \nthe pay raise incentives, the bill enhances the Montgomery GI bill \nbenefits. S. 4 will eliminate the $1,200 contribution required of \nmembers who elect to participate in the GI bill, increase monthly GI \nbill benefits anywhere between $60 to $70, allow service members to \ntransfer education benefits to immediate family members, and then to \naccelerate lump-sum benefits for an entire term, semester, or quarter \nat college, and full amounts for courses not leading to a college \ndegree.\n  The Armed Services Committee believes that these enhancements will \nmake entering the military more attractive to more people, especially \nwhen the private sector offers so many more options than in the past.\n  I will conclude with a few personal thoughts. I understand that this \nbill is not acceptable to all Senators, but if you plan on voting no, I \nask that you think about a few people--the young service man or woman \nwho is about to be sent to Kosovo, or the service member who is coming \nback from Bosnia, or even second tour of Bosnia; or about the pilot \npatrolling the no-fly zone in Iraq; or the sailor who is doing double \nduty because his ship is undermanned and so he will have to be away \nfrom his family longer than necessary. How will you tell them that they \nare not worth the extra money in S. 4?\n  Let me finish with a statement from a letter which I believe was \nprinted in the National Association of Uniformed Services Journal and \nreprinted in the Northern Colorado chapter of the Retired Officers \nAssociation's newsletter, entitled, ``Why Am I Getting Out?''\n\n       The bottom line is ``Patriotism is great, but it doesn't \n     put food on the table or provide for your family.'' One \n     soldier who requires food stamps is a shame. We can do better \n     for those from whom we ask so much.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I am honored to join with the \ndistinguished Senators who have been sponsoring and working for the \npassage of the bill that we believe will help our soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines to increase their pay, their retirement benefits, \nand other benefits. They will know that this Nation affirms them, \nbelieves in them, and cares about them, and is not going to stand by \nand allow recruitment and retention to go in the tank and to not give \nthem the kind of pay and benefits they have to have to live in this \nworld.\n  We have taken advantage of them in many ways, and it is time to put \nan end to that. We have done a lot of things to reduce our defense \nstructure. In 1992, we had 1.8 million men and women in the services. \nBy the year 2000, we will be at 1.38 million. We will drop another 24 \npercent during this period of time. But we, at the same time, increased \nthe pressures and responsibilities our service men and women are \nfacing. They are being sent around the world at greater and greater \nrates.\n  The operational tempo--the OPTEMPO they call it--has never been \nhigher. I had the opportunity recently to be with an Air Force officer \nin Montgomery, AL, at Maxwell Air Force Base. He told me he was in \nBosnia and received orders to be stationed in Korea. He called his wife \nwho was then in Montgomery and explained this situation to her, and she \nreplied, ``Well, you can go to Korea, I'm going back to North \nCarolina.''\n  These kinds of assignments may sound easy to people sitting in \nWashington, but it is important to families. They will do it. Our \nsoldiers and sailors give of themselves and sacrifice on a regular \nbasis, but they need to know we care about them, that we are willing to \npay them a decent wage, that we are going to maintain good retirement \nbenefits and health care benefits for them.\n  There has been a lack of confidence in that, and that, I believe, is \none reason retention is down--that and a good economy; people have more \nchoices. We have reduced our enlistment rates. It is harder and harder \nto enlist and most of the services are not meeting their enlistment \nrates now, their goals.\n  It is a matter of real importance. I salute Senator Wayne Allard who \nchairs our Personnel Subcommittee on Armed Services for his leadership, \nand Senator John Warner, the chairman of the committee, who made this a \ntop priority. We don't want to wait around with it. We want to pass it \nearly this session, and we want to be able to send a message to the men \nand women who stand ready at any time to defend this Nation, to send \nthem the message that we care about them, we are hearing their \nconcerns, and we are going to respond to them.\n  I recently had a conversation with a senior retired officer. We were \ntalking about the need to restore the 50-percent retirement. He said \none of the concerns that he had and that he was hearing among our \nservice men and women is that older NCO's --noncommissioned officers--\nare saying to younger NCO's, ``Well, I got a 50-percent retirement; \nsorry, you're not going to get that,'' and it makes them feel less \nappreciated. It makes them feel like they are not getting a fair shake, \nand it makes them more and more willing to give up a service that they \nmay really love and enjoy and believe in and take a job in the private \nsector.\n  So I think there are a lot of reasons why changing this retirement \nbenefit from 40 to 50 percent is what we need to do, and I salute \nSenator Allard for it.\n  I am also an absolutely committed supporter of the Federal \nGovernment's Thrift Plan. I think it is one of the best ideas that has \nbeen done for the men and women who work for the U.S. Government, and \nextending it to the military is a great idea. It should be done. They \nwill make their contributions, in effect, to an IRA.\n  As years go by, they will see that fund--that is, their fund--\nincrease and increase over the years. They will feel that that is an \nadditional benefit, an additional basis to stay in the active service \nof their country in the military and not get out at an earlier time.\n  I think it is also terrible, really shameful, that we have allowed \nlarge numbers of our service men and women to have to ask for food \nstamps. They qualify for food stamps. That is something we must end. I \nbelieve this bill understood that, and it will end that and give them \nthe opportunity to receive other compensations than having to go down \nto the food stamp office to ask for those benefits. I think we owe them \nthat.\n  Finally, Madam President, let me just say this. I talked to a senior \nofficer just today about the military and about this bill. He was \nextraordinarily supportive of it, but he told me this. He\n\n[[Page S1701]]\n\nsaid it is really more than just the money. Our people who make their \ncareer in the service of this country, who are prepared at any time to \ngive their life for their country, those people, those men and women, \nare committed to public service. And what we need to do most of all is \nto affirm them and to raise up the respect we give to them. They are \nprepared, at a moment's notice, to go in harm's way for the people of \nthis country.\n  So I believe this bill, in a way, does that. It is saying: We are \nhearing your concerns. We are going to move promptly. We are going to \nmake this legislation one of the top priorities of this Congress. We \nare going to move it out of here quickly. And we are going to get a \nraise to you and retirement changes that will benefit you, that will \nend food stamps for you, and give you a Thrift Plan opportunity you \nhave never had before. We are going to say we care about what you are \ndoing. We thank you for your service.\n  I believe that is the kind of signal we need to send. It is not all. \nWe have to deal with such things as spare parts, a national missile \ndefense. We have to decide whether we have enough people in the \nmilitary now. All these kinds of things we are going to be dealing with \nlater on in the year. But right now we need to move with this \nlegislation.\n  I thank the majority leader, Trent Lott, for being an early sponsor \nand supporter of it and for making a commitment to bring it up at an \nearly time. And again, let me say how much I have been honored to serve \nwith Senator Wayne Allard. He chairs the subcommittee where this \nlegislation has begun. He is doing an outstanding job for our Nation in \nso many different ways but particularly as chairman of this \nsubcommittee. I am also pleased to see Senator Levin here. He is the \nranking member of this committee and is committed to our Nation's \nstrength and defenses. And it is a pleasure to see that this \nlegislation is moving forward in an expeditious manner.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would just like to state that that was a great \nstatement that my colleague from Alabama made. And I just want him to \nknow what a pleasure and honor it is for me to be able to serve on \nArmed Services with him. We came together into this august body, and I \nlook forward to many years of working with him and trying to shore up \nthe defense of this country.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have long been a strong advocate for a \nwell-educated American work-force. Vermont's quality of life is related \nclosely to the educational opportunities available to her citizens. \nEducation is a cornerstone of our healthy economy. These same notions \napply with similar effect to our men and women in the military. Modern, \ntechnologically advanced systems and complex missions depend on the \nskills and wisdom of well-educated personnel. S. 4 modestly enhances \nthe educational opportunities for our men and women on active duty. It \nshould do the same for the members of our Guard and Reserve.\n  Consequently, I strongly urge my fellow Senators to support the three \neducation-related amendments which Senator Cleland and I will be \noffering to S. 4, the appropriately named ``Soldiers', Sailors', \nAirmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights.'' It is appropriate because one's \nuse of the term ``Bill of Rights'' invariably suggests the concepts of \nfairness and equity.\n  Perhaps Secretary of Defense William Cohen had this in the back of \nhis mind in September of 1997 when he instructed the Department of \nDefense to eliminate ``all residual barriers, structural and cultural'' \nto effective integration of the Guard, Reserve and Active Components \ninto a ``seamless Total Force.'' Precisely one year later his Deputy, \nJohn Hamre, looked back to that day and observed:\n\n       We have made great progress integrating our active and \n     Reserve forces into one team, trained and ready for the 21st \n     century. Our military leaders are getting the message. \n     Structural and cultural barriers that reduce readiness and \n     impedes interoperability between active and Reserve personnel \n     are gradually being eliminated. We must now assess the \n     progress we have made, acknowledge those barriers to \n     integration that still exist, and, most importantly, set our \n     plans into motion.\n\n  If these wise words are to have full effect we must work to rectify \nan oversight in S. 4, which, as written, enhances educational benefits \nfor a portion of our seamless Total Force but neglects the remainder. \nConsequently, to promote parity among all components of our military I \nwill be offering the following three amendments:\n  The first: Allow members of the Guard and Reserve the ability to \naccelerate payments of educational assistance in the same manner \ncurrently provided in S. 4 to the Active Duty military.\n  The second: Allow members of the Guard and Reserve the ability to \ntransfer their entitlement to educational assistance to their family \nmembers in the same manner currently provided in S. 4 to the Active \nDuty military.\n\n  The third: Allow members of the Guard and Reserve who have served at \nleast ten years in the Selected Reserve, an eligibility period of five \nyears after separation from the military to use their entitlement to \neducational benefits. (Active duty military members have a ten year \nperiod.)\n  Just a few weeks ago, four Reserve Component members lost their lives \nwhen their KC-135 went down in Germany while flying active duty \nmissions for the Air Force. Death did not discriminate between Active \nand Reserve Components. Nor should S. 4.\n  The opportunity to face this ultimate risk will only increase as we \ndo place greater demands on our Guard and Reserve units to participate \nin our global missions. Since Operation Desert Storm the pace of \noperations has swelled by more than 300% for the Guard alone and is \nwidely expected to climb higher.\n  We all know the value of the Guard and Reserve for missions close to \nhome. In Vermont they saved our citizens from the drastic effects of \nrecord setting ice storms last winter. Recently, other units helped \nwith hurricanes in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina. They \nassist our citizens during droughts and blizzards. They enrich our \ncommunities with Youth Challenge programs and they conduct an ongoing \nwar on drugs. Just last year we added protection of the U.S. from \nweapons of mass destruction to that list, and the list keeps growing.\n  It is now time to bring their educational benefits in balance.\n  As many of you know, I believe in the value of life-long learning to \nour society. Access to continuing education has become an essential \ncomponent to one's advancement through all stages of modern careers. S. \n4 modestly improves this access for our brave men and women on active \nduty. It should do the same for our Guard and Reserves.\n  I urge my colleagues to help bring parity, equity and fairness to the \neducational opportunities available to all components of our military. \nThe Guard and Reserve have been called upon increasingly to contribute \nto the Total Force. They face similar challenges to recruiting and \nretention. They should have similar access to educational \nopportunities.\n  Mr. President, let me now turn to another important amendment Senator \nCleland and I will be introducing. Specifically, we propose allowing \nour men and women in the Guard and Reserve the opportunity to \nparticipate in the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) in the same manner S. 4 \nprovides to their colleagues on active duty.\n  Allowing members of the Guard and Reserve to participate in the \nFederal Employees TSP is long overdue and I strongly support the \nproposal to make it law. This program is good for federal workers and \nit would benefit members of the Guard and Reserve financially for them \nto participate in the TSP. Under this system, they would be the sole \ncontributors to their accounts, much like civil servants who are under \nthe old Civil Service Retirement System. Since there would be no \nfederal match to their accounts the cost would be very low to the \nbranches of the military and to the taxpayers, as well. Additional \nsavings in individual accounts will be important to those individuals \nwho serve our nation in regular, but temporary capacities. The payroll \ndeduction feature of the TSP is an easy way to save. The accounts are \nmanaged prudently by the Thrift Savings Board. Participation in the \nsystem is high and satisfaction with it is also very high.\n  Those of us on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committees \nhave\n\n[[Page S1702]]\n\nbeen spending quite a bit of energy trying to encourage Americans to \nsave more money. As a New Englander, I speak for my constituents when I \nsay that we know a lot about THRIFT. This is a good amendment that will \nencourage thrift and I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  Given that our Guard and Reserve are shouldering an increasing share \nof our world-wide missions, they should have the same savings \nopportunity that S. 4 gives to the active duty. Now is the time to \nensure that our reserve component personnel are not overlooked.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to join my Senate \ncolleagues in supporting the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and \nMarines' Bill of Rights as it comes to the floor for debate. As a \nformer Marine, I am especially proud that the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee has recognized the important contribution of my branch of \nservice by including Marines in the title of this bill.\n  This bipartisan legislation addresses the critical need of improving \nretention in our military services. We've heard much over the past \nmonths about the impending crisis in maintaining the force strength of \nour military. For example, the Air Force has missed its recruitment \ntargets for the past three months, in all three of its recruitment \ncategories. This is the first time that the Air Force has ever faced \nthis problem. It is critical that we intervene now while the problem is \nstill manageable. This bill concentrates on improving the \nattractiveness of a career in the military, not only for new recruits, \nbut also for second and third term re-enlistments.\n  First, this bill raises the pay of service personnel to keep salaries \ncompetitive with civilian equivalents. Second, it provides incentives \nfor active duty personnel to keep longer service commitments by \nrepairing the damage done in 1986 to the military retirement system. \nThird, this bill provides service members with the opportunity to save \nfor their own retirement by allowing military personnel to contribute \nup to 5% of their base pay, before taxes, into the Thrift Savings Plan. \nFinally, this bill enhances the Montgomery GI Bill educational \nbenefits. I'm also aware that some of my colleagues will be offering \nother amendments that will further enhance the incentives for long term \nservice. These collective changes encourage both current and \nprospective service members to make the military an attractive \nalternative for an extended career.\n  One of the first commitments in the Constitution is to provide for \nthe common defense. We're demonstrating our commitment to the \nConstitution and our nation's defense today by taking this first step \nin improving the long-neglected quality of life for our service \nmembers. As we have already seen, when we don't take care of the people \nwho are out in harm's way, they end up leaving the service. We have \nalmost reached the point of needlessly risking the lives of those \nmembers choosing service careers due to the increased commitments \nrequired of them.\n  So, we shouldn't just stop with this bill and call our work complete. \nPay and Retirement incentives are not the only concerns voiced by \nmilitary personnel when they discuss quality of life. They care about \nbeing able to participate in their family's activities. They want to be \nable to help raise their children. They want to provide a home for \ntheir families where the roofs don't leak and the water and sewer \nsystems work. They want to be trained to handle the weapons they must \nuse to maximize their ability to survive in a firefight. In our push to \npass this piece of legislation, let's not forget that these other \nquality of life issues that service men and women weigh when they \nconsider the military as a life-long career. As a next step, we should \ncommit to eliminating the military construction backlog that has grown \nto a 100-plus-year maintenance cycle at its current funding level. \nThose who have seen military action in the Gulf or Panama or other \nregions will ask how Veterans are treated. We should commit to \nimproving veterans' heath care and access to the VA system. No service \nmember is naive enough to believe that military life will be easy or \nwithout sacrifice. However, we shouldn't intentionally be making the \nsacrifice for duty greater than it needs to be. Nor should we let the \nadministration's promise of improving true quality of life stop at pay \nand retirement benefits. We owe it to our service members to continue \naddressing all areas of quality of life to make sure that our \ncommitment of defense for the citizens of the United States is both \nreal and effective. I'll be using my position on the Appropriations \nCommittee as well as chairing the Military Construction Subcommittee to \npush for additional improvements in these other important quality of \nlife issues.\n  But let's not forget why we are here today. As demonstrated globally, \nthe quality of our uniformed service personnel is second to none. By \nproviding focused incentives for increasing the attractiveness of a \nmilitary career, we ensure that our services will sustain its worldwide \ncompetitive edge. We owe it to the parents, spouses, and children of \nour service members to make sure that their physical devotion to \npatriotism doesn't come at fiscal expense. This bill is a critical \nfirst step in meeting our commitments to both family and country. I \nstrongly encourage my colleagues to vote for its passage.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nand say farewell to an outstanding Marine Corps officer, Lieutenant \nColonel Chase Moseley, upon his retirement from the Marine Corps after \nmore than twenty-one years of commissioned service. Throughout his \ncareer, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley has served with distinction, and it \nis my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend \nhim for the superb service he has provided the Marine Corps and the \nNation.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Moseley, a native of the State of Mississippi, \ngraduated from the University of Southern Mississippi and was \ncommissioned a Second Lieutenant through the Platoon Leaders Class \nProgram in 1978. Since then, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley has spent his \ncareer patrolling the world's skies as a Naval Aviator. Following \nflight training, he began his service flying the F-4 Phantom in Marine \nFighter Attack Squadron 531 in El Toro, California. After his tour in \nCalifornia, he reported to Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232 in \nKaneohe, Hawaii, making two deployments to the Western Pacific and Far \nEast. In 1985, he reported to Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron \n101 in Yuma, Arizona for instructor duty. Completing F/A-18 training in \n1987, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley was again assigned instructor duty, \nnow flying the F/A-18 Hornet. During this tour, Lieutenant Colonel \nMoseley was selected to attend the Naval Fighter Weapons School \n(TOPGUN) and in July 1989 was selected to join the Naval Flight \nDemonstration Squadron ``Blue Angels'' in Pensacola, Florida. In 1991, \nLieutenant Colonel Moseley reported to Marine All Weather Fighter \nAttack Squadron 242 in El Toro, California to assist in the squadron's \ntransition to the new F/A-18 ``Delta'' (All Weather Night Attack) \naircraft. During this tour, he completed two Western Pacific \ndeployments serving as the Squadron Operations Officer and Executive \nOfficer.\n  When not in the air, Lieutenant Colonel Moseley has like-wise served \nwith distinction. In 1994, he served on the staff of the 5th Marine \nRegiment, 1st Marine Division, Camp Pendelton,\n\n[[Page S1703]]\n\nCalifornia as the Regimental Air Officer. In 1995, he was assigned to \nthe Marine Aviation Department at Headquarters Marine Corps, \nWashington, D.C. to serve as the Congressional Liaison Officer for the \nMarine Aviation Plans, Programs & Budget Branch. During this tour, \nLieutenant Colonel Moseley was selected for a Federal Executive \nFellowship in a national competition sponsored by the American \nPolitical Science Association and Johns Hopkins University for its \n1997-1998 Congressional Fellowship program. Upon completion of the \nCongressional Foreign Affairs program at Johns Hopkins University, \nLieutenant Colonel Moseley was selected to serve as the Military \nLegislative Assistant to Senator Trent Lott, U.S. Senate Majority \nLeader. Among Lieutenant Colonel Moseley's many awards and decorations \nare the Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Unit Commendation, \nMeritorious Unit Commendation with one star, the National Defense \nMedal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon with 4 stars.\n  During his more than twenty one-year career, Lieutenant Colonel \nMoseley has served the United States Marine Corps and our nation with \nexcellence and distinction. He has been an integral member of, and \ncontributed greatly to, the best-trained, best-equipped and best-\nprepared expeditionary combat force in the history of the world. \nLieutenant Colonel Moseley's strong leadership, integrity, and energy \nhave had a profound and positive impact on the United States Marine \nCorps and the Nation.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Moseley will retire from the United States Marine \nCorps on April 1, 1999, after twenty-one years and three months of \ndedicated commissioned service. On behalf of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, I wish Lieutenant Colonel Chase Moseley ``fair \nwinds and following seas.'' Congratulations on completion of an \noutstanding and successful career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1702-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE SANDRA K.

After nearly \nfive years in this position, Ms. Stuart is leaving government service \nto pursue other opportunities in the private sector. She definitely \nwill be missed by many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  I have enjoyed working with Ms. Stuart on a wide range of matters \naffecting the Department of Defense. I always found her to be extremely \nknowledgeable and very effective in representing the Department's \nviews. Despite the sometimes contentious nature of national security \nmatters, Ms. Stuart always maintained a friendly and constructive \napproach to her work which served our Nation very well.\n  Ms. Stuart had the difficult tasks of coordinating the Department of \nDefense's legislative agenda. She has deftly balanced a wide range of \nDefense-related issues, including Bosnia, missile defense, health care, \nreadiness, acquisition reform, and modernization. Because Ms. Stuart \nearned the trust and confidence of those with whom she worked, she was \nable to promote the Department's views very effectively in Congress.\n  Ms. Stuart's experience with the Congress predated her current \nposition as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs. \nBefore joining the Department of Defense in 1993, Ms. Stuart served as \nChief of Staff to Representative Vic Fazio of California who recently \nretired from Congress. In addition to managing his Congressional staff, \nMs. Stuart handled appropriations matters before the House Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  Ms. Stuart's legislative experience also includes work as an \nAssociate Staff Member of the House Budget Committee and as the Chief \nLegislative Assistant to Representative Bob Matsui of California.\n  Ms. Stuart is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at \nGreensboro and attended the Monterey College of Law. She is the mother \nof two sons, Jay Stuart, Jr. and Timothy Scott Stuart. She is married \nto D. Michael Murray.\n  Ms. Stuart earned the respect of every Member of Congress and their \nstaffs through hard work and her straightforward nature. As she now \ndeparts to share her experience and expertise in the civilian sector, I \ncall upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize her \noutstanding and dedicated public service and wish her all the very best \nin her new challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1703-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the \nSenate in sponsoring the National Missile Defense Act of 1999. This \nbill clearly states that the policy of the United States is to provide \nfor the defense of its territory against a potential missile attack by \na rogue nation.\n  A defense capability against missile attack is a necessity due to the \nincreased threat of terrorism. An arms control commission formed to \nassess the missile threat to the U.S. concluded that ``concerted \nefforts by a number of overtly or potentially hostile nations to \nacquire ballistic missiles with biological or nuclear payloads pose a \ngrowing threat to the United States, its deployed forces, and its \nfriends and allies.'' Experts suspect that these countries are \nacquiring unaccounted-for Russian nuclear bombs as part of this \ndevelopment effort. Regional stability is being threatened by weapons \nprograms in India, Pakistan, Iran, and others. North Korea is expected \nto be capable of a missile threat to U.S. citizens by 2010. The threat \nis very real. The Rumsfeld Commission concluded that the United States \nmay have ``little or no warning'' before facing a threat from these so-\ncalled ``rogue states.'' We must find a way to defend ourselves against \npotential attack from any terrorist country.\n  I have long supported the three tiered development of a National \nMissile Defense. Under these criteria, a missile defense could be \ndeployed after showing that (1) a specific missile threat has been \nidentified, (2) the technology has proven to be effective, and (3) the \nsystem is deemed affordable. As stated earlier, we've clearly confirmed \nthat the threat exists. The technology is proving to be increasingly \navailable. Most importantly, in a period where we are investing in \nmodernizing our defense capabilities, we would be negligent if we \nfailed to fund such a fundamental element of defense for our citizens. \nNow is the time to commit ourselves to completing the three steps and \ndeploying a missile defense for all Americans.\n  Senate Bill 257 is an important effort to document the will of the \nAmerican people. With the increasing missile threat posed by outlaw \ncountries, it is critical that the United States do everything in its \npower to prevent, reduce, deter, and defend against all weapons of mass \ndestruction and missiles. I strongly encourage my colleagues to support \nthe passage of this bill.\n  (Pursuant to a previous unanimous consent agreement, the following \nstatements pertaining to the impeachment proceedings were ordered \nprinted in the Record:)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1703-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1703-S1718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIAL OF WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. Chief Justice, the United States Senate has nearly \nconcluded only the second impeachment trial of a President in history. \nWe fulfilled our promise to conclude the process in an expeditious and \nresponsible manner in accordance to the Constitution.\n  Americans understand there is really only one person to blame for \nthis ordeal: Bill Clinton. He could have prevented the entire \nimpeachment process if he had chosen the truth instead of lies and \nobstruction and the well-being of the nation instead of his own \npersonal and political needs. He squandered his opportunity to provide \ntrustworthy leadership on the important issues facing America.\n  The President's actions left the Attorney General with no choice but \nto ask the Independent Counsel to investigate. They left the \nIndependent Counsel with no choice but to refer charges to the House of \nRepresentatives. They left the House with no choice but to impeach him.\n  The day Senators took that impeachment oath was one of the most \nserious, solemn times that I have experienced\n\n[[Page S1704]]\n\nduring my 18 years in the Senate. Our oath was to do impartial justice, \nand that oath was in my mind as I weighed the facts, the law, and the \nConstitution.\n  The President took an oath too. He took an oath to tell the truth, \nthe whole truth, and nothing but the truth.\n  I believe that clear and convincing evidence presented to the Senate \ndemonstrates that President Clinton did indeed commit multiple acts of \nperjury, as alleged in Article I, and multiple acts of obstruction of \njustice, as alleged in Article II, and deserves to be found guilty on \nboth articles of impeachment.\n  The President made a serious, serious mistake when he went to his \nPaula Jones deposition, raised his right hand and swore to tell the \ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, and then lied \nrepeatedly. Following that, he committed more acts of obstruction and \nmore lies, culminating in his testimony before the grand jury where he \nlied time and time again. He had obstructed justice and he had perjured \nhimself in the Jones case, and he wanted to be consistent, so he \nperjured himself again.\n  One of many specifics, concerning his ``conversations'' with Betty \nCurrie: ``I was trying to get the facts down. I was trying to \nunderstand what the facts were.'' He wasn't trying to understand the \nfacts. He knew what the facts were. He was trying to mislead a witness, \nand then he lied under oath after being begged, ``Don't do it again, \nMr. President.''\n  I believe the public deserves, and the Constitution permits, that the \nSenate demand a high standard of conduct in its President. Rather than \nfind a loophole to excuse the President's behavior, the Senate ought to \nfind him guilty.\n  The President's counsel have attempted to frame the question before \nthe Senate as ``[a]re we at that horrific moment in our history when \nour Union could be preserved only by taking the step that the framers \nsaw as the last resort?'' \\1\\ His lawyers are asking the wrong \nquestion. In fact, as Manager Canady pointed out, under this standard \neven the deeds of Richard Nixon may not have been worthy of \nimpeachment.\\2\\ The proper question is not whether America would \nsurvive President Clinton remaining in office: that answer is yes. The \nproper question before the Senate is whether, knowing what we now know \nabout his conduct, America should have to do so.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of speech.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Another of the President's lawyers argued that ``[i]f you convict and \nremove President Clinton on the basis of these allegations, no \nPresident will ever be safe from impeachment again[.]'' \\3\\ I, for one, \nhave a little more confidence that our future leaders will not commit \nfelonies, but if a future President commits the same crimes as \nPresident Clinton, I hope that President will face the same \nconstitutional response.\n  In fact, one familiar lawyer recognized that there is ``no question \nthat an admission of making false statements to government officials \nand interfering with the FBI is an impeachable offense.'' \\4\\ That \nlawyer was William Clinton, speaking in 1974.\n\n\n                       PUBLIC OR PRIVATE CONDUCT?\n\n  The President's defenders have argued that his errors were ``private \nacts'' which are irrelevant to the constitutional standards of public \nbehavior. But this was not about adultery. These charges would be just \nas valid even if he were never married. Let's also consider a few other \nfacts.\n  The President utilized his secretary to conceal evidence;\n  The President went out of his way to lie to his most senior aides, \nknowing they would repeat those lies to the grand jury;\n  The President supervised a massive and coordinated effort to have his \nstaff, on government time, repeatedly lie to the public on his behalf;\n  The President asserted one of his most precious powers, that of \nexecutive privilege, to keep government employees from cooperating with \na federal grand jury; and\n  There is evidence that official White House personnel attempted to \nsmear Ms. Lewinsky and other witnesses to bolster his bogus defense.\n  If this conduct is so private, why has the President dragged so many \npublic servants into his web of deceit and lies?\n  If the Senate were going to pass a censure resolution, perhaps it \nshould include language rebuking his private behavior which even his \nstaunchest defenders have recognized as reprehensible, reckless, and \nindefensible. However, we are sitting not as a court of morality, but \nas a court of impeachment which must decide whether the rule of law, as \nManager Hyde so eloquently explained, is a value so worthy of \nprotection that it requires removal of a twice-elected President.\n\n\n                   ATTACK ON THE SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT\n\n  Even more importantly, the President's conduct was not simply a \npersonal matter, but rather an attack on our system of government. Our \nsystem of justice, both civil and criminal, would collapse if lying \nunder oath was tolerated, tampering with witness' testimony was \npermitted or hiding of evidence was customary. Think of all of the \nplaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses who are involved in difficult or \nembarrassing situations involving bad investments, physical \naltercations, substance abuse, or adultery. How can we expect all of \nthem to tell the truth, produce the evidence, and abide by society's \nlegal standards about these matters when our President refused to do \nso?\n  Recognizing that the President still may face the criminal justice \nsystem, I believe it is entirely appropriate for the Senate to consider \nhow our judicial system reacts to perjury. Remember the 1998 quote from \na federal judge which Manager Buyer recounted:\n\n     [Congress does not] want people lying to grand juries. They \n     particularly don't want people lying to grand juries about \n     criminal offenses. They particularly don't want people lying \n     to grand juries about criminal offenses that are being \n     investigated. They don't like that. And Congress has said we \n     as a people are going to tell you if you do that, you're \n     going to jail and you're going to jail for a long time. And \n     if you don't get the message, we'll send you to jail again. \n     Maybe others will. But we're not going to have people coming \n     to grand juries and telling lies because of their children or \n     their mothers or fathers or themselves. It's just not \n     acceptable. The system can't work that way.\\6\\\n\n\n             A DOUBLE STANDARD FOR THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF?\n\n  Of all of the powers trusted to the President, possibly the most \nimportant is his role as Commander-in-Chief. His ability to lead the \nmilitary in times of war, and during every day of preparation, \ntraining, and planning which precedes violent conflict, depends in \nlarge part in the trust and confidence he can inspire in the \napproximately 1.2 million men and women he commands. These men and \nwomen are subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice: the \nPresident should be grateful he is not, for he likely would be facing \ncourt martial for his actions. At a minimum, he likely would be found \nguilty of the following offenses:\n  False official statements--Article 107;\n  Perjury--Article 131;\n  Conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman--Article 133;\n  False swearing--Article 134;\n  Obstruction of justice--Article 134; and\n  Subornation of perjury--Article 134.\n  As Manager Buyer reminded us:\n\n       In every warship, every squadbay, and every headquarters \n     building throughout the U.S. military, those of you who have \n     traveled to military bases have seen the picture of the \n     Commander in Chief that hangs in the apex of the pyramid that \n     is the military chain of command. You should also know that \n     all over the world military personnel look at the current \n     picture and know that, if accused of the same offenses as \n     their Commander in Chief, they would no longer be deserving \n     of the privilege of serving in the military.\\7\\\n\n  We all remember the publicity surrounding the case of Kelly Flynn, \nforced to resign from the Air Force for adultery and false statements. \nBut there are many others, including the pending case of Air Force \ncaptain Joseph Belli. Captain Belli is currently awaiting trial, and \nfaces up to 27 years in military prison, for having an adulterous \naffair with a female airman on the base at Diego Garcia, then asking \nboth his wife and his lover to lie about it. Although Captain Belli \nasked to resign and although his wife asked that the charges, which she \nfirst raised, be dropped, the prosecution goes on. What do you think \nCaptain Belli would think of an acquittal of President Clinton?\n\n\n                  DOUBLE STANDARD COMPARED TO JUDGES?\n\n  One of the bedrock principles of our system of justice is stare \ndecisis, that\n\n[[Page S1705]]\n\nis following precedent. One question before us is whether making false \nstatements under oath merits conviction and removal. The Senate has \nclear and recent precedent that answers this exact question. In 1986, \nJudge Harry Claiborne was convicted by votes of 90-7 and 89-8 for \nmaking false statements under oath on his tax returns. In 1989, Judge \nWalter Nixon was convicted by votes of 89-8 and 78-19 for making false \nstatements to a federal grand jury. Also in 1989, Judge Alcee Hastings \nwas convicted by a votes of 68-27, 69-26, 67-28, 67-28, 69-26, 68-27, \nand 70-25 for making false statements under oath. The Senate has spoken \ndecisively, repeatedly, and recently on this question: making false \nstatements under oath is an offense worthy of impeachment and \nconviction.\n  As Manager Hyde noted, ``This country can survive with a few bad \njudges, a few corrupt judges; we can make it; but a corrupt President, \nsurvival is a little tougher there.'' \\8\\ Legal commentator Stuart \nTaylor phrased it well: ``While removing him would be uniquely \ntraumatic, his alleged crimes . . . are uniquely visible, and thus \nuniquely menacing to the rule of law, to trust in government, and to \nthe national culture.'' \\9\\\n  Moreover, we know what the Founders thought of perjury: the very \nfirst Congress enacted ``An Act for the Punishment of Certain Crimes \nAgainst the United States'' which made perjury a federal crime. Rather \nthan creating a lower standard of conduct for the President, I believe \nthe Senate should hold the President to the same or even a higher \nstandard.\n  And we should ask the President, if he discovered that a person he \nwas considering for a judicial nomination had committed the acts which \nhave been proven in this case, would he still nominate that individual? \nI think we know the answer.\n\n\n                       DISCUSSION OF THE ARTICLES\n\n                ARTICLE I--PERJURY BEFORE THE GRAND JURY\n\n  I believe the evidence shows a pattern of perjury which deserves \nconviction. In describing how the lies were not few in number or in \nimportance, Manager McCollum captured the essence of the President's \ngrand jury testimony: ``This is about a pattern. This is about a lot of \nlies.''\\10\\\n  In the weeks leading up to the President's grand jury testimony, \nAmericans of all political persuasions offered unsolicited advice to \nthe President to ``come clean'' before the grand jury, to admit any \nembarrassing conduct, and, above all, to tell the truth. They advised \nhim that testimony which was ``evasive, incomplete, misleading--even \nmaddening,'' as the President's own lawyer described his deposition \ntestimony, would not suffice before the grand jury.\\11\\ Rather than \nheed this advice, however, the President decided to ignore his oath \n``to the tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,'' \nand instead, to paraphrase Manager Rogan, decided to tell the evasive \ntruth, the incomplete truth, and nothing but the misleading truth.\\12\\\n  It is true, as counsel for the President argue, that the President \ndid make many admissions during his appearance which no doubt were \npainful: that he had had an affair with a subordinate employee not even \nhalf his age, and that he had misled the American people, his family, \nand aides. Sprinkled amidst these admissions, however, were numerous \nlies and half-truths. These statements were obviously under oath, they \nwere material to the grand jury's investigation, and they were \nintentional. Thus, they constitute perjury. The claim by the \nPresident's counsel that ``he told the truth, the whole truth, and \nnothing but the truth for 4 long hours'' is complete nonsense.\\13\\\n  Simply put, the President decided that his personal and political \nneeds were more important than the rights of the grand jury to receive \ntruthful testimony or his obligation to comply with federal law. For \nthese statements, which deceived a legitimately constituted federal \ngrand jury investigating criminal conduct not only of the President, \nbut of others, the President deserves to be convicted on Article I.\n  For instance, I believe that the President lied when he claimed his \ngoal during the deposition ``was to be truthful'' and again when he \nsaid ``I was determined to work through the minefield of this \ndeposition without violating the law, and I believe I did.'' \\14\\ No \nperson who has read or seen the President's deposition can really \nbelieve that he was trying to be truthful.\n  For example, when asked during the deposition, ``at any time have you \nand Monica Lewinsky ever been alone together in any room in the White \nHouse?'', the President replied `` . . . it seems to me that she was on \nduty on a couple of occasions working for the legislative affairs \noffice and brought me some things to sign, something on the weekend.'' \n\\15\\ No reasonable person could believe that his goal in responding \nthis question was to be truthful. And the President, a lawyer, a former \nlaw professor, and a former attorney general of his state, could not \nhave believed that he had not violated the law when he answered \nquestions in this manner.\n  I need to address briefly the defense argument that the Senate is \nforbidden from considering the Jones deposition because the specific \narticle alleging perjury was defeated on the House floor--remember Ms. \nSeligman's claim that the deposition ``answers are not before you and \nthe managers' sleight of hand cannot now put them back into article \nI.'' \\16\\\n  On December 11, 1998, when the House Judiciary Committee considered \nthe articles of impeachment against the President, subsection 2 of \nArticle I read exactly as it does today alleging perjury in the grand \njury about the ``prior perjurious, false and misleading testimony he \ngave in a Federal civil rights action brought against him.'' No member \nof the Committee offered a motion to strike or amend this provision. \nThe subarticle remained unchanged when it was debated on the House \nfloor. All 435 Members of the House were on notice that this section of \nArticle I clearly charged the President with lying before the grand \njury about his Jones deposition testimony. The fact that a separate \narticle of impeachment dealing solely with the deposition was defeated \non the House floor has absolutely no impact on the contents of Article \nI.\n  Moving to the remainder of Article I, I believe that the evidence \ntends to show that the President was lying when he stated to the grand \njury that ``I was not paying a great deal of attention to this \nexchange'' when his attorney, Robert Bennett, argued for a lengthy \nperiod of time that the President should not have to answer questions \nabout Monica Lewinsky because of her affidavit, known by the President \nto be false.\\17\\ The videotape of the deposition clearly shows \nPresident Clinton staring directly at his attorney when these \nmisrepresentations were made, and then closely following the back-and-\nforth between Bennett, Judge Wright, and Jones' counsel.\n  I also believe that the evidence demonstrates clearly that the \nPresident perjured himself during his testimony concerning his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  Part Four of Article I concerns the President's grand jury testimony \nconcerning the various allegations of obstruction of justice contained \nin Article II. I discuss my views on the substantive obstruction counts \nbelow, but I also conclude that the President committed multiple acts \nof perjury in discussing and denying his role in these events. For \nthose who argue that the allegations of perjury only deal with sex, I \ninvite you to read the President's answers to the questions about the \nalleged obstruction: some defy common sense, most conflict with more \ncredible accounts provided by other witnesses, and many are perjurious, \nfalse, and misleading.\n\n\n                               ARTICLE II\n\n  The evidence concerning certain of the allegations of obstruction is \nstrong, and would meet the legal requirements of Title 18 were this a \ncriminal trial. While the White House defense would urge us to consider \nthe President's ``record on civil rights, on women's rights[,]'' \\18\\ I \nwould urge all Senators to remember that it is easy to talk a good \ngame, but when another American citizen sought to exercise her rights, \nthe President played a different one. To use a phrase, the President \nwanted to win too badly.\n  For instance, the evidence that the President tampered with a \npotential witness, Betty Currie, is convincing. As Manager McCollum \npointed out, Ms. Currie's testimony in this matter is undisputed.\\19\\ \nJust hours after he fed the Jones' lawyers numerous lies, the President \ncalled Currie and demanded\n\n[[Page S1706]]\n\nthat she come to Oval Office on a Sunday. He then accosted her with a \nlist of falsehoods, such as ``You were always there when she was there, \nright?'' \\20\\ The President clearly knew Currie was a potential witness \nin the Jones case, not only because he had mentioned her repeatedly \nduring the deposition, but also because he knew that the Jones lawyers \nobviously knew there was some relationship between he and Lewinsky and \nthat they would continue to follow that lead.\n  Even worse, according to Currie's testimony and evidence in the \nrecord, when it was known that the Office of Independent Counsel was \ninvestigating, the President saw Currie again, and repeated his \ncoaching. By this time, Currie was clearly a witness to a grand jury \ninvestigating federal crimes. Both of these conversations constituted \nwitness tampering under Title 18 and warrant conviction.\n  Moreover, in attempting to explain away his crime during his \nappearance before the grand jury, the President clearly perjured \nhimself. His answers, which included the hilarious claims that he was \ntrying to ``refresh my memory'' and ``I was trying to get the facts \ndown. I was trying to understand what the facts were'' are perjury.\\21\\ \nThe fact that Ms. Currie was willing to recount these encounters to the \ngrand jury does not diminish in the slightest the fact that the \nPresident illegally tried to coach her.\n  But this episode of obstruction was only part of a continuing \npattern. Clear circumstantial evidence proves that the President \nparticipated in a scheme to hide evidence under subpoena by Paula \nJones. The evidence shows that Lewinsky suggested that she make sure \nthat the many gifts the President had given her were not at her \nresidence, specifically suggesting to the President that Betty Currie \ncould hide them from the Jones attorneys. Lo and behold, hours later, \nCurrie, having no idea that Lewinsky was under subpoena to turn over \ngifts, called Lewinsky after having seen the President at the White \nHouse and said something to the effect of ``I know you have something \nfor me or the President said you have something for me.'' \\22\\ The two \narranged to meet, Lewinsky sealed the gifts in a taped box, handed the \nbox over to Currie, who hid it under her bed.\n  There are two explanations for how this obstruction happened. One, \nBetty Currie suddenly had a vision that she should call Lewinsky to see \nif she needed help in her plans to obstruct justice. Or two, the \nPresident communicated, explicitly or obliquely, that Currie should \ncall Lewinsky to execute her scheme. Deciding which of these scenarios \nis more plausible is not difficult. Moreover, the idea, advanced by the \nPresident's defense, that he did not care if Lewinsky produced to the \nJones attorneys all 24 gifts he had given her, is ridiculous. Can \nanybody really think that the Jones attorneys would have taken a look \nat the pile of gifts and said ``well, there are only 24 gifts--I guess \nthere was nothing going on there.''\n  I also believe Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that the President suggested \nto her that she could supply the Jones attorneys their long-standing \n``cover stories''--that she was delivering papers or visiting Currie \nwhen in fact she was coming to visit the President. The President's \ncounsel have done their best to confuse this issue by linking it with \nthe events surrounding Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit. But her deposition \ntestimony is clear that the President reminded her during a 2 A.M. \nphone call, after she was on the Jones witness list, that if she ended \nup testifying--that is, if the affidavit was unsuccessful--that she \nshould use the cover stories they had developed:\n\n       Q: . . . did you talk about cover story that night \n     (December 17, 1997)?\n       A: Yes, sir.\n       Q: And what was said?\n       A: Uh, I believe that, uh, the President said something--\n     you can always say you were coming to see Betty (Currie) or \n     bringing me papers.\n       Q: . . . You are sure he said that that night?\n       A: Yes.\\23\\\n\n  As the Managers pointed out, this scheme, which was ``not illegal in \nits inception--simply trying to keep the relationship private--did in \nfact deteriorate into illegality once it left the realm of private life \nand entered that of public obstruction.'' \\24\\\n  And on the issue of making false statements to top aides, knowing \nthese lies would be repeated to the grand jury, the President is guilty \nboth of obstruction and perjury. The fact that the President was also \nlying to the American people is irrelevant to this charge. The facts \nare that the President was denying this workplace relationship, that he \nknew the Independent Counsel was attempting to prove it was true, and \nhe knew his top aides working in his close proximity would be called \nbefore the grand jury to find out whether they had seen or heard of the \nrelationship. The false information he passed to them, including much \nmore than just false denials, clearly obstructed the grand jury's \ninvestigation.\n  I also believe the evidence concerning unusual job assistance \nprovided to Monica Lewinsky through the President's close friend, \nVernon Jordan, and the President's blatant failure to interrupt his \nattorney's unknowing attempt to utilize Ms. Lewinsky's false affidavit \nbolsters the Managers' charges of obstruction.\n  The Senate has never faced the question whether obstruction of \njustice is an offense worthy of conviction and removal from office. \nLuckily, this is not a difficult question. No less than perjury, \nobstruction of justice and witness tampering interfere with the \ngathering of truthful evidence and testimony that is the lifeblood of \nour civil and criminal courts. Our Federal Sentencing Guidelines \nrecognize the detrimental effects of these acts, providing for tougher \nsentences for obstruction than for general acts of bribery.\n  In conclusion, consider whether instead of lying and obstructing in \nthe Jones case, the President had paid bribes to Lewinsky and Judge \nWright. Would the President's defenders still claim that this was \nprivate conduct? No, they could not, and the effect of the perjury and \nobstruction is the same.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Throughout these proceedings, the President's counsel and defenders \nhave cited his popularity as a new type of legal defense to the \ncharges: Senator Bumpers said ``the people are saying `Please don't \nprotect us from this man.' '' \\25\\ In fact, I believe his popularity, \nlargely a result of economic factors not of his making, means the \nSenate should give even closer scrutiny to the charges. I would argue, \nas did Manager Canady, that a President able to get away with crimes \nbecause of his popularity is the greatest danger to our system of \ngovernment, exactly the type of danger that the Framers envisioned when \ntrusting the Senate with the power of removal.\\26\\ Remember how \nAlexander Hamilton spoke of the Senate's role:\n\n       Where else, than in the Senate could have been found a \n     tribunal sufficiently dignified, or sufficiently independent? \n     What other body would be likely to feel confidence enough in \n     its own situation, to preserve unawed and uninfluenced the \n     necessary impartiality between an individual accused, and the \n     representatives of the people, his accusers? \\27\\\n\n  As Manager Graham pointed out, a Senator voting to convict the \nPresident for his actions is placing a ``burden on every future \noccupant'' of the office of the President to avoid this type of \nconduct.\\28\\ Asking our Presidents to obey the law and to respect the \njudicial process are burdens that I am willing to place on future \nPresidents.\n  President Clinton is guilty of perjury. He is guilty of obstruction \nof justice. He must be removed from office.\n  The House and its Managers admirably fulfilled their Constitutional \nand moral responsibilities. I can say confidently that Senate \nRepublicans kept their promises to conduct a fair and expeditious trial \nand to protect the Constitution. The just cause of impeachment is \nnearly over.\n  Congress will then be able to focus on its full-time job: securing a \nbetter quality of life for all Americans. During the coming months, \nCongress will move forward with an aggressive agenda to provide an \nacross-the-board tax cut, improve educational opportunities for our \nchildren, strengthen our national security, and ensure a sound Social \nSecurity and retirement system that provides Americans with the best \npossible return on their investments.\n  I am anxious to roll up my sleeves, get to work, and make the most of \nthe opportunities ahead in the 106th Congress.\n\n                               Footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ 145 Cong.

S289 (January 16, 1999) (statement of \n     Manager Graham).\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. Chief Justice, as I begin, as so many of my \ncolleagues have, I would like to thank our leaders for their tremendous \npatience--Tom, for your steady hand and, Trent, for your good sense of \nhumor.\n  Before I get into the core of my remarks, I would like to say that \nthis ordeal has been, indeed, trying for all of us, but I believe it \nhas strengthened us individually and as a body. We have come to know \neach other far better. We have gained a deeper appreciation of our \nindividual strengths and gifts. And I am more than satisfied, \nparticularly in listening to my colleague, Olympia Snowe, that this \ncountry is in good hands with the men and women here in this chamber.\n  Besides gaining a deeper appreciation for each other and for the \nSenate itself, we have also shared a great history lesson. For some of \nus, it has been our first in-depth study of these portions of our \nhistory; for others, it has been a timely refresher course; and to one \namong us, Senator Robert C. Byrd, I trust a rewarding experience as \nyour words and writings on this important constitutional question have \nbrought calm and clarity to our deliberations.\n  So many excellent points have been made in these last days. And I \ndon't want you all to repeat this outside--and I know you can't--\nbecause people would say I am crazy, but I have enjoyed every single \nmoment of these last three days. There has been a lot of talk about our \nConstitution and the Framers intent regarding the impeachment clause. \nMany have been mentioned. I will only venture to offer one that has to \nmy knowledge not been mentioned yet because it strikes me as \nparticularly timely, important and ironic. That is the argument of the \nanti-Federalist faction who fought vigorously for an impeachment \nprovision, because they believed according to Madison, ``. . . that the \nlimitations of the period of service''--and they were speaking about an \nExecutive--``was not sufficient security.''\n  They believed that in creating a federal government it would quickly \nget out of control and out of step with the sentiments of the American \npeople. Their fears were palpable. According to some scholars, as \noutlined in Senator Biden's brief, this charge of possible \n``corruption, intrigue, tyranny and arrogance'' between elections by \nthe chief executive was so strong that it was almost fatal to the \nratification of the Constitution by the states.\n  It is, indeed, ironic that we are in the process of conducting an \nimpeachment against a president that seems by all impartial and \nobjective analysis--despite his personal failings--to be in step with \nthe American people, in step with their wishes and their hopes for this \ncountry, in step with their ideas for a domestic and an international \nagenda.\n  The latest independent analysis by the New York Times and CNN \npublished today shows that 70% of the American people--a clear \nmajority--believe that the President should not be removed from office. \nI know that people have rejected talk of analysis and polling. When I \nwas writing this, I felt some hesitation of even bringing it up because \nI come from a family that wears as a badge of honor the ability to \nstand alone against great odds. In the 1950's, 60's, and 70's, as one \nof nine siblings born to parents who were civil rights leaders, it is \nthe only way I knew. I grew up listening to my father tell stories \nabout his lone vote against the Jim Crow laws in the Louisiana \nLegislature. I grew up thinking that was the right thing to do. I \nbelieve at this time, it still is.\n  But as the Bible would infer, there is a time to lead and there is a \ntime to listen. For those who are still struggling at this last hour \nwith your decision, regardless of how strongly you might feel about \nwhat the President did, I respectfully suggest that you can find \ncomfort in the wisdom of the people.\n  Should we make all of our decisions based on polls and public opinion \nsurveys? Absolutely not. However, this particular situation is \ndifferent. Let me point out two important distinctions.\n  One, this is not a regular issue. The people know a lot about this \ncase. They have a clear high-tech, 20th century view of the currents \nand events shaping it. All of them: the good, the bad, and the ugly. It \nhas been the most publicized and analyzed political/legal case of this \ncentury and perhaps all of history.\n  Two, this is the greatest and most admired democracy on the face of \nthe earth. As Patrick Moynihan so eloquently pointed out: One so rare \nand precious, it is truly a treasure. In such a democracy, the people's \nvoices should count.\n  Thomas Jefferson said, ``Democracy is cumbersome, slow and \ninefficient.'' Over the last twelve months, we can certainly attest to \nthat. ``But,'' he said, ``in due time, the voice of the people will be \nheard and their latent wisdom will prevail.''\n  As for me, I voted to dismiss both articles at the first appropriate \nopportunity. I did so after careful review of the facts, the evidence \nand a reading of the relevant parts of the Constitution and the other \nappropriate historical documentation. My colleague, Olympia Snowe, and \nothers have eloquently gone through many of the details of the case, \nand I will not take time to repeat them now.\n  I concluded that the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, \nwhile serious indeed, overlaid an immoral but not a criminal act \nagainst the state, one that is essentially private and not a public \nact. Therefore, in my judgment the charges did not rise to the level of \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors, a high constitutional bar which has \nserved us exceedingly well over the last 223 years.\n  So today for those same reasons, and in respect for the people of \nthis democracy, I will vote to acquit the President on both charges.\n  As I said in an earlier statement, which at this time I would like to \nadd to this record, this vote should not be interpreted as approval of \nthe President's actions which were reckless, irresponsible and showed a \nserious lack of judgment. A sexual dalliance with a White House intern \nand the subsequent breach of the public trust will cast a deep shadow \nover his other notable accomplishments and will forever tarnish his \npresidential legacy.\n  I cast this vote and find my comfort in a clear conscience, in the \nConstitution, and in the will of the people.\n  In closing, let me make one last appeal. Let us put forth a strong \ncensure resolution. One that doesn't attempt to provide cover for \neither political party or to make us feel better or worse about our \nvotes. We can all defend our votes, and certainly we will be called on \nto do so. Let us, rather, craft a resolution which could receive a \nmajority support of both parties. The wording should condemn the \nPresident's actions in the strongest terms and call for a national \nreconciliation.\n\n\n                       Upholding the Constitution\n\n  Several weeks ago the Senate took up the somber Constitutional task \nof sitting in judgment of a president in an impeachment trial. \nThroughout the trial, I have limited public comment to underscore the \nimpartiality I have brought to this process. Both sides have now spoken \nand I have reviewed all of the evidence as required by the\n\n[[Page S1708]]\n\nConstitution. My decision has been made: the actions of President \nClinton, while wrong, indefensible and reckless, do not meet the \nConstitutional standards for removal from office. Therefore I have \nvoted to dismiss the Articles of Impeachment against the President.\n  From the start, I have tried to focus on what the Framers of the \nConstitution had in mind when they carefully crafted the Impeachment \nClause. It is important to remember that for more than 100 years the \ncolonies suffered under the thumb of the tyrannical kings of the \nEnglish monarchy. A principle goal of the Framers was to have a \nmechanism to protect the populace from corrupt and oppressive leaders.\n  In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison argued \nthat impeachment be used only for ``distinctly political offenses \nagainst the state.'' Our Founders were trying to guard against tyranny \nand oppression, and not personal actions no matter how reprehensible. \nMore than 700 noted legal and historical scholars, both conservative \nand liberal, agree with this constitutional interpretation of the \nimpeachment clause.\n  The Founders were also rightly concerned that impeachment might be \nemployed as a partisan tool to undermine, even destroy, high ranking \ngovernment officials--especially the President. They worried a \n``powerful partisan majority'' might misuse it for public gain. The \nHouse impeachment vote, which essentially fell along party lines, is \ntroubling. Such partisanship was absent during the Watergate \nproceedings. At that time Republicans and Democrats on the House \nJudiciary Committee joined together to vote for impeachment because the \nevidence showed crimes were committed against the government.\n  I also voted against calling witnesses because it is clear that a \ncomplete and fair trial can and should be conducted on this voluminous \nand well-publicized record. Our nation deserves to be spared this \nprotracted spectacle, particularly at a time when public \ndisillusionment of government is at an all-time high and issues like \nSocial Security, education and international crises demand our \nimmediate attention.\n  Critics of this position will somehow believe that President Clinton \nhas avoided punishment. On that issue, let me make two points. First, \nthe power of impeachment was never meant to punish the president, but \nto protect the nation. Second, the president has already suffered by \nhis reckless behavior and, unfortunately, so has his family. In \naddition, criminal charges could be brought against him once he leaves \noffice, and he is still subject to civil charges. Worst of all, his \ninappropriate and reckless behavior and the subsequent breach of public \ntrust will cast a permanent shadow over his other notable \naccomplishments and will forever tarnish his presidential legacy.\n  In 1868 Senator James G. Blaine voted to convict and remove Andrew \nJohnson, the only other president to be impeached. Twenty years later \nhe said he had made a ``bad mistake'' and recanted. Upon further \nreflection he realized that the charges did not warrant the ``chaos and \nconfusion'' of removing President Johnson from office. Likewise, these \ncharges do not warrant the ``chaos and confusion'' that could occur \nshould our last presidential election be overturned.\n  At the conclusion of this trial, I plan to cosponsor a strong censure \nresolution of President Clinton concluding that his conduct in this \nmatter has brought shame and dishonor to himself and the Office of the \nPresident. In my opinion, it would bring a sensible end to this \nregrettable chapter in American political history. Finally, the \nultimate political judgments will be made by the people in future \nelections. And the lasting judgment will be made by the only One who \ncan.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. Chief Justice, thank you very much. I \nwould certainly give more than a penny for your thoughts on this \nmatter. But I am afraid we will probably never know.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I have been proud to be a U.S. Senator ever since \nthat day over 8 years ago when I took the oath of office and my \ncolleague, Senator Byrd, told me that I was the 1,794th person to serve \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  During my tenure in the Senate, I have learned to respect my \ncolleagues even when I strongly disagree with them on the issues of the \nday. I have challenged colleagues on issues and maybe at times even \ncriticized their votes. But I have never challenged a colleague's \nmotives and I never will. I respect each and every one of you and the \nhigh office you hold.\n  I consider it a great honor to serve in this body, and serve with \nsome giants here--Senator Helms, Senator Thurmond, Senator Byrd, to \nname a few.\n  I remember when I came to the floor of the Senate and signed that \nbook as No. 1,794. Senator Byrd reminded me of the significance of \nthat. And I have never forgotten it.\n  I also sit at the desk of Daniel Webster. It is a constant reminder \nthat I am just a temporary steward occupying this seat in the U.S. \nSenate. It is also a reminder that we will move on. But the \nConstitution will not move on. The Constitution will endure forever. \nOur role here in this proceeding is to preserve the Constitution and \nthe Presidency. Yes--even if it means we have to remove the President.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, when the rollcall is called tomorrow, I will be \nvoting ``guilty'' on both of the articles that are now before the \nSenate. It is clear that the Senate will not be finding President \nClinton guilty on either article. But I just want to say regarding \ncensure that my vote is my censure. I think anyone who votes to find \nhim guilty does not need to be concerned about censure.\n  As I contemplate my vote, I am reminded of a prayer offered in 1947 \nby a former Chaplain of the Senate, Rev. Peter Marshall. Reverend \nMarshall prayed: ``Our Father in Heaven . . . help us to see that it is \nbetter to fail in the cause that will ultimately succeed than to \nsucceed in a cause that will ultimately fail.''\n  I have faith that the cause in which I believe will ultimately \nprevail, because I believe that history will judge that President \nClinton is, in fact, guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors that \nwarrant his removal from office. I know others respectfully disagree. \nAnd believe me, I respect that disagreement.\n  Many of my colleagues have spoken on the instability a guilty verdict \nwould cause for the Nation. We should never remove a President unless \nthere is clear and present danger to the Nation, they say. With \nrespect, colleagues, I submit to you that the double standard that we \nhave set for our leader will ignite a cynicism directed against all of \nus. A cynicism is a clear and present danger to society.\n  With a not guilty verdict, you will tell the American people that \nperjury and obstruction of justice for the President are acceptable; \nthat those who put their lives on the line for our Nation every day in \nour Armed Forces have a higher standard than the Commander in Chief; \nand that for everyone else in America who lose their jobs because of \nperjury and obstruction, that is not acceptable.\n  We reap what we sow. In my view, respectfully, history will judge us \nharshly for this. And I say that in great humbleness. It is my view. A \nnot guilty verdict is a short-term victory for the President. It is a \nlong-term defeat for truth, for honor, for integrity, for the \nPresidency, and, in my view, for the Constitution.\n  As Peter Marshall intimated in his prayer, with a not guilty verdict \nwe have succeeded in a cause which I believe will ultimately fail.\n  My colleagues, we are all elected officials. And I want to comment \nabout this partisanship. I say it in the spirit of bipartisanship. We \nhave all been through the same ordeal together here. The nasty \nfundraising, the ad wars, dirty campaign tactics, thousands of miles of \ntravel, neglecting our families, hours and hours away from home, much \nto the detriment of our own health and financial well-being. We do it \nall the time. And for anyone inside or outside this institution to \nsuggest that my vote, or your vote, or anyone's vote in here is based \non partisanship not only makes me sick, it makes me bristle with anger.\n  What are my colleagues really saying when they invoke the word \n``partisanship''? Do you really believe that the impeachment of the \nPresident of the United States by a majority of the Members of the \nHouse of Representatives, the body that is elected every 2 years, gives \nclosure to the people, and\n\n[[Page S1709]]\n\nthe body elected by the same voters who elect one-third of us every 2 \nyears would impeach the President of the United States because he is a \nDemocrat? Even to imply that is unworthy, it is arrogant, and it is \nbelow the dignity of this very seat that you now hold. Have you \nforgotten the ``war'' that James Carville declared on Ken Starr a year \nor so ago, and on the Republicans, to protect the innocent Bill \nClinton?\n  Was that partisan? Was the President totally innocent? Partisanship \nhas no place in this Senate, especially when it sits as a Court of \nImpeachment. We are here to do impartial justice, to be unbiased triers \nof fact. Yet, we have allowed that runaway partisan train of White \nHouse apologists, I might say, to rumble into the Senate with no \nbrakes.\n  One of my colleagues mentioned the courage of Republicans who voted \nagainst impeachment in the House. How about the Democrats who voted to \nimpeach? Are they, by implication, cowards?\n  Alexander Hamilton would be appalled at the notion of partisanship in \nan impeachment trial. Indeed, writing in the Federalist Papers, \nHamilton said that the impeachment of the President ``will seldom fail \nto agitate the passion of the whole community, and to divide it into \nparties more or less friendly to the accused.\n  ``There will always be the greatest danger,'' Hamilton warned, ``that \nthe decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the \nparties, than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.''\n  Mr. Chief Justice, there was a hero of the Revolutionary War era, Dr. \nJoseph Warren. He was a doctor. He didn't have to serve; he was 34 \nyears old. His colleagues begged him not to go. But he picked up arms \nat Bunker Hill at 34 years old and he said, ``Our country is in danger. \nOn you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide the important \nquestions upon which rest the happiness and the liberty of millions yet \nunborn. Act worthy of yourselves.'' He was killed at the Battle of \nBunker Hill.\n  We don't act worthy of ourselves when we let partisanship enter into \nthis trial, or even accuse one another of it. Why is it, when Democrats \nmarch in lockstep on a vote, that we Republicans are the only ones \nbeing accused of partisanship?\n  Why are the House Republicans partisan because they vote out the \narticles, yet the Democrats who vote to block them are not partisan?\n  I have served with Henry Hyde in the U.S. House of Representatives, \nand so have many of you. There is not even a remote chance--and every \nsingle one of you knows it--not even a remote chance that Henry Hyde \nwould bring articles of impeachment against the President of the United \nStates of any party if he didn't believe they were justified.\n  Honorable men and women can disagree on these articles, but leave \nyour politics at the door. Act worthy of yourselves.\n  If the articles were so outrageous, so political, so partisan, so \nvindictive, and it is nothing more than a private sexual matter, then \nwhy do those of you who say those things want to censure this President \nusing such terms to describe his actions as ``shameful,'' \n``disgraceful,'' ``reprehensible,'' ``false'' and ``misleading,'' and \nso forth?\n\n  Before I leave the matter of partisanship, let me say a few words \nabout the case of our former colleague, Senator Packwood. My colleagues \nknow I was a member of the Ethics Committee, and I supported the \nexpulsion of Senator Packwood. I lost a colleague, and I lost a friend \nover that.\n  That case, too, was ``about sex.'' My colleagues and I didn't shrink \nfrom doing our duty in the Packwood case because this outrageous \nbehavior was about sex.\n  In addition, those organizations advocating that the Senate take \nstrong action against Senator Packwood were, by and large, liberal \nfeminist groups, which I disagree with on nearly every issue.\n  That, however, did not matter. Instead of being partisan or being \ndeterred because the case was about sex, those of us on the Ethics \nCommittee painstakingly investigated that case in all of its sordid and \nunpleasant detail. We considered the shameful behavior in which \nPackwood engaged. We considered how his behavior reflected on his \nfitness to serve. We considered his obstruction of the investigation \nwith respect to his diaries.\n  And in the end, the committee, Republicans and Democrats alike, voted \nto recommend to the full Senate that he be expelled. In doing our duty \nas we saw fit, we were not deterred by the argument that we were \n``overturning an election,'' nor were the Republican members of the \nEthics Committee--at the time, Senators McConnell, Craig and myself--\ndeterred by the fact that Senator Packwood was a member of our own \nparty, nor were we deterred because liberal feminist groups were \naggressively supporting many of the women accusers of Senator Packwood. \nThe heart of the issue is not who Paula Jones' lawyers are, my \ncolleagues, but, rather, did Bill Clinton expose himself in the \npresence of Paula Jones against her wishes? That is at best sexual \nmisconduct, and at worst it is sexual harassment. Right wing groups did \nnot find Paula Jones. Bill Clinton did. He says he didn't do it. Do you \nreally believe him? The women accusers of Senator Packwood received \njustice in spite of those who promoted their cause. Paula Jones \ndeserves the same treatment. The Supreme Court agreed 9 to zero. It is \noutrageous to say, as some have on this floor, that it is acceptable to \nexpel Senator Packwood and acquit the President. That kind of debate \nshould not take place on the floor of the Senate. How can you say that \nSenator Packwood is equal under the law, and yet the President is above \nthe law?\n  Today, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to do in the impeachment \ncase of President Clinton what we did in the ethics case of Senator \nPackwood. Put aside your political affiliation. Put aside your \nfriendship or your personal disdain for President Clinton. Put all of \nthat aside and do the right thing.\n  The House managers have established, I believe, beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that President Clinton perjured himself and obstructed justice. \nAs such, I don't believe we have any option other than to remove him \nfrom office and replace him with the Vice President--a fine, decent \nman, as many of his predecessors who have assumed the office of the \nPresidency during difficult times, and the Nation has persevered.\n  As I have listened to my colleagues in these final deliberations, I \nhave heard time and again that the House managers did not prove their \nobstruction of justice charge because of conflicts in testimony. We \nheard about all these conflicts--conflicts in testimony about the \nhiding of the gifts, conflicts in testimony about the job search, \nconflicts in testimony about the President's coaching of Betty Currie.\n  Well, let me ask you, colleagues, if you believed that these \nconflicts needed to be resolved, then why didn't you join some of us \nwho signed a letter to call for the President of the United States to \ncome here to the Senate and tell the truth? What were you afraid of?\n  We could have called President Clinton here to a closed session of \nthe Senate. It need not have been a media spectacle. It can and should \nhave been a closed session--just the Senate and the President.\n\n  Time and again, I have heard my colleagues say that there should be a \nhigher standard for removing a President of the United States than for \nremoving a Federal judge or expelling a Senator Packwood. If there is \nsuch a higher standard for the law, then why not insist on a higher \nstandard for the man?\n  One of my colleagues mentioned the Iran-contra matter. At an earlier \ntime, not too many years ago, when impeachment talk was in the air, \nPresident Ronald Reagan walked to the microphone, and he said, ``I take \nfull responsibility for my own actions and for those of my \nadministration. As angry as I may be about activities undertaken \nwithout my knowledge, I am still accountable for those activities. As \ndisappointed as I may be in some who served me, I'm still the one who \nmust answer to the American people for this behavior. And as personally \ndistasteful as I find secret bank accounts and diverted funds--well, \nwell, as the Navy would say, this happened on my watch.''\n  Oh, what a little honesty and candor can do for the soul of the \nNation. Why didn't we call the President? Why didn't every Member of \nthis Senate sign that letter? What would be wrong\n\n[[Page S1710]]\n\nwith having him come, either in deposition or in person? I will always \nregret that we failed to do so. We will never know whether the \nPresident's own testimony here before us could have better enabled us \nto do our constitutional duty. We will never know. The President \ntestified before the grand jury. He testified before the Paula Jones \ncase. He should have testified at his own impeachment trial so we could \nget the truth, so those of you who want to know whether or not he \nobstructed justice or committed perjury could have heard from him, not \nhis lawyers. It is a permanent black mark on this trial, and I believe \nhistorians will ask for a long, long time: Why didn't the President \ntestify? It could have changed the outcome of the trial.\n  Speaking of constitutional duty, I am reminded of the President's \noath. Article II, section 1, clause 7, of the Constitution provides \nthat:\n\n       Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall \n     take the following Oath or Affirmation: ``I do solemnly swear \n     (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of the \n     President of the United States, and will to the best of my \n     Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the \n     United States.''\n\n  The Constitution considers the oath so important that it requires the \nman or woman who is elected President to take it. So given the \nimportance of an oath--it is so important that no one elected can serve \nunless they take it--how can we say that willful violation of that \noath, being perjury and obstruction, doesn't rise to the level of \nimpeachment?\n  President Clinton has discredited the oath that the chief law \nenforcement officer of the Nation must take. We have compounded that \ndiscredit by not holding him accountable.\n  Manager Lindsey Graham said that ``we could leap boldly into the 21st \ncentury by ignoring the rule of law.'' Unfortunately, the Senate opted \nto crawl.\n  My colleagues, we all in politics know what a user is. With all due \nrespect, Bill Clinton is a user. He used Monica Lewinsky; he used his \nfriends; he used his Cabinet; he used the American people; and now he \nis using the Senate.\n  The President has never been held accountable. He wasn't held \naccountable for not telling the truth about the draft; he was not held \naccountable for not telling the truth about marijuana; he was not held \naccountable for lying about his relationship with Gennifer Flowers; he \nwas not held accountable for his actions towards Paula Jones; he was \nnot held accountable for lying about Monica Lewinsky. He will walk away \nfrom this trial with an acquittal, and yet again he will avoid \naccountability for his actions. He will avoid being held accountable \nfor the actions that every American citizen, every teacher, every CEO, \nevery military man and woman, would have lost his or her job over, and \nwe let it happen. We did. With the greatest respect, that is not a \nprofile in courage.\n  After the acquittal, I hope we will not be a party to the party. The \nchampagne corks will pop; cigars will be lit; maybe even the bongo \ndrums will be played. I implore you, colleagues, don't go to the party. \nThere is nothing to celebrate. Act worthy of yourselves.\n  In 1880, when Dostoevsky, the great Russian author, wrote ``The \nBrothers Karamazov,'' he could not even have dreamed that there would \never be a Bill Clinton, but here is what he says, and it goes right to \nthe heart of this entire case:\n\n       The important thing is to stop lying to yourself. A man who \n     lies to himself and believes his own lies becomes unable to \n     recognize the truth, either in himself or anyone else, and he \n     ends up losing respect for himself as well as for others.\n       When he has no respect for anyone, he can no longer love. \n     And in order to divert himself, having no love in him, he \n     yields to his impulses, indulges in the lowest form of \n     pleasure, and behaves in the end like an animal in satisfying \n     his vices. And it all comes from lying, lying to others and \n     to yourself.\n\n  The rule of law and the President's constitutional oath must pass the \ntest of truth. President Clinton, regrettably, failed that test.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton is guilty of perjury, is guilty of \nobstruction of justice, and must be removed from office. I have only to \nanswer to my conscience, to the Constitution, and the judgment of \nhistory, and I stand ready for that judgment.\n  I yield back any time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, I will vote to acquit \nthe President on the two articles of impeachment. I will vote ``no'' \nfor two reasons. First, the House has failed to allege acts by this \nPresident which in the context of this case constitute high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. And, second, the House managers allege that the President \ncommitted crimes, but they have failed to establish the elements of \nthose crimes.\n  The illicit sexual affair which the President engaged in, and the \nPresident's efforts to conceal that affair, are permanent black marks \non his Presidency. His actions were deplorable, indefensible, and \nimmoral.\n  But however reprehensible these acts were, they are not impeachable \noffenses. They did not endanger the Government. They were not the \n``stuff'' which the writers of the Constitution had in mind when they \nused the phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''\n  I think we should act accordingly. Our duty, as I see it, is to look \nat the record, look at the arguments, judge our own authority as it has \nbeen given to us in the Constitution, and then vote either to remove \nthe President or to acquit the President.\n  I want to spend just a minute on this issue of our own authority. As \nI hear some of the discussion, it seems to me we have lost sight of our \nown authority. Some have argued that if a university president were to \nhave engaged in these acts, clearly the board of regents of the \nuniversity would fire that president. Some have said if a chief \nexecutive officer of a corporation were to engage in a course of \nconduct like this, the board of directors of the corporation would fire \nthe chief executive officer.\n  I was visiting the United Parcel Service facility in Albuquerque \nright before Christmas, and I was talking to various people there. One \nof the men said, ``I hope you throw the President out of office because \nif I did what he has done my boss would sure fire me.'' That is the way \na lot of us tend to think about this issue. And the discussion here \nthis afternoon has been consistent with that. So I think it is worth \nfocusing on what is wrong with that argument.\n  What is wrong with that argument is that we are not the President's \nboss. We did not hire the President. The American people hired the \nPresident, just like the American people hired each one of us. And we \nhave very limited authority under the Constitution to step in and \ninterfere with the decision of the American people in that regard. I do \nnot believe that the Constitution intended that we would set ourselves \nup as the judge of the President's character, or to determine whether \nwe believe this President is trustworthy enough to remain in office. \nThat issue is not for us to decide. That was decided by the American \npeople. They have not delegated that decision to us.\n  I am reminded of a story from New Mexico politics. We had a mayor in \nAlbuquerque many years ago named Clyde Tingley. He was very proud of \nthe city zoo, which he had built with city funds. He was showing the \nzoo to a high official in the Catholic Church one day. And the official \nat one point said, ``Well, Mr. Mayor, this is an amazing project here. \nThe people of Albuquerque ought to canonize you for this.'' The mayor \nshot back, ``A bunch of them tried during the last election. But they \ndidn't get away with it.''\n  I think a bunch of people tried to throw this President out of the \nWhite House in the last election because of questions about his \ncharacter, but they didn't get away with it. These are not new \nquestions about this President. These are questions which have been \nraised and raised and raised about whether this President is \ntrustworthy, whether this President has demonstrated the character \nnecessary to serve as President. And we really did already have a vote. \nEvery one of us has already voted on whether to remove this President \nfrom the White House. Each one of us voted on that issue in November of \n1996. I would assume a majority of us in this Chamber voted to remove \nhim from the White House. But the American people chose to keep him \nthere. The American people judged him to be worthy of the job and chose \nhim to be their President for another four years. And they did not \nauthorize us to second guess that decision.\n\n[[Page S1711]]\n\n  So we need to look at our own job here, and say to ourselves, ``Are \nwe here to pass judgment on the President's character, are we here to \npass judgment on the President's trustworthiness, are we here to \ndetermine whether he is a proper example for young people, or instead \nare we here to decide whether he has committed high crimes and \nmisdemeanors that would justify removing him from office?''\n  Senator Joe Biden put it very well by saying that this branch of \ngovernment--the House and Senate--should be very reluctant to reach \nacross and remove the head of another branch of government. That is an \nextraordinary act. It has never occurred in the history of this \ncountry. For good reason it has never occurred. It would be a major \nmistake for us to take that action at this time.\n  The framers of the Constitution did not intend Congress to remove a \nduly elected President on the basis of facts such as these, and they \nwere right to deny the Senate that authority. The stability of the \nexecutive branch must not be put at risk by Congress, contrary to the \n``electoral will'', absent a clear showing of ``high crimes and \nmisdemeanors'' by the President. There is no such clear showing here. \nThe proper remedy for this kind of improper conduct is in the voting \nbooth, not here on the floor of the United States Senate.\n  In my view, the House misused the power of impeachment when it voted \nthese articles of impeachment against the President. It would compound \nthe misuse of power if the Senate were to vote to convict and remove. \nMy vote will be to acquit.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Chief Justice, as I have sat through this trial, I \nhave not spent much time on questions of reasonable doubt or where the \npreponderance of evidence lies. Whatever the importance of those \nconcepts in a typical court, the constitutional implications of what we \nare considering are much more serious than the issues decided in a \nnormal trial. I will not vote to remove a sitting President on the \nturning of a legal issue.\n  Accordingly, early in the trial I decided that I would not vote to \nconvict under the First Article of Impeachment. It struck me as overly \nlegalistic. I listened to the lawyers argue about the proper form of \nthe article, and I heard about questions of materiality--not a term I \nuse in everyday conversation--and I decided that while the case was \nthere, it was shaky. In order to be sure I would render impartial \njustice, I asked myself if I would remove Ronald Reagan in a similar \ncircumstance. When I realized I would not, I decided that I could not \nvote to remove Bill Clinton.\n  Once I had made that decision, I more or less tuned out further \ndiscussions on Article One, from either side, and concentrated on \nArticle Two.\n  Here the issues seemed more disturbing. The Constitution guarantees \nthat the most ordinary of citizens has the right to her day in court, \nregardless of her hair or her nose or her choice of attorneys. The man \nshe sues, even if he is the most powerful man in the country, does not \nhave the right to lie while testifying under oath in her case, to deny \nher truthful discovery just because it would embarrass him. He does not \nhave the right to encourage others who are beholden to him, either for \ntheir jobs or for favors he has done for them, to do the same, even by \ninterference. He does not have the right to coach and mislead potential \nwitnesses. He does not have the right to use the awesome power of the \nWhite House public relations apparatus to spread false and malicious \nrumors about people--calling them ``stalkers,'' ``trailer park trash'' \nand ``liars''--just because he thinks they might embarrass him if they \ntell the truth.\n  It has been said that it was understandable for President Clinton to \ndo all these things because he was just trying to cover up a sexual \naffair, and, after all, everyone lies about sex. Well, not everyone. We \nhave had other Presidents whose sexual improprieties have been made \npublic at awkward times --Grover Cleveland, while a candidate for \nPresident, was exposed as having fathered a child out of wedlock. Asked \nby his panicked political allies what to do he said, ``Tell the truth, \nof course,'' and won the election. Bill Clinton should take such notes.\n  What finally convinced me to vote for Article Two was the statement \nof my good friend, Dale Bumpers. I thought he was magnificent. He told \nus that the fundamental purpose of the Constitution was to ``keep \nbullies from running over weak people.''\n  I was struck by that. I wrote it down. Then I asked myself, ``In this \ncase, who is the bully, and who are the weak people?''\n  While publicly posing as a helpless victim of a relentless \nprosecutor, it was President Clinton and the people in his famous ``war \nroom'' who were the bullies, using presidential powers and presidential \nlies to run over the rights of Paula Jones and, if necessary, Monica \nLewinsky.\n  Any President who is willing to lie and smear and stonewall, whether \nunder oath in a courtroom or before a TV camera, speaking \nconfidentially to his aides or privately to his family--any President \nwho is so ruthless, disdainful of the truth and callous of the rights \nof others that he is willing to do anything to ``just win, then''; any \nPresident who readily uses the power of his office for his personal \nends regardless of who is hurt--that President is a bully and, as such, \na threat to the constitutional liberties of us all.\n  Dale Bumpers said that the Constitution was written to keep bullies \nfrom running over weak people. That's called justice. William Jefferson \nClinton tried to obstruct that justice. And I decided to vote to remove \nhim from office.\n  So there I was--ready to vote not guilty on Article One, guilty on \nArticle Two. I sat down and wrote a fancy speech outlining these \nconclusions, showed it to a few friends, notified my staff and sat back \nto let things play out.\n  As the trial proceeded, however, something was gnawing at me. The \nperjury charge kept creeping back into my mind. That something, as I \nconfronted it, was my experience with the Clinton political apparatus \nand its modus operandi. At the heart of everything that apparatus and \nits operatives do, whatever the situation, is the process of lying.\n  Some of their lies have been whoppers, some trivial. Most have been \ndismissed as mere ``spin,'' relatively few have been under oath, but \nthe continuing pattern of distorting, avoiding and, when necessary, \nsimply denying the truth goes back to the 1992 campaign. It has carried \nthrough the three Senate investigations in which I have participated. \nOn a parochial note, it defined the process of creating a stealth \nNational Monument in my state. It has permeated the entire PR campaign \nconnected with the Lewinsky affair. The New York Times calls it \n``habitual mendacity.''\n  If this were a standard trial, as juror I would not know any of that. \nI would have to make up my mind solely on the basis of the evidence \npresented here. Some would say I still should.\n  I believe that the Framers of the Constitution dictated otherwise. \nThey chose the Senate as the trial court of impeachment deliberately, \ngiving us extensive powers as both judge and jury, and they were not \nnaive enough to think that we would check our understanding of the \nhistory of the accused President at the door as we took up this burden. \nThey intended for this to be different than a typical trial court.\n  When I realized that, I began to rethink my earlier decision. With \nsuch a pattern of ``habitual mendacity'' running through his entire \npublic career, could I really say that Bill Clinton's perjurious \ntestimony before the Grand Jury didn't warrant removal?\n  I made my decision to change my vote to ``guilty'' on Article One \nduring the closing arguments when Charles Ruff, the President's \nattorney, asked us a question with respect to an alleged high crime or \nmisdemeanor. He asked, ``would it put at risk the liberties of the \npeople?''\n  As I watched a replay of the President's testimony repeating obvious \nlies while under oath, I realized that the answer is yes. A President \nwho has demonstrated a capacity to lie about anything, great or small, \nwhether or not under oath, does threaten our liberties. We cannot be \nsure of anything he says, we cannot trust his word, whatever the issue. \nWe will always be fearful of where that trait of his could take us, and \nwe should be.\n  So now I will vote guilty on both Articles, with a clear conscience \nthat I have done my duty. And I would vote\n\n[[Page S1712]]\n\nthe same if the President's name were Ronald Wilson Reagan.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Chief Justice, for the past six weeks, the Senate has \nbeen engaged as a Court of Impeachment to try President William \nJefferson Clinton--the first trial of an elected President in the \nhistory of the United States. Our deliberations will bring to a close \nmore than a year of controversy which has left the American people both \nfrustrated and dismayed. And, hopefully, our decision will serve as a \nmeans of rededicating the energies of our Government to the service of \nthe American people.\n  In this endeavor, our solemn duty to the Constitution is paramount.\n  Conscious of these responsibilities and based on the evidence in the \nrecord, the arguments of the House Managers and the counsels for the \nPresident, I conclude as follows. The President has disgraced himself \nand dishonored his office. He has offended the justified expectations \nof the American people that the Presidency be above the sordid episodes \nrevealed in the record before us. However, the House Managers failed to \nestablish that the President's conduct amounts to ``high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors'' requiring his removal from office in accordance with the \nConstitution. Moreover, the House Managers also failed to prove, beyond \na reasonable doubt, that the allegations in the Articles would \nconstitute the crimes of perjury or obstruction of justice.\n  The Constitutional grounds for Impeachment, ``Treason, Bribery, or \nother high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' indicate both the severity of the \noffenses necessary for removal and the essential political character of \nthese offenses. The clarity of ``Treason'' and ``Bribery'' is without \ndoubt. No more heinous example of an offense against the Constitutional \norder exits than betrayal of the nation to an enemy or betrayal of duty \nfor personal enrichment. With these offenses as predicate, it follows \nthat ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' must likewise be restricted \nto serious offenses that strike at the heart of the Constitutional \norder.\n  Certainly, this is the view of Alexander Hamilton; one of the trio of \nauthors of the Federalist Papers which is the most respected and \nauthoritative interpretation of the Constitution. In Federalist No. 65, \nHamilton describes impeachable offenses as ``those offenses which \nproceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words from the \nabuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may \nwith peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate \nchiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ See footnotes at end of speech.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  This view is sustained with remarkable consistency by other \ncontemporaries of Hamilton. George Mason, a delegate to the Federal \nConstitutional Convention, declared that ``high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors'' refer to ``great and dangerous offenses'' or ``attempts \nto subvert the Constitution.'' \\2\\ James Iredell, a delegate to the \nNorth Carolina Convention which ratified the Constitution and later a \njustice of the United States Supreme Court, stated during the \nConvention debates:\n\n       The power of impeachment is given by this Constitution, to \n     bring great offenders to punishment. . . . This power is \n     lodged in those who represent the great body of the people, \n     because the occasion for its exercise will arise from acts of \n     great injury to the community, and the objects of it may be \n     such as cannot be easily reached by an ordinary tribunal.\\3\\\n\nIredell sustains the view that an impeachable offense must cause \n``great injury to the community.'' These interpretations strongly \nindicate that private wrongdoing, without a significant, adverse effect \nupon the nation, does not constitute an impeachable offense.\n  Later commentators expressed similar views. In 1833, Justice Story \nquoted favorably from the scholarship of William Rawle in which Rawle \nconcluded that the ``legitimate causes of impeachment . . . can have \nreference only to public character, and official duty. . . . In \ngeneral, those offenses, which may be committed equally by a private \nperson, as a public officer, are not the subject of impeachment.'' \\4\\\n  This line of reasoning was manifest in the careful and thoughtful \nwork of the House of Representatives during the Watergate proceedings \nin 1974. The Democratic staff of the House Judiciary Committee \nconcluded that:\n\n     [b]ecause impeachment of a President is a grave step for the \n     nation, it is to be predicated only upon conduct seriously \n     incompatible with either the constitutional form and \n     principles of our government or the proper performance of \n     constitutional duties of [the President's] office.\\5\\\n\n  This view was echoed by many of the Republican members of the \nJudiciary Committee when they declared:\n\n     . . . the Framers . . . were concerned with preserving the \n     government from being overthrown by the treachery or \n     corruption of one man . . . [I]t is our judgment, based upon \n     this constitutional history, that the Framers of the United \n     States Constitution intended that the President should be \n     removable by the legislative branch only for serious \n     misconduct dangerous to the system of government.\\6\\\n\n  This authoritative commentary on the meaning of ``high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors'' is supported by the structure of the Constitution which \nmakes impeachment independent from the operation of the criminal \njustice system. Regardless of the outcome of an impeachment trial, the \naccused ``shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, \nTrial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.'' \\7\\ The \nindependence of the impeachment process from the prosecution of crimes \nunderscores the function of Impeachment as a means to remove a \nPresident from office, not because of criminal behavior, but because \nthe President poses a threat to the Constitutional order. Criminal \nbehavior is not irrelevant to an Impeachment, but it only becomes \ndecisive if that behavior imperils the balance of power established in \nthe Constitution.\n  The House Managers argue that we should apply the same reasoning to \nthe removal of the President that we have applied to the trial of \nFederal judges. They make their argument with particular urgency in \nregard to Article I and its allegations of perjury since several judges \nhave been removed for perjury.\\8\\\n  This reasoning disregards the unique position of the President. The \nPresident is elected and popular elections are a compelling check on \nPresidential conduct. No such ``popular check'' was imposed on the \nJudiciary. They are deliberately insulated from the public pressures of \nthe moment to ensure their independence to follow the law and not a \nchangeable public mood. As such, impeachment is the only means of \nremoving a judge. And, the removal of one of the 839 Federal judges can \nnever have the traumatic effect of the removal of the President. To \nsuggest that a Presidential impeachment and a judicial impeachment \nshould be treated identically strains credibility.\n  Moreover, the Constitution requires that judicial service be \nconditioned on ``good Behavior.'' This adds a further dimension to the \nconsideration of the removal of a judge from office. Although ``good \nBehavior'' is not a separate grounds for impeachment, this \nConstitutional standard thoroughly permeates any evaluation of judicial \nconduct. Judges are subject to the most exacting code of conduct in \nboth their public life and their private life.\\9\\ Without diminishing \nthe expectations of Presidential conduct, it is fair to say that we \nexpect and demand a more scrupulous standard of conduct, particularly \npersonal conduct, from judges.\n  The House Managers' argument is ultimately unpersuasive. Rather than \nreflexively importing prior decisions dealing with judicial \nimpeachments, we are obliged to consider the President's behavior in \nthe context of his unique Constitutional duties and without the \ncondition to his tenure of ``good Behavior.''\n  Authoritative commentary on the Constitution, together with the \nstructure of the Constitution allowing independent consideration of \ncriminal charges, makes it clear that the term, ``high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors,'' encompasses conduct which involves the President in the \nimpermissible exercise of the powers of his office to upset the \nConstitutional order. Moreover, since the essence of impeachment is \nremoval from office rather than punishment for offenses, there is a \nstrong inference that the improper conduct must represent a continuing \nthreat to the people and the Constitution, and not simply an episode \nthat either can be dealt with in the Courts or raises no generalized \nconcerns about the continued service of the President.\n\n[[Page S1713]]\n\n  Measured against this Constitutional standard, the allegations \nagainst the President do not constitute ``high Crimes and \nMisdemeanors.'' The uncontradicted facts of the case paint a sordid \npicture of the President's involvement in a clandestine, consensual \naffair with a young woman. His atempts to disguise this affair collided \nwith the Jones lawsuit; a lawsuit filed against him in his capacity as \na private citizen, and not in anyway directed at his conduct as \nPresident. Over many months, he misled and he dissembled about his \nrelationship with Monica Lewinsky. He lied to his family, he lied to \nhis colleagues, and, on January 26, 1998, he lied to the American \npeople. All of these lies were designed to disguise his illicit but \nconsensual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Only after being compelled \nto testify before a Federal Grand Jury in August of 1998, did the \nPresident finally admit his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  The House Managers take this tale of deception and betrayal, more \nsoap opera than high drama of State, and urge that it rises to behavior \nevidencing an impermissible exercise of his powers as President or an \nimpermissible failure to discharge his duties as President which \nthreatens the Constitutional balance of government and can only be \nremedied by the removal of the President. They urge too much. The \nallegations, even construed in the most favorable light to the House \nMangers, do not constitute ``high Crimes and misdemeanors'' as that \nterm has been consistently interpreted over the course of American \nhistory.\\10\\\n  One could confidently stop at this point and reach a judgment to \nacquit the President. Such a judgment does not forgive the disreputable \nbehavior of the President. Rather, it does, as it must, keep faith with \nthe Constitution.\n  However, to stop at this juncture and ignore the allegations of \ncriminal conduct could leave several misperceptions. First, such an \napproach could be criticized as failing to afford the House of \nRepresentatives in appropriate recognition as the proponent of Articles \nof Impeachment. The House of Representatives acted in the discharge of \nits exclusive Constitutional prerogative to Impeach the President. They \ncast these Articles as criminal violations, and due deference must be \ngiven to the decision of the House. Second, failing to examine the \nallegations of criminal conduct may leave the erroneous impression that \ncriminal activity by the President can never rise to the level of \n``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' And, finally, failing to examine \nthese allegations leaves in doubt charges of criminal misconduct \nagainst the President. Although the Senate does not sit as a criminal \ncourt, a condemnation or exoneration ``by silence'' would be unfair to \nboth the President and to the American people.\n\n  The House Managers argue in Article I that the President committed \nthe crime of perjury while testifying before the Federal Grand Jury on \nAugust 17, 1998. They argue in Article II that the President committed \nthe crime of obstruction of justice in the Jones case. After \nconsidering the evidence and the arguments of the House Managers and \nthe White House counsels, I believe that the House Managers have not \nshown, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the President is guilty of the \nalleged crimes.\n  It is without dispute that the House Managers have the burden of \nproof. It is also without dispute that each Senator has the right \nindividually to determine what constitutes the appropriate burden of \nproof. Because of the gravity of this impeachment process, but, more \nsignificantly, because of the urging of the House Managers,\\11\\ I \nbelieve that a standard of beyond a reasonable doubt should be \nused.\\12\\ This is the standard used in the prosecution of criminal \ncases.\n  Article I alleges that the President committed perjury before the \nGrand Jury by knowingly making false, material statements. The first \ngreat hurdle that the House Managers must overcome is the fact that the \nHouse refused to adopt an article of impeachment regarding the \nPresident's testimony at the Jones deposition. However one \ncharacterizes these two statements under oath, no one can argue that \nthe President was more truthful at the Jones deposition. Most, if not \nall, would argue that he was considerably less truthful at the Jones \ndeposition. This discrepancy fatally undercuts the contention that this \nArticle constitutes ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' and it seriously \nerodes the claim that the President committed the crime of perjury \nbefore the Grand Jury. Unlike the Jones deposition, the President \nadmitted up front in his Grand Jury testimony that he had engaged in \n``inappropriate intimate behavior'' with Ms. Lewinsky while they were \n``alone.''\n  Confronted with this preemptive statement by the President, the \nArticle generally alleges perjury without citing specific statements \nfrom the Grand Jury testimony and leaves the House Managers with the \ntask of sifting through the record to suggest examples of the \nPresident's alleged perjury. They suggest four general areas.\n  First, they point to discrepancies between the testimony of the \nPresident and Monica Lewinsky about intimate details of their \nrelationship. This is a difficult proposition to prove without \ncorroborating evidence, and the House Managers offer none. Moreover, \nsome of these details, such as the number of times they engaged in \nsexual banter on the phone, are just not material.\n  Second, the House Managers attempt to ignore the President's \npreliminary statement and argue that he adopted the ``perjurious'' \ntestimony of his Jones deposition. This is simply not true. To make \nthis assertion, the House Managers use the President's Grand Jury \ntestimony that ``I was determined to walk through the mind field of \nthis deposition without violating the law, and I believe I did.'' \\13\\ \nBut, the President's peremptory statement clearly indicated that he was \nnot vouching for the facts of his Jones deposition. The President's \nstatement expresses his state of mind. It is not an affirmation of the \nJones testimony. Not even Independent Counsel Starr alleged that the \nPresident committed perjury in this way.\n\n  Third, the House Managers allege that the President's silence, while \nhis counsel made representations about the Lewinsky affidavit, \nconstitutes perjury. This novel theory of ``unspoken perjury'' fails \nfrom the lack of any conclusive evidence concerning the President's \nstate of mind at this time. Such evidence is necessary to prove the \nspecific intent to establish the crime.\n  Fourth, the House Managers alleged that the President committed \nperjury when he denied his involvement in the obstruction of justice, \nparticularly his alleged involvement in the exchange of gifts between \nMonica Lewinsky and Betty Currie. This topic will be discussed in more \ndetail with respect to Article II. At this juncture, it is sufficient \nto note that the House Managers have not presented evidence to indicate \nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the President committed perjury.\n  Fifth, the House Managers allege that the President committed perjury \nwhen he denied ``coaching'' Betty Currie. Again, this issue will be \naddressed in more detail with respect to Article II. But, this \nallegation also fails from the absence of persuasive evidence \nestablishing the President's specific intent in conducting this \nconversation with Ms. Currie.\n  Finally, the House Managers allege that the President committed \nperjury when he gave false information to his aides about his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky. This too raises the issue of the \nPresident's state of mind. His Grand Jury testimony expressed his \nbelief that he tried to say things that were true. He acknowledged that \nhe misled, but he asserted that he tried not to lie. To prove that \nthese statements are perjurious, the House Managers had to prove that \nthe President had the necessary specific intent. They have not done so.\n  Article II alleges that the President obstructed justice. The article \nsets forth seven ``acts'' which the House Managers argue the President \nused to implement this ``scheme.''\n  Three of these alleged ``acts,'' encouraging Monica Lewinsky to file \na false affidavit, urging her to give false testimony, and finding her \na job to obtain her silence, crash on an immovable evidentiary rock: \nMonica Lewinsky's uncontradicted and often repeated statement, ``no one \never asked me to lie and I was never promised a\n\n[[Page S1714]]\n\njob for my silence.'' \\14\\ The House Managers offered other \ncircumstantial evidence, but this too failed to be persuasive.\n  The fourth ``act'' involves the transfer of gifts between Ms. \nLewinsky and Ms. Currie. Although Ms. Lewinsky's testimony strongly \nsuggests that the President directed Ms. Currie to retrieve gifts, the \ntwo parties to this suggested transaction, the President and Ms. \nCurrie, flatly deny any such conversation. Certainly, there is more \nthan a reasonable doubt based on this conflicting testimony; \nparticularly, since no one has ever impeached Ms. Currie's credibility.\n  The fifth ``act'' recharacterizes the President's silence, while his \nattorney made representations about Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, as \nobstruction of justice. This allegation fails based on the lack of any \nconclusive evidence of the President's state of mind.\n  The sixth ``act'' involved the purported coaching of Betty Currie by \nthe President after his Jones deposition. This allegation too turns on \nthe President's state of mind. The House Managers argue that the \nPresident's intent was to influence the testimony of Ms. Currie as a \npotential witness. White House counsels argue that the President had no \nreasonable anticipation that she would be a witness. But, more \ndecisively, they argue that his intent was to confirm his story in \nanticipation of a media onslaught. The lack of persuasive evidence \nabout his state of mind also undercuts this allegation.\n\n  Finally, the last allegation involves the President's purported \nattempt to influence the testimony of his aides. Again, the House \nManagers have not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the President \nintended to make his statement to influence their testimony. There is \nan equally plausible inference that the President was simply continuing \nhis public campaign to deny his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. This \ncampaign led him to lie to the American public and no one suggests he \nwas then tampering with witnesses. Indeed, as a result of these public \nstatements, it seems unlikely that he would tell his aides anything \nelse.\n  The House Managers have not sustained their burden of proof in regard \nto Article II.\n  It is clearly evident that the facts of the case require acquittal. \nAs such, serious questions can and should be raised about the \nunwarranted extension of the trial. Given the significant doubts \nsurrounding the case of the House Managers, a motion to dismiss, \nfollowed by a debate on censure should have been utilized to properly \nput an end to these proceedings. Instead, a majority of the Senate \naccommodated the desire of the House Managers to excessively pursue \nallegations that were politically damaging to the President. Indeed, \nhad members of the House of Representatives been allowed to consider \ncensure this matter may never have reached the Senate.\n  We, as a nation and as the Senate, have come to the end of a long and \nwearisome road. It has wandered through scandal and deception. Many of \nthose who have trod this road, both individuals and institutions, have \nseen their reputations besmirched. The journey emanated from the \nreckless conduct of William Jefferson Clinton. But, the passage has \nalso exposed vicious political partisanship and the reckless and \nrelentless exploitation of the powers of the Independent Counsel. In \nthe midst of this dishonor, deception, and rancor, we could have easily \nlost our way. But, we reached this moment because we have been guided \nby the Constitution and inspired by the common sense and common decency \nof the American people, and with such a guide and such inspiration, we \nwill do justice with our votes, whether they be to conflict or acquit.\n  And for my part, the Constitution and the evidence compels me to vote \nto acquit the President on both Articles of Impeachment.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ The Federalist Papers, No. 65 (Hamilton) at 396 (Clinton \n     Rossiter, ed., 1961) (emphasis in original).\n     \\2\\ Max Farrand, ed., The Record of the Federal Convention of \n     1787, at 550 (1966).\n     \\3\\ Jonathan Elliot, Debates on the Adoption of the Federal \n     Constitution, at 113 (emphasis added).\n     \\4\\ Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution Sec. 799 \n     at 269-270 quoting William Rawle, A View of the Constitution \n     of the United States at 213 (2d ed. 1829).\n     \\5\\ Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment, \n     Report by the Staff of the Impeachment Inquiry, House Comm. \n     On Judiciary, 93rd Cong., 2d Sess. at 26 (1974).\n     \\6\\ Impeachment of Richard M.

See also Counsel to the President's \n     Trial Brief, p. 57.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. Chief Justice and Colleagues of the Senate.\n  This has been a month long ethics and Constitution class--with \nmandatory attendance. That should have value for each of us.\n  I'm getting more mail each day than I normally get in a month--and \nmost of it is from your constituents. That's right. Out of every 1000 \nletters I get, only 30 are from Wyoming. I have some ideas what your \nconstituents are saying. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not going to present any \nlegal arguments. Most of my constituents aren't lawyers. I notice that \nmost of your constituents aren't either.\n  I've only served on one jury before and we didn't even get to render \na verdict. A boy was being tried for poaching deer out of season--shot \nwith a twenty-two. He was caught red-handed in the barn with the \ntwenty-two and two of the six deer hanging to be butchered. The Boy's \nargument began claiming he hadn't been properly read his rights. His \ndad, supporting from the audience, stopped the trial by asking the \njudge if he could speak with his son. They went into the hall a couple \nminutes. A boy freshly chastised said, ``I want to plead guilty. In our \nfamily we don't believe in getting off on technicalities.'' A \nsuccessful trial. I watched a boy become a man.\n  I thought about propounding a unanimous consent that anything already \nsaid couldn't be repeated as testimony even though it could be \nsubmitted. I thought that would speed up the proceedings. I will not \npropound it but will attempt to follow it. Instead of the smooth \ntransitions and brilliant arguments, you will only hear what is left. I \ntrust you will rush to get a copy of my whole statement. Here goes!\n  The President was so thorough in denying any relationship with Monica \nLewinsky, that Janet Reno believed him. Janet Reno is the person who \nexpanded the investigation into the Monica Lewinsky matter. The \nPresident told all of us he had done nothing wrong. His own Attorney \nGeneral believed him. Janet Reno was helping to clear the air on these \nludicrous charges when SHE gave Ken Starr the approval, direction and \nbudget.\n  When our country was founded oaths meant everything. A man's word was \nhis bond. Their oath was honor and duels were fought to defend honor. \nWhen this trial started you and I had to take an oath. It struck me \nthat I might be taking an oath to determine if oaths still mean \nanything.\n  The White House argues that the President's actions will not have an \naffect on anyone. I am hearing from\n\n[[Page S1715]]\n\njudges who say people before their court are asking for the same \ntreatment given the President. They do not feel their situation is as \nblatant as the President and they are more repentant and remorseful. \nSome have even taken action to correct their wrong. All feel they \nshould get a suspended sentence.\n  I was disappointed with the White House failure to explain all of the \ncharges. Their rebuttal was focused on those charges for which they \nfelt they could answer or, more accurately use to create the most \nconfusion. Skipping the tough issues is not an answer. This is not an \nissue of spin or even polls.\n  Impeachment is the most serious indictment a President or judge can \nget. The President was impeached by the House of Representatives. His \nreaction was to celebrate in the Rose Garden of the White House--spin \nagain--more spin than a kid's top. Truth was needed. Dizzy deception is \nwhat we've gotten.\n  The President's Counsel admit he lied, was evasive, misleading. The \nwords and adjectives used by the White House Counsel during the trial \nshould be enough to condemn the President. But they still expect us to \ntrust the President with the country? Do you think he will only lie \nabout sex? This man sends our children into war. He has to be held to \nthe highest standard. I would feel more comfortable if even one person \nwould have said, ``He didn't do this.'' Only the President said that, \nand we all know he wasn't truthful.\n  Last year an Air Force pilot, an officer, was forced to resign. She \nwas having a consensual sexual affair. It was adultery. She didn't lie \nabout it. She was forced to resign--removed from office--because we \ncouldn't trust her with deadly weapons. The President pushes the button \non the whole world--not just on one plane. Oh, that's right, this isn't \nabout personal sex. No one would ever be removed from office for that.\n  But the President is doing a great job. Job performance cannot be the \ndefense for perjury or obstruction of justice or sexual harassment or \nany other crime. If a bank president embezzled even a little money from \nhis bank would we leave him alone? Would we say, ``That's okay because \nthe bank was doing well''?\n  We had a hypothetical situation posed to us--an employee who \ncontrolled the whole computer system and he did what the President did. \nIf there is any parallel, you'd fire him! You'd fire him because you \nhave been cross-training a vice president of computer systems. I've \nlistened to the arguments about world peace and I've got to say, that's \na terrible indictment of the capabilities of the Vice President.\n  When the video evidence was countered, White House Counsel had one \npresentation on Ms. Lewinsky's testimony. A second presentation was \nmade on Vernon Jordan's testimony. Why didn't White House Counsel \ncounter Sidney Blumenthal's testimony at all? Charges made, charges \nunanswered. If you have enough votes, I guess you only need to look \ncredible.\n  Presidents have power. Power draws loyalty. Are we a country with one \nset of standards for the rich, famous, or powerful? Is that the way we \nwant our country to be? This isn't even a popularity contest. \nPopularity cannot be a defense in an impeachment trial.\n  House manager Rogan said he would risk his political future for the \nConstitution. He said, ``Dreams come and dreams go, but conscience is \nforever.'' We are supposed to be the collective conscience of our \nnation. Are we trying instead to salve our conscience?\n  We talk of censure? Isn't that just another way to salve our \nconscience. When this trial is over we better come together as a \nnation--undivided and behind whoever is the President--not debating \nagain to what degree he is bad.\n  Some have been wrestling with whether the offenses ``rise to the \nlevel of impeachment''. The founders may have been a lot tougher than \nwe are. We've talked about a guilty vote by a two thirds majority \nremoving from office. The founders provided for a second vote--a vote \nthat takes away more rights and honor--the right to hold public office \never again. Should we suggest the offenses, especially in the \ncumulative, rise to the level of impeachment and then wrestle with the \nquestion and vote on ``forever''? Judges are appointed for life. \nPresidents have the title for life.\n  I heard a suggestion that we can't remove the President for sexual \nharassment because we are not his boss or because he has such a \ncritical position. The founders recognized both those circumstances. We \nare not the President's boss--but we have been given that \nresponsibility through impeachment. He holds a critical position, \nthat's why the founders established the succession. And remember, that \nwas when impeachment could put another party into the presidency. And \nthat was when the Senate was appointed, not elected.\n  ``The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire'' was a book we were \nintroduced to in high school. Rome went through this phase too. Free \nlunches for the masses, an emphasis on entertainment, and no \naccountability for the powerful. We have seen the rise of America. Will \nwe be listed in history as the start of the fall? Our society is \neroding. Our values are disappearing. If you watch the news, many \nnights the main lead even during this trial is about the multiple \nmurders right around us.\n  We've been talking about ``an impeach able standard''. We've talked \nabout the ``Reagen Test'' I'm going to suggest two more tests. The \n``Mom Test'' and the ``Spouse Test''. When you were growing up, did \nyour mom need proof ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' before punishment? \nDid she ever say, ``Don't put yourself in a position where it even \nlooks like you did something wrong.'' Circumstantial evidence was \nenough. Did your mom ever say, ``Watch out who you hang out with. It \nreflects on you.'' Did your mom say, ``Watch your actions--they reflect \non you and your family''? Did your mom ever say, ``Act so I won't be \nembarrassed tomorrow reading the front page of the paper about what you \ndid today.'' The President has complained that others are out to get \nhim. That he is the most investigated President in history. Perhaps he \nought to apply the ``Mom Test''.\n\n  What about the ``Spouse Test''? My wife has applied that test. She \nsaid, ``If this were a Republican President, I would have already \nchained myself to the White House fence until he resigned.'' She is \nabsolutely stymied that women's groups haven't done that. For years she \nand I fought the accusations that women's groups were only about \nallowing abortion--but their silence on the President has changed my \nmind. I will not defend them as they have not defended any woman \ndefamed by the actions and the words of the President. And a final \n``Spouse Test''--when you are playing games with sex definitions ask, \n``What would my spouse think I was doing?''\n  While we may have a country doing well economically we are headed \ntoward moral bankruptcy if the trend is not reversed. We are becoming \n``De-Moralized''\n  With this case we are all in a ``no-win'' situation. We have heard \nthe media and the Democrats note that the Republicans are committing \npolitical suicide. But just as many mention the Democrats are filing \nmoral bankruptcy. History will be the judge of us all. Our constituents \njust expect us to do ``What is right''! They will expect us to do what \nis right based even on what comes out in the future. Yes, what is right \nbased on the books and future disclosures of the participants. They \nwill judge us even based on the future actions of this President. Our \nwords will be forgotten, our verdict won't.\n  This isn't about politics. Its about our country. Its not about Bill \nClinton. Its about the future of the Presidency. The process is on \ntrial. The Senate is on trial. No, Truthfully, Truth is on trial!\n  As we enter into our final deliberations on whether or not to convict \nPresident Clinton on the two articles of Impeachment presented to us by \nthe House of Representatives, I think it is imperative that we remember \nthe oath each of us took at the outset of this historic process. Each \none of us took an oath before God to do ``impartial justice according \nto the Constitution and the laws.'' That oath should guide our thoughts \nand actions for it reminds us of the gravity of this process and the \nweighty responsibility we assumed by our own free will. We must finally \nremember that we answer not only to future generations who will judge \nwhether we did right by the Constitution we swore to uphold, but also \nto that eternal witness of our most solemn oath.\n\n[[Page S1716]]\n\n  I will be the first to admit that striving to be impartial has been \nvery difficult. To be a good juror is a heavy burden. That duty is \nheightened when one is also called to wear a judge's robe when sitting \nas a silent juror weighing the evidence, probing the credibility and \nmotives of the various witnesses, and ascertaining the appropriate law \nwhich applies to the facts before you. There are few duties we will \nface in our life as grave as this one: to decide the political fate of \nthe President of the United States.\n  Before the trial started I read everything I could find that dealt \nwith impeachment history. As the trial progressed, I read volumes of \npublished evidence including the prior testimony of the witnesses in \nthis proceeding. I have attended all of the proceedings in the Senate \nfrom start to finish. I have carefully watched all of the videotaped \ndepositions. I have read all of the transcripts of these depositions. I \nwatched many parts of the depositions several times to be sure I \nunderstood exactly what each witness was saying and how that testimony \nfit with that witnesses' prior testimony and with the testimony of \nother witnesses who testified under oath. These depositions were very \nhelpful in focusing the key points of this trial and deciding who was \ntestifying truthfully and who was lying in instances where the \ntestimony is in conflict. In short, I believe I have taken into account \nnearly all of the pertinent information in this case in coming to my \nfinal decision.\n  This case challenges us to consider whether, in light of all the \nevidence, President Clinton's actions indicate that he has, in the \nwords of Alexander Hamilton, ``abused or violated some public trust.'' \nIn making this determination, we must first decide whether allegations \npresented by the House Managers do in fact constitute ``high crimes and \nmisdemeanors'' as contemplated in Article II, Section 4 of the \nConstitution. I have come to the conclusion that they do.\n  I believe that perjury and obstruction of justice demonstrate \nintentional, pre-meditated violations of an indispensable public trust. \nIn taking the oath of office, President Clinton twice raised his right \nhand and placed his hand on the Bible swearing to uphold and defend the \nConstitution and to faithfully execute the laws of the United States. \nBy this oath, he took upon himself the duty to be the chief law \nenforcement officer of the United States. Actions which undermine this \nhigh duty, whether they involved committing perjury in a judicial \nproceeding or obstructing justice, strike at the very heart of the rule \nof law.\n  There is no contradiction that perjury and obstruction of justice are \nserious crimes for the average citizen in the United States. Both of \nthese offenses presented by the House managers are felonies under the \nfederal criminal code, and both carry equivalent or even higher minimum \nsentences than bribery under the federal sentencing guidelines. Nor is \nthe seriousness of these crimes simply a matter of abstract \nspeculation. We heard video testimony of a real, live citizen who has \npaid a very heavy price indeed for the crime of perjury. In July of \n1995, Dr. Barbara Battalino, a physician who worked for the Veterans \nAdministration, lied under oath about an encounter she had had with one \nof her patients. As a result of this perjury, Dr. Battalino was fired \nfrom the Veterans Administration, she lost her license to practice \nmedicine, she was prohibited from ever practicing law (she also had a \nlaw degree), and she was required to wear an electronic ankle bracelet \nfor 3 years. Those who argue that perjury about sexual matters is not \nserious owe Dr. Battalino a heartfelt apology. Dr. Battalino lied one \ntime about one consensual act of oral sex.\n  Moreover, both perjury and obstruction of justice were counted among \nthe list of ``public wrongs'' as opposed to private wrongs under Common \nLaw at the time of the American founding. These are the very kind of \ncrimes the founders contemplated when they included the impeachment and \nremoval mechanism in the Constitution. These crimes were not considered \nto be private offenses by the Common Law, nor by the Founding Fathers. \nThe pre-eminent commentator on the English Common Law at the time of \nthe American founding, William Blackstone, described perjury, or false \nswearing in a judicial proceeding, as an ``offense against public \njustice.'' As with perjury, obstruction of justice was considered a \n``high misprision'' or ``high misdemeanor'' at the time of the drafting \nof our own Constitution.\n  It should be remembered that this Senate has convicted and removed \nfederal judges for perjury. In the 1980s alone, this body removed three \nfederal judges for lying under oath. Many in this chamber had occasion \nto vote in those cases and voted to remove these judges because they \nsaw that the act of perjury, even if it involved lying about one's \ntaxes, was incompatible with a judge's duty to uphold the constitution \nand laws of the United States.\n  When confronted with these very recent precedents, the White House \nlawyers have argued that this Senate should apply a lesser standard to \nthe President than to federal judges. They argue that federal judges \nshould be held to a higher standard because they are given life tenure \nunder Article III of the Constitution. I must admit, that this is an \nargument that I cannot square either with the plain language of the \nConstitution or with common sense. Do we really want to hold our \nPresident to a lower standard than the federal judges he appoints? It \nis our President, after all, who appoints all the United States \nattorneys and the federal marshals, who names all the cabinet \nofficials, who has the authority to send American troops into battle, \nand who can sign treaties with foreign nations. A corrupt federal \ndistrict court judge can work injustice on the litigants who enter his \ncourtroom. A corrupt President, by contrast, has the power to wreak \nhavoc on the entire political order.\n  The President's oath forbids him to selectively decide whether to \nfollow the laws of the land based on a calculation of political \nexpediency or determination of personal gain or loss. He is bound to \nfollow Constitution and the laws of our country in and out of season. \nBy intentionally violating this duty, the president's actions display \nthe tendencies of an unbridled monarch rather than a constitutional \nexecutive who must bow before the law he swore to faithfully execute.\n\n  On the specific article of perjury, there is abundant evidence that \nPresident Clinton violated his oath to ``tell the truth, the whole \ntruth, and nothing but the truth'' on several occasions. As the chief \nlaw enforcement officer of the United States, the President was bound \nto ``tell the whole truth'' and act in a manner becoming of the dignity \nof his office. President Clinton did not do this. When asked before the \nfederal grand jury on August 17, 1998 whether he understood that he had \nan obligation to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the \ntruth in his prior deposition of January 17, 1999 in a federal civil \nrights suit, the President testified that ``His goal was to be \ntruthful, but not particularly helpful''. He later admitted that his \ntestimony had been ``misleading''. For any plain speaking American, to \nbe misleading is the same as lying. In short, the President violated \nhis oath to ``tell the whole truth'' when he misled the court.\n  The facts indicate that President was not attempting to be truthful \nand was not truthful in his deposition in the Jones federal civil \nrights case. Moreover, he lied about the nature of his relationship \nwith a subordinate employee before the federal grand jury. The \nPresident also allowed his attorney, Robert Bennett, to file a false \naffidavit on his behalf denying his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. \nThe President continued this pattern of deception by lying to his top \naides with the knowledge that they were likely to be called as \nwitnesses before the federal grand jury. He then attempted to cover up \nthese lies by claiming he had possibly ``misled'' his aides, but he did \nnot lie to them since he knew they were likely to be called as \nwitnesses before the federal grand jury. These were lies. They were \nlies under oath. They were lies that adversely impacted the rights of a \nUnited States citizen to obtain relief in a civil rights case in \nfederal court. They were lies under oath in a federal grand jury after \nhe had been begged by his aides, his friends, and some in this chamber \nto finally tell the truth. They were lies of a public character and \nthey were unbefitting the chief law enforcement officer of our country.\n  What is perhaps most disturbing about these lies, is that the \nPresident's\n\n[[Page S1717]]\n\nactions indicate he had no intention of ever telling the truth of his \nrelationship. He had already lied under oath in a federal civil rights \naction, he lied to his top aides and cabinet officers, he lied to his \nfriends and political allies, and he lied with perfect calculation to \nthe American public, including myself. I remain convinced that the only \nreason the President admitted his relationship at all was the discovery \nof the now famous ``blue dress''. Only when it became clear that he \ncould no longer continue his pattern of judicial and public deception \ndid the President admit that he had in fact had an ``improper \nrelationship'' with Monica Lewinsky. Unfortunately, the President's \ndeception did not end with the revelation of the DNA. Rather, it \ngraduated to legal hairsplitting, attempts to torture plain English \nlanguage, and statements which degraded the judicial process and \ninsulted the intelligence of the American public. The President has not \ncarried out the public trust the American public entrusted to him when \nhe was twice elected President.\n  When the President's actions became public, the President even turned \nhis sword of deception against his partner in perjury. Once the \nWashington Post broke the story on the President's extra-marital affair \nand his possible perjury and obstruction of justice, the President \ncalled in his top aides to deny the story and destroy the character of \nMonica Lewinsky. We have seen and heard the video testimony of one of \nPresident Clinton's top aides, Sidney Blumenthal. Immediately after the \nstory broke, President Clinton called Sidney Blumenthal into the Oval \nOffice and denied the entire story. He went on to say that Monica \nLewinsky was a troubled young woman who was called the ``stalker'' by \nher peers. He said that she came on to him and made a sexual demand of \nhim, but he rebuffed her. The President went so far as to claim that \nMs. Lewinsky had threatened to tell people that she had had an affair \nwith him, even though it was not true. In the words of Mr. Blumenthal, \nthe President ``lied to him.'' As expected, Mr. Sidney Blumenthal \nrepeated these lies before the federal grand jury. There is also \ngrowing evidence that Mr. Blumenthal, or other key White House aides, \ncirculated these lies to the popular media. Such conduct further \nestablishes that the President was willing to go to all lengths to \nprevent anyone from discovering the truth about his illegal conduct in \na federal civil rights case.\n  The President's lawyers argued that the President could not have \nintended to corruptly influence the grand jury proceeding since the \nlies the President told his top aides were no different than the lie \nthe President told the American people when he adamantly denied having \n``sexual affairs, with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.'' If this is the best \ndefense the White House lawyers can wage for their client, it speaks \nvolumes about the President's character. Unfortunately, it is also \nfalse. The President never told the American people that Monica \nLewinsky was a stalker, or that she wore her skirts too tight, or that \nshe came on to him and made sexual demands on him. This is exactly what \nthe President told his aide, Sidney Blumenthal. The President never \nenumerated the sexual acts he ``did not commit'' with Monica Lewinsky. \nHe did deny with great specificity, these acts when questioned by his \nassistant chief of staff, John Podesta. The President did lie to the \nAmerican public. However, he also told other lies to his top aides, \nknowing that they were likely to be called as witnesses before the \ncriminal grand jury.\n  There is also substantial evidence that the President attempted to \nobstruct justice in both the civil rights case brought against him and \nthe federal criminal investigation conducted by Judge Starr. It should \nbe noted that Judge Kenneth Starr's investigation was not the creature \nof President Clinton's political enemies, as some have asserted. \nPresident Clinton's own Attorney General, Janet Reno, directed Judge \nStarr to expand his investigation to include the allegations in this \ncase. If Janet Reno is a member of the vast right wing conspiracy, then \nthat operation is very vast indeed.\n  We now know that the Monica Lewinsky filed a false affidavit in the \nJones civil action. We also know that the President called Ms. Lewinsky \nat home at 2:30 in the morning to inform her that she had been named on \nthe witness list in the Jones Civil Rights case. We also know that in \nthis conversation, the President also suggested Ms. Lewinsky could file \nan affidavit to avoid testifying. Finally, we know that the President \nreminded Ms. Lewinsky of their agreed upon ``cover stories'' to conceal \ntheir relationship. While President's lawyers have made much over Ms. \nLewinsky's statement that ``the President never asked me to lie'', they \nare unable to put a positive spin on the cover stories and the \nPresident's attempts to encourage Monica Lewinsky to file an affidavit \nin the first place.\n  It stretches the bounds of credulity beyond recognition to believe \nthat the President intended Ms. Lewinsky to tell the truth when: 1) he \nhimself lied under oath about their relationship, 2) he reminded Ms. \nLewinsky of their cover stories in the same conversation in which he \nsuggested that she file an affidavit, and 3) he relied on Ms. \nLewinsky's false affidavit in his own testimony denying their \nrelationship. Finally, when Ms. Lewinsky asked President Clinton if he \nwanted to see her signed affidavit, he said he didn't need to see it \nbecause he had ``seen fifteen others like it''. This response remains \none of the more puzzling in this case and leaves open the possibility \nthat the President tampered with other witnesses in the Jones Civil \nRights case.\n  We also now know that the President's personal secretary, Betty \nCurrie, hid presents under her bed that had been subpoenaed in the \nJones case. These are the gifts the President had given to Monica \nLewinsky during their relationship. Ms. Lewinsky has testified that \nBettie Currie definitely called her about the gifts, and the only way \nMs. Currie could have known about the gifts is if the President \ninstructed her to pick them up. While the President's lawyers deny this \nexplanation, the only phone record we know about is a phone call made \nfrom Betty Currie to Ms. Lewinsky on the day she picked up the gifts. \nThe President's lawyers have failed to produce any concrete evidence to \ncontradict this explanation. Concealing gifts that are under subpoena \nin a legal proceeding is illegal and it obstructs the administration of \njustice.\n  Moreover, the conclusion that it was in fact President Clinton who \ndirected Betty Currie to conceal the presents is bolstered by the fact \nthat the President corruptly attempted to influence Ms. Currie's \ntestimony in a federal civil rights suit. President Clinton made \nseveral false statements to Betty Currie on Sunday, January 18, 1997, \nthe day after he testified in the Jones lawsuit. Ms. Currie, who \nexplained that it was very unusual for the President to ask her to come \nin to work on a Sunday, testified that President Clinton made a series \nof false statements to her as if asking for her consent. Specifically, \nthe President stated to Ms. Currie: 1) ``You were always there when she \n[Monica Lewinsky] was there, right? We were never really alone.'' 2) \n``You could see and hear everything.'' 3) ``Monica came on to me, and I \nnever touched her, right?'' 4) She wanted to have sex with me and I \ncouldn't do that.'' All of these statements were false, and all of them \noccurred the day after Judge Wright had expressly forbidden any of the \nparties deposed or their attorneys from discussing the deposition with \nanyone.\n  The President's lawyers have argued that the President made these \nstatements to refresh his recollection or to find out what Ms. Currie \nknew in the event of a press avalanche. Neither of these explanations \nis plausible. It is impossible to refresh one's recollection with \nfalse, leading questions. It is also impossible to find out what \nsomeone else knew if you tell them what they are supposed to believe. \nThe plausibility of either of these explanations is entirely discounted \nwhen you consider that the President called Betty Currie in a second \ntime, on January 20th to ``remind'' her of these statements. The most \nlikely explanation for these statements is far more sinister. That \nPresident was intending to influence the testimony of a likely witness \nin a federal civil rights proceeding. President Clinton was, in fact, \ntrying to get Betty Currie to join him in his web of deception and \nobstruction of justice.\n  The inescapable conclusion I have come to is that the President of \nthe United States set upon a deliberate, premeditated plan to deceive \nthe court\n\n[[Page S1718]]\n\nin two separate legal proceedings and to encourage others to deceive \nthe court as well. The President first defended himself by claiming to \nbe the unfortunate victim of a vast right wing conspiracy. Only after \nthe physical evidence uncovered the truth about his affair did the \nPresident claim he was only trying to protect his family from these \nembarrassing revelations. Neither of these excuses justifies the \nPresident's actions. A defendant in a legal proceeding does not have \nthe right to perjure himself because he questions the motives of the \nplaintiff. There are proper legal procedures and remedies available to \nany defendant who believes he has been the victim of a lawsuit \npredicated on frivolous legal theories or springing from personal \nmalice. It is, however, never legitimate to respond to even a frivolous \nlawsuit by lying under oath.\n  There has been a great debate on how the President's actions will \nimpact our nation, especially if those actions go unpunished. Last year \nI read of a town in Midwestern America that had experienced a number of \nkillings in the first two months of the year. A consultant was hired to \nfind the cause of these brutal acts. I believe the findings in his \nreport should cause all of us to take pause. He explained that first a \nwindow is broken and nobody fixes it. That leads to a lawn that isn't \nmowed. Through a series of similar instances, the kids think nobody \ncares about them. If we let the President off for intentionally \nviolating the rule of law, what do we tell our children when they are \ncaught breaking the law? That we have one law for the rulers and \nanother for the ruled? Do we tell them they have to follow the law \nuntil they become powerful enough, or clever enough, or rich enough to \nviolate the law with impunity? What do we tell the federal judges who \nhave lost their robes and gavels for committing perjury? What do we \ntell military officers who have lost their livelihood for violating \ntheir oaths and rules of their office? What do we tell average citizens \nwho have lost their jobs, their freedom, and their fortunes for \nviolating their oaths to tell the truth in a court of law? If the \nlegacy we leave to our children is one of cynical duplicity, I fear \nthat even an ever-increasing Dow Jones' average will be incapable of \nsalvaging our next generation, or even, I fear, our civilization.\n  I must conclude that while the power of Impeachment and removal is a \nstrong measure and one that should never be taken gently, it is an \nindispensable remedy in our government for those public officers who \nhave so violated their public trust as to be unworthy to continue \nholding offices of public trust. The great Supreme Court Justice and \nConstitutional scholar Joseph Story perhaps best summarized the \nimpeachment mechanism as one which ``holds out a deep and immediate \nresponsibility, as a check upon arbitrary power; and compels the chief \nmagistrate, as well as the humblest citizen, to bend to the majesty of \nthe laws.'' Those who would disregard this rule of law for their own \npersonal or political ends must not be allowed to remain in offices of \npublic trust. For this reason, I will vote to convict President Clinton \non both articles of Impeachment.\n  I thank the chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1703-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1718-S1723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    OPINION OF SENATOR RUSSELL D. FEINGOLD IN THE TRIAL OF WILLIAM \n                           JEFFERSON CLINTON\n\n  Mr. Feingold. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my opinion \nin the recently concluded impeachment trial of President William \nJefferson Clinton be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the opinion was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Opinion of Senator Russell D. Feingold\n\n     I. Introduction\n     II. Analysis of Alleged Federal Crimes\n     A. Standard of Proof\n     B. Perjury\n     C. Obstruction of Justice\n     III. High Crimes and Misdemeanors\n     IV. Conclusion\n       Only 154 Senators have ever been sworn to sit in a Court of \n     Impeachment for the trial of an American president. For this \n     senator, to sit in judgment of this President was a sorrowful \n     experience. The President and I began our careers in \n     Washington together in January 1993. On the crisp, winter day \n     of his first inauguration, I was moved by the poetry of Maya \n     Angelou, which celebrated the ``pulse of . . . [a] new day'' \n     in American politics and culture. All along in this process, \n     I have regretted that his presidency has come to this, but \n     have sought not to personalize that regret in a way that \n     would affect my judgment. Taking the oath of impartiality on \n     January 7 helped me to do that, but let me say, I very much \n     regret that the President's conduct brought us to this day.\n       This somber experience requires a senator to blend three \n     different considerations: (1) the historical purposes of \n     impeachment and the record of past impeachments; (2) the \n     current legal and political merits and implications of these \n     impeachment proceedings; and (3) the potential impact of the \n     current impeachment proceedings on future impeachments and \n     the stability of the American constitutional system.\n       In attempting to reconcile these considerations, a senator \n     has only the Andrew Johnson impeachment trial to look to for \n     precise precedents for a presidential impeachment trial. Each \n     senator is expected to render independently his or her \n     judgment about the applicable law and then to apply that law \n     to his or her own individual understanding of the facts of \n     the case. This Opinion is an explanation of my attempt to \n     meet that challenge.\n\n\n                            I. Introduction\n\n       Strive as they may to minimize its import, the House \n     Managers and those advocating removal of the President must \n     recognize that the single most salient fact in this entire \n     case is that on November 5, 1996, 47,402,357 Americans voted \n     to reelect William Jefferson Clinton. That decision was the \n     right and the responsibility of the American people.\n       By contrast, impeachment and removal from office prior to \n     the expiration of a president's four year term of office must \n     be viewed as an extreme and radical remedy, given that it \n     overrides the solemn, quadrennial decision of the American \n     people. For us to remove a duly elected president could well \n     be the most momentous constitutional event in the history of \n     our country, save the Civil War. The people choose their \n     leaders in America, and we must not lightly reverse their \n     will. To overrule the voters, the offense must be grave and \n     the case must be very strong.\n       Too much of the rhetoric in this impeachment debate has \n     focused on whether the President should be permitted to keep \n     ``his'' job, in light of his unacceptable behavior. The \n     question is better phrased as whether the President's conduct \n     is sufficiently egregious to require the Congress to undo the \n     decision of more than 47 million Americans to give him that \n     job in the first place. Nor is it a valid argument or \n     palliative to suggest that the same number of Americans also \n     voted for Vice President Albert Gore Jr., and that he would \n     become president upon President Clinton's removal. This \n     argument is far too dependent on the particular nature of the \n     unusual positive connection between this President, this \n     Vice-President, and the American people. It flies in the face \n     of the few actual examples of past presidents who faced the \n     prospect of impeachment.\n       In 1868, President Johnson, an unpopular president who had \n     been President Lincoln's vice-president, himself had no vice \n     president. A member of the Senate would have succeeded him \n     had he been convicted. In the case of President Nixon, whose \n     resignation merely substituted for a nearly certain removal \n     from office in an impeachment trial, Gerald R. Ford was \n     elevated to the presidency. He had never been elected \n     popularly to an office higher than the House of \n     Representatives. In any event, the political similarity of a \n     vice-president to a president cannot be taken seriously as an \n     argument that conviction will be less wrenching for the \n     country or damaging to the institution of the presidency. The \n     crucial fact in this case remains that on November 5, 1996, \n     the American people hired one man and one man alone to be \n     their president, and they have a right to expect that their \n     decision will be honored and preserved, except in the most \n     dire circumstances.\n       This principle does not apply in the same way to the \n     impeachment of judges. Elected presidents and appointed \n     judges are chosen differently and their removal must be \n     considered differently. They are starkly different in the \n     nature and scope of their duties and in the sources of their \n     constitutional legitimacy.\n       In the American constitutional system, it cannot soundly be \n     argued that every precedent from past impeachments of judges \n     must control in the impeachment of an elected president. I do \n     not suggest here a lower standard of behavior for presidents. \n     Rather, I believe that our system requires a higher standard \n     for removal of an elected president than for an appointed \n     judge. Judges serve for life ``during good behavior.'' That \n     is a long time, with no means of removing a judge except \n     impeachment. Presidents are chosen by the people in a sacred \n     democratic process. If the people become displeased with the \n     president they have chosen, they need only wait for the next \n     election or the end of his term.\n       Thus, the analogy of an elected president to an appointed \n     judge is weak. Weaker still are the arguments that the \n     President must be removed because a corporate manager or \n     military officer would be removed under similar \n     circumstances. Corporate life is an arena of private behavior \n     and corporate positions do not proceed from popular \n     elections. Personnel decisions in the boardroom are of no \n     broad constitutional consequence. Military officers likewise \n     are not chosen by the voters. The corporate and military \n     analogies\n\n[[Page S1719]]\n\n     cannot justify overturning a presidential election.\n       Yet, while overturning an election is the most severe \n     constitutional sanction in our democracy, this President has \n     chosen to conduct himself in such a manner as to run the risk \n     that the U.S. Senate reasonably could conclude that he has \n     committed ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' That is not the \n     conclusion I ultimately reach. But at least with regard to \n     one of the charges in Article II, the President came \n     perilously close to committing an impeachable offense. Even \n     without his removal, this is a tragic occurrence in our \n     nation's history and a personal disappointment to me as one \n     who holds the abilities and many of the accomplishments of \n     this President in high esteem.\n       This impeachment process has led members of the Senate to \n     consult the relatively scant history of American \n     impeachments. Much of the history relates to the impeachment \n     of federal judges, and this was of some limited relevance to \n     these proceedings. Of the greatest relevance, however, are \n     the histories of the impeachment and acquittal of Andrew \n     Johnson in 1868, and the virtual impeachment and conviction \n     of President Nixon, who resigned in the face of near certain \n     removal in 1974.\n       Based on my reading and study, the actions of President \n     Clinton lie somewhere between the conduct of the presidents \n     in the Johnson and Nixon episodes. The general historical \n     view appears to be that the case against President Johnson \n     lacked a credible basis for removal, the primary accusation \n     being that President Johnson removed a cabinet secretary from \n     office in circumvention of the law. President Johnson \n     disputed the constitutionality of the statute he was alleged \n     to have violated, and apparently had a good basis for that \n     view. The United States Supreme Court ultimately struck down \n     a similar statute as unconstitutional. Myers v. United \n     States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926). Johnson argued that he was the \n     victim of a partisan Congress, determined to punish him for \n     his policies. History has adopted that view. The President's \n     defenders point to the Johnson case and they argue that the \n     impeachment of President Clinton is the same sort of partisan \n     exercise, unfounded in fact or law.\n       The President's accusers point to the case of President \n     Nixon. In contrast to the relatively weak case against \n     President Johnson, most regard President Nixon's actions in \n     covering up his and others' efforts to interfere with the \n     1972 presidential election to be a classic example of the \n     type of conduct that the framers sought to discourage with \n     the ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' provision. President \n     Nixon's misdeeds almost certainly would have led to his \n     impeachment and conviction if he had not resigned. His \n     alleged crimes were clearly committed in the course of his \n     public duties, subverting the Constitution, compromising the \n     integrity of the processes of government, and using agents of \n     the government for illegal political purposes. The \n     President's accusers argue that the same is true of President \n     Clinton.\n       With all due respect to historians and constitutional \n     scholars who may know more or feel differently, it is my \n     sense that the case against President Clinton is the first \n     close or ``hard'' case of presidential impeachment in our \n     nation's long history. This case lies in the middle. It is a \n     hard case and senators may see it either way.\n       In the ordinary practice of law, there is a saying that \n     ``hard cases make bad law.'' Some people may invoke that \n     phrase when they complain that the President has ``gotten \n     away with it.'' Others may invoke it with concern that we \n     have somehow made it easier to impeach, if not convict, a \n     president. I have tried to remember that adage as we have \n     made our procedural and evidentiary decisions along the way. \n     Our actions in this trial and our decision today may hold \n     even greater significance for our nation's constitutional \n     structure than the past two presidential impeachments, as \n     wrenching and important as each of those was in our nation's \nhistory and in its time. I hope, in the end, that this hard case has \nmade good law.\n\n\n                 II. Analysis of Alleged Federal Crimes\n\n     A. Standard of proof\n       In drafting the two Articles of Impeachment against \n     President Clinton, the House of Representatives sought to \n     portray certain conduct by the President as meeting the \n     constitutional standard of ``High Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' \n     In the specific language employed by the House in the \n     Articles, and in the forceful arguments advanced by the House \n     Managers on the Senate floor, a strategic choice was made. A \n     particular approach was adopted that the House Managers \n     clearly believe puts their case in its strongest light. They \n     could simply have recited and attempted to prove certain \n     conduct by the President and then argued, independent of the \n     strictures of modern criminal law, that the President had \n     committed ``High Crimes and Misdemeanors'' as that term has \n     been understood throughout this nation's constitutional \n     history.\n       Perhaps to make the facts of the case more easily \n     understandable, or perhaps because the conduct alone may lack \n     the gravity to justify the removal from office of the \n     President of the United States, the House Managers chose \n     another course, laden with the opprobrium of the modern \n     statutory federal criminal law. Rather than simply alleging a \n     course of general presidential misconduct, they placed \n     enormous reliance on their assertion that the President \n     committed the serious federal crimes of perjury and \n     obstruction of justice. Indeed, in his opening statement on \n     January 15, House Manager McCollum stated quite directly:\n       ``The first thing you have to determine is whether or not \n     the President committed crimes. It is only if you determine \n     he committed the crimes of perjury, obstruction of justice, \n     and witness tampering that you will move to the question of \n     whether he is removed from office. In fact, no one, none of \n     us, would argue to you that the President should be removed \n     from office unless you conclude that he committed the crimes \n     that he is alleged to have committed.''\n       The very names of these crimes connote in modern America \n     the type of conduct that is hard to reconcile with the \n     continuation in office of the chief law enforcement officer \n     of this nation. The House Managers' strategy was clever. It \n     had an emotional power deeply rooted in the nation's \n     abhorrence of disrespect for the law. It also placed the \n     triers of fact and law in the position of potentially having \n     to justify a decision that the President committed these \n     federal crimes, but that these particular instances of \n     alleged perjury and obstruction of justice did not constitute \n     ``High Crimes and Misdemeanors'' as intended by the Framers.\n       I see nothing inappropriate in this approach and, in some \n     ways, it assisted me in organizing my thoughts about this \n     case. An obligation, however, does attend the House Managers' \n     decision to rely on proving that the President committed \n     actual federal statutory crimes. That obligation relates to \n     the standard of proof.\n       I cannot justify concluding that the President should be \n     removed from office for committing these federal crimes \n     unless the case is proved by the same standard of proof that \n     any federal prosecutor would be required to meet in a federal \n     criminal case. This standard requires that the President be \n     shown to have committed one of the two crimes alleged \n     ``beyond a reasonable doubt,'' as that standard of proof is \n     understood in our criminal justice system. The ``beyond a \n     reasonable doubt'' standard is guaranteed to defendants in \n     criminal cases by the due process clause of the Constitution. \n     Victor v. Nebraska, 511 U.S. 1 (1994). To apply any lesser \n     standard in this trial would be unfair not only to the \n     President, but also to the tens of millions of Americans \n     whose right to have the President finish his term could be \n     overridden by a mere likelihood or possibility that he \n     actually committed such serious crimes.\n       In other words, the House Managers are free to use the \n     ``sword'' of the language of the federal criminal law but \n     cannot simultaneously deprive the president of the ``shield'' \n     that same criminal law provides any defendant by requiring \n     the prosecution to prove its case by the highest standard of \n     proof in our legal system.\n     B. Perjury\n       Article I charges the President with committing numerous \n     acts of perjury in his Grand Jury testimony of August 17, \n     1998. To convict an individual of perjury under 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec.  1621 or Sec.  1623, the prosecution in a criminal case \n     must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant: (1) \n     knowingly or willfully made a (2) false, (3) material \n     declaration (4) under oath (5) in a proceeding before or \n     ancillary to any court or grand jury of the United States. To \n     be perjurious, the false statements must be knowingly or \n     willfully false and material to the proceeding in which they \n     are given. Literally true statements, even if misleading, are \n     not perjurious. And if a witness honestly believes that his \n     or her testimony is true at the time the testimony is given, \n     it is not perjurious, even if it is later shown to have been \n     false.\n       Before turning to the allegations of perjury in Article I, \n     I must comment on the failure of the House to specify the \n     perjurious statements on which it based its charge. The \n     President's counsel made a convincing argument that if \n     Article I were offered as an indictment in a criminal case, \n     it would be dismissed out of hand for this failure. And \n     despite being alerted to this deficiency in the President's \n     answer and his opening trial memorandum, the House Managers \n     steadfastly refused to be specific and complete in their \n     discussion of the perjury charges, constantly referring to \n     alleged acts of perjury as mere examples.\n       As a Senator who has tried to apply a thorough and \n     impartial legal analysis to these charges, I have found this \n     refusal to specify the alleged perjurious statements somewhat \n     frustrating. Unfortunately, even at the conclusion of this \n     trial, it is still very difficult to be sure of what the full \n     list of alleged perjuries includes. Indeed, it is even \n     difficult to be sure if the House Managers continue to rely \n     on all of the charges they raised in their trial memorandum \n     and opening presentation.\n       The House listed four ``categories'' of perjury before the \n     Grand Jury. With respect to the first category, ``the nature \n     and details of his relationship with a subordinate Government \n     employee,'' I find that some of the examples that the House \n     Managers raised in their trial memorandum and in presenting \n     their case in the trial are truly frivolous. The Grand Jury \n     was investigating perjury and obstruction of justice in the \n     civil case pursued by Paula Jones. Once the President \n     admitted that his relationship with Monica Lewinsky included \n     inappropriate sexual conduct, of what possible materiality to \n     the Grand Jury's inquiry was the question of how many times \n     such conduct occurred?\n       The testimony of the President concerning whether he \n     engaged in conduct with Ms.\n\n[[Page S1720]]\n\n     Lewinsky that would have been considered ``sexual relations'' \n     as that term was defined in the Jones case is the one \n     instance of testimony in this category cited by the House \n     Managers that was clearly material to the Grand Jury's \n     investigation of possible perjury in the deposition. As to \n     the specific facts at issue, we still have only the \n     conflicting testimony of the two witnesses, Ms. Lewinsky and \n     the President. While there are good common sense reasons to \n     doubt the President's version of a wholly non-reciprocal \n     sexual relationship, perjury has not been proven beyond a \n     reasonable doubt. Even if we accept Ms. Lewinsky's version of \n     what kind of touching occurred, the ultimate question of \n     whether President Clinton's statements on this issue in the \n     Grand Jury were actually false turns on the question of what \n     his intent was in engaging in those particular acts with Ms. \n     Lewinsky. I simply cannot say that there is no reasonable \n     doubt on this point. Even Ms. Lewinsky stated in her \n     deposition that the President's intent was something on which \n     she did not feel comfortable commenting.\n       A second category of alleged perjury consists of statements \n     by the President before the Grand Jury concerning his earlier \n     testimony in the deposition in the Jones case. This is \n     ``bootstrapping.'' It is particularly troubling because the \n     House of Representatives, and even one of the House Managers, \n     rejected an Article of Impeachment that alleged that the \n     President committed perjury in the Jones deposition. I reject \n     the House Managers' argument that the President reaffirmed \n     his entire Jones deposition before the Grand Jury and \n     therefore should be found guilty of perjury in the Grand Jury \n     if any of his deposition testimony was false. The basis for \n     this breathtaking position, as laid out by House Manager \n     Rogan in response to Senator Nickles' question, is the \n     statement made by the President in response to a question \n     from the Independent Counsel concerning what the oath he \n     swore to tell the truth in the Jones deposition meant to him. \n     He said, ``I believed then that I had to answer the questions \n     truthfully, that's correct.'' In my mind, that was not a \n     reaffirmation of his entire Jones deposition testimony \n     sufficient to make any perjury in that deposition perjury \n     ``by reference'' before the Grand Jury.\n       The President did state a few times in the Grand Jury that \n     he intended to answer the Jones' lawyers questions in the \n     deposition in a misleading but technically true manner, and \n     House Manager McCollum highlighted a few of those statements \n     in his closing argument concerning this category of perjury. \n     For purposes of the charge of perjury before the Grand Jury \n     in these statements, the key issue is not whether the \n     President succeeded in negotiating the line between perjury \n     and misleading but true testimony, but whether he intended to \n     negotiate that line. Frankly, my reading of his testimony in \n     the Jones deposition is that it was, in fact, his intent to \n     tell the truth. In the Jones deposition, he was cagey and \n     evasive, but he appeared to be trying mightily not to tell an \n     out and out lie. Even though he may very well have crossed \n     the line on a number of occasions, I have to find that there \n     is reasonable doubt that the President was committing perjury \n     in the Grand Jury when he said that his intent was to testify \n     truthfully in the Jones deposition.\n       The third part of Article I deserves only brief mention. It \n     boils down to the charge that the President lied when he said \n     he wasn't paying attention when his lawyer offered Monica \n     Lewinsky's affidavit in the Jones deposition and argued that \n     it meant that ``there is absolutely no sex of any kind, in \n     any manner, shape, or form, with President Clinton.'' The \n     only evidence that the House Managers offered to support \n     their charge of perjury is the videotape of the deposition \n     in which President Clinton is seen looking, we are told, \n     in the direction of his lawyer when this conversation \n     occurred. The House Managers tried to bolster this \n     shockingly thin reed on which to base a perjury charge \n     with a similarly inconclusive affidavit from a law clerk \n     to Judge Susan Webber Wright. This is perhaps the weakest \n     of the many inferences about the President's state of mind \n     that the House Managers urge us to accept in order to \n     convict. I am virtually certain that a perjury charge \n     based on this kind of evidence would not be pursued by a \n     federal prosecutor, and absolutely certain that a jury \n     would not find guilt on such a charge beyond a reasonable \n     doubt. I certainly cannot.\n       The fourth and final part of Article I alleges that the \n     President committed perjury when he testified in the Grand \n     Jury concerning ``his corrupt efforts to influence the \n     testimony of witnesses and to impede the discovery of \n     evidence'' in the Jones case. This presumably refers to the \n     President's statements to the Grand Jury concerning the gift \n     exchange and his conversations with Betty Currie and other \n     aides after his Jones deposition. With respect to the \n     President's testimony about the gifts, I find it significant \n     that Monica Lewinsky revealed for the first time in her \n     Senate deposition that she had told the FBI shortly after the \n     President's deposition that one of his statements about the \n     gifts ``sounded familiar.'' Her Senate deposition was the \n     first time that anyone learned about that FBI interview. \n     Surely this was ``exculpatory information'' that the \n     Independent Counsel and the House Managers had the \n     responsibility to disclose to the President's counsel and \n     bring to our attention.\n       The President denied that he instructed Betty Currie to \n     pick up the gifts from Monica Lewinsky. By charging the \n     President with perjury for that statement, the House Managers \n     have essentially tried to convert their obstruction charge \n     into a perjury charge. But there is an unresolved conflict of \n     testimony on the issue of who initiated the hiding of the \n     gifts. As I will explain later, that conflict raises \n     reasonable doubt in my mind about that portion of the \n     obstruction charge. It is similarly dispositive of the \n     perjury charge, which essentially amounts to a claim that the \n     President lied when he said he did not obstruct justice by \n     urging Betty Currie to pick up the gifts.\n       The President stated in the Grand Jury that in his \n     conversations with aides after his deposition in the Jones \n     case he attempted to be literally truthful, but misleading, \n     in order to conceal his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. The \n     questioning here by the Independent Counsel was far too \n     general to support a perjury conviction for his statement in \n     the Grand Jury that he ``said things that were true'' to his \n     aides. He certainly said many things that were true to his \n     aides, and he told some lies. The clear import of his \n     testimony was that he was trying to conceal his relationship \n     with Ms. Lewinsky from his aides while being generally \n     truthful to them. I do not believe that the President \n     willfully or knowingly lied when he said this to the Grand \n     Jury, nor do I believe that these statements were material to \n     the Grand Jury's inquiry, since he was never asked about and \n     he never denied making specific statements to his aides that \n     were not true.\n       As I will discuss later with respect to Article II, the \n     President's conversations with Betty Currie give me the most \n     pause and cause me the most concern in this whole matter. \n     While it may be hard to believe the President's explanation \n     in the Grand Jury that he was ``trying to figure out what the \n     facts were,'' his intent in having the oblique and tortured \n     conversation with Ms. Currie is not clear enough to find \n     beyond a reasonable doubt that he committed perjury in the \n     Grand Jury when he discussed that conversation.\n       In sum, I do not believe that the House Managers have \n     proved the elements of perjury beyond a reasonable doubt. But \n     I also must say that even if one or two of these charges did \n     meet that test, I would have some skepticism about Article I. \n     It was a highly unusual situation that led to the President's \n     appearance before the Grand Jury. Targets of criminal \n     investigations are almost never subpoenaed to testify in the \n     Grand Jury, and when they are subpoenaed, they invariably \n     invoke their Fifth Amendment rights. Here, of course, the \n     President did not invoke his right against self-incrimination \n     but instead answered questions about the charges against him. \n     And now he faces charges that he committed perjury when he \n     denied committing the crimes of perjury in the deposition and \n     obstruction of justice that the Grand Jury was investigating. \n     I am uncomfortable with these prosecutorial tactics, which \n     come very close, it seems to me, to using the Grand Jury not \n     only to investigate potential crimes but to trap the \n     President into committing them.\n     C. Obstruction of justice\n       In Article II, the House charged President Clinton with \n     obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Once again, to \n     successfully convict defendants in criminal cases of these \n     charges, prosecutors must prove each of the elements of the \n     crime beyond a reasonable doubt. And that is the standard I \n     believe is most appropriate here.\n       In the case of obstruction, the elements of a violation of \n     18 U.S.C. Sec.  1503 are that: (1) a judicial proceeding was \n     pending; (2) the defendant knew it was pending; and (3) the \n     defendant corruptly endeavored to influence, obstruct, or \n     impede the due administration of justice in the proceeding. \n     The courts have indicated that the requirement that the \n     defendant ``corruptly endeavor to influence'' provides the \n     element of intent in this crime. To ``corruptly endeavor to \n     influence'' is to act voluntarily and deliberately with the \n     purpose of improperly influencing or obstructing the \n     administration of justice.\n       Witness tampering under 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1512 requires proof \n     that the defendant (1) corruptly persuaded or attempted to do \n     so or engaged in misleading conduct toward another person (2) \n     with intent (a) to influence or prevent that person's \n     testimony in an official proceeding; or (b) to cause or \n     induce any person to withhold testimony or physical evidence \n     from an official proceeding.\n       The charges against the President in Article II have been \n     referred to by the House Managers as the ``seven pillars of \n     obstruction.'' Some of these charges are more easily \n     interpreted as allegations that the federal witness tampering \n     statute has been violated. In any event, the crucial disputed \n     element in all the charges against the President is intent to \n     influence or obstruct the proceeding. The House Managers made \n     little effort to distinguish between the two criminal \n     statutes, which both include that element. Indeed, if the \n     intent element of these crimes were proven, some of the \n     alleged improper conduct of the President could fall under \n     both statutes, which is one reason I have referred to the \n     case against the President as a close one, with regard to \n     Article II.\n       The House Managers have regularly urged the Senate to look \n     at the entirety of the charges against the President and not \n     to pick apart the individual allegations. I think the more \n     appropriate analysis, however, is to\n\n[[Page S1721]]\n\n     look at each allegation and determine if the elements of \n     obstruction are proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In many \n     cases, the House Managers seem to take the position that the \n     intent to obstruct or influence can be inferred from a \n     pattern of behavior. But each allegation cannot be considered \n     part of a ``pattern of obstruction'' unless it meets the \n     elements of obstruction (or witness tampering) on its own. \n     Otherwise, Article II become a series of ``bootstraps,'' \n     which are alleged to add up to obstruction of justice without \n     any specific action actually constituting a violation of \n     federal law.\n       Nonetheless, there is no question in my mind that Article \n     II is the more serious of the two articles of impeachment, \n     because the factual allegations are more troubling and \n     because it charges conduct that involved a number of \n     individuals, in and out of government, other than the \n     President. If the allegations are true, this conduct would \n     undermine respect for the rule of law and injure our system \n     of justice even more deeply than perjury, which, of course, \n     is a serious violation as well. Because I took these charges \n     very seriously, I wanted to give the House Managers every \n     reasonable opportunity to prove them. I supported the \n     issuance of subpoenas to witnesses for depositions and the \n     presentation of the witnesses' testimony to the Senate \n     because I wanted to be very clear in my own mind about what \n     had taken place before deciding whether to acquit or convict \n     on this particular article.\n       The first two obstruction charges against the President \n     arise out of his late night telephone conversation with \n     Monica Lewinsky on December 17, 1997. The House Managers \n     charge that during that call the President encouraged Ms. \n     Lewinsky to file a false affidavit and to lie if called upon \n     to testify in the Jones case. While I may agree with House \n     Manager Graham that a telephone call at the hour of 2:30 a.m. \n     is not likely to be a casual call, the burden on the House \n     Managers is to prove that the President committed a crime \n     during the call, not merely to invite an inference that he \n     was ``up to no good.'' And the direct evidence--testimony \n     from Ms. Lewinsky--does not support the Managers' theory. She \n     testified repeatedly that she never, ``ever'' discussed the \n     contents of her affidavit with the President. In addition, \n     according to Ms. Lewinsky, the discussion of ``cover \n     stories'' in the December 17 phone call was not in connection \n     with her possible affidavit or testimony in the Jones case.\n       There simply is not enough evidence that the President \n     intended to influence Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit or testimony \n     to find that the law was broken. According to Ms. Lewinsky, \n     they discussed the possibility of her filing an affidavit in \n     order to avoid testifying, but did not discuss the details of \n     that affidavit. She testified that she thought the contents \n     of affidavit could include a ``range of things,'' running \n     from the innocuous to the deceitful. Indeed, the main \n     evidence offered by the House Managers seems to be that the \n     President and Ms. Lewinksy over the period of the \n     relationship developed ``cover stories'' and planned to \n     conceal their affair. The House Managers suggest that we must \n     infer from the mention of these cover stories during the \n     December 17 conversation a signal to Ms. Lewinsky that they \n     should be employed in the affidavit or in Ms. Lewinsky's \n     testimony if she were called.\n       The ``cover stories'' had been developed over a year \n     earlier. The House Managers argue that they were transformed \n     into obstruction of justice and witness tampering when Ms. \n     Lewinsky became a witness in the Jones case by their mere \n     mention in the telephone conversation of December 17. That is \n     an interesting theory, but evidence of the President's intent \n     to obstruct justice in that conversation is simply lacking. I \n     do not believe a federal criminal prosecution would ever be \n     brought with such a slim factual foundation, notwithstanding \n     the earnest statements to the contrary by a number of the \n     House Managers who are former prosecutors.\n       Another allegation refuted by the depositions taken by the \n     House Managers was the charge based on the efforts of Vernon \n     Jordan to secure Monica Lewinsky a job. Jordan admitted that \n     he sought a job for Ms. Lewinsky at the request of the \n     President. However disturbing the conduct and whatever \n     innuendo it invites, it was not against the law for the \n     President to seek to aid a woman with whom he had carried on \n     an illicit relationship. It only amounts to obstruction of \n     justice or witness tampering if it is proven that the job \n     assistance was offered with the intent of preventing her from \n     testifying or influencing her testimony in the Jones case. \n     Numerous facts cut against this allegation: (1) the \n     President's efforts to help Ms. Lewinsky find a job started \n     long before she was a witness in the Jones case; (2) Vernon \n     Jordan's intensified efforts predated by at least a week his \n     knowledge that she had been subpoenaed; (3) both Ms. Lewinsky \n     and Mr. Jordan testified that they thought that the job \n     search and the submission of Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit were \n     not connected.\n       Vernon Jordan's role in this whole story is nonetheless \n     troubling. It is clear he made extraordinary efforts to help \n     Ms. Lewinsky obtain employment, and he kept the President \n     informed of his progress. But I cannot conclude beyond a \n     reasonable doubt that his efforts must be attributed to a \n     plan on the part of the President to prevent Ms. Lewinsky \n     from testifying truthfully in the Jones case. Just as \n     plausible is that the President's motive to help Ms. Lewinsky \n     was loyalty or guilt, or to make it less likely that she \n     would reveal the relationship, which had long since ceased to \n     be sexual, to one of her friends or the press.\n       Another charge in Article II deals with the President's \n     failure to prevent his lawyer from relying on Ms. Lewinsky's \n     misleading affidavit during the Jones deposition. But \n     evidence of the President's intent to obstruct justice is \n     completely lacking here. As a witness in a deposition, the \n     President did not have a duty to monitor his lawyer's \n     statements. One can only imagine what the President was \n     thinking about as he listened to the lawyers and Judge Wright \n     debate whether he was going to have to answer questions about \n     his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.\n       Before turning to the most serious allegations of \n     obstruction and witness tampering, let me comment on the \n     final charge in Article II, which concerns the President's \n     statements to aides who later were called before the Grand \n     Jury to testify. This charge has been a sideshow and a \n     distraction from the beginning. While the charge is listed in \n     Article II as one of the ``means used to implement'' the \n     ``course of conduct or scheme designed to delay, impede, \n     cover up, and conceal the existence of evidence and \n     testimony'' in the Jones case, it actually alleges an effort \n     to obstruct the Grand Jury investigation. Furthermore, it \n     assumes that in the days when the Lewinsky story was \n     breaking, the President's conversations with his aides were \n     aimed at influencing their eventual testimony in the Grand \n     Jury, rather than dealing with the public firestorm that was \n     enveloping the White House and the enormous personal \n     embarrassment and humiliation that the President faced as his \n     affair became public.\n       There is much for the Congress and the nation to criticize \n     about the President's behavior in this matter. Concealing the \n     truth and the intimate details of this relationship from his \n     close aides ranks well down on the list for me. I am much \n     more outraged by his very public, very forceful denial of the \n     affair to the American people on national television. Yet \n     that denial does not appear to be part of a scheme to \n     obstruct the Grand Jury. And the fact that the President's \n     more elaborate lie about the nature of his relationship with \n     Ms. Lewinsky in his conversation with Sidney Blumenthal found \n     its way into press accounts is essentially irrelevant to the \n     question of whether the President committed a crime. Yet the \n     House Managers spent hours and hours trying to substantiate \n     their claim that there was a White House effort, masterminded \n     by the President, to discredit and attack Ms. Lewinsky. They \n     even called Sidney Blumenthal as a witness and explored this \n     issue in depth with him. Then, on the day our deliberations \n     started, they sought to introduce new evidence and take new \n     depositions because they believe that Mr. Blumenthal was \n     untruthful in his deposition.\n       After all this, the House Managers still have not explained \n     what crime is lurking in the conspiracy they think they have \n     found. The President cannot be impeached and removed from \n     office for being a ``bully,'' or being ``mean,'' or because \n     his Administration has a muscular spin operation. On this \n     charge, not only is there a reasonable doubt that the \n     President intended to obstruct justice when he misled his \n     aides about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, there is no \n     evidence at all that he did.\n       Let me turn to the two charges of Article II that I view as \n     the most serious and substantial--the concealment of gifts \n     given by the President to Ms. Lewinsky and the President's \n     two conversations with his personal secretary, Betty Currie, \n     after he was deposed in the Jones case.\n       It is significant that both of these allegations involve \n     Ms. Currie. And the gift concealment allegation raises what \n     is probably the most serious factual dispute in this case--\n     the question of whether it was Ms. Lewinsky or Ms. Currie who \n     suggested hiding the gifts. Yet even when given the \n     opportunity to call a limited number of witnesses for \n     depositions, the House Managers chose not to call Betty \n     Currie. I was troubled by this at the time, particularly \n     since the testimony of Sidney Blumenthal seemed so tangential \n     to the case. Other than Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie was the \n     most important witness in this case, and the House Managers \n     chose not to depose her.\n       While I was inclined to give the House Managers the benefit \n     of the doubt on their witness selection, I am prohibited from \n     giving them the benefit of the doubt on whose testimony to \n     believe on key disputes of fact. Without seeing Ms. Currie \n     testify, I have no basis on which to compare her credibility \n     to that of Ms. Lewinsky on the issue of who initiated the \n     hiding of the gifts. Furthermore, Ms. Lewinsky testified that \n     she was concerned about the Jones lawyers' request for the \n     gifts long before her December 28 meeting with the President \n     and her delivery of the gifts to Ms. Currie later that day.\n       I was struck by Ms. Lewinsky's testimony on this point in \n     her Senate deposition. She seemed indefinite when she \n     reaffirmed her earlier testimony that Betty Currie had called \n     her about the gifts, rather than vice versa. In this \n     instance, I appreciated the opportunity to view Ms. \n     Lewinsky's demeanor when she testified. She seemed \n     significantly less certain about who raised the idea of \n     hiding the gifts. I certainly do not conclude that she was \n     lying, but her memory of the sequence of events did not seem \n     as clear on this point as it was on many of the issues \n     discussed in the deposition. The fact that the\n\n[[Page S1722]]\n\n     President gave Ms. Lewinsky even more gifts on December 28 \n     lends additional weight to the theory that it was Ms. \n     Lewinsky who wanted to hide the gifts, not the President.\n       With an unresolved direct conflict between the testimony of \n     the two primary witnesses on this allegation, I simply cannot \n     find beyond a reasonable doubt that the President \n     masterminded the gift exchange to obstruct the Jones case.\n       Finally, we come to what for me has been the most difficult \n     charge of Article II--the President's alleged ``coaching'' of \n     Betty Currie. Neither the President's testimony in the Grand \n     Jury concerning these conversations nor his lawyers' valiant \n     efforts to explain them were wholly convincing. For the \n     President to call his secretary into the Oval Office on a \n     Sunday --the day after his deposition in the Jones case--and \n     feed her a number of falsehoods about his relationship with \n     Ms. Lewinsky is very alarming.\n       The central issue, however, is the President's intent. \n     Knowing that the secret of his relationship with Lewinsky was \n     out, but not yet knowing who had told the Jones lawyers about \n     it, the President could very well have been concerned mostly \n     about public exposure and what his wife would soon learn. He \n     knew that Betty Currie was aware of his friendship with Ms. \n     Lewinsky, but he did not know how much she knew or had \n     surmised about what went on behind closed doors. Since all of \n     that activity had ended quite a long time before, it is not \n     inconceivable that the President was trying to find out what \n     Ms. Currie knew or even influence what Ms. Currie would say \n     to other White House staff, without being specifically \n     concerned with her being a witness in the Jones case.\n       It is worth noting here that I am unconvinced by the \n     argument frequently made by the House Managers that Monica \n     Lewinsky was a crucial witness in the Jones case whose \n     testimony might have changed the course of that litigation. \n     Despite the fact that Monica Lewinsky was at one time a White \n     House intern and later a White House employee, there is no \n     allegation of sexual harassment in the relationship, and Ms. \n     Lewinsky consistently characterized her interaction with the \n     President as affectionate and consensual.\n       The Jones case later was dismissed on legal grounds that \n     were wholly unrelated to any issue on which Ms. Lewinsky \n     could have shed light. Thus, it is my view that the President \n     hoped that Ms. Lewinsky would not have to testify in the \n     Jones case because he did not want their affair to become \n     public, not because he was concerned about the impact of her \n     testimony on Paula Jones' claims. When he called Ms. Currie \n     into his office on January 18, he knew that someone had told \n     the Jones lawyers about Monica Lewinsky. In that context, it \n     is at least plausible that he was concerned about the \n     imminent explosion of press attention and the political \n     damage that would result from it, rather than his legal \n     situation.\n       Whatever our suspicions about the President's intentions in \n     his conversations with Ms. Currie, the available evidence \n     does not entitle us to a convincing inference about his state \n     of mind that would support a finding of guilt. Therefore, \n     although I still have concerns about this allegation of \n     witness tampering, and I believe it was a serious charge to \n     which the President's defense was weak, I do not believe that \n     the House Managers have carried their burden to show beyond a \n     reasonable doubt that the President's intent was to obstruct \n     justice in the Jones case. I cannot reach this conclusion, \n     however, without expressing my deepest concern and sadness \n     that I am able to say only that the President apparently just \n     barely avoided committing the crime of obstruction of justice \n     in his conversations with Betty Currie.\n\n\n                   III. High Crimes and Misdemeanors\n\n       Many Senators chose to reach the issue of the \n     ``impeachability'' of the offenses charged against the \n     President as a threshold question of law prior to hearing the \n     House Managers' full case. Many voted for Senator Byrd's \n     motion to dismiss on this basis. For two reasons, I believed \n     it was appropriate to allow the facts of the case to be more \n     fully presented and put into evidence before making a legal \n     judgment.\n       First, I believed that as a matter of deference and respect \n     for the constitutional role of the House of Representatives, \n     the case, including evidence, should be presented before the \n     Senate reached a judgment. The Constitution gives the House \n     the sole power of impeachment, and a determination of whether \n     certain offenses constitute ``Treason, Bribery, or other high \n     Crimes and Misdemeanors'' is necessarily a part of the \n     House's decision to impeach a president. While the Senate's \n     exclusive power to try, convict, and remove a president makes \n     it the final arbiter of whether the conduct alleged is \n     ``impeachable,'' I believe it is incumbent on the Senate to \n     permit the House Managers a reasonable opportunity to set out \n     their case against the President before making a decision on \n     that question. Whatever misgivings I may have about the way \n     the House exercised its constitutional power to impeach in \n     this instance, I felt compelled to permit the House Managers \n     a reasonable opportunity to make their case before I would \n     exercise my role as both a trier of fact and a judge of law.\n       Second, the historical and legal authorities on the \n     question of what constitutes ``other high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors'' are varied and not wholly consistent. I \n     believed that I could apply those authorities with more \n     certainty to a clear and complete set of facts, after hearing \n     the evidence, than to a set of allegations that might never \n     be proved. I recognize that when courts entertain motions to \n     dismiss in civil cases, they assume that all facts alleged in \n     a complaint are true and determine the scope and impact of \n     the particular statute or legal doctrine on which the claim \n     for relief is based. But in this case, I felt more \n     comfortable reaching the legal question of ``impeachability'' \n     after hearing the evidence. I was comfortable allowing this \n     limited deference to the prerogatives of the House Managers \n     in the interest of a thorough and constitutional process.\n       Having decided that the House Managers failed to prove that \n     the President committed the federal crimes they alleged, the \n     question remains whether the underlying acts themselves, \n     whether criminal or not, constitute conduct that under the \n     Constitution constitute ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' that \n     should result in the President's removal from office. On the \n     issue of what constitutes ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' \n     as in many other issues in this impeachment and trial, there \n     has been heated and polarizing rhetoric. The House Managers \n     and their supporters argued vigorously that the criminal acts \n     they charged were, on their face, high crimes. White House \n     counsel and many historians and legal scholars argued the \n     contrary, that these acts could in no way be considered high \n     crimes.\n       Other than bribery and treason, the Constitution itself \n     gives no exhaustive or exclusive list of those offenses for \n     which presidents should be removed from office. We are given \n     only the phrase ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' for \n     guidance. The key to understanding the meaning of this phrase \n     in my view are the words ``other'' and ``high.''\n       As University of Chicago Law School Professor Joseph \n     Isenbergh has written:\n       ``* * * without the word `high' attached to it, the \n     expression `crimes and misdemeanors' is nothing more than a \n     description of public wrongs, offenses that are cognizable in \n     some court of criminal jurisdiction.''\n       Isenbergh notes that in the 18th Century, the word ``high'' \n     when attached to the word ``crime'' or ``misdemeanor,'' \n     described a crime aiming at the state or the sovereign rather \n     than a private person, and thus a ``high Crime or \n     Misdemeanor'' was not simply a serious crime, but one aimed \n     at the highest powers of the state. This concept had been \n     asserted by William Blackstone and others, and was well \n     understood by the Framers of the Constitution.\n       Indeed, Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist Paper No. 65 \n     that the crimes to be considered in a court of impeachment \n     are:\n       ``[T]hose offenses which proceed from the misconduct of \n     public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of \n     some public trust. They are of a nature which may with \n     particular propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate \n     chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.''\n       Writing at the time of the Nixon impeachment, Yale \n     University Law Professor Charles Black commented that the \n     crimes enumerated in the Constitution, treason and bribery, \n     are crimes that ``so seriously threaten the order of \n     political society as to make pestilent and dangerous the \n     continuance in power of their perpetrator.'' In my view, \n     ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' must be interpreted as \n     crimes or acts of a similar gravity and impact on society as \n     those enumerated crimes.\n       To determine whether the conduct that led to impeachment \n     for these crimes meets the definition of a high crime, the \n     underlying circumstances must govern and a determination must \n     be made if the offense, in Black's words, ``threatens the \n     order of political society.'' While it is certainly true that \n     an act need not be criminal in a technical sense to \n     constitute a threat to the well-being of the State, the acts \n     in this case were not assaults on the State or the liberties \n     of the people that threaten the order of political society, \n     as contemplated by the Framers. This conduct does not justify \n     overturning the will of the people as expressed in the 1996 \n     election.\n\n\n                             IV. Conclusion\n\n       As I listened carefully to the trial proceedings over the \n     past month, I was impressed with the efforts of counsel for \n     both sides in making their cases. Even understanding the role \n     of counsel as advocates, however, I was troubled by the \n     exaggerated claims with regard to the strength of each side \n     of the case.\n       The House Managers referred to the evidence in support of \n     removal as ``overwhelming,'' while the President's counsel \n     described the House Managers' evidence as ``nonexistent.'' I \n     find neither statement to be true and maybe a little \n     reminiscent of the heated words of the Senator Charles Sumner \n     of Massachusetts in his Opinion following the impeachment \n     trial of President Andrew Johnson:\n       ``In the judgment which I now deliver I cannot hesitate. To \n     my vision the path is clear as day. Never in history was \n     there a great case more free from all just doubt. If Andrew \n     Johnson is not guilty, then never was a political offender \n     guilty before; and, if his acquittal is taken as a precedent, \n     never can a political offender be found guilty again. The \n     proofs are mountainous. Therefore, you are now determining \n     whether impeachment shall continue a beneficent remedy in the \n     Constitution, or be blotted out forever, and the country \n     handed over to the terrible process of revolution as its sole \n     protection.''\n       I cannot view the Clinton impeachment case from either \n     extreme. This, unfortunately, was a close case that raised \n     the very\n\n[[Page S1723]]\n\n     real specter of the nullification of an American presidential \n     election. It is, however, at such a moment, when the high \n     standard for impeachment and conviction becomes especially \n     important.\n       The reason I describe the decision of the American people \n     to elect a president as the most salient fact in this case is \n     not simply because it is the right of the American people to \n     choose their president. It is also because of the \n     constitutional goal of our Founding Fathers to create a \n     system of political stability. Just as the Framers wished to \n     avoid the uncertainty of a parliamentary system, we today in \n     this last year of the twentieth century should be concerned \n     about political instability and the threat that excessive \n     partisanship poses to our constitutional order.\n       I see the four year elected term of our president as a \n     unifying force in our country. Yet this is the second time in \n     my adult life that a President of the United States has \n     undergone a serious impeachment process. And I am only 45 \n     years old. In the nearly two hundred years prior to the case \n     of President Nixon, this happened only once.\n       Are these two recent impeachments a fluke? Is it \n     coincidence that two of our recent presidents were thought by \n     some to be sufficiently unfit to be president to warrant this \n     procedure? I wonder how we will feel about the stability of \n     our system if another presidential impeachment occurs \n     sometime in the next ten or twenty years.\n       I see a danger in this. I see a danger in this in an \n     increasingly diverse country. I see a danger in this in an \n     increasingly divided country. I see a danger when national \n     elections seem never to be over. I see a danger when the lead \n     House Manager in his concluding remarks in this trial asserts \n     that we are engaged in a ``culture war'' in this country. I \n     hope that is not where we are, and I hope that is not where \n     we are heading.\n       In making a decision of this magnitude, it is best not to \n     err at all. If we must err, however, we should err on the \n     side of avoiding such divisions, and of respecting the will \n     of the people. Senator James W. Grimes of Iowa, one of the \n     seven Republicans who voted to acquit President Andrew \n     Johnson in 1868, said in his Opinion at the conclusion of the \n     trial:\n       ``I cannot agree to destroy the harmonious working of the \n     Constitution for the sake of getting rid of an unacceptable \n     President. Whatever may be my opinion of the incumbent, I \n     cannot consent to trifle with the high office he holds. I can \n     do nothing which, by implication, may be construed into an \n     approval of impeachment as a part of future political \n     machinery.''\n       Spoken almost 131 years ago, these words express nearly \n     perfectly my sentiments on the grave constitutional questions \n     I was required to address in this case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1718-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEASURES REFERRED\n\n  The following bills, previously received from the House of \nRepresentatives for the concurrence of the Senate, were read the first \nand second times by unanimous consent and referred as indicated:\n\n       H.R. 68.

A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, to \nprovide for a land exchange between the Secretary of Agriculture and \nthe Kake Tribal Corporation, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       kake tribal corporation public interest land exchange act\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nsecond of two bills of which passed the Senate last year with unanimous \nconsent. The first bill which was introduced on February 12, 1999, \namends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), to provide for \na land exchange between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Huna Totem \nCorporation, a village corporation created under that Act. The second \nbill provides for a similar land exchange between the Secretary and the \nKake Tribal Corporation. Both of these bills will allow the Kake Tribal \nand Huna Totem Corporations to convey land needed as municipal \nwatersheds in their surrounding communities to the Secretary in \nexchange for other Forest Service lands.\n  Enactment of these bills will meet two objectives. First, the two \ncorporations will finally be able to fully recognize the economic \nbenefits promised to them under ANCSA. Second, the watersheds that \nsupply the communities of Hoonah, Alaska and Kake, Alaska will be \nprotected in order to provide safe water for those communities.\n  The legislation I offer today clarifies several issues that were \nraised during the Committee hearings and mark-up last year. First, the \nlegislation directs that the subsurface estates owned by Sealaska \nCorporation in the Huna and Kake exchange lands are exchanged for \nsimilar subsurface estates in the conveyed Forest Service lands. Second \nthe substitute clarifies that these exchanges are to be done on an \nequal value basis. Both the Secretary of Agriculture and the \ncorporations insisted on this provision. I believe this is critical, \nMr. President, because both these bills provide that any timber derived \nfrom the newly acquired Corporation lands be processed in-state, a \nrequirement that does not currently exist on the watershed lands the \ncorporations are exchanging. Therefore, if this exchange simply were \ndone on an acre-for-acre basis it is likely that the acreage the \ncorporations are exchanging, without any timber export restrictions, \nwould have a much higher value than what they would get in return. It \nis for this reason that these exchanges will not be done on an acre-\nfor-acre basis. If it ends up that either party has to receive \nadditional compensation, either in additional lands or in cash to \nequalize the value, then it is my hope this will be done in an \nexpeditious way to allow the exchange to move forward within the times \nspecified in the legislation.\n  I believe these two pieces of legislation are in the best interest of \nthe native corporations, the Alaska communities where the watersheds \nare located, and the Federal government. It is my intention to try and \npass these bills out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to address an important \nnational health concern. On February 5, 1999, the Department of \nTreasury and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms approved two \nnew health statements for wine labels. This decision, in my opinion, \nwas irresponsible and constitutes poor public policy.\n  Alcohol abuse is a serious problem in our country. For years, drunk \ndriving, underage drinking, drinking during pregnancy, and alcoholism \nhave had devastating effects on the health and safety of our citizens. \nDuring the 1980s, I was proud to be part of a national public health \ncampaign that resulted in congressionally mandated alcohol container \nwarning labels.\n  Since the implementation of these warning labels, the wine industry \nhas been determined to undermine their effectiveness. Through a \nvigorous lobbying and marketing campaign, the wine industry has enticed \nthe public with the assurance that alcohol consumption is healthy. A \nrecent New York Times editorial by Michael Massing provides an \ninsightful summary of the wine industries' irresponsible efforts to \nmanipulate public policy toward this end. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of that editorial be printed in the Congressional Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, unfortunately, the wine industry may \nalready have had ironic success in its campaign. According to a recent \nstudy by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, four times as \nmany pregnant women frequently consumed alcohol in 1995 than did in \n1991. The study attributes reports about the so-called health benefits \nof moderate wine consumption as a cause for this terrible increase.\n  The decision by Treasury and A.T.F. to approve new health claims \nlabels will escalate the problems of alcohol abuse. Last week, several \nbig liquor firms signaled an intent to attach health-benefits labels to \nbottles of liquor. The alcohol industry's veiled attempt to use health \nclaims as a marketing scheme has gone on long enough. And the passive \ncomplicity of Treasury and A.T.F. is unacceptable. Today I am \nintroducing three bills that will address this public health dilemma.\n  The first bill, the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1999, will \ntransfer authority over alcoholic beverage labeling from the Department \nof Treasury to the Department of Health and Human Services. Treasury \nand A.T.F. proved themselves incapable of managing the responsibility \nof alcohol labeling when they decided to favor the aggressive lobbying \ntactics of the wine industry over the public health concerns of such \ngroups as the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the American \nMedical Association, the American Cancer Society, and the American \nHeart Association. The issues of public health and labeling require a \nlevel of experience and expertise that Treasury and A.T.F. apparently \ndo not possess. My legislation will give the labeling authority to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and its subsidiary the Food and \nDrug Administration which have more experience in these matters.\n  The second bill I am introducing, The Alcohol Abuse, Prevention and \nTreatment Trust Fund Act of 1999, will create a trust fund dedicated to \nprograms for the prevention and treatment of alcohol related problems \nand will be paid for by a new tax on wine. Wine is currently taxed at a \nrate slightly lower than beer and significantly lower than distilled \nspirits. Distilled spirits are taxed more heavily than beer because, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service, more affluent \ntaxpayers drink distilled spirits while working class taxpayers drink \nbeer. Like distilled spirits, wine is consumed by more prosperous \ntaxpayers, so it is reasonable that wine should be taxed at a rate \nsimilar to distilled spirits.\n  The revenue generated by this tax will be used specifically for the \nprevention and treatment of alcohol related problems such as heart \ndisease and birth defects. Funds will also be used to address problems \ncaused by moderate alcohol consumption, such as breast cancer and \nhypertension.\n  For many years the tobacco industry deceived the public about the \nconsequences of smoking. It appears as if the wine industry is \nfollowing the lead of the tobacco industry. Rather than wait for the \nlong term repercussions of an alcohol health benefits campaign, we \nshould take action now to thwart its inevitable effects.\n  The third and final bill I am introducing today, the Alcoholic \nBeverage Label Preservation Act of 1999, will block the use of the two \nnew health claims labels approved by Treasury and A.T.F.\n  I urge my colleagues to review these important pieces of legislation \nand support passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of all three \nbills be printed in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of an article by \nthe Marin Institute, which provides helpful background information on \nthis subject, be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 9, 1999]\n\n                     Wine's Unfortunate New Labels\n\n                          (By Michael Massing)\n\n       The Government's announcement on Friday that it would allow \n     the wine industry to use bottle labels that mention the \n     ``health effects of wine consumption'' exemplifies what is \n     wrong with the political process in Washington.\n       In making the label decision, the Treasury Department's \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms drew on a growing \n     body of scientific research showing that moderate alcohol \n     consumption can reduce the risk of heart disease in some \n     people. Yet the new labels were vigorously opposed by an \n     array of medical and public health groups, including the \n     American Cancer Society, the American Medical Association, \n     the American Heart Association and the Center for Science in \n     the Public Interest (as well as Senators Strom Thurmond and \n     Robert Byrd), on the grounds that the labels would simply \n     encourage more people to drink and would drive moderate \n     drinkers to drink more heavily, with potentially steep \n     medical and social costs.\n       That the Federal bureau would override such concerns is \n     testimony to the political clout of the wine industry. Its \n     lobbying arm, the Wine Institute, has an annual budget of \n     more than $6 million, a staff of two dozen at its \n     headquarters in San Francisco, satellite offices in seven \n     other cities and lobbyists in more than 40 states. Its \n     Washington office is headed by Robert Koch, who is a former \n     staff director for Representative Richard Gephardt (as well \n     as being George Bush's son-in-law).\n       The Wine Institute's president, John DeLuca, had made \n     approval of the new labels a priority for several years. \n     Mobilizing the industry's many supporters in Congress (who \n     include virtually the entire California delegation), Mr. \n     DeLuca succeeded first in softening the warnings about \n     alcohol consumption in the Federal Government's Dietary \n     Guidelines.\n       Building on that, he mounted a campaign to persuade the \n     bureau--long a handmaiden to the alcohol industry--to approve \n     new labels referring to the health benefits of wine. The \n     bureau would not go that far, but it did approve language \n     that will undoubtedly help to boost sales. ``To learn the \n     health effects of wine consumption, send for the Federal \n     Government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans,'' one label \n     will read, giving an address at the Agriculture Department.\n       Public health groups protested that such a move would \n     undermine years of patient efforts to raise awareness of \n     alcohol abuse, one of the nation's biggest health problems. \n     But they could not match the wine industry's political and \n     financial resources, and so the vintners' narrow commercial \n     interests won out. In the end, perhaps a limited number of \n     moderate drinkers will benefit, but for the general public \n     the risks--in terms of increased alcoholism, drunk driving \n     and birth defects--seem far greater.\n       In the coming months, when you pick up a bottle of merlot \n     or chardonnay bearing a label urging you ``to consult your \n     family doctor about the health effects of wine consumption,'' \n     take it as a sign of how unhealthy our political process has \n     become.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 431\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A joint responsibility of the \n     Health and Human Services Department and U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture since 1980, the guidelines are updated every five \n     years by an appointed panel of experts. The committee is only \n     advisory to the administration, which has ultimate authority \n     to change the guidelines before publication.\n       The 1995 version made history before the committee even \n     met. It was the first set of guidelines mandated by Congress \n     and the first to include oral testimony from special interest \n     groups and individuals. Unlike the 1990 guidelines advisory \n     committee, the 1995 group--expanded from nine to 11 members--\n     lacked an expert on the public health effects of alcohol.\n       Ironically, the majority of the committee thought their \n     most controversial advice was that Americans hold the line on \n     weight at all costs and exercise 30 minutes a day to help do \n     so. But changes in the alcohol section stole the headlines. \n     Gone were 1990 statements that said ``drinking . . . has no \n     net health benefit. . . .'' and that alcohol consumption ``is \n     not recommended.''\n       Two new sentences were added to the guideline: ``Alcoholic \n     beverages have been used to enhance the enjoyment of meals by \n     many societies throughout human history,'' and ``current \n     evidence suggests that moderate drinking is associated with a \n     lower risk for coronary heart disease in some individuals.''\n       The list of problems associated with heavy drinking was \n     expanded to include violence, accidents, high blood pressure, \n     stroke, heart disease, and certain cancers. Calories in a \n     serving of wine, beer and spirits were noted near the usual \n     guideline definition of moderate drinking as a maximum of one \n     drink a day for women and two a day for men. The concluding \n     statement stressed for the first time that those who drink \n     should do so ``with meals, when consumption does not put you \n     or others at risk.''\n       Some of the headlines across America:\n       ``A Toast to Your Health: US Government Now Says a Drink or \n     Two Can Help You''\n       ``A Little Food, A Little Walk, A Little Wine''\n       ``Drink for Health--But Not As Much As You'd Hoped''\n       ``When It Comes to Eating Right, Don't Forget the Wine''\n       ``Have a Drink, Live a Little Longer''\n       ``Eat, Drink and Be Healthy''\n       ``W'' magazine reported that at last the federal government \n     included alcohol as an ``appropriate `nutritional substance.' \n     ''\n       John De Luca, president of the Wine Institute, gushed: ``We \n     had a campaign of tenacity, working with the contributions of \n     the scientific community.'' He said that thanks to the \n     guideline, alcohol was no longer to be seen as a part of a \n     ``sin industry,'' but as part of a healthy diet, ``back on \n     the table with meals, as it always has been.''\n       De Luca told a reporter that the overall impact of the new \n     wording was so positive that the wine industry might help \n     distribute the new guidelines. When it came to paraphrasing \n     the guidelines' reference to cardiac research and alcohol, De \n     Luca's Wine Institute press releases left out the qualifying \n     ``in some individuals,'' making it sound as if moderate \n     drinking might protect all adults.\n       Members of the committee that drafted the guidelines were \n     dumbfounded. They felt their changes to the alcohol guideline \n     were ``modest.'' With adult Americans deriving five to seven \n     percent of their caloric energy from alcohol, the experts \n     said they intended to ``emphasize the food use of alcoholic \n     beverages rather than the social drug use.'' But they never \n     expected to have that interpreted as recommending alcohol as \n     some kind of health elixir.\n       Several committee members never saw the final version that \n     emerged after government review and federal administrative \n     editing. Some never noticed that their first sentence about \n     alcohol enhancing meals had been moved down and that their \n     two references to alcohol's ``drug effects'' had been \n     deleted. The downside framing of alcohol as a drug that \n     causes about 100,000 deaths a year had been softened to a \n     general reference to alcohol as a potentially harmful \n     substance. Most also failed to notice that their suggested \n     footnote underscoring the fattening nature of alcohol had \n     been removed.\n       Barbara Schneeman is dean of the College of Agriculture and \n     Environmental Sciences at University of California at Davis, \n     which houses one of the world's most prestigious wine study \n     programs. Schneeman is the only committee member who also \n     served on the 1990 Dietary Guidelines committee.\n       ``What disappointed me was publicity that said we made a \n     recommendation to drink,'' says Schneeman. ``The guidelines \n     do not contain a recommendation to drink. If anything, I felt \n     the alcohol guideline was more cautionary than before. I felt \n     we were used by the Wine Institute . . . When I saw the \n     coverage, my reaction was that the wine industry put a spin \n     on it. The guideline does not differentiate between wine, \n     beer or spirits.''.\n       The committee felt that there had to be ``some \n     acknowledgment of data accumulating on low-to-moderate \n     alcohol consumption and the heart,'' Schneeman says. ``There \n     is a break point when you get into three or more glasses a \n     day where you see all the risk. Before that break point, we \n     don't fully understand what's going on--whether it's the \n     alcohol or compounds other than the alcohol'' that might be \n     protective.\n       According to Schneeman, ``once you begin to think about \n     consuming alcohol for any reason other than enjoying a glass \n     of it, that puts it into another ballpark--making a health \n     claim.'' To her, ``that might not be in the best long-term \n     interest of the alcohol industry,'' because claiming health \n     benefits on a label would probably open alcohol to being \n     regulated as a drug.\n       ``I have told the wine people that if I'm a clinician I may \n     look at your data and say it's very interesting, but I'm not \n     going to tell a patient to drink for health based on the \n     observational studies we have thus far.''\n       Schneeman says she is surprised the committee's references \n     to ``drug effects'' were missing from the final version. As \n     an advisory board, she says, the committee's power ended when \n     they turned the proposed guidelines over to the agencies.\n       Dr. Irwin Rosenberg, director of the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts \n     University, drafted the alcohol guideline and worked on it \n     with two other committee members before submitting it to the \n     entire panel. The committee self-selected working groups to \n     draft guideline topics. Everyone agreed that Dr. Rosenberg \n     was the natural writer for the alcohol section because of his \n     special training in liver disease and nutrition.\n       If it had been up to Irwin Rosenberg, alcohol would have \n     been taken out of the Dietary Guidelines. And according to \n     him, the 1990 phrase that alcohol has ``no net health \n     benefit'' is still accurate, although it ``does not convey \n     accurately the state of the science.''\n       ``It occurred to me to take alcohol out of the guidelines \n     altogether,'' he says, ``because it really doesn't belong, \n     one could argue, with other elements of a food-based dietary \n     guideline. Any discussion of alcohol is so enormously \n     influenced by the problem of alcohol abuse . . . that it \n     makes the whole issue of alcohol and public health such a \n     complicated thing. Alcohol carries and enormous amount of \n     baggage because of those other factors.\n       ``But once a guideline is in, the inertia of taking it out \n     is huge. There was tremendous concern over how that would be \n     interpreted--that we don't care or it isn't important. So, in \n     the end, my argument for taking it out wasn't given serious \n     consideration.''\n       Dr. Rosenberg says he wrote the sentence about alcohol \n     having enhanced meals throughout history to bolster the \n     committee's commitment to being more positive about enjoying \n     food than in previous guidelines, where food was referred to \n     in terms of nutrients.\n       ``We didn't think we ought to be talking about what people \n     do when they're drinking in a bar at 3 p.m. That's a public \n     health/social issue. We were trying to bet at the question of \n     alcohol as a meal beverage . . . I don't blame Mr. De Luca as \n     a lobbyist for crowing and trying to take credit for what may \n     have happened here. Maybe he can make his membership happy. I \n     wanted to\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\n     posit alcohol with meals because when you have it with food \n     that physiologically changes its impact [it is absorbed \n     slower]. If this happened to intersect with a campaign of the \n     wine industry to think of wine as a meal beverage, then so be \n     it.''\n       Dr. Rosenberg is concerned that any discussion of studies \n     on cardiovascular risk and alcohol must stress that moderate \n     drinking might be protective for some adults and not others.\n       ``What I meant by `some individuals' is that moderate \n     alcohol consumption does not appear to protect all adults \n     from risk of cardiovascular disease, and we don't know who \n     might be protected and who might not be protected. We \n     certainly didn't mean to suggest that it might protect \n     everyone.''\n       In making changes to the previous alcohol guideline, the \n     committee ignored advice from former Surgeon General C. \n     Everett Koop, the American Public Health Association and \n     scores of health professionals who warned that any brief \n     reference to current research could lead to \n     oversimplification and misinterpretation as encouragement to \n     drink for health. A policy statement that can be interpreted \n     as both promoting and discouraging alcohol use can lead to \n     abuse, they said.\n       Public health professionals offered their documentation, \n     including an 11-year study by Dr. Carlos Camargo of Harvard \n     University that concluded that men who had two to four drinks \n     per week had lower death rates from all causes compared to \n     men who had a drink or more per day.\n       The Wine Institute submitted its lists of studies. Both \n     sides instigated letter-writing campaigns. The 1990 \n     guidelines committee had received four comments on the \n     alcohol section; in 1995, more than half of the 284 comments \n     were directed at the alcohol guidelines.\n       Dr. Richard Havel, vice chairman of the committee and \n     interim director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute at \n     University of California at San Francisco, says none of it \n     impacted him.\n       ``I don't think a lot new has really happened in the area \n     of the health effects of alcohol,'' he says. ``Nothing that \n     has scientific validity to influence the guidelines per se. \n     We do not yet know the extent to which the reduced \n     cardiovascular risk is the result of the change in HDL [the \n     ``good'' cholesterol]. It could be lifestyle. To know for \n     certain alcohol's effect on risk of cardiovascular disease, \n     we would have to give pure ethyl alcohol to an individual for \n     years.''\n       What the committee was doing with its changes was \n     ``recognizing a reality,'' says Marion Nestle, head of New \n     York University's Department of Nutrition, Food & Hotel \n     Management and a member of the committee's alcohol guideline \n     subgroup. ``Alcohol is, in fact, a part of people's lifestyle \n     and it is okay for most when done moderately . . . I don't \n     think the committee was making comments about what should be. \n     The `should be' in alcohol is very complicated.''\n       It is Nestle who points out that the process of coming up \n     with federal dietary advice is ``incredibly political.'' \n     Anyone who thinks otherwise, she says, ``does not really \n     understand the situation.''\n       During the past five years, the Wine Institute of San \n     Francisco has made the release of studies about wine and \n     health the centerpiece of its annual press conference in \n     Washington, DC. First the studies were about red wine \n     bolstering the ``good cholesterol.'' Television's ``60 \n     Minutes'' featured the story and red wine sales soared more \n     than 40 percent. Then they disseminated research pointing to \n     both red and white wine. Now that researchers are crediting \n     ethyl alcohol regardless of its form, the Wine Institute \n     appears to be carrying the political ball on alcohol and \n     health for all segments of the alcoholic beverage business.\n       Two years ago, vintners began to pressure Congress to \n     direct the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism \n     (NIAAA) to study the health effects of moderate drinking. \n     They succeeded in getting a legislative rider to the bill \n     funding the NIAAA, which has thus far accepted 63 \n     applications for about 10 grants to do $2 million worth of \n     research.\n       In the spring of 1994, California vintner Robert Mondavi \n     went to the nation's capital and dined with Donna Shalala, \n     secretary of Health and Human Services, and other appointed \n     and elected officials. In a thank-you letter to Shalala, \n     Mondavi Winery Vice President Herb Schmidt enclosed a study \n     he discussed at the dinner. ``The fact that moderate wine \n     consumption could actually have a positive effect on the \n     problem of rising health care costs is intriguing to me,'' he \n     wrote.\n       Richard Rominger, deputy secretary of the Department of \n     Agriculture, says political connections only assured the wine \n     industry of a fair hearing.\n       ``I don't think I did anything more for the Wine Institute \n     than I did for any of the other commodity groups, whether it \n     be the National Cattlemen's Association or any of the \n     others,'' says Rominger.\n       Rominger says that when the vintners sent him \n     correspondence regarding the alcohol guideline, he passed it \n     to the staff supporting committee work with a note ``to \n     please consider it along with the other information you're \n     getting on the subject.''\n       He may have mentioned it to Dr. Lee when their paths \n     crossed, ``because we're both Californians and run into reach \n     other occasionally.'' In the end, says Rominger, ``I'm sure \n     the Wine Institute felt they could get a fair hearing from \n     Dr. Lee or me. We're both Californians and they know us. \n     That's the way it works in all kinds of government, I think. \n     People like to talk to people they know.''\n       It was Dr. Lee who deleted the committee's references to \n     the ``drug effects'' of alcohol. Former chancellor of \n     University of California at San Francisco and former U.S. \n     assistant secretary of health, Dr. Lee says he struck the \n     phrase suggested by the committee because, ``if you take \n     alcohol with food, you take it out of context if you think of \n     it as a drug.''\n       Dr. Lee says that he didn't think they needed an alcohol \n     expert on a panel with more generalists than technical \n     experts. Committee members were chosen by Lee and Eileen \n     Kennedy, executive director of the Department of \n     Agriculture's Center for Nutrition Policy & Promotion, after \n     staff solicited nominations in the Federal Register and from \n     major organizations such as the American Dietetics \n     Association.\n       The health directors stands by the comment he made at the \n     press conference last January when the guidelines were \n     released: ``In my personal view, wine with meals in \n     moderation is beneficial. There was a significant bias in the \n     past against drinking. To move from anti-alcohol to health \n     benefits is a big change.''\n       Dr. Lee says he comes to that belief because of research \n     and because his physician father was a member of Medical \n     Friends of Wine and the Lee family made wine for their own \n     use. Yet, he stresses that as a clinician he knows the \n     difference between alcohol use and abuse and ``is very aware \n     when you don't recommend alcohol.''\n       John De Luca had no impact on what he changed in the \n     committee's proposed guideline, says Dr. Lee.\n       ``The main person I talked to because he's an old friend is \n     John De Luca. We talked almost exclusively about research \n     needs and particularly Heart, Lung and Blood Institute-funded \n     research or the Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse. \n     NIAAA was funding research that related to alcohol beyond \n     alcoholism and he [De Luca] was interested in having language \n     in the appropriation that gave some guidance--a lot of people \n     do--to National Institutes of Health with respect to \n     research.''\n       Dr. Lee adds that he has ``tremendous respect'' for De \n     Luca, who has done a ``very able'' job promoting the Wine \n     Institute. ``But that doesn't mean he influenced me at all. \n     Nor did he even offer me a bottle of wine or take me out. I \n     went to a reception where there were lots of people from \n     California--Leon Panetta, Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Boxer and \n     others.''\n       Both Health and Human Services Director Shalala and he were \n     surprised that the national story about the Dietary \n     Guidelines came out as the government advising that alcohol \n     is good for you, says Dr. Lee. ``I think you have to give the \n     Wine Institute either credit or whatever you want to call it \n     for doing a thorough job of informing the media and pitching \n     it the way they did'' he says.\n       According to Jim Harrell, former deputy director of the \n     Office of Disease Prevention & Health Promotion, the Wine \n     Institute put ``tremendous pressure'' on the staff supporting \n     guidelines committee work.\n       Interviews with staff reveal that Wine Institute officials \n     intensified pressure after apparently learning that the staff \n     had moved the committee's first sentence about alcohol \n     ``enhancing meals'' lower in the text for fear that beginning \n     on too positive a note might be misleading.\n       Last April, Wine Institute representatives met with an \n     official of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, \n     which regulates labeling and advertising of alcoholic \n     beverages, to talk about what new labeling might be \n     acceptable.\n       Dr. Lee says it is ``unlikely'' that misinterpretation of \n     the guideline will lead to increased alcohol consumption and \n     abuse. ``It's clearly a possibility,'' he says, ``but not a \n     likely consequence because I think abuse is much more \n     complicated than that.''\n       Dr. Charles Lieber isn't so certain. Director of Alcohol \n     Research and Treatment at the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical \n     Center in New York, Dr. Lieber is the alcohol expert credited \n     with structuring the 1990 alcohol guideline.\n       ``My stance is the same as it was 12 years ago,'' says Dr. \n     Lieber. ``You have to be extremely careful about giving \n     advice in general to a population about alcohol. It is \n     different from a doctor giving advice to an individual \n     patient. I believe that it's important to have an alcohol \n     specialist on the committee.\n       ``We didn't need to have the guideline say that people \n     enjoy drinking. Including that sentence about alcohol \n     enhancing meals wasn't very revealing or educational for the \n     public. And if I'd been on the committee, I would have been \n     upset if the administration took out the phrase, `drug \n     effects of alcohol.' ''\n       Dr. Lee and everyone else involved in the guideline process \n     agree that if in five years statistics reveal alcohol abuse \n     to be on the rise, the next Dietary Guidelines committee will \n     have to revisit their drinking advice.\n       Dr. Cutberto Garza, a committee member who is chairman of \n     the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of \n     Medicine, doesn't want the government to wait that long.\n       ``We didn't endorse moderate drinking for health, but \n     that's the story that's out\n\n[[Page S1733]]\n\n     there,'' he says. ``We can flail against the way this came \n     out, but I lay the blame on the government. Prevention is \n     only one percent of the healthcare budget, but the government \n     put out the guidelines and hasn't done a thing to correct the \n     perception people have of the alcohol guideline. I look to \n     the government to be assertive about promoting what it really \n     says.''\n\n\n         if you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation\n\n       Alcoholic beverages supply calories but few or no \n     nutrients. The alcohol in these beverages has effects that \n     are harmful when consumed in excess. These effects of alcohol \n     may alter judgment and can lead to dependency and a great \n     many other serious health problems. Alcoholic beverages have \n     been used to enhance the enjoyment of meals by many societies \n     throughout human history. If adults choose to drink alcoholic \n     beverages, they should consume them only in moderation. (box \n     16)\n       Current evidence suggests that moderate drinking is \n     associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease in \n     some individuals. However, higher levels of alcohol intake \n     raise the risk for high blood pressure, stroke, heart \n     disease, certain cancers, accidents, violence, suicides, \n     birth defects, and overall mortality (deaths). Too much \n     alcohol may cause cirrhosis of the liver, inflammation of the \n     pancreas, and damage to the brain and heart. Heavy drinkers \n     also are at risk of malnutrition because alcohol contains \n     calories that may substitute for those in more nutritious \n     foods.\n\n\n                          what is moderation?\n\n       Moderation is defined as no more than one drink per day for \n     women and no more than two drinks per day for men.\n       Counts as a drink--\n       12 ounces of regular beer (150 calories)\n       5 ounces of wine (100 calories)\n       1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits (100 calories)\n\n\n                         who should not drink?\n\n       Some people should not drink alcoholic beverages at all. \n     These include:\n       Children and adolescents.\n       Individuals of any age who cannot restrict their drinking \n     to moderate levels. This is a special concern for recovering \n     alcoholics and people whose family members have alcohol \n     problems.\n       Women who are trying to conceive or who are pregnant. Major \n     birth defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome, have been \n     attributed to heavy drinking by the mother while pregnant. \n     While there is no conclusive evidence that an occasional \n     drink is harmful to the fetus or to the pregnant woman, a \n     safe level of alcohol intake during pregnancy has not been \n     established.\n       Individuals who plan to drive or take part in activities \n     that require attention or skill. Most people retain some \n     alcohol in the blood up to 2-3 hours after a single drink.\n       Individuals using prescription and over-the-counter \n     medications. Alcohol may alter the effectiveness or toxicity \n     of medicines. Also, some medications may increase blood \n     alcohol levels or increase the adverse effect of alcohol on \n     the brain.\n\n\n                            advice for today\n\n       If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation, with \n     meals, and when consumption does not put you or others at \n     risk.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     A Prize for the Wine Institute\n\n                         (By Lawrence Wallack)\n\n       The Wine Institute has been nominated for a prize it would \n     rather not win. In a recent editorial, the San Francisco \n     Examiner nominated that trade organization for the \n     newspaper's annual Emperor Norton Prize, ``to draw public \n     attention to crack-brained schemes, dingbat proposals and \n     stupendous nuttiness in matters of public policy.''\n       What Wine Institute scheme has warranted such a dubious \n     accolade? In the interest of public education, the Wine \n     Institute wants to place a label on wine bottles alerting \n     consumers to the health benefits of moderate alcohol \n     consumption.\n       While I support the Wine Institute for this award and \n     praise the Examiner for its courage and insight, I still want \n     to know what made the Wine Institute's scheme possible. How \n     did the irrelevant sentence ``alcoholic beverages have been \n     used to enhance the enjoyment of meals by many societies \n     throughout human history'' make it into the final version of \n     the federal dietary guidelines, the cornerstone of national \n     nutrition policy? No parallel friendly sentence accompanies \n     any other guideline in the federal document. And while we're \n     at it, what about the final deletion of the phrase ``drug \n     effects of alcohol,'' which the guidelines advisory committee \n     used twice in its proposed document? Certainly this must be \n     private industry propaganda, not public interest education.\n       Educating the public about the role of alcohol in our \n     society is an important mission and should be undertaken by \n     those without a vested interest. The alcoholic beverage \n     industry already spends several billion dollars every year \n     educating youth and adults alike about the ``benefits'' of \n     their product. Sophistication, wit, sexiness, peer \n     acceptance, fitness, and many other implied benefits are \n     communicated endlessly to the consumer. Alcohol advertising \n     is almost, but not quite, pervasive enough to make people \n     forget that alcohol is a drug, that alcohol is the number one \n     cause of potential years of life lost in this country, that \n     alcohol causes about 100,000 deaths every year.\n       Public health educators are struggling against great odds \n     to level the playing field for the consumer seeking \n     information about this very significant risk factor. They \n     want an information environment where people can get a \n     realistic view of the role of alcohol in society. The Wine \n     Institute wants to tilt the field so it looks like one of San \n     Francisco's hills.\n       From a public health perspective, the proposed Wine \n     Institute label would contribute to the high level of \n     misinformation about alcohol that clogs our environment. None \n     of the studies I have seen that suggest a health benefit from \n     moderate drinking recommends that anyone start drinking or \n     increase their consumption. The Dietary Guidelines for \n     Americans, in fact, states that moderate drinking is \n     associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease ``in \n     some individuals.''\n       Of course, researchers conducting these studies would be \n     the first to say that ``association'' is not ``causation.'' \n     Indeed, the usual recommendation is to seek advice from a \n     physician--a medical approach that provides patients with \n     information particular to their situation. This is especially \n     important when the change is one that can have widely \n     different effects on different individuals. Advice to a \n     population is a public health matter and is not a good means \n     for communicating the limited or special case benefits of a \n     drug, especially when that drug is addictive.\n       So, the Wine Institute of San Francisco may not want the \n     Emperor Norton Prize, but if it is somehow successful in its \n     efforts to get the proposed label approved, it will certainly \n     deserve the award, and the notoriety that comes with it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 435. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to waive the contemporaneous \nsubstantiation requirement for deduction of charitable contributions in \ncertain cases; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  The Equity in Charitable Giving Act\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill help reform America's tax system. The bill I introduce today is \ndesigned to advance the important goal of encouraging charitable \ncontributions. With this proposal, I add my voice to the Republican \nchorus in the Senate and House of Representatives calling for reform of \nour tax system to make it fairer and less burdensome for all Americans.\n  The bill I introduce today is the Equity in Charitable Giving Act. \nThis legislation, which is also cosponsored by the senior Senator from \nWyoming, Senator Thomas, would provide relief for taxpayers who have \nhad legitimate charitable contributions disallowed by the IRS because \nof a technical change Congress made to the Tax Code in 1993. In that \nyear, a change was made to section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code \ndealing with the documentation required by taxpayers to claim \ncharitable contributions. The new change required taxpayers to have a \n``contemporaneous written acknowledgment'' of their contributions for \nall contributions they claimed over $250 in a taxable year.\n  While the purpose of this change was understandable, the rule \nespoused was too broad and it has in turn yielded some harsh results. \nSome taxpayers, unaware of the change in the law, did not receive the \nnecessary acknowledgment before they filed their taxes. This oversight \nis understandable. For example, a taxpayer who filed his taxes in \nFebruary may not have received the necessary documentation from the \naffected charities prior to filing his taxes. Under the current rule, \nany contributions over $250 would be disallowed even if he received the \nproper documentation before his taxes were due on April 15th. As a \nresult of the very narrow definition of ``contemporaneous'' found in \nsection 170(f)(8)(C), a number of taxpayers have had their otherwise \nlawful charitable contributions disallowed by the Internal Revenue \nService. This punitive rule elevates form over substance and places an \nunwarranted burden on those generous taxpayers desiring to make their \ncommunities better places in which to live.\n  The Equity in Charitable Giving Act, which I introduce today, has one \nsimple purpose: to provide tax relief for those taxpayers who fell \nthrough the cracks when the law on charitable contributions was \nchanged. While this bill would still require taxpayers to receive the \nproper documentation from the charitable organization, taxpayers would \nhave a longer time to file this written acknowledgment with the \nInternal Revenue Service. In order to take advantage of this \nflexibility, taxpayers would also have to demonstrate\n\n[[Page S1734]]\n\nto the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that no goods or \nservices were received from the tax exempt organization in return for \ntheir contributions. While this is only a small step in the larger \njourney of reforming America's Tax Code, it furthers the important \nobjective of charitable giving by ensuring that taxpayers receive the \nproper tax treatment for their gifts.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to provide meaningful tax relief and \nreform for the American people. The Republican-led Congress has taken \nimportant and meaningful steps in that direction over the past two \nyears with the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Internal Revenue \nService Reform Act of 1998. We must continue this important endeavor by \ncontinuing to restructure our tax policy to respect marriage and \nfamilies, encourage investment and savings, reward charitable giving, \nand promote job creation and entrepreneurship. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in this endeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for hnimself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 438. A bill to provide for the settlement of the water rights \nclaims of the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be jointly \nintroducing with my fellow Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, a bill \nto settle the claims and define the water rights of the Chippewa Cree \nTribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation. This bill is the product of many \nyears of work and negotiations in our state and will result in the \nfederal government sanctioning the water rights agreement that has been \nadopted by the Montana State Legislature. This settlement represents a \ntextbook example of how State and Tribal governments, together with \noff-Reservation local representatives, can sit down and resolve their \ndifferences. I am also pleased that local ranchers were involved in \nevery step of discussions, and that their water rights are fully \nprotected under this settlement.\n  The state agreement quantifies the Tribe's on-reservation water \nrights and establishes a water administration system carefully designed \nto have minimal adverse impacts on downstream, non-tribal water users. \nIn fact, our goal was to benefit downstream water users wherever \npossible. This is quite an accomplishment in an area of Montana with a \nscarce water supply. The Rocky Boy's Reservation is located in an arid \narea with an average annual rainfall of 12 inches or less. Fortunately, \nthe annual runoff from the Bearpaw Mountains, with a annual snowpack of \nover 30 inches, contributes to a significant spring runoff. Effective \nuse of that runoff through enlarged or new storage facilities on the \nReservation is a critical part of the settlement package which this \nbill represents. Accordingly, $25 million in the budget of the Bureau \nof Reclamation is earmarked for specified on-reservation water \ndevelopment projects. To meet both the future water and economic needs \nof the Reservation, the bill contains an allocation of 10,000 acre-feet \nof storage water to the Tribe in Tiber Reservoir, a federal storage \nfacility. To resolve future disputes, this settlement established a \nboard composed of Tribal and off-Reservation representatives.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes the initial steps of a more detailed \nprocess of securing long-term drinking water supplies for the Chippewa \nCree Tribe, a process that is vital to the survival of the Tribe. \nSpecifically, the bill authorizes the following: (1) $15 million in \nseed money toward the cost of a future project to import more drinking \nwater to the Reservation. (2) $1 million for a feasibility study by the \nSecretary of the Interior to identify water resources available to meet \nthe Tribe's drinkiater needs. (3) $3 million to evaluate water \nresources over a broader area of North Central Montana that contains \ntwo other Indian Reservations with water rights that have not yet been \nestablished.\n  In closing, I believe that the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's \nReservation Indian Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act is a historic \nagreement. It is a tribute to the Governor of Montana, Marc Racicot; \nthe Water Rights Compact Commission; the Chippewa Cree Tribe chairman, \nBert Cocoran; the Tribal negotiating team; Interior Secretary's \nCounselor, David Hayes; the Federal negotiating team; and the water \nusers on the Big Sandy and Beaver Creeks in the Montana Milk River \nvalley. This is truly a local solution that takes into account the \nneeds and sovereign rights of each party. Just as the mentioned parties \nhave worked closely together to get us to the submission of this bill \ntoday, I intend to work closely with all members of Congress to insure \npassage of this important bill.\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague from the State of Montana on the introduction of the Chippewa \nCree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved Water Rights \nSettlement Act. The legislation ratifies the Compact approved by the \nState and the Tribe in 1997. Senator Burns and I jointly introduced \nthis legislation in the 105th Congress and had the 2nd Session of that \nCongress lasted a few more weeks, I believe the bill would have been \napproved by the Senate. The introduction of this bill is the \nculmination of 16 years of extensive technical studies and six years of \nrather intensive negotiations in our state involving the Chippewa Cree \nTribe, the Montana state government, off-Reservation county and \nmunicipal governments in north-central Montana, local ranchers, and the \nUnited States Departments of Justice and Interior.\n  The 122,000-acre Rocky Boy's Reservation sits west of Havre, Montana \non several tributaries of the Milk River on what was formerly the Fort \nAssiniboine Military Reserve. Unfortunately, the portion of the land \nreserved for the Chippewa Cree is rough and arid. Without irrigation, \nmuch of the land is not suitable for farming. Recent studies have \ndemonstrated that the Reservation could not sustain the membership of \nthe Chippewa Cree Tribe as a permanent homeland without an infusion of \nadditional water. The development of a viable reservation economy calls \nfor more water for drinking purposes, as well as for agriculture and \nother municipal uses. In 1982, acting in its fiduciary capacity as \ntrustee for the Tribe, the United States filed a claim for the water \nrights of the Chippewa Cree in the State of Montana general stream \nadjudication. Were it not for the negotiated settlement represented by \nthis legislation, divisive and costly litigation would be pending \nbetween the State, the Tribe, the United States and non-Indian ranchers \nfor many years to come. Fortunately, in 1979, the Montana legislature \narticulated a policy in favor of negotiation and established the \nMontana Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission to negotiate \n``compacts for the equitable division and apportionment of waters \nbetween the state and its people and several Indian tribes claiming \nreserved water rights within the state.''\n  From the initial meeting in 1992, to the conclusion of an agreed on \nwater rights Compact in 1997, the State, the Federal Government and the \nTribe acted in good faith and worked together to explore options. This \nculminated in passage of a resolution by the Chippewa Cree Tribal \nCouncil to ratify the Compact on January 9, 1997. Following \noverwhelming approval by the Montana Legislature and appropriation of \nfunds for implementation, Governor Marc Racicot signed the Compact into \nstate law on April 14, 1997. Subsequent negotiation, in which staff \nfrom my office assisted the State and Tribe, resulted in approval by \nthe United States Departments of the Interior and Justice and drafting \nof this bill by the three parties.\n  The litigation filed in state water court in 1982 is stayed pending \nthe outcome of this bill. Once passed, the United States, the Tribe and \nthe State of Montana will petition the Montana Water Court to enter a \ndecree reflecting the water rights of the Tribe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this very positive legislation and \nwork with Senator Burns and Montana's Congressman Hill, who has \nsimultaneously introduced this bill in the House, to secure passage of \nthe Settlement Act this year.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to expeditious passage of this historic \nsettlement.\n\n[[Page S1735]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1727-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1727-S1735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 430. A bill to amend the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, to \nprovide for a land exchange between the Secretary of Agriculture and \nthe Kake Tribal Corporation, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       kake tribal corporation public interest land exchange act\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nsecond of two bills of which passed the Senate last year with unanimous \nconsent. The first bill which was introduced on February 12, 1999, \namends the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), to provide for \na land exchange between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Huna Totem \nCorporation, a village corporation created under that Act. The second \nbill provides for a similar land exchange between the Secretary and the \nKake Tribal Corporation. Both of these bills will allow the Kake Tribal \nand Huna Totem Corporations to convey land needed as municipal \nwatersheds in their surrounding communities to the Secretary in \nexchange for other Forest Service lands.\n  Enactment of these bills will meet two objectives. First, the two \ncorporations will finally be able to fully recognize the economic \nbenefits promised to them under ANCSA. Second, the watersheds that \nsupply the communities of Hoonah, Alaska and Kake, Alaska will be \nprotected in order to provide safe water for those communities.\n  The legislation I offer today clarifies several issues that were \nraised during the Committee hearings and mark-up last year. First, the \nlegislation directs that the subsurface estates owned by Sealaska \nCorporation in the Huna and Kake exchange lands are exchanged for \nsimilar subsurface estates in the conveyed Forest Service lands. Second \nthe substitute clarifies that these exchanges are to be done on an \nequal value basis. Both the Secretary of Agriculture and the \ncorporations insisted on this provision. I believe this is critical, \nMr. President, because both these bills provide that any timber derived \nfrom the newly acquired Corporation lands be processed in-state, a \nrequirement that does not currently exist on the watershed lands the \ncorporations are exchanging. Therefore, if this exchange simply were \ndone on an acre-for-acre basis it is likely that the acreage the \ncorporations are exchanging, without any timber export restrictions, \nwould have a much higher value than what they would get in return. It \nis for this reason that these exchanges will not be done on an acre-\nfor-acre basis. If it ends up that either party has to receive \nadditional compensation, either in additional lands or in cash to \nequalize the value, then it is my hope this will be done in an \nexpeditious way to allow the exchange to move forward within the times \nspecified in the legislation.\n  I believe these two pieces of legislation are in the best interest of \nthe native corporations, the Alaska communities where the watersheds \nare located, and the Federal government. It is my intention to try and \npass these bills out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                 S. 430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1988 \nto prohibit additional statements and representations relating to \nalcoholic beverages and health, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n         the alcoholic beverage label preservation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address an important \nnational health concern. On February 5, 1999, the Department of \nTreasury and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms approved two \nnew health statements for wine labels. This decision, in my opinion, \nwas irresponsible and constitutes poor public policy.\n  Alcohol abuse is a serious problem in our country. For years, drunk \ndriving, underage drinking, drinking during pregnancy, and alcoholism \nhave had devastating effects on the health and safety of our citizens. \nDuring the 1980s, I was proud to be part of a national public health \ncampaign that resulted in congressionally mandated alcohol container \nwarning labels.\n  Since the implementation of these warning labels, the wine industry \nhas been determined to undermine their effectiveness. Through a \nvigorous lobbying and marketing campaign, the wine industry has enticed \nthe public with the assurance that alcohol consumption is healthy. A \nrecent New York Times editorial by Michael Massing provides an \ninsightful summary of the wine industries' irresponsible efforts to \nmanipulate public policy toward this end. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe text of that editorial be printed in the Congressional Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, unfortunately, the wine industry may \nalready have had ironic success in its campaign. According to a recent \nstudy by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, four times as \nmany pregnant women frequently consumed alcohol in 1995 than did in \n1991. The study attributes reports about the so-called health benefits \nof moderate wine consumption as a cause for this terrible increase.\n  The decision by Treasury and A.T.F. to approve new health claims \nlabels will escalate the problems of alcohol abuse. Last week, several \nbig liquor firms signaled an intent to attach health-benefits labels to \nbottles of liquor. The alcohol industry's veiled attempt to use health \nclaims as a marketing scheme has gone on long enough. And the passive \ncomplicity of Treasury and A.T.F. is unacceptable. Today I am \nintroducing three bills that will address this public health dilemma.\n  The first bill, the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1999, will \ntransfer authority over alcoholic beverage labeling from the Department \nof Treasury to the Department of Health and Human Services. Treasury \nand A.T.F. proved themselves incapable of managing the responsibility \nof alcohol labeling when they decided to favor the aggressive lobbying \ntactics of the wine industry over the public health concerns of such \ngroups as the Center for Science in the Public Interest, the American \nMedical Association, the American Cancer Society, and the American \nHeart Association. The issues of public health and labeling require a \nlevel of experience and expertise that Treasury and A.T.F. apparently \ndo not possess. My legislation will give the labeling authority to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and its subsidiary the Food and \nDrug Administration which have more experience in these matters.\n  The second bill I am introducing, The Alcohol Abuse, Prevention and \nTreatment Trust Fund Act of 1999, will create a trust fund dedicated to \nprograms for the prevention and treatment of alcohol related problems \nand will be paid for by a new tax on wine. Wine is currently taxed at a \nrate slightly lower than beer and significantly lower than distilled \nspirits. Distilled spirits are taxed more heavily than beer because, \naccording to the Congressional Research Service, more affluent \ntaxpayers drink distilled spirits while working class taxpayers drink \nbeer. Like distilled spirits, wine is consumed by more prosperous \ntaxpayers, so it is reasonable that wine should be taxed at a rate \nsimilar to distilled spirits.\n  The revenue generated by this tax will be used specifically for the \nprevention and treatment of alcohol related problems such as heart \ndisease and birth defects. Funds will also be used to address problems \ncaused by moderate alcohol consumption, such as breast cancer and \nhypertension.\n  For many years the tobacco industry deceived the public about the \nconsequences of smoking. It appears as if the wine industry is \nfollowing the lead of the tobacco industry. Rather than wait for the \nlong term repercussions of an alcohol health benefits campaign, we \nshould take action now to thwart its inevitable effects.\n  The third and final bill I am introducing today, the Alcoholic \nBeverage Label Preservation Act of 1999, will block the use of the two \nnew health claims labels approved by Treasury and A.T.F.\n  I urge my colleagues to review these important pieces of legislation \nand support passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of all three \nbills be printed in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks. I also ask unanimous consent that the text of an article by \nthe Marin Institute, which provides helpful background information on \nthis subject, be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S1729]]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 9, 1999]\n\n                     Wine's Unfortunate New Labels\n\n                          (By Michael Massing)\n\n       The Government's announcement on Friday that it would allow \n     the wine industry to use bottle labels that mention the \n     ``health effects of wine consumption'' exemplifies what is \n     wrong with the political process in Washington.\n       In making the label decision, the Treasury Department's \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms drew on a growing \n     body of scientific research showing that moderate alcohol \n     consumption can reduce the risk of heart disease in some \n     people. Yet the new labels were vigorously opposed by an \n     array of medical and public health groups, including the \n     American Cancer Society, the American Medical Association, \n     the American Heart Association and the Center for Science in \n     the Public Interest (as well as Senators Strom Thurmond and \n     Robert Byrd), on the grounds that the labels would simply \n     encourage more people to drink and would drive moderate \n     drinkers to drink more heavily, with potentially steep \n     medical and social costs.\n       That the Federal bureau would override such concerns is \n     testimony to the political clout of the wine industry. Its \n     lobbying arm, the Wine Institute, has an annual budget of \n     more than $6 million, a staff of two dozen at its \n     headquarters in San Francisco, satellite offices in seven \n     other cities and lobbyists in more than 40 states. Its \n     Washington office is headed by Robert Koch, who is a former \n     staff director for Representative Richard Gephardt (as well \n     as being George Bush's son-in-law).\n       The Wine Institute's president, John DeLuca, had made \n     approval of the new labels a priority for several years. \n     Mobilizing the industry's many supporters in Congress (who \n     include virtually the entire California delegation), Mr. \n     DeLuca succeeded first in softening the warnings about \n     alcohol consumption in the Federal Government's Dietary \n     Guidelines.\n       Building on that, he mounted a campaign to persuade the \n     bureau--long a handmaiden to the alcohol industry--to approve \n     new labels referring to the health benefits of wine. The \n     bureau would not go that far, but it did approve language \n     that will undoubtedly help to boost sales. ``To learn the \n     health effects of wine consumption, send for the Federal \n     Government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans,'' one label \n     will read, giving an address at the Agriculture Department.\n       Public health groups protested that such a move would \n     undermine years of patient efforts to raise awareness of \n     alcohol abuse, one of the nation's biggest health problems. \n     But they could not match the wine industry's political and \n     financial resources, and so the vintners' narrow commercial \n     interests won out. In the end, perhaps a limited number of \n     moderate drinkers will benefit, but for the general public \n     the risks--in terms of increased alcoholism, drunk driving \n     and birth defects--seem far greater.\n       In the coming months, when you pick up a bottle of merlot \n     or chardonnay bearing a label urging you ``to consult your \n     family doctor about the health effects of wine consumption,'' \n     take it as a sign of how unhealthy our political process has \n     become.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 431\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

For purposes of the \n     preceding sentence, the term ``controlled group of \n     corporations'' has the meaning given to such term by \n     subsection (a) of section 1563 of such Code; except that for \n     such purposes the phrase ``more than 50 percent'' shall be \n     substituted for the phrase ``at least 80 percent'' each place \n     it appears in such subsection.\n       (B) Nonincorporated dealers under common control.--Under \n     regulations prescribed by the Secretary, principles similar \n     to the principles of subparagraph (A) shall apply to a group \n     of dealers under common control where 1 or more of such \n     dealers is not a corporation.\n       (5) Other laws applicable.--All provisions of law, \n     including penalties, applicable to the tax imposed by section \n     5041 of such Code with respect to any tax-increased article \n     shall, insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with the \n     provisions of this section, apply to the floor stocks taxes \n     imposed by paragraph (1) to the same extent as if such taxes \n     were imposed by such section 5041.\n       (6) Definitions.--For purposes of this subsection--\n       (A) In general.--Terms used in this paragraph which are \n     also used in subchapter A of chapter 51 of such Code shall \n     have the respective meanings such terms have in such \n     subchapter.\n       (B) Person.--The term ``person'' includes any State or \n     political subdivision thereof, or any agency or \n     instrumentality of a State or political subdivision thereof.\n       (C) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Treasury or his delegate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                 S. 433\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PROHIBITION ON ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS AND \n                   REPRESENTATIONS.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Section 202 of the Alcoholic Beverage \n     Labeling Act of 1988 (27 U.S.C. 213) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by striking ``The'' and \n     inserting ``(a)(1) The'';\n       (2) in the last sentence, by striking ``It is therefore'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(b) It is''; and\n       (3) in subsection (a) (as designated in paragraph (1)), by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Congress finds that--\n       ``(A) the consumers would be confused by an additional \n     statement or representation, beyond the statement required by \n     this Act, on alcoholic beverage containers relating to the \n     health effects or consequences of alcoholic beverage \n     consumption;\n       ``(B) any such additional statement or representation would \n     conflict with, dilute, impede, and undermine the clear \n     reminder of the health effects or consequences in the \n     statement required by this Act;\n       ``(C) the effects of and consequences arising from drunk \n     driving, underage drinking, drinking during pregnancy, and \n     alcoholism have had a devastating effect on the health and \n     safety of United States citizens; and\n       ``(D) prevention of the effects and consequences is \n     furthered by--\n       ``(i) having an exclusive and clear statement on alcoholic \n     beverage containers relating to the health effects and \n     consequences of alcoholic beverage consumption; and\n\n[[Page S1731]]\n\n       ``(ii) prohibiting any other statement or representation \n     pertaining to the health effects or consequences of alcoholic \n     beverage consumption.''.\n       (b) Prohibition.--Section 205 of the Alcoholic Beverage \n     Labeling Act of 1988 (27 U.S.C. 216) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``No'' and inserting ``(a) No''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) No container of an alcoholic beverage, or any box, \n     carton, or other package, irrespective of the material from \n     which made, that contains such a container, shall bear any \n     statement or representation relating to alcoholic beverages \n     and health, other than the statement required by section \n     204.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Marin Institute, Summer 1996]\n\n               Uncle Sam Never Said Drink for Your Health\n\n       Most of the experts who authored the new Dietary Guidelines \n     for Americans are astounded at widespread interpretation of \n     their document as a prescription to drink alcohol.\n       Several members of the guidelines advisory committee \n     question why U.S. Public Health Service Director Philip Lee \n     deleted their references to the ``drug effects'' of alcohol. \n     They hold the Wine Institute responsible for the press spin \n     interpreting the government advice as a recommendation for \n     moderate drinking.\n       One committee member, who oversees one of the world's most \n     prominent academic wine study programs, feels manipulated by \n     the Wine Institute, which represents an $8 billion retail \n     business and recently proposed a bottle label bigger than the \n     warning label inviting consumers to ``learn the health \n     benefits of moderate wine consumption'' by sending for the \n     guidelines.\n       ``If you read the whole alcohol guideline, you can see that \n     it does not say drink for your health,'' says Dr. Lee, who \n     partially credits his background in a family that made its \n     own wine for his personal belief that it is beneficial. ``The \n     guideline says if you drink, do so in moderation, with food. \n     It doesn't say to drink.''\n       Interviews with nine of the 11 scientists, nutritionists \n     and physicians who spent a year crafting the guidelines, and \n     federal staffers and administrators who reworked them, reveal \n     what every food editor knows: Food and what accompanies it in \n     a glass, can or bottle is political.\n       The guidelines are the cornerstone of federal nutrition \n     policy. the federal government uses them to plan food and \n     nutrition education programs; private industry uses them to \n     dispense nutrition information. A joint responsibility of the \n     Health and Human Services Department and U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture since 1980, the guidelines are updated every five \n     years by an appointed panel of experts. The committee is only \n     advisory to the administration, which has ultimate authority \n     to change the guidelines before publication.\n       The 1995 version made history before the committee even \n     met. It was the first set of guidelines mandated by Congress \n     and the first to include oral testimony from special interest \n     groups and individuals. Unlike the 1990 guidelines advisory \n     committee, the 1995 group--expanded from nine to 11 members--\n     lacked an expert on the public health effects of alcohol.\n       Ironically, the majority of the committee thought their \n     most controversial advice was that Americans hold the line on \n     weight at all costs and exercise 30 minutes a day to help do \n     so. But changes in the alcohol section stole the headlines. \n     Gone were 1990 statements that said ``drinking . . . has no \n     net health benefit. . . .'' and that alcohol consumption ``is \n     not recommended.''\n       Two new sentences were added to the guideline: ``Alcoholic \n     beverages have been used to enhance the enjoyment of meals by \n     many societies throughout human history,'' and ``current \n     evidence suggests that moderate drinking is associated with a \n     lower risk for coronary heart disease in some individuals.''\n       The list of problems associated with heavy drinking was \n     expanded to include violence, accidents, high blood pressure, \n     stroke, heart disease, and certain cancers. Calories in a \n     serving of wine, beer and spirits were noted near the usual \n     guideline definition of moderate drinking as a maximum of one \n     drink a day for women and two a day for men. The concluding \n     statement stressed for the first time that those who drink \n     should do so ``with meals, when consumption does not put you \n     or others at risk.''\n       Some of the headlines across America:\n       ``A Toast to Your Health: US Government Now Says a Drink or \n     Two Can Help You''\n       ``A Little Food, A Little Walk, A Little Wine''\n       ``Drink for Health--But Not As Much As You'd Hoped''\n       ``When It Comes to Eating Right, Don't Forget the Wine''\n       ``Have a Drink, Live a Little Longer''\n       ``Eat, Drink and Be Healthy''\n       ``W'' magazine reported that at last the federal government \n     included alcohol as an ``appropriate `nutritional substance.' \n     ''\n       John De Luca, president of the Wine Institute, gushed: ``We \n     had a campaign of tenacity, working with the contributions of \n     the scientific community.'' He said that thanks to the \n     guideline, alcohol was no longer to be seen as a part of a \n     ``sin industry,'' but as part of a healthy diet, ``back on \n     the table with meals, as it always has been.''\n       De Luca told a reporter that the overall impact of the new \n     wording was so positive that the wine industry might help \n     distribute the new guidelines. When it came to paraphrasing \n     the guidelines' reference to cardiac research and alcohol, De \n     Luca's Wine Institute press releases left out the qualifying \n     ``in some individuals,'' making it sound as if moderate \n     drinking might protect all adults.\n       Members of the committee that drafted the guidelines were \n     dumbfounded. They felt their changes to the alcohol guideline \n     were ``modest.'' With adult Americans deriving five to seven \n     percent of their caloric energy from alcohol, the experts \n     said they intended to ``emphasize the food use of alcoholic \n     beverages rather than the social drug use.'' But they never \n     expected to have that interpreted as recommending alcohol as \n     some kind of health elixir.\n       Several committee members never saw the final version that \n     emerged after government review and federal administrative \n     editing. Some never noticed that their first sentence about \n     alcohol enhancing meals had been moved down and that their \n     two references to alcohol's ``drug effects'' had been \n     deleted. The downside framing of alcohol as a drug that \n     causes about 100,000 deaths a year had been softened to a \n     general reference to alcohol as a potentially harmful \n     substance. Most also failed to notice that their suggested \n     footnote underscoring the fattening nature of alcohol had \n     been removed.\n       Barbara Schneeman is dean of the College of Agriculture and \n     Environmental Sciences at University of California at Davis, \n     which houses one of the world's most prestigious wine study \n     programs. Schneeman is the only committee member who also \n     served on the 1990 Dietary Guidelines committee.\n       ``What disappointed me was publicity that said we made a \n     recommendation to drink,'' says Schneeman. ``The guidelines \n     do not contain a recommendation to drink. If anything, I felt \n     the alcohol guideline was more cautionary than before. I felt \n     we were used by the Wine Institute . . . When I saw the \n     coverage, my reaction was that the wine industry put a spin \n     on it. The guideline does not differentiate between wine, \n     beer or spirits.''.\n       The committee felt that there had to be ``some \n     acknowledgment of data accumulating on low-to-moderate \n     alcohol consumption and the heart,'' Schneeman says. ``There \n     is a break point when you get into three or more glasses a \n     day where you see all the risk. Before that break point, we \n     don't fully understand what's going on--whether it's the \n     alcohol or compounds other than the alcohol'' that might be \n     protective.\n       According to Schneeman, ``once you begin to think about \n     consuming alcohol for any reason other than enjoying a glass \n     of it, that puts it into another ballpark--making a health \n     claim.'' To her, ``that might not be in the best long-term \n     interest of the alcohol industry,'' because claiming health \n     benefits on a label would probably open alcohol to being \n     regulated as a drug.\n       ``I have told the wine people that if I'm a clinician I may \n     look at your data and say it's very interesting, but I'm not \n     going to tell a patient to drink for health based on the \n     observational studies we have thus far.''\n       Schneeman says she is surprised the committee's references \n     to ``drug effects'' were missing from the final version. As \n     an advisory board, she says, the committee's power ended when \n     they turned the proposed guidelines over to the agencies.\n       Dr. Irwin Rosenberg, director of the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts \n     University, drafted the alcohol guideline and worked on it \n     with two other committee members before submitting it to the \n     entire panel. The committee self-selected working groups to \n     draft guideline topics. Everyone agreed that Dr. Rosenberg \n     was the natural writer for the alcohol section because of his \n     special training in liver disease and nutrition.\n       If it had been up to Irwin Rosenberg, alcohol would have \n     been taken out of the Dietary Guidelines. And according to \n     him, the 1990 phrase that alcohol has ``no net health \n     benefit'' is still accurate, although it ``does not convey \n     accurately the state of the science.''\n       ``It occurred to me to take alcohol out of the guidelines \n     altogether,'' he says, ``because it really doesn't belong, \n     one could argue, with other elements of a food-based dietary \n     guideline. Any discussion of alcohol is so enormously \n     influenced by the problem of alcohol abuse . . . that it \n     makes the whole issue of alcohol and public health such a \n     complicated thing. Alcohol carries and enormous amount of \n     baggage because of those other factors.\n       ``But once a guideline is in, the inertia of taking it out \n     is huge. There was tremendous concern over how that would be \n     interpreted--that we don't care or it isn't important. So, in \n     the end, my argument for taking it out wasn't given serious \n     consideration.''\n       Dr. Rosenberg says he wrote the sentence about alcohol \n     having enhanced meals throughout history to bolster the \n     committee's commitment to being more positive about enjoying \n     food than in previous guidelines, where food was referred to \n     in terms of nutrients.\n       ``We didn't think we ought to be talking about what people \n     do when they're drinking in a bar at 3 p.m. That's a public \n     health/social issue. We were trying to bet at the question of \n     alcohol as a meal beverage . . . I don't blame Mr. De Luca as \n     a lobbyist for crowing and trying to take credit for what may \n     have happened here. Maybe he can make his membership happy. I \n     wanted to\n\n[[Page S1732]]\n\n     posit alcohol with meals because when you have it with food \n     that physiologically changes its impact [it is absorbed \n     slower]. If this happened to intersect with a campaign of the \n     wine industry to think of wine as a meal beverage, then so be \n     it.''\n       Dr. Rosenberg is concerned that any discussion of studies \n     on cardiovascular risk and alcohol must stress that moderate \n     drinking might be protective for some adults and not others.\n       ``What I meant by `some individuals' is that moderate \n     alcohol consumption does not appear to protect all adults \n     from risk of cardiovascular disease, and we don't know who \n     might be protected and who might not be protected. We \n     certainly didn't mean to suggest that it might protect \n     everyone.''\n       In making changes to the previous alcohol guideline, the \n     committee ignored advice from former Surgeon General C. \n     Everett Koop, the American Public Health Association and \n     scores of health professionals who warned that any brief \n     reference to current research could lead to \n     oversimplification and misinterpretation as encouragement to \n     drink for health. A policy statement that can be interpreted \n     as both promoting and discouraging alcohol use can lead to \n     abuse, they said.\n       Public health professionals offered their documentation, \n     including an 11-year study by Dr. Carlos Camargo of Harvard \n     University that concluded that men who had two to four drinks \n     per week had lower death rates from all causes compared to \n     men who had a drink or more per day.\n       The Wine Institute submitted its lists of studies. Both \n     sides instigated letter-writing campaigns. The 1990 \n     guidelines committee had received four comments on the \n     alcohol section; in 1995, more than half of the 284 comments \n     were directed at the alcohol guidelines.\n       Dr. Richard Havel, vice chairman of the committee and \n     interim director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute at \n     University of California at San Francisco, says none of it \n     impacted him.\n       ``I don't think a lot new has really happened in the area \n     of the health effects of alcohol,'' he says. ``Nothing that \n     has scientific validity to influence the guidelines per se. \n     We do not yet know the extent to which the reduced \n     cardiovascular risk is the result of the change in HDL [the \n     ``good'' cholesterol]. It could be lifestyle. To know for \n     certain alcohol's effect on risk of cardiovascular disease, \n     we would have to give pure ethyl alcohol to an individual for \n     years.''\n       What the committee was doing with its changes was \n     ``recognizing a reality,'' says Marion Nestle, head of New \n     York University's Department of Nutrition, Food & Hotel \n     Management and a member of the committee's alcohol guideline \n     subgroup. ``Alcohol is, in fact, a part of people's lifestyle \n     and it is okay for most when done moderately . . . I don't \n     think the committee was making comments about what should be. \n     The `should be' in alcohol is very complicated.''\n       It is Nestle who points out that the process of coming up \n     with federal dietary advice is ``incredibly political.'' \n     Anyone who thinks otherwise, she says, ``does not really \n     understand the situation.''\n       During the past five years, the Wine Institute of San \n     Francisco has made the release of studies about wine and \n     health the centerpiece of its annual press conference in \n     Washington, DC. First the studies were about red wine \n     bolstering the ``good cholesterol.'' Television's ``60 \n     Minutes'' featured the story and red wine sales soared more \n     than 40 percent. Then they disseminated research pointing to \n     both red and white wine. Now that researchers are crediting \n     ethyl alcohol regardless of its form, the Wine Institute \n     appears to be carrying the political ball on alcohol and \n     health for all segments of the alcoholic beverage business.\n       Two years ago, vintners began to pressure Congress to \n     direct the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism \n     (NIAAA) to study the health effects of moderate drinking. \n     They succeeded in getting a legislative rider to the bill \n     funding the NIAAA, which has thus far accepted 63 \n     applications for about 10 grants to do $2 million worth of \n     research.\n       In the spring of 1994, California vintner Robert Mondavi \n     went to the nation's capital and dined with Donna Shalala, \n     secretary of Health and Human Services, and other appointed \n     and elected officials. In a thank-you letter to Shalala, \n     Mondavi Winery Vice President Herb Schmidt enclosed a study \n     he discussed at the dinner. ``The fact that moderate wine \n     consumption could actually have a positive effect on the \n     problem of rising health care costs is intriguing to me,'' he \n     wrote.\n       Richard Rominger, deputy secretary of the Department of \n     Agriculture, says political connections only assured the wine \n     industry of a fair hearing.\n       ``I don't think I did anything more for the Wine Institute \n     than I did for any of the other commodity groups, whether it \n     be the National Cattlemen's Association or any of the \n     others,'' says Rominger.\n       Rominger says that when the vintners sent him \n     correspondence regarding the alcohol guideline, he passed it \n     to the staff supporting committee work with a note ``to \n     please consider it along with the other information you're \n     getting on the subject.''\n       He may have mentioned it to Dr. Lee when their paths \n     crossed, ``because we're both Californians and run into reach \n     other occasionally.'' In the end, says Rominger, ``I'm sure \n     the Wine Institute felt they could get a fair hearing from \n     Dr. Lee or me. We're both Californians and they know us. \n     That's the way it works in all kinds of government, I think. \n     People like to talk to people they know.''\n       It was Dr. Lee who deleted the committee's references to \n     the ``drug effects'' of alcohol. Former chancellor of \n     University of California at San Francisco and former U.S. \n     assistant secretary of health, Dr. Lee says he struck the \n     phrase suggested by the committee because, ``if you take \n     alcohol with food, you take it out of context if you think of \n     it as a drug.''\n       Dr. Lee says that he didn't think they needed an alcohol \n     expert on a panel with more generalists than technical \n     experts. Committee members were chosen by Lee and Eileen \n     Kennedy, executive director of the Department of \n     Agriculture's Center for Nutrition Policy & Promotion, after \n     staff solicited nominations in the Federal Register and from \n     major organizations such as the American Dietetics \n     Association.\n       The health directors stands by the comment he made at the \n     press conference last January when the guidelines were \n     released: ``In my personal view, wine with meals in \n     moderation is beneficial. There was a significant bias in the \n     past against drinking. To move from anti-alcohol to health \n     benefits is a big change.''\n       Dr. Lee says he comes to that belief because of research \n     and because his physician father was a member of Medical \n     Friends of Wine and the Lee family made wine for their own \n     use. Yet, he stresses that as a clinician he knows the \n     difference between alcohol use and abuse and ``is very aware \n     when you don't recommend alcohol.''\n       John De Luca had no impact on what he changed in the \n     committee's proposed guideline, says Dr. Lee.\n       ``The main person I talked to because he's an old friend is \n     John De Luca. We talked almost exclusively about research \n     needs and particularly Heart, Lung and Blood Institute-funded \n     research or the Institute for Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse. \n     NIAAA was funding research that related to alcohol beyond \n     alcoholism and he [De Luca] was interested in having language \n     in the appropriation that gave some guidance--a lot of people \n     do--to National Institutes of Health with respect to \n     research.''\n       Dr. Lee adds that he has ``tremendous respect'' for De \n     Luca, who has done a ``very able'' job promoting the Wine \n     Institute. ``But that doesn't mean he influenced me at all. \n     Nor did he even offer me a bottle of wine or take me out. I \n     went to a reception where there were lots of people from \n     California--Leon Panetta, Nancy Pelosi, Barbara Boxer and \n     others.''\n       Both Health and Human Services Director Shalala and he were \n     surprised that the national story about the Dietary \n     Guidelines came out as the government advising that alcohol \n     is good for you, says Dr. Lee. ``I think you have to give the \n     Wine Institute either credit or whatever you want to call it \n     for doing a thorough job of informing the media and pitching \n     it the way they did'' he says.\n       According to Jim Harrell, former deputy director of the \n     Office of Disease Prevention & Health Promotion, the Wine \n     Institute put ``tremendous pressure'' on the staff supporting \n     guidelines committee work.\n       Interviews with staff reveal that Wine Institute officials \n     intensified pressure after apparently learning that the staff \n     had moved the committee's first sentence about alcohol \n     ``enhancing meals'' lower in the text for fear that beginning \n     on too positive a note might be misleading.\n       Last April, Wine Institute representatives met with an \n     official of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, \n     which regulates labeling and advertising of alcoholic \n     beverages, to talk about what new labeling might be \n     acceptable.\n       Dr. Lee says it is ``unlikely'' that misinterpretation of \n     the guideline will lead to increased alcohol consumption and \n     abuse. ``It's clearly a possibility,'' he says, ``but not a \n     likely consequence because I think abuse is much more \n     complicated than that.''\n       Dr. Charles Lieber isn't so certain. Director of Alcohol \n     Research and Treatment at the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical \n     Center in New York, Dr. Lieber is the alcohol expert credited \n     with structuring the 1990 alcohol guideline.\n       ``My stance is the same as it was 12 years ago,'' says Dr. \n     Lieber. ``You have to be extremely careful about giving \n     advice in general to a population about alcohol. It is \n     different from a doctor giving advice to an individual \n     patient. I believe that it's important to have an alcohol \n     specialist on the committee.\n       ``We didn't need to have the guideline say that people \n     enjoy drinking. Including that sentence about alcohol \n     enhancing meals wasn't very revealing or educational for the \n     public. And if I'd been on the committee, I would have been \n     upset if the administration took out the phrase, `drug \n     effects of alcohol.' ''\n       Dr. Lee and everyone else involved in the guideline process \n     agree that if in five years statistics reveal alcohol abuse \n     to be on the rise, the next Dietary Guidelines committee will \n     have to revisit their drinking advice.\n       Dr. Cutberto Garza, a committee member who is chairman of \n     the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of \n     Medicine, doesn't want the government to wait that long.\n       ``We didn't endorse moderate drinking for health, but \n     that's the story that's out\n\n[[Page S1733]]\n\n     there,'' he says. ``We can flail against the way this came \n     out, but I lay the blame on the government. Prevention is \n     only one percent of the healthcare budget, but the government \n     put out the guidelines and hasn't done a thing to correct the \n     perception people have of the alcohol guideline. I look to \n     the government to be assertive about promoting what it really \n     says.''\n\n\n         if you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation\n\n       Alcoholic beverages supply calories but few or no \n     nutrients. The alcohol in these beverages has effects that \n     are harmful when consumed in excess. These effects of alcohol \n     may alter judgment and can lead to dependency and a great \n     many other serious health problems. Alcoholic beverages have \n     been used to enhance the enjoyment of meals by many societies \n     throughout human history. If adults choose to drink alcoholic \n     beverages, they should consume them only in moderation. (box \n     16)\n       Current evidence suggests that moderate drinking is \n     associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease in \n     some individuals. However, higher levels of alcohol intake \n     raise the risk for high blood pressure, stroke, heart \n     disease, certain cancers, accidents, violence, suicides, \n     birth defects, and overall mortality (deaths). Too much \n     alcohol may cause cirrhosis of the liver, inflammation of the \n     pancreas, and damage to the brain and heart. Heavy drinkers \n     also are at risk of malnutrition because alcohol contains \n     calories that may substitute for those in more nutritious \n     foods.\n\n\n                          what is moderation?\n\n       Moderation is defined as no more than one drink per day for \n     women and no more than two drinks per day for men.\n       Counts as a drink--\n       12 ounces of regular beer (150 calories)\n       5 ounces of wine (100 calories)\n       1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits (100 calories)\n\n\n                         who should not drink?\n\n       Some people should not drink alcoholic beverages at all. \n     These include:\n       Children and adolescents.\n       Individuals of any age who cannot restrict their drinking \n     to moderate levels. This is a special concern for recovering \n     alcoholics and people whose family members have alcohol \n     problems.\n       Women who are trying to conceive or who are pregnant. Major \n     birth defects, including fetal alcohol syndrome, have been \n     attributed to heavy drinking by the mother while pregnant. \n     While there is no conclusive evidence that an occasional \n     drink is harmful to the fetus or to the pregnant woman, a \n     safe level of alcohol intake during pregnancy has not been \n     established.\n       Individuals who plan to drive or take part in activities \n     that require attention or skill. Most people retain some \n     alcohol in the blood up to 2-3 hours after a single drink.\n       Individuals using prescription and over-the-counter \n     medications. Alcohol may alter the effectiveness or toxicity \n     of medicines. Also, some medications may increase blood \n     alcohol levels or increase the adverse effect of alcohol on \n     the brain.\n\n\n                            advice for today\n\n       If you drink alcoholic beverages, do so in moderation, with \n     meals, and when consumption does not put you or others at \n     risk.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     A Prize for the Wine Institute\n\n                         (By Lawrence Wallack)\n\n       The Wine Institute has been nominated for a prize it would \n     rather not win. In a recent editorial, the San Francisco \n     Examiner nominated that trade organization for the \n     newspaper's annual Emperor Norton Prize, ``to draw public \n     attention to crack-brained schemes, dingbat proposals and \n     stupendous nuttiness in matters of public policy.''\n       What Wine Institute scheme has warranted such a dubious \n     accolade? In the interest of public education, the Wine \n     Institute wants to place a label on wine bottles alerting \n     consumers to the health benefits of moderate alcohol \n     consumption.\n       While I support the Wine Institute for this award and \n     praise the Examiner for its courage and insight, I still want \n     to know what made the Wine Institute's scheme possible. How \n     did the irrelevant sentence ``alcoholic beverages have been \n     used to enhance the enjoyment of meals by many societies \n     throughout human history'' make it into the final version of \n     the federal dietary guidelines, the cornerstone of national \n     nutrition policy? No parallel friendly sentence accompanies \n     any other guideline in the federal document. And while we're \n     at it, what about the final deletion of the phrase ``drug \n     effects of alcohol,'' which the guidelines advisory committee \n     used twice in its proposed document? Certainly this must be \n     private industry propaganda, not public interest education.\n       Educating the public about the role of alcohol in our \n     society is an important mission and should be undertaken by \n     those without a vested interest. The alcoholic beverage \n     industry already spends several billion dollars every year \n     educating youth and adults alike about the ``benefits'' of \n     their product. Sophistication, wit, sexiness, peer \n     acceptance, fitness, and many other implied benefits are \n     communicated endlessly to the consumer. Alcohol advertising \n     is almost, but not quite, pervasive enough to make people \n     forget that alcohol is a drug, that alcohol is the number one \n     cause of potential years of life lost in this country, that \n     alcohol causes about 100,000 deaths every year.\n       Public health educators are struggling against great odds \n     to level the playing field for the consumer seeking \n     information about this very significant risk factor. They \n     want an information environment where people can get a \n     realistic view of the role of alcohol in society. The Wine \n     Institute wants to tilt the field so it looks like one of San \n     Francisco's hills.\n       From a public health perspective, the proposed Wine \n     Institute label would contribute to the high level of \n     misinformation about alcohol that clogs our environment. None \n     of the studies I have seen that suggest a health benefit from \n     moderate drinking recommends that anyone start drinking or \n     increase their consumption. The Dietary Guidelines for \n     Americans, in fact, states that moderate drinking is \n     associated with a lower risk for coronary heart disease ``in \n     some individuals.''\n       Of course, researchers conducting these studies would be \n     the first to say that ``association'' is not ``causation.'' \n     Indeed, the usual recommendation is to seek advice from a \n     physician--a medical approach that provides patients with \n     information particular to their situation. This is especially \n     important when the change is one that can have widely \n     different effects on different individuals. Advice to a \n     population is a public health matter and is not a good means \n     for communicating the limited or special case benefits of a \n     drug, especially when that drug is addictive.\n       So, the Wine Institute of San Francisco may not want the \n     Emperor Norton Prize, but if it is somehow successful in its \n     efforts to get the proposed label approved, it will certainly \n     deserve the award, and the notoriety that comes with it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 435. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to waive the contemporaneous \nsubstantiation requirement for deduction of charitable contributions in \ncertain cases; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  The Equity in Charitable Giving Act\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill help reform America's tax system. The bill I introduce today is \ndesigned to advance the important goal of encouraging charitable \ncontributions. With this proposal, I add my voice to the Republican \nchorus in the Senate and House of Representatives calling for reform of \nour tax system to make it fairer and less burdensome for all Americans.\n  The bill I introduce today is the Equity in Charitable Giving Act. \nThis legislation, which is also cosponsored by the senior Senator from \nWyoming, Senator Thomas, would provide relief for taxpayers who have \nhad legitimate charitable contributions disallowed by the IRS because \nof a technical change Congress made to the Tax Code in 1993. In that \nyear, a change was made to section 170 of the Internal Revenue Code \ndealing with the documentation required by taxpayers to claim \ncharitable contributions. The new change required taxpayers to have a \n``contemporaneous written acknowledgment'' of their contributions for \nall contributions they claimed over $250 in a taxable year.\n  While the purpose of this change was understandable, the rule \nespoused was too broad and it has in turn yielded some harsh results. \nSome taxpayers, unaware of the change in the law, did not receive the \nnecessary acknowledgment before they filed their taxes. This oversight \nis understandable. For example, a taxpayer who filed his taxes in \nFebruary may not have received the necessary documentation from the \naffected charities prior to filing his taxes. Under the current rule, \nany contributions over $250 would be disallowed even if he received the \nproper documentation before his taxes were due on April 15th. As a \nresult of the very narrow definition of ``contemporaneous'' found in \nsection 170(f)(8)(C), a number of taxpayers have had their otherwise \nlawful charitable contributions disallowed by the Internal Revenue \nService. This punitive rule elevates form over substance and places an \nunwarranted burden on those generous taxpayers desiring to make their \ncommunities better places in which to live.\n  The Equity in Charitable Giving Act, which I introduce today, has one \nsimple purpose: to provide tax relief for those taxpayers who fell \nthrough the cracks when the law on charitable contributions was \nchanged. While this bill would still require taxpayers to receive the \nproper documentation from the charitable organization, taxpayers would \nhave a longer time to file this written acknowledgment with the \nInternal Revenue Service. In order to take advantage of this \nflexibility, taxpayers would also have to demonstrate\n\n[[Page S1734]]\n\nto the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Treasury that no goods or \nservices were received from the tax exempt organization in return for \ntheir contributions. While this is only a small step in the larger \njourney of reforming America's Tax Code, it furthers the important \nobjective of charitable giving by ensuring that taxpayers receive the \nproper tax treatment for their gifts.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to provide meaningful tax relief and \nreform for the American people. The Republican-led Congress has taken \nimportant and meaningful steps in that direction over the past two \nyears with the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Internal Revenue \nService Reform Act of 1998. We must continue this important endeavor by \ncontinuing to restructure our tax policy to respect marriage and \nfamilies, encourage investment and savings, reward charitable giving, \nand promote job creation and entrepreneurship. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in this endeavor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for hnimself and Mr. Baucus):\n  S. 438. A bill to provide for the settlement of the water rights \nclaims of the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be jointly \nintroducing with my fellow Senator from Montana, Senator Baucus, a bill \nto settle the claims and define the water rights of the Chippewa Cree \nTribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation. This bill is the product of many \nyears of work and negotiations in our state and will result in the \nfederal government sanctioning the water rights agreement that has been \nadopted by the Montana State Legislature. This settlement represents a \ntextbook example of how State and Tribal governments, together with \noff-Reservation local representatives, can sit down and resolve their \ndifferences. I am also pleased that local ranchers were involved in \nevery step of discussions, and that their water rights are fully \nprotected under this settlement.\n  The state agreement quantifies the Tribe's on-reservation water \nrights and establishes a water administration system carefully designed \nto have minimal adverse impacts on downstream, non-tribal water users. \nIn fact, our goal was to benefit downstream water users wherever \npossible. This is quite an accomplishment in an area of Montana with a \nscarce water supply. The Rocky Boy's Reservation is located in an arid \narea with an average annual rainfall of 12 inches or less. Fortunately, \nthe annual runoff from the Bearpaw Mountains, with a annual snowpack of \nover 30 inches, contributes to a significant spring runoff. Effective \nuse of that runoff through enlarged or new storage facilities on the \nReservation is a critical part of the settlement package which this \nbill represents. Accordingly, $25 million in the budget of the Bureau \nof Reclamation is earmarked for specified on-reservation water \ndevelopment projects. To meet both the future water and economic needs \nof the Reservation, the bill contains an allocation of 10,000 acre-feet \nof storage water to the Tribe in Tiber Reservoir, a federal storage \nfacility. To resolve future disputes, this settlement established a \nboard composed of Tribal and off-Reservation representatives.\n  In addition, the bill authorizes the initial steps of a more detailed \nprocess of securing long-term drinking water supplies for the Chippewa \nCree Tribe, a process that is vital to the survival of the Tribe. \nSpecifically, the bill authorizes the following: (1) $15 million in \nseed money toward the cost of a future project to import more drinking \nwater to the Reservation. (2) $1 million for a feasibility study by the \nSecretary of the Interior to identify water resources available to meet \nthe Tribe's drinkiater needs. (3) $3 million to evaluate water \nresources over a broader area of North Central Montana that contains \ntwo other Indian Reservations with water rights that have not yet been \nestablished.\n  In closing, I believe that the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's \nReservation Indian Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act is a historic \nagreement. It is a tribute to the Governor of Montana, Marc Racicot; \nthe Water Rights Compact Commission; the Chippewa Cree Tribe chairman, \nBert Cocoran; the Tribal negotiating team; Interior Secretary's \nCounselor, David Hayes; the Federal negotiating team; and the water \nusers on the Big Sandy and Beaver Creeks in the Montana Milk River \nvalley. This is truly a local solution that takes into account the \nneeds and sovereign rights of each party. Just as the mentioned parties \nhave worked closely together to get us to the submission of this bill \ntoday, I intend to work closely with all members of Congress to insure \npassage of this important bill.\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague from the State of Montana on the introduction of the Chippewa \nCree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved Water Rights \nSettlement Act. The legislation ratifies the Compact approved by the \nState and the Tribe in 1997. Senator Burns and I jointly introduced \nthis legislation in the 105th Congress and had the 2nd Session of that \nCongress lasted a few more weeks, I believe the bill would have been \napproved by the Senate. The introduction of this bill is the \nculmination of 16 years of extensive technical studies and six years of \nrather intensive negotiations in our state involving the Chippewa Cree \nTribe, the Montana state government, off-Reservation county and \nmunicipal governments in north-central Montana, local ranchers, and the \nUnited States Departments of Justice and Interior.\n  The 122,000-acre Rocky Boy's Reservation sits west of Havre, Montana \non several tributaries of the Milk River on what was formerly the Fort \nAssiniboine Military Reserve. Unfortunately, the portion of the land \nreserved for the Chippewa Cree is rough and arid. Without irrigation, \nmuch of the land is not suitable for farming. Recent studies have \ndemonstrated that the Reservation could not sustain the membership of \nthe Chippewa Cree Tribe as a permanent homeland without an infusion of \nadditional water. The development of a viable reservation economy calls \nfor more water for drinking purposes, as well as for agriculture and \nother municipal uses. In 1982, acting in its fiduciary capacity as \ntrustee for the Tribe, the United States filed a claim for the water \nrights of the Chippewa Cree in the State of Montana general stream \nadjudication. Were it not for the negotiated settlement represented by \nthis legislation, divisive and costly litigation would be pending \nbetween the State, the Tribe, the United States and non-Indian ranchers \nfor many years to come. Fortunately, in 1979, the Montana legislature \narticulated a policy in favor of negotiation and established the \nMontana Reserved Water Rights Compact Commission to negotiate \n``compacts for the equitable division and apportionment of waters \nbetween the state and its people and several Indian tribes claiming \nreserved water rights within the state.''\n  From the initial meeting in 1992, to the conclusion of an agreed on \nwater rights Compact in 1997, the State, the Federal Government and the \nTribe acted in good faith and worked together to explore options. This \nculminated in passage of a resolution by the Chippewa Cree Tribal \nCouncil to ratify the Compact on January 9, 1997. Following \noverwhelming approval by the Montana Legislature and appropriation of \nfunds for implementation, Governor Marc Racicot signed the Compact into \nstate law on April 14, 1997. Subsequent negotiation, in which staff \nfrom my office assisted the State and Tribe, resulted in approval by \nthe United States Departments of the Interior and Justice and drafting \nof this bill by the three parties.\n  The litigation filed in state water court in 1982 is stayed pending \nthe outcome of this bill. Once passed, the United States, the Tribe and \nthe State of Montana will petition the Montana Water Court to enter a \ndecree reflecting the water rights of the Tribe.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this very positive legislation and \nwork with Senator Burns and Montana's Congressman Hill, who has \nsimultaneously introduced this bill in the House, to secure passage of \nthe Settlement Act this year.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to expeditious passage of this historic \nsettlement.\n\n[[Page S1735]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1727-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1735-S1736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  S. 4\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) was added as a cosponsor of S. 4, a bill to \nimprove pay and retirement equity for members of the Armed Forces; and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 13\n\n  At the request of Mr. Sessions, the name of the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mr. Hutchinson) was added as a cosponsor of S. 13, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide additional tax incentives for \neducation.\n\n\n                                 S. 38\n\n  At the request of Mr. Campbell, the name of the Senator from Montana \n(Mr. Burns) was added as a cosponsor of S. 38, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to phase out the estate and gift taxes \nover a 10-year period.\n\n\n                                 S. 67\n\n  At the request of Mr. Moynihan, the names of the Senator from Florida \n(Mr. Graham), the Senator from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), and the Senator \nfrom California (Mrs. Boxer) were added as cosponsors of S. 67, a bill \nto designate the headquarters building of the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development in Washington, District of Columbia, as the ``Robert \nC.

Mr. President, on behalf of my principal cosponsor, \nSenator Inouye, and myself, I am proud to submit a resolution \nrequesting that the United States Postal Service issue a commemorative \npostage stamp honoring the 100th anniversary of the founding of the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (``VFW''), which will be \ncelebrating its centennial in September of this year. We are pleased to \nbe joined by 56 of our colleagues in support of this measure.\n  As a member of the VFW Ladies Auxiliary post in Caribou, ME, and as \nthe daughter of a World War II veteran who was wounded twice in combat, \nI am honored to lead the charge for this worthwhile legislation.\n  This measure is intended to pay special tribute to all members of the \nVFW, past and present, who pledged their honor and their lives to \ndefend the United States and who fought bravely in foreign lands so \nthat we as a nation might live in freedom. These are our true American \npatriots, for they have demonstrated a profound commitment to the \nprinciples of our Founding Fathers not in mere words, but in their \ndeeds. When their country called, they answered, and they fought to \nkeep the American way of life safe and secure.\n  As an organization, the Veterans of Foreign Wars traces its roots \nback to 1899. Veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine \nInsurrection returned home from intense fighting abroad and were \ngreeted with a hero's welcome. Over time, the memory of wartime \nsacrifice faded in the minds of many Americans, but not for the men who \ncarried with them permanent battle scars, prolonged illnesses, and \nother grim reminders of war.\n  Absent a single Government agency possessing responsibility for \nveterans, and facing neglect, these brave men banded together to \nestablish a handful of local organizations intended to help secure \nmedical care and pensions for their military service. These original \nforeign service organizations, located in Ohio, Colorado, and \nPennsylvania, gradually grew in number and influence and in 1914 came \nto be known collectively as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, it was several years later, on June 24, 1921, when the \nVFW's chapter in my home State of Maine was chartered. Today, there are \n84 VFW posts in Maine to which over 16,000 veterans belong.\n  Those small groups of veterans who organized in 1899 have today grown \nto over 2 million strong. VFW members have fought and died in every \nwar, conflict, and military intervention in which the United States has \nbeen engaged during this century. From factory workers to occupants of \nthe White House, the VFW members and its Ladies Auxiliary have come to \nrepresent a cross section of American society, and each new generation \nof veterans has brought renewed strength and dedication to the VFW's \nfounding principles.\n  As the 21st century approaches, the VFW's members continue to live by \nthe organization's creed of ``Honor the dead by helping the living.'' \nThey do so by representing the interests of veterans across the Nation \nthrough an established network of trained service officers who, at no \ncharge, help millions of veterans and their dependents secure the \neducational benefits, disability compensation, pension, and health care \nservices that they are rightfully entitled to as a result of their \ndistinguished service to our Country.\n  The VFW also has a long and proud tradition of supporting troops \ndeployed overseas. From letter-writing campaigns in World War I, to \n``Welcome\n\n[[Page S1737]]\n\nhome'' rallies after the Persian Gulf war, to providing care packages, \nto USO shows and, more recently, to providing free telephone cards \nenabling servicemen and women to call loved ones from their posts in \nBosnia, the VFW continues to provide comfort and a touch of home to \nthose men and women stationed far away.\n  The endeavors of the VFW, however, go well beyond the realm of \n``veterans helping veterans.'' In fact, service to the broader American \ncommunity has always been a pillar of the VFW foundation.\n  Through the VFW's Community Service Program, members of its 10,000 \nposts serve local communities, States, and the Nation with all of the \nintegrity, ingenuity, and loyalty that have characterized the \norganization since its inception. During the past program year, for \nexample, the VFW, working side by side with its Ladies Auxiliary, \ncontributed nearly 13 million hours of volunteer service and donated \nnearly $55 million to a variety of community projects. Commitment to \nworthy causes such as the March of Dimes, the Keep America Beautiful \ncampaign, and many other volunteer organizations also continues to be a \nhallmark of service among VFW members.\n  The promotion of patriotism is another hallmark of the VFW's history. \nSince the beginning of its Americanization Committee in 1921, the VFW \nhas actively taught traditional values to Americans both young and old. \nToday, teaching respect for the flag is a primary activity, as is \neducating children in the classroom about the critical role that \nveterans have played throughout our history.\n  The interests of today's youth are also met by VFW posts around the \nNation through active support for drug prevention programs, the Boy \nScouts of America, the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, and \nsponsorship of competitors in both the Junior and Special Olympics. The \nVFW has also recently commemorated 50 years of helping high school \nstudents attend college. Because of VFW support, in fact, America's \nyoung people annually receive more than $2.6 million in scholarships.\n  The VFW deserves public national recognition for these efforts and \nfor its many other contributions to improving the lives of our Nation's \nveterans and enhancing American society as a whole. Although as a \ncountry we can never fully repay the debt we owe to these brave men and \nwomen, we can certainly strive to honor the vision which led them into \nbattle to protect the principles America holds dear.\n  We must uphold the memories of their heroic acts with respect, with \nreverence, and with our heartfelt admiration. By requesting that the \nU.S. Postal Service issue a commemorative stamp honoring the VFW's \n100th anniversary, as was done for its 50th and 75th anniversaries, we \ncan take a small step toward remembering their service and showing our \ndeep appreciation for their unwavering commitment to our country, both \nin peacetime and in times of conflict. This, I believe, would be a \nmuch-deserved tribute to the VFW and its more than 2 million veterans \nof overseas service.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to note that you are a cosponsor of \nthis important measure.\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the resolution before the Senate \ntoday requesting that the United States Postal Service issue a \ncommemorative postage stamp for the 100th anniversary of the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars of the United States will honor our veterans who have \nso courageously fought in every war, conflict, police action, and \nmilitary intervention since the Spanish-American War in 1899.\n  Members of the VFW have helped millions of veterans secure the \neducation, disability compensation, pension, and health care benefits \nthat veterans are rightfully entitled to receive as a result of their \nmilitary service.\n  With over 2 million members the VFW has also been deeply involved in \ncommunity service projects designed to encourage service in the local \ncommunity benefiting education, the environment, health services, civic \npride, and community betterment. For example, the VFW's Voice of \nDemocracy essay competition provides over $2.7 million in college \nscholarships annually to promising young students. The VFW's Safety \nProgram conducts programs in home, auto, and bicycle safety, as well as \nprograms dealing with drug awareness and substance abuse. Clearly, the \nVFW with over 10,000 posts continues to make valuable and significant \ncontributions to our communities across the country.\n  In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the VFW I urge my \ncolleagues to support this resolution to commemorate our veterans for \ntheir service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1736-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SOLDIERS', SALIORS', AIRMEN'S, AND MARINES' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ROBB AMENDMENT NO. 7\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ROBB sumitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill (S. 4) to improve pay and retirement equity for members of the \nArmed Forces; and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 28, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 104.

Mr. President, among the paintings hanging in \nthe Blue Room of New York's City Hall is a full-length portrait of \nGeneral Lafayette by Samuel F. B. Morse. The father of the telegraph \n(and noted member of the anti-Catholic ``Know-Nothings''), began his \ncareer as a portrait artist. For his commission, Morse received $100 \nand earned a reputation as a gifted painter. Before turning to \ninvention, he would paint the portraits of a galaxy of New York \nworthies.\n  The subject of one such portrait is known to opera lovers the world \nover--Lorenzo Da Ponte. He was, of course, the librettist of Mozart's \nmasterpieces Don Giovanni, Nozze di Figaro, and Cosi Fan Tutte. What \nmakes his life especially intriguing to an American is his career in \nNew York. In a preface to a 1959 edition of his Memoirs (first \npublished in 1830) Thomas G. Bergin observes\n\n       By tradition, education, and experience, this European \n     sophisticate would seem to be far removed from the American \n     Psyche; but his deeper nature--eager, adventurous and \n     basically evangelical--was well-adapted to the New World.\n\n  Born March 10, 1749 in Ceneda, Italy, now Vittorio Veneto, Da Ponte \narrived in New York in 1805 in his middle years and with what might \nseem to be his greatest work already behind him. Upon coming ashore, he \nwas the self-proclaimed ``poet of the Emperor Joseph II, for Salieri, \nfor Storace, for Mozart!'' He found work as a grocer on the Bowery, \nthat great stretch of Manhattan teeming with all the varieties of 19th \nCentury life. He soon fell in with the young Clement Clark Moore, \nfounder of the General Theological Seminary and the (long anonymous) \nauthor of The Night Before Christmas. The two shared a love of language \nand books. Moore, amazed by Da Ponte's brilliance, introduced his \nfriend to a literary group at Columbia College, of which he was a \ntrustee. The group included the future Congressman Gulian Verplank. In \ntime Da Ponte would become a major figure in New York society, dining \nwith Livingstons, Hamiltons, Onderdoncks and the like. He became a \nprofessor of Italian, donated the first volume of Italian literature to \nthe New York Public Library, and, with the help of his friends at \nColumbia, founded the Italian Opera. Don Giovanni was performed at the \nPark Theater in May 1826 and it may be said New York has never been the \nsame.\n  The scholar Arthur Livingston observes, ``There is no doubt all this \nwas an important moment for the American mind. Da Ponte made Europe, \npoetry, painting, music, the artistic spirit, classical lore, a \ncreative classical education, live for many important Americans as no \none had done before.''\n  In 1838, his last year on earth, he was given absolution by John \nMacCloskey, New York's second Archbishop and America's first Cardinal. \nHe died on August 17. Three days later, at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral \nat Mott and Prince Streets, he was honored with a ``hero's burial'' \nbefore a large and distinguished funeral party. As one account has it:\n\n       Da Ponte was buried, probably in the tomb of a friend, to \n     await reburial and a headstone at a later date. As far as is \n     known, the reburial never took place, and the headstone was \n     not installed. The overcrowded cemetery was closed in 1848, \n     and all of its records (including Da Ponte's) were destroyed \n     when Old St. Patrick's was gutted by fire eighteen years \n     later. . . . Between 1909 and 1915, all the bodies were \n     disinterred and moved, with or without identification, to \n     Calvary Cemetery in Queens.\n\nAnd so, like Mozart, Da Ponte came to rest in an unmarked grave.\n  This year provides an opportunity to rectify, at least in part, this \nsad and resonant ending. This seems a wondrous time to celebrate \nperhaps by some memorial in Old St. Patrick's, surely by performing \nMozart's Requiem, K.626, composed in 1791.\n  After his death, the New York Daily Express recorded:\n\n\n[[Page S1739]]\n\n\n       Signor Da Ponte came to America, where he has resided 32 \n     years, chiefly in this city; and to his indefatigable \n     exertions, commanding talents, and profound literary \n     attainments, are we mainly indebted for the taste everywhere \n     diffused on our country for the music and language of his \n     native land. He has been the Cadmas to whom we owe an \n     unpayable debt for these inappreciable gifts.\n\n  We are in his debt to this day, and surely 1999 is year to \nacknowledge it.\n  I ask that the obituary from the New York Daily Express be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The obituary follows:\n\n           [From the New York Daily Express, August 20, 1838]\n\n                              City Affairs\n\n       Death of Daponte--Signor Lorenzo Daponte being a resident \n     of this City died here on Friday at the advanced age of 90. \n     His celebrated opera, written for Mozart, has given him a \n     name all over the world. The Sunday Morning News states that \n     he was a Venetian and native of Cenda--educated from the \n     Church, and then afterwards from his fine poetic talents and \n     passion for music, that he became a prominent person in the \n     Court of Emperor Joseph II of Austria. Under his special \n     protection, he formed a close relationship with the \n     celebrated Mozart, which led to the production of those \n     admired Operas, Giovanni, the Marriage of Figaro, and c., \n     which the poetry of Daponte is no less eternized by its own \n     beauties than by the divine music by which it is embalmed. \n     After the decease of Mozart, who died in his friend Daponte's \n     arms, the poet went to London, and there for years was \n     intimately associated with the early efforts to introduce a \n     more perfect Italian Opera. From there, Signor Daponte came \n     to America, where he has resided 32 years, chiefly in this \n     city; and to his indefatigable exertions, commanding talents, \n     and profound literary attainments, are we mainly indebted for \n     the taste every where diffused in our country for the music \n     and language of his native land.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDaniel Pratt, a distinguished Southern Industrialist and founder of the \ncity of Prattville, Alabama. A man whose vision guided the state on a \ncourse of industrialization and modernization. As a celebration of \nDaniel Pratt's 200th birthday, 1999 has been named the ``Year of \nIndustry'' in Alabama. This is a significant tribute to honor a very \nimportant figure in the history of Alabama. Daniel Pratt's legacy not \nonly includes the beginning of modern industry to the state, but also \nphilanthropic deeds that were unrivaled for his era. Daniel Pratt's \nindomitable pioneer spirit serves as an inspiration to others who have \nfaced adversity and conquered the unknown.\n  Born in 1799, Daniel Pratt was raised in Temple, New Hampshire. \nBrought up as a Congregationalist in a traditional Puritan family, \nDaniel Pratt grew up disciplined, structured, and religious. He \nreceived only a limited education, but took advantage of an opportunity \nto apprentice under a family friend, who was an architect and a \nbuilder. This new focus in his life helped to channel his natural \ninclination towards machinery and building. After his mother's death in \n1817, Daniel Pratt acted on his ambitions and set out for the South, \nwhich he regarded as a land of opportunity. Daniel Pratt's formative \nyears instilled in him a strong work ethic and religious convictions, \nalong with a sense of compassion. These two attributes would help to \nguide him through difficult decisions throughout his life.\n  After sailing to Savannah, Georgia, Daniel Pratt did not immediately \nbecome a rich entrepreneur. Initially, he put the tools of his \napprenticeship to work as a builder and planner for wealthy planters. \nAfter a few years, he moved onto ship building, adding to his \nburgeoning knowledge of construction and the industrial process. Daniel \nPratt was willing to take the long road to success. He realized that \nthe only way to succeed in life was through hard work and gritty \ndetermination. He also had the common sense to learn from others, which \npaid off when he befriended Samuel Griswold, who was a prominent cotton \ngin manufacturer in the area. Through friendship as well as a business \nrelationship, Daniel Pratt learned the trade which would ultimately \nthrust him into the forefront of Southern industrialization. Daniel \nPratt proved to be so adept at the manufacture and sale of cotton gins, \nthat he became a partner in the enterprise within a year. At this point \nin his life, Daniel Pratt's unbridled vision was able to manifest \nitself in his actions. He saw that the expansion of the cotton gin into \nthe West was a fantastic opportunity for his new enterprise. He \nrealized that the center of distribution in the South would revolve \naround the great river systems which offered the advantage of water as \na cheap source of power. Pratt had planned to stay in business with his \npartner, but with Indian uprisings in the Alabama area, his partner \nbecame apprehensive. This did not deter Daniel Pratt in the slightest. \nAs his first biographer, Shadrack Mims wrote: ``The indomitable will of \nDaniel Pratt, that spirit of enterprise which characterized him through \nlife, was not to be daunted nor discouraged by Indian uprisings. He \npurchased material for fifty gins, put the same on wagons, and in 1833, \nhe with his brave wife headed for Alabama.''\n  Daniel Pratt rapidly met the success he foresaw in his move to \nAlabama. He found quick sales among the planters of the Alabama Black \nBelt. He established a temporary site for his factory along Autauga \nCreek and immediately began to expand his operations. Within a period \nof five years, it was evident that he needed a larger area for a \npermanent site. He chose to settle on a marshy, heavily wooded piece of \nland only three miles from his original site. In only ten years, he \nturned this hostile area into a thriving manufacturing village of eight \nhundred people. This is the site that would eventually form the booming \nindustrial town of Prattville.\n  Initially, the Gin Factory was the corner stone of the economy in the \nnew settlement. But as business grew, Daniel Pratt reinvested the \nprofits into new industries in the town. By the 1850's, Prattville, for \nits size, furnished the most diverse industrial pattern in the United \nStates. In addition, the Pratt Gin Company became the largest gin \nfactory in the world, with unrivaled quality in construction. Daniel \nPratt's business was so successful, that he began to invest money in \nthe state infrastructure. He presided over railroad conventions and \nsparked Southern railroad growth with his generous infusion of capital.\n  Daniel Pratt also used his good fortune to invest in the Red Mountain \nIron and Coal Company, and he controlled the Oxmoor iron furnaces in \nthe Birmingham Industrial district. In his honor, the great vein of \ncoal west of Birmingham was named the Pratt Vein, and Pratt City was \nlater incorporated into the town of Birmingham. These furnaces were \ndestroyed by Wilson's Raiders during the Civil War, but Daniel Pratt \nwas determined to rebuild them. With the help of his son-in-law, Henry \nDebardeleban, he did just that, and by 1873, they were back in \noperation. The name was changed to the Eureka Mining Company, and the \ntowns of Birmingham and Bessemer began to thrive. Daniel Pratt is \ncredited with being one of the driving forces behind the development of \nthat entire area of the state.\n  In 1847, the University of Alabama awarded him the degree of Master \nof Mechanical and Useful Arts, the only one of it's kind the University \nhas ever given. Pratt also served as a distinguished member of the \nAlabama House of Representatives throughout the duration of the Civil \nWar.\n  However, it was Daniel Pratt's philanthropic deeds which set him \napart from other industrialists of his time. Pratt built schools and \nchurches for workers in his textile mill with his own money. His \nboundless paternalism towards his workers led him to teach in \nPrattville's Sunday Schools. It was his sincere desire to better both \nthe town of Prattville as well as the entire South through his \nrelentless efforts to preach the industrial gospel. He wrote numerous \nletters and articles professing his industrialist beliefs, which were \npublished in southern newspapers and periodicals across the area.\n\n[[Page S1740]]\n\n  Although born 200 years ago, Daniel Pratt serves as a shining example \nof a pioneer spirit which transformed the South into a thriving \nindustrial center. His leadership, vision, courage, and generosity is \nan inspiration to everyone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1739-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SISTER JANE: A CHAMPION FOR THE POOR\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nwork of an extraordinary woman from the state of New Jersey, Sister \nJane Frances Brady.\n  Sister Jane, as she is widely known, has been a tireless advocate on \nbehalf of the poor and uninsured. She has done this most visibly \nthrough her 26-year tenure as both president and chief executive \nofficer of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson, New \nJersey.\n  Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, Paterson is my home \ntown and I am privileged to be able to call Sister Jane a good and \nlongtime friend. Sister Jane has just recently stepped down from her \nposition as president, and will leave her post as CEO of St. Joseph's \nby the summer. I know that she will be sorely missed there.\n  But Sister Jane is not leaving health care altogether. She will be \nthe new executive vice president of Via Caritas Health System in \nParsippany.\n  The combination of Sister Jane's tough administrative style and \nendless compassion has enhanced St. Joseph's facilities and reputation \nimmensely. During her time there, the hospital has excelled in \nproviding care for people living with HIV, newborns, bone marrow \ntransplant candidates, patients needing open-heart surgery and trauma \nvictims.\n  Mr. President, one of the most important things that Sister Jane has \ndone through her work at St. Joseph's is to care for poor children. A \nhuge part of fighting that battle is waging a campaign to provide \nhealth insurance coverage for those children. I would like to share \nwith my colleagues a recent editorial in the Bergen Record about Sister \nJane, and her fearless courage to fight for the right of the urban poor \npopulation to have access to adequate health care.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Sister Jane on all her hard work at St. \nJoseph's, and wish her well in her new position at Via Caritas.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a copy of the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Bergen Record, Jan. 12, 1999]\n\n                         Sister Jane Steps Down\n\n       An estimated 290,000 children in New Jersey go without \n     medical insurance. So last year, when the Whitman \n     administration withdrew some funding for a health-care \n     program for uninsured children because of lower-than-expected \n     enrollment, Sister Jane Frances Brady, president and chief \n     executive officer of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center \n     in Paterson, was furious.\n       With the help of St. Joseph's, Passaic County alone had \n     registered more than 1,400 children--nearly one-fifth of the \n     statewide enrollment up until that point. ``If we did that, \n     why can't the state do as much?'' Sister Jane asked.\n       Stung by criticism from Sister Jane and others, the state \n     initiated a massive advertising campaign to sign up uninsured \n     children. It included mass mailings, advertisements, and a \n     radio spot by Governor Whitman.\n       Sister Jane has always expected others to work as hard for \n     the poor as she does, and that applied to state officials as \n     well as St. Joseph's employees. In addition to championing \n     the urban poor during her 26 years at St. Joseph's, Sister \n     Jane has transformed the hospital into a regional health-care \n     hub that attracts patients statewide for services such as \n     high-risk births and open heart surgery.\n       Earlier this month, Sister Jane stepped down as president. \n     Patrick Wardell, the hospital's new executive vice president, \n     will run the hospital on a day-to-day basis, but the 63-year-\n     old nun will continue as CEO until July. At that point, she \n     will assume full-time her role as executive vice president of \n     Via Caritas Health System in Parsippany. Via Caritas is a \n     Catholic health-care system--formed in 1997--that has St. \n     Joseph's as its largest hospital member.\n       Sister Jane set a fine example for dedication and \n     leadership at St. Joseph's. Prior to suffering a small stroke \n     in 1997, she had never taken a sick day. And under her \n     leadership St. Joseph's became one of the most financially \n     sound hospitals in the state. Although she will remain a \n     tireless voice for compassion for the less fortunate, her \n     day-to-day involvement in the medical care of the poor in \n     Paterson will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1740-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    100 YEARS OF SPARTAN BASKETBALL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my alma \nmater, Michigan State University, as their basketball program \ncelebrates its centennial season. Over the course of the last century, \nSpartan basketball has been a tremendous source of pride for the \nMichigan State student body and its vast alumni network. A splendid \nrepresentative of the Big Ten conference since 1951, MSU is one of the \npremier college basketball programs in the nation. MSU basketball has \nproduced 45 NBA draft picks, among them some of the greatest players in \nthe history of the game.\n  The many great teams and coaches that have graced the floor of the \nJenison Field House and Breslin Center should be very proud of the \ntradition of excellence that they have built. The accomplishments of \nMichigan State's basketball program are tremendous: 15 First-Team All-\nAmericans, seven Big Ten championships, four Big Ten players of the \nyear, 12 NCAA Tournament appearances, and one National Championship.\n  I extend my warmest regards and best wishes to the 1998 National \nCoach of the Year, Tom Izzo, and all current Spartan players. I also \napplaud all past coaches, players, and supporters of Spartan \nBasketball's first one hundred years. I hope the next century is as \nexciting and successful as the first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1740-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO GORDON M.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Gordon \nSherman, of Dunwoody, Georgia, who after more than four decades of \ndedicated service to the Social Security Administration retired on \nDecember 31, 1998. He is an outstanding example to his family and \nfriends, and has been an asset to the many communities that he has \ntouched over the years.\n  Gordon has more than 40 years of combined military and civilian \nfederal service. He began working for the Social Security \nAdministration in 1958 and has served as the Southeast Regional \nCommissioner to the Social Security Administration (SSA) since October \n1975. In this role, he has been responsible for supervision, \ncoordination, executive leadership, and effective and efficient \nadministration of the Social Security program in the eight southeastern \nstates.\n  As a career senior governmental executive, he has received many \nawards in honor of his noteworthy accomplishments and outstanding \nleadership over the years. Several of Gordon's most prestigious awards \nare the U.S. Army Legion of Merit medal, two Presidential Meritorious \nExecutive Rank Awards, the National Public Service Award from the \nAmerican Society of Public Administration (ASPA) and the National \nAcademy of Public Administration (NAPA), the coveted Ewell T. Bartlett \nNational Award for Humanity in Government, and the national ``Making \nthe King Holiday Award'' from the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal \nHoliday Commission for his assistance in making this holiday a reality.\n  As a native of Alabama, he graduated from Auburn University with a \nB.S. degree and received J.D. and LL.M degrees, as well as an honorary \nLL.D from Woodrow Wilson College of Law and completed the Senior \nManagers in Government (SMG) program at the John F. Kennedy School of \nGovernment at Harvard University. Gordon and his wife Miriam are also \nassociated with several business, educational, professional, civic, \nservice and volunteer organizations in the Dunwoody area.\n  Mr. President, I would like to honor and commend Gordon Sherman for \nhis outstanding and innumerable contributions over the years to the \nState of Georgia and to our entire Nation, and ask you and my \ncolleagues to join me in saluting and congratulating Gordon on his \nretirement.

We \nhonor the courageous men and women who fought in the war and especially \nthose who lost their lives while fighting to protect the ideals America \nstands for; that is, freedom and liberty for all.\n  As Americans, we enjoy many freedoms. When our Forefathers declared \nindependence from Britain, they cited the ``right to life, liberty and \nthe pursuit of happiness'' as the rights of all citizens. These \ninalienable rights cannot be taken away by anyone. After America won \nits independence and had drafted a constitution, a section was added to \nsecure certain rights of all Americans. This addendum was called the \nBill of Rights, and it ensures all citizens freedom of speech and \nfreedom of religion. Unfortunately, we sometimes take these freedoms \nfor granted and forget that not all people around the world enjoy the \nsame inalienable rights that we do, nor can they protect themselves \nfrom aggressors who threaten to take away their liberty.\n  When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, he took away their freedom and \nthreatened to oppress the people. As a promotor of freedom and liberty, \nthe United States stepped in to defend the rights of Kuwaitis. Although \nwar is a grave option, all people deserve the chance to live without \noppression. Before turning to war, our first move is to find a solution \npeacefully through negotiations. Yet, sometimes this option fails. As \nmuch as we want to achieve world peace through diplomatic means, the \nunfortunate reality is that sometimes we face many complicated \ninternational problems, which must be dealt with in other ways.\n  Because of the actions of Saddam Hussein, the Persian Gulf War was \nunavoidable. The U.S. Armed Forces came together with our Allies to \nfight for the rights of the people of Kuwait. We should be proud of the \nheroic men and women, including the members of the Minnesota Reserve \nand Guard, who fought for the freedom of others. These men and women \nput their lives on the line without hesitation.\n  Mr. President, eight years ago, American soldiers bravely won freedom \nfor a small country in the Middle East. I am honored today to pay \ntribute to these courageous men and women who fought in the Persian \nGulf War.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1740-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BARNEY DWYER\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nfriend and former colleague in Congress, Bernard Dwyer. Barney, as he \nwas affectionately known, was a devoted public servant and respected \nNew Jerseyan, having served 12 years in the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, you might not know how devoted he actually was, since \nhe never delivered a speech on the floor of the House. But Barney was \nproud of that record.\n  He worked proudly, and tirelessly, behind the scenes in Congress as a \nmember of the House Appropriations Committee to fund myriad projects \nfor New Jersey and for the country. Only some of the examples of his \nhard work was his support of AMTRAK and New Jersey's transportation \nfunding needs, his backing of an alcohol abuse program at Rutgers \nUniversity, and his assistance in helping the Red Cross receive grants \nfor AIDS education programs. Whether he was improving sidewalks, street \nlamps, public schools or community park paths, Barney approached his \nwork with the same diligence and passion.\n  Mr. President, Barney began his career over forty years ago, serving \nas councilman and mayor in Edison, New Jersey. He then served as a \nstate senator of New Jersey for six years, acting as both senate \nmajority leader and as chairman of the Legislature's joint \nappropriations committee.\n  Before going into politics, Barney also served in World War II. He \nwas the believed to be the only member of Congress to have survived the \nattack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.\n  Mr. President, Barney Dwyer stood out in New Jersey's political \ncommunity as warm, compassionate, modest, even humble. He was an \nhonorable statesman and a man of the highest integrity. And he will be \nsorely missed.\n  I would like to send my sincerest condolences to Barney's \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1741-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO WOMEN'S RESOURCE CENTER\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nWomen's Resource Center of Lackawanna and Susquehanna Counties in \nPennsylvania for providing more than 20 years of shelter and counseling \nto adults and children who have been victims of violence at the hands \nof family members, partners or someone else they know.\n  The Center will display a memorial exhibit, ``An Empty Place at the \nTable,'' in the Rotunda of the Senate Russell Building on February 24 \nand 25 to ensure that the brutal deaths of women and children are not \nforgotten.\n  In the United States a woman is beaten by her partner or former \npartner every 12 seconds, and, according to the FBI, 26 percent of all \nfemale murder victims are killed by their husbands or boyfriends.\n  The Women's Resource Center, established in 1977, has demonstrated a \ncommitment to their community by providing more than 18,000 hours of \ncrisis services. These services include a 24 hour hotline, an emergency \nshelter, crisis counseling and advocacy to more than 2,000 adults and \nchildren each year, as well as numerous hours of educational \nprogramming with the legal system, schools, businesses, professionals \nand faith communities on the dynamics of abuse and assault. The Center \nprovides their services under the strictest confidentiality and free of \ncharge and discrimination.\n  Mr. President, the Center's memorial exhibit reveals how violence \nundeniably leaves an empty place at the table. I ask my colleagues to \njoin with me in commending the Women's Resource Center for its \nleadership and commitment to restoring the fundamental right to live \nfree from fear in our own homes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1741-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EXPLANATION OF VOTE\n\n Mr. SPECTER.

BURKES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to see the Senate \ntoday approve the nomination of a fellow Mississippian, Wayne O. \nBurkes, to serve as a member of the Surface Transportation Board (STB). \nWayne is qualified to serve because he brings a wealth of experience \nand a depth of character to the STB.\n  Wayne Burkes comes to this position after serving as the \nTransportation Commissioner for the Central District of Mississippi for \nthe past ten years. In this capacity, he supervised all modes of \ntransportation in the state involving aviation, highways, public \ntransit, and rail safety. Prior to that, he served for 14 years in the \nMississippi Legislature as both a Senator and a Representative on the \nHighways and Transportation Committees.\n  Mr. President, Wayne Burkes brings a real multimodal background to \nthe STB. He is a thoughtful, introspective, humble, and mature public \nservant. Wayne knows who he is and this will help him be an effective \nSTB Member. Significantly, his experience, education, and training \nextend beyond the world of transportation. He understands the economics \nof business from his experience as an insurance underwriter and serving \non the Board of Trustees of the Mississippi Baptist Medical Center.\n  Wayne Burkes answered our Nation's call to duty by serving in the Air \nForce and Mississippi's Air National Guard, including service in \nVietnam. He rose to the rank of major general before retiring from the \nAir National Guard. His background includes over two decades as a \npastor at his church, where he now serves as a deacon. He also \nvolunteers his time and talents to assist the Boy Scouts of America.\n  Mr. President, our Nation can count on Wayne Burkes to diligently and \nfaithfully execute his duties as a member of the STB. He is the one of \nthe most decent and honest men you could hope to find. We wish him well \nas he embarks on another public service mission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/22/senate-section/article/S1741-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
