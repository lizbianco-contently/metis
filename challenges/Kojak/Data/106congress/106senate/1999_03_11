We confess that it is a lot easier for us to say that than for \nthe 56 men who placed their signatures on that historic liberating \ndocument. We reflect thoughtfully that few were long to survive. Five \nwere captured, tortured, and later died. Twelve had their homes \nransacked, looted, occupied by enemy soldiers, or burned. Two lost sons \nin the Army. One had two sons captured. Nine died of hardships. Thomas \nMcKean of Delaware was so harassed that he had to move his family five \ntimes and yet served in Congress without pay, his family living in \npoverty and hiding. Thomas Nelson, Jr. of Virginia committed his own \nestate to pay back loans of the Government for $2 million and was never \npaid back. And we remember John Hancock's courage was as large in \ncommitment of his funds as his signature was on the Declaration.\n  Father, remind us that freedom is not free. May we do our work today \nwith profound gratitude, but it is You we give the praise. Thank You \nfor women and men in every period of our history who really had to give \nup their lives, offer up their fortunes, and keep their sacred honor \nwith costly patriotism. God, bless America with women and men like that \ntoday and start with each of us now. In Your holy name.

The clerk will report the \npending business.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 5) expressing \n     congressional opposition to the unilateral declaration of a \n     Palestinian state and urging the President to assert clearly \n     United States opposition to such a unilateral declaration of \n     statehood.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent resolution.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. Under the previous order, I believe there are 45 minutes \nequally divided between myself and Mr. Wellstone on this debate.\n  At the very start of the Oslo peace process between Israel and the \nPalestinians, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat wrote a letter to then Israeli \nPrime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in which he stated this: ``The PLO commits \nitself to the Middle East peace process, and to a peaceful resolution \nof the conflict between the two sides, and declares that all \noutstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved \nthrough negotiations.'' That letter was dated September 9, 1993, and it \nled to the ceremony on the White House lawn 4 days later that publicly \nlaunched the peace process.\n  Indeed, it was on the basis of the words that Chairman Arafat wrote \nthat Israel agreed to enter into the negotiations. It was on that basis \nthat Israel agreed to cede land and political authority to the \nPalestinians. It is the most important and fundamental Palestinian \ncommitment, and it undergirds the entire peace process.\n  And yet it is this very principle that Chairman Arafat now threatens \nto abandon. Over the past several months he has repeatedly threatened \nto unilaterally declare a Palestinian state over the entire West Bank \nand the Gaza Strip, with the eastern part of Jerusalem as its capital.\n  Mr. President, this issue touches the core of the Israel-Palestinian \nconflict as the question of the permanent status of the Palestinian \nentity. What will be its final borders? Will there be limits on its \nsovereignty? Will it be allowed to have a military, to possess jets and \ntanks and missiles, to enter into foreign alliances with the likes of \nIraq or Iran or Libya? All these questions need to be bilaterally \nnegotiated\n\n[[Page S2536]]\n\nbetween Israel and the Palestinians so that Israel's security can be \nassured.\n  You can just imagine what happens the day after a unilateral \ndeclaration. Palestinian security forces begin patrolling an area that \nthey now consider part of an independent state but that is part of the \narea that Israel has had security control over. Israel would \nundoubtedly have to take steps to provide for the safety of its \ncitizens. Tension will mount quickly, leading inevitably--and rapidly--\nto a quick descent into violence and bloodshed.\n  And consider for a moment what the Palestinians have already achieved \nin the peace process. Five years ago at this time, not one Palestinian \nliving in the Gaza Strip or on the West Bank lived under Palestinian \ncivilian authority. Today, 98 percent have their own executive branch, \ndemocratically-elected legislature, and courts. They have their own \neducational system, their own broadcasting authority, their own \nairport, their own travel documents, their own flag and anthem. They \nhave full control over virtually the entire Gaza Strip and ten percent \nof the West Bank, including all major population centers, and civilian \nauthority over another seventeen percent. And that is even before the \nstart of final status negotiations. There has been much progress.\n  So why does Arafat make such a threat? Why jeopardize the entire \npeace process? On May 4, the five-year period that began with the \nsigning of the first agreement between Israel and the Palestinians \nends. It had been hoped that by that point all final status \nnegotiations would have been completed. But it should be noted that \nnone of the agreements signed between Israel and the Palestinians--Oslo \nI, Oslo II, the agreement on redeployment in the city of Hebron, and \nthe Wye River Accord were negotiated by the hoped for date. Still, the \nnegotiators stuck to it until agreements were hammered out. That is \nexactly what should occur now. The peace process is much too important \nto be held hostage to an arbitrary date.\n  Some say that Arafat will back down and not carry out this threat, or \nthat he will postpone the date. I certainly hope that is right. But \nlisten to these words of his closest associate which were spoken as \nrecently as February 22, less than 3 weeks ago. He said,\n\n       We . . . assure the whole world that the establishment of \n     the independent state of Palestine, with holy Jerusalem as \n     its capital, is a sacred and legitimate right of the \n     Palestinian people. It is a goal that our people will not \n     accept to abdicate or to give up no matter what the \n     difficulties.\n\n  Palestinian Authority Minister Nabil Shaath said on February 9, ``Our \nposition concerning our right to declare a state on the fourth of May \nhas not changed.\n  Any opposition to this right is rejected.'' Eleven days later, on \nFebruary 20, he continued on the same line, stating, ``We are moving \nforward in our preparations for the day, May 4, the date of the \ndeclaration of the Palestinian state.'' A few weeks earlier, in January \nof this year, he indicated that the declaration of independence would, \nin his words, ``delineate the borders of the Palestinian state as being \nthe borders of June 4, 1967, including all of the West Bank, Gaza \nStrip, and the part of Jerusalem that was on the Jordanian side of the \narmistice.''\n  So it is clear that the Palestinians are still considering their \noptions. Chairman Arafat should know, therefore, that the Congress of \nthe United States strongly urges him not to pursue this reckless \ncourse, but to live up to his own words and his own fundamental \ncommitment to negotiate this most complicated and important issue \nbilaterally with Israel. That is the only true path to a final and \nlasting peace, which is what we all see.\n  He should know that the Congress of the United States stands strongly \nin opposition to a unilateral declaration. This resolution expresses \nthat opposition to a unilateral declaration, and it urges the President \nto make clear to Chairman Arafat that we will not recognize a \nunilaterally declared state.\n  We should be very clear on this point. This is a matter of principle. \nWe should not be relieved if Mr. Arafat arises on May 4 and says, ``We \nwill postpone this decision until December 31.'' A unilateral \ndeclaration, whenever it would occur, would be wrong. The status of the \nterritories controlled by the Palestinian Authority can only be \ndetermined through negotiations with Israel. Period.\n  We should not pay Mr. Arafat for not doing something which he should \nnot have threatened to do in the first place. We should have only one \nmessage: To make a unilateral declaration of statehood is wrong, we \nwill not recognize it, and we urge you not to go forward with it, but \ninstead to return to the process that has gotten us this far to date--\nthe peace process. That is the only course which holds a promise of \nmeeting the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people while \nproviding the people of Israel what they have yearned for in the past \n50 years: peace with security.\n  Mr. President, we have a number of speakers on our side, and I know \nSenator Wellstone does as well.\n  Before I yield the floor, I ask unanimous consent to add Senators \nKyl, Robb, Abraham and Moynihan as cosponsors of S. Con. Res. 5. Their \nnames appear to have been inadvertently omitted in the printed Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I shall be relatively brief, and then I \nwill ask Senator Wyden, who is a cosponsor of this resolution, to \nreally manage the rest of the time for Democrats. He is really the \nperson who has taken the lead in the Senate on this, and he certainly \nshould have the most time to talk about the resolution and the \nimportance of it.\n  Mr. President, I will make a couple of points. One of them is very \nmuch in agreement with my colleague from Kansas, having to do with the \nimportance of the peace process.\n  First, let me say that I think this resolution, which calls on the \nPalestinians not to unilaterally declare an independent state, is an \nimportant resolution. It is one which I certainly support. I support \nthis resolution because I think that whatever ultimately is decided \nabout whether or not there is or is not an independent Palestinian \nstate, that is to be decided by Israel and the Palestinians. That is a \npart of the negotiation, part of where this peace process has to go in \nterms of dealing with these kinds of difficult questions. It would be a \ntragic mistake for there to be a unilateral declaration of a \nPalestinian state now. It would be a tragic mistake. I think this \nresolution really says that in a fairly strong and firm way.\n  Second of all, let me just say that I did have a chance, in December, \nto go to Israel with President Clinton. I have been a critic of the \nPresident on any number of different issues, especially when it comes \nto human rights questions. I think the administration's record is very \nweak. I think the President is trying to do the right thing in the \nMideast. I went, in part, because I thought this was a commitment that \nthe President was living up to, which he had made, regarding the Wye \nRiver agreement.\n  It was a very moving trip. I thought it was especially significant. I \nam convinced that the historians will write about what happened in Gaza \nwhen the Palestinian National Council went on record voting to revoke \nthat part of their charter that called for the destruction of Israel. \nThat can only be a step forward. It was very moving to be there when \nthat vote took place. I just think that it raised the benchmark in \nterms of where we are going in the peace process. I thought it was a \nterribly important step that was taken.\n  Now we really wait to see what will happen in Israel. There are key \nelections. It is my hope that both Israel and the Palestinians will \nlive up to a commitment that I think is so important to people all over \nthe world. If there is not some political settlement, if there is not \nsome resolution of this conflict, I fear that Israeli children and \nPalestinian children will be killing each other for generations to \ncome.\n  My final point is that I would like to make this a part of the Senate \nrecord, and that is why I wanted to speak briefly about this. I do not \nbelieve that our support for this resolution should be construed as the \nU.S. Senate taking a one-sided point of view. I think we\n\n[[Page S2537]]\n\nshould be evenhanded. I think the role of our Government is to \nencourage both parties to be committed to this peace process.\n  I think the role of the U.S. Government is to have credibility with \nboth parties and to simply say that this really is the only step that \ncan be taken, and the only step that can be taken is a political \nsettlement.\n  So let me just make it clear, as ranking minority member of this \ncommittee, that this resolution is a terribly important resolution. I \nthank my colleagues for their leadership on this question, but I also \nwant to make it clear that I believe it is important for the U.S. \nSenate to maintain an evenhanded approach and to do everything we can \nto encourage this peace process to go forward, to do everything we can \nto encourage both parties to be a part of this peace process. And I \nbelieve that is what this resolution does.\n  I will reserve the remainder of the time on our side. I will ask my \ncolleague, Senator Wyden from Oregon, to please manage this bill \nforthwith.\n  I ask unanimous consent that John Bradshaw, a fellow in my office, be \nallowed to be on the floor of the Senate for the rest of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthis resolution, and I yield myself as much time as I might consume.\n  Mr. President, I have had the opportunity, over the last 30 years, to \nvisit Israel on a number of occasions, and I have had a personal \nawareness of the difficult responsibilities that are involved in \nmaintaining the security of one of our best friends in the \ninternational community. As the ranking majority member of the \nSubcommittee on Near East Affairs for the Foreign Relations Committee, \nI have a few comments that I would like to make in regard to this \nmatter and in support of this resolution, of which, as I said, I am a \ncosponsor.\n  Yasser Arafat and other senior Palestinian leaders have threatened \nrepeatedly to declare a Palestinian state on May 4. That was the \noriginal deadline for the completion of the Oslo peace process. It is \nimportant to note that there are many commitments that have not been \nfulfilled by the Palestinian Authority, many deadlines that have not \nbeen met.\n  Mr. Arafat s ultimate objective is the creation of a Palestinian \nstate, but he seems to be overlooking a number of obligations in the \npeace process which have not been met by the Palestinian Authority. Mr. \nArafat is essentially saying that regardless of the fact that prior \ncommitments have not been honored, he will declare an independent \nstate.\n  Along with other difficult issues such as the status of Jerusalem, \nrefugees, and water rights, the issue of a Palestinian state should be \ndetermined in the final status negotiations between Israel and the \nPalestinians. And that was clearly called for, I believe, in the Oslo \nagreement.\n  Recognizing the security threat posed to Israel from a self-contained \nPalestinian entity, President Reagan wisely enunciated the U.S. policy \nof opposing the creation of a Palestinian state. Behind President \nReagan's policy on Palestinian statehood was his correct understanding \nthat Israel, in order to ensure its own security, needed to be a \ncentral participant in determining how and in what form a Palestinian \nstate would come into existence. The Reagan policy has endured since \n1982 and has served the interests of the United States, of Israel, and \nof all other earnest supporters of peace in the Middle East. But the \nwinds of change have been blowing in the past year.\n  The First Lady of our country was quoted in the New York Times in May \nof 1998 as stating, ``It will be in the long-term interests of the \nMiddle East for Palestine to be a state.'' President Clinton's trip to \nGaza last December added a great deal of momentum to Palestinian \nstatehood.\n  In other parts of the world, implicit policy shifts and diplomatic \novertures may pass without much notice. But we have to remember that \nIsrael is in one of the most dangerous and unstable regions of the \nworld.\n  Since the beginning of the Oslo process, for example, in 1993, Israel \nhas lost more than 280 of its citizens to terrorist violence. That is a \nproportion of the Israeli population that would equal 15,000 Americans \nlosing their lives. It is not an inconsequential number, but a very \nserious number. Those Israeli casualties have come through over 1,000 \nterrorist attacks, and the death toll in the five years since Oslo is \ngreater than in the 15 years before the Oslo process was initiated. So \nit is important for us to note that this is not an inconsequential \nmatter. It is, as a matter of fact, a very serious situation that \ndemands our attention.\n  As Israel faces these threats, it must determine finally what steps \nin the peace process preserve and enhance its security and what steps \ndo not. American policy has been most successful in the region when it \nhas respected the role of Israel in this process.\n  The role of Israel as a respected, necessary component of the process \nis at odds with the idea of a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian \nstate, and such a declaration would undoubtedly upset future peace \ntalks and introduce a destabilizing element into Middle Eastern \npolitics.\n  The administration has said that it opposes unilateral acts by either \nside in the peace process. But neutral statements are not good enough \nwhen it comes to supporting a friend like Israel in this dangerous \nregion of the world.\n  Our leadership must be more consistent and forthright in opposition \nto the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state. As a result, I \nbelieve that the U.S. Senate should go on record as saying that it is \nimproper and inappropriate to declare a Palestinian state unilaterally. \nThis resolution should be a signal that this country will not recognize \na unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state.\n  This is a matter of great concern to us as a Nation for our own \nnational interests. It is a matter of grave concern to us because we \nappreciate freedom-loving people around the world, and we understand \nthe very serious threat to the security of Israel that an inappropriate \ndetermination of this issue could represent. When countries decide to \ntry to reach agreements as a result of understandings similar to those \npresented in the Oslo accords, we have to make sure that they are \nsimply not a cover for what would otherwise be a unilateral assertion \nof the rights of one individual or one individual group against \nanother.\n  It is with that in mind, in reviewing my own experience and the \nhistory of Israel, acknowledging the difficult task of security Israel \nfaces, that I have cosponsored this resolution.\n  Rather than eradicate terrorist infrastructure in Palestinian \nterritory, the Palestinian Authority apparently has maintained its \nrevolving door policy in detaining terrorists. Over 20 prominent \nterrorists have been released since President Clinton's visit to Gaza \nin December 1998. The Israeli Government reports that at least 12 \nwanted fugitives, including several who have killed American and \nIsraeli citizens, are known to be serving in the Palestinian police.\n  At times, Mr. Arafat has threatened to cross out the peace accords \nand unleash a new uprising against Israel. He has described the peace \naccords as a temporary truce. The Palestinian Authority's official \nmedia arm, the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation, consistently \nbroadcasts incitement against Israel, including a children's program \nwhere martyrdom as ``suicide warriors'' is glorified. Mr. Arafat has \nnot been helpful in resolving Israeli MIA cases, including the case of \nZachary Baumel, missing since 1982.\n  This in not behavior of a responsible partner in the search for \npeace. The United States should be demanding full accountability for \nthese violations of the Oslo Accord.\n  Too often, we have been seen as pressuring our friends and rewarding \nthose who undermine the peace process, both in our dealings with the \nPalestinian Authority and our diplomacy throughout the Middle East.\n  Palestinian violations of the Wye Accord: In spite of Palestinian \nviolations of the Wye Accord, the latest agreement in the peace \nprocess, State Department spokesman James Rubin said Palestinian \nleaders had ``worked hard'' to fulfill their commitments. Rubin then \nemphasized ``It is the Israelis who have not fulfilled any of their \nPhase\n\n[[Page S2538]]\n\nTwo obligations by failing to pull back the further redeployment as \nrequired by Phase Two'' (January 6, 1999).\n  Iran poses a military and terrorist threat to Israel: Iran's \nballistic missile and weapons of mass destruction programs are a direct \nthreat to Israel. The Senate passed the Iran Missile Proliferation \nSanctions Act (H.R. 2709) to sanction missile proliferation to Iran by \na 90-4 vote last year, but the President vetoed the legislation. Iran \nsupports terrorist groups which have killed Americans and Israelis, yet \nthe Administration waived sanctions last year under the Iran-Libya \nSanctions Act designed to restrict billions of dollars in foreign \ninvestment in Iran's oil and gas fields--dollars which will fund Iran's \nsupport of the enemies of peace in the Middle East.\n  Lack of United States leadership in Iraq: Saddam Hussein is the chief \nterrorist of a terrorist government committed to the destruction of \nIsrael. The Iraqi president has provided nothing but provocation for \nover a year and international support for the sanctions regime is \neroding. An inconsistent administration policy on Iraq over the last \nfive years has undermined our efforts to bring about a change of \ngovernment in Baghdad.\n  Syria continues to harbor Hezbollah terrorists: Syria provides safe \nhaven to Hezbollah terrorists which wage an almost constant low-grade \nwar with Israel. Hezbollah killed four Israelis in southern Lebanon on \nFebruary 28, including a brigadier general, the highest ranking Israeli \nofficer to be killed in Lebanon in 17 years. I have sponsored \nlegislation to sanction the Syrian Government for its support of \nterrorism, but the administration has opposed the bill for the past 2 \nyears.\n  I urge its passage in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, how much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes 33 seconds.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am going to speak for a few minutes, and then I am \ngoing to yield some of our time to the Senator from New Jersey, the \ncosponsor of this resolution who has very strong feelings on this \nmatter as well. We appreciate him coming over, as well, this morning.\n  Mr. President, a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood is \nirresponsible political brinkmanship, a provocative act that literally \ndares the State of Israel to respond, and it directly contravenes the \nspirit of the historic Oslo accords.\n  Six years ago, at those accords, the Israeli and Palestinian people \ntook significant steps towards achieving peace and stability in the \nMiddle East. Together there was a commitment to work and cooperate to \nproduce a lasting peace through open and honest negotiations.\n  Despite that very promising beginning, the peace process is now on \ndangerously thin ice. The greatest risk to stability in the Middle East \ntoday is a repeated threat by Palestinian leaders to unilaterally \ndeclare statehood once the historic Oslo accords expire on May 4. Not \nonly would such a declaration run counter to the spirit of the accords, \nbut it would truly send a chilling message to all those who want \nmeaningful peace in the Middle East.\n  That meaningful peace is why Senator Brownback and I in our \nbipartisan resolution today have garnered the support of 95 Members of \nthe U.S. Senate to stand in strong opposition to a unilateral \ndeclaration of a Palestinian state. We believe that step would \nconstitute an ill-conceived plan that would truly short circuit the \npeace process. It would be bad news to all those who value stability in \nthe Middle East.\n  The question of achieving Palestinian statehood while maintaining \nIsrael's security lies at the heart of the conflict between Israel and \nthe Palestinian people. It is not going to be resolved overnight with a \npress release. It is going to take careful face-to-face negotiations \nand real commitment from both sides.\n  Both Israeli and Palestinian leaders made a commitment in the Oslo \naccords to go forward with the negotiated process. Chairman Arafat said \nso himself in a letter to Prime Minister Rabin in 1993. In his own \nwords, he said, ``All outstanding issues relating to permanent status \nwill be resolved through negotiations.'' He needs to be held to this \npromise. Israel has held up its end of the bargain. Mr. Arafat must do \nthe same.\n  A rash move such as unilateral declaration would derail these \nnegotiations and risk a dangerous escalation of this conflict. This \nsheer defiance of both the Oslo accords and the peace process would be \nthe diplomatic equivalent of drawing a line in the sand, which invites \na response and a potential escalation of this conflict.\n  On the playground, fights begin when the schoolyard bully balances a \nstick on his shoulder and dares someone to knock it off. A unilateral \ndeclaration of statehood employs the same kind of school-yard \nbullying--it dares the State of Israel to respond. And when Israel does \nrespond by taking reasonable and necessary steps to ensure its \nsecurity, these actions would be used as an excuse to further escalate \nthis conflict.\n  How long would it be before we have Israeli defense forces and \nPalestinian militiamen standing eyeball to eyeball across the disputed \nboarder waiting for the other to blink, if there is a unilateral \ndeclaration of statehood?\n  How long before tensions rise so high that the smallest spark ignites \nmore violence?\n  How long before we are faced again with the disturbing images where \nboth Palestinian and Israeli mothers are shown mourning their children \nslain in some senseless act of violence?\n  The people of the Middle East have been down that road before. They \nhave tried the old ways in resolving conflict through violence and \nbloodshed. Now they want the opportunity to use peaceful negotiation to \nresolve their differences. Let us not sabotage the prospect of peaceful \nresolution with a unilateral declaration. The Oslo peace process is a \nvaluable opportunity to begin healing centuries-old wounds. A \nunilateral declaration of statehood would only reopen those old wounds \nand eventually lead to yet more bloodshed.\n  No one wants to see diplomats being replaced by armed soldiers. No \none wants to see open dialog give way to angry threats. The peace \nprocess will be far better served by an open hand extended in \nfriendship than by a fist clenched in anger.\n  Mr. President, the resolution that we will be voting on today is \nvitally important to keep the peace process moving forward. With \noverwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate, we have the opportunity \nto send a clear, unequivocal message that we stand united in our \nopposition to a unilateral declaration of statehood. This resolution \nwill hopefully make Palestinian leaders think twice about scrapping the \npeace process.\n  I am pleased that the President of the United States indicated his \nopposition to a unilateral declaration of statehood. The reason so many \nMembers of the Senate join us today in this bipartisan resolution is we \nwish to drive this message home even further.\n  The President is going to be meeting with Chairman Arafat in several \nweeks to discuss this important issue. By the Senate making this \nunequivocal assertion this morning, we can strengthen his hand as he \ngoes forward using the Oslo peace process to make sure that there are \nno end runs around the critically needed negotiations.\n  I am optimistic that a peaceful resolution can be found in the Middle \nEast. Last month, Israeli and Palestinian authorities committed \nthemselves to try to change the images they have of each other and to \nbreak through the mistrust that has divided them for so long.\n  They decided to exchange columns in each other's newspapers and to \nhold joint briefings for Israeli and Palestinian journalists. These are \npositive steps toward peace, and I'm hopeful to see more of this kind \nof cooperation in the Middle East.\n  But even an incurable optimist like me knows that it would be \ndifficult to take further positive steps after a bad-faith attempt to \nunilaterally declare independence.\n  Palestinian statehood is a complex issue that must be dealt with \ncarefully. It cannot be resolved through force or fiat. The prospect of \npeace in the Middle East is just too important to risk in a game of \npolitical chicken. If the Palestinian leadership is truly serious about \npeace, they will abandon the prospect of unilateral statehood.\n\n[[Page S2539]]\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I am very proud to join with Senator Brownback, \nSenator Wyden, and my other colleagues in offering this resolution. I \nstrongly support S. Con. Res. 5 and urge all of my colleagues in the \nSenate to adopt it.\n  S. Con. Res. 5 states not only our opposition to a unilateral \ndeclaration of a Palestinian state; it also urges the President of the \nUnited States to make very clear the opposition of this Government to \nsuch a unilateral action.\n  It is fair to state that the peace process in the Middle East has \nreached a critical point. Since the signing of the Wye River agreement, \nthere has in truth been little progress. Some predicted that with the \npassage of the January 29 implementation date, the agreement might \nfail. All parties have a common interest that the Wye Plantation \nagreement not fail because the consequences would be enormous. The \narguments for success remain overwhelming.\n  First, only implementation of the agreement will allow the parties to \nmove to talks on final status, and only talks on final status hold the \npromise of ending this decades-old dispute.\n  Second, only implementation of the agreement will allow the parties \nto build of the basic elements of trust and confidence that are \nrequired for any complete and final agreement.\n  And finally, only a successful agreement will contribute to stability \nin the region, and bring an end to the use of the Palestinian dispute \nto fuel other conflicts.\n  Fifty years of negotiating for greater peace in the Middle East has \ntaught us one lesson, peace requires' both words and deeds. Any deed \nthat runs contrary to written agreements has enormous consequences.\n\n  We have also learned through these 50 years that progress may be \nunsteady, but it is certain. It has been a very long road from Golan \ndisengagement of the Syrians, to a Sinai agreement, to Egyptian peace, \nto the Wye Plantation, following Oslo. There were moments when it \nappeared it might come to an end, but it has been continuous. The \nprocess does work, and it yields results. Abandoning the peace process \nnow by a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood runs contrary \nto everything we have learned. It is contrary not only to the interests \nof the peace process of Israel and the United States, but ironically, \nin the long term contrary to the interests of the Palestinians \nthemselves.\n  I believe the consequences would be enormous: The destabilization of \nthe peace process would perhaps be irrevocable; second, the declaration \nis almost certain to lead to renewed bloodshed and frustration--people \nwould believe the peace process would never be resumed. And, third, \ntragically, it may damage the interests of the U.S. Government in the \nsupplemental aid package that is part of the Wye River agreement, and \nthe hope of economic progress on the West Bank and Gaza so the \nPalestinian people themselves believe there is a dividend in the peace \nprocess and their quality of life. It would be extremely difficult to \nreturn to the Congress and argue for that supplemental aid package, \nincluding funds for the Palestinians, if the peace process has been \nabandoned and a Palestinian state unilaterally declared.\n  Mr. President, both parties committed themselves to a continuous \nbilateral process of negotiation. In September 1993, Yasser Arafat said \nto then-Prime Minister Rabin, ``All outstanding issues relating to \npermanent status will be resolved through negotiations.'' That was not \na simple statement of fact. It was a promise. It is on that promise \nthat Israel entered into the Wye agreement. It is on that promise that \nthe United States has lent its good offices. It is on that basis that \nIsrael recognized the Palestinian Liberation Organization and began \nthese negotiations.\n  A unilateral act by the Palestinians on statehood would undermine \nthis process perhaps irrevocably. I urge my colleagues' support of this \nresolution.\n  Just as importantly, I urge Chairman Arafat to consider these \nconsequences. Whatever frustration he may feel, whatever disappointment \nthey all feel that the deadline of January 29 has passed, I urge \nChairman Arafat to remember that while progress has been unsteady, it \nhas continued. This process will go forward. Do not abandon it. The \nIsraeli elections may have caused a delay, but a new Israeli Government \nwill remain committed to the peace process no matter who is elected. \nReject the advice of abandoning peace. Reject the temptation of a \nunilateral declaration of statehood. Await the outcome of the Israeli \nelections and then let us return to the only peace process that \nguarantees the Israeli and the Palestinian people final determination \nthrough permanent status talks.\n  That is the process that is now before us. I thank my colleagues for \noffering this resolution. I thank Senator Wyden for yielding me time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, could I inquire how much time is remaining \non this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio has 7 minutes 6 seconds.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this \nconcurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. 5. This resolution expresses the \nstrong disapproval of the U.S. Senate to any proposed or contemplated \nPalestinian state that is created, not through negotiation, but rather \nthrough unilateral declaration on the part of the Palestinian \nAuthority.\n  I strongly support and have cosponsored this resolution because I \nbelieve in the Middle East process. Brave Israeli leaders have taken \ngreat risks for peace. So have Arab leaders. And so, importantly, have \nthe people of the Middle East. I believe this process still offers the \nmost promising approach for an enduring peace in the region.\n  Palestinian Chairman Arafat made a fundamental commitment at Oslo \nthat, in his words, ``all outstanding issues relating to permanent \nstatus will be resolved through negotiations.'' I am here on the Senate \nfloor today to call for a reassertion of that very policy. To move away \nfrom the Oslo process and take refuge in unilateralism would put the \nwhole region at risk of destabilization. That is simply the wrong \ndirection. I do not believe that a lasting peace can be built on the \nbasis of unilateral declarations. Negotiations remain the single best \nway to secure the two pillars of a secure peace--addressing Israel's \nsecurity concerns and creating a sustainable framework for preserving \nthe human rights and political self-determination of the Palestinians.\n  The American people want security for Israel in the context of human \nrights for Palestinians. A unilateral declaration of independence by \nthe Palestinian Authority would only delay the fulfillment of these \ngoals. So I am proud to join my colleagues today in supporting this \nvery important resolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 5 and announce my opposition to the unilateral \ndeclaration of a Palestinian state.\n  Palestinian statehood is an issue that has been left to be resolved \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians during permanent status \nnegotiations. Nevertheless, Chairman Yasser Arafat has stated on a \nnumber of occasions his intention to declare a Palestinian state on May \n4, 1999. This action would seriously undermine the continuation of the \nOslo peace process. Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has stated \npublicly that he would respond to such a unilateral declaration by \nannexing parts of the West Bank. Such a chain of events would surely \nmark a major setback and probably the end of the peace process.\n  In his September 9, 1993 letter to the late Prime Minister Yitzhak \nRabin, Chairman Arafat writes that ``all outstanding issues will be \nresolved through negotiations.'' The unilateral declaration of a \nPalestinian state would clearly violate this commitment as well as the \nIsraeli-Palestinian Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza \nStrip which was signed in Washington, D.C. on September 28, 1995. The \nagreement states that it is the understanding of the parties involved \nthat permanent status negotiations ``shall cover remaining issues, \nincluding: Jerusalem, refugees, settlements, security arrangements, \nborders, relations and cooperation with other neighbors, and other \nissues of common interest'' and further that ``neither\n\n[[Page S2540]]\n\nside shall initiate or take any step that will change the status of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip pending the outcome of the permanent \nstatus negotiations.''\n  Mr. President, this resolution puts the U.S. Senate on record as \nopposing the unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood. It is a \nstatement, in my mind, in support of the peace process and the \ncontinuation of negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis. \nNegotiation and mutual agreement are the only way a true and lasting \npeace can be reached in the Middle East. While a Palestinian state may \nindeed become a reality at some point in the future, it is my hope that \nany such entity would be born from the direct negotiations of the \nIsraeli and Palestinian people and not a unilateral declaration.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, a unilateral statehood declaration by \nchairman Arafat would constitute a gross violation of the Oslo accords, \nin effect ending the peace process. And any state that he might \ndeclare, outside of the peace process, would be illegitimate, \nirresponsible, and wrong.\n  I am pleased to see this initiative has been cosponsored by 90 \nSenators as of this morning. But we must realize that this show of \nsupport grows from a very deep and heartfelt concern. We want peace to \nsucceed, but Chairman Arafat's threat to unilaterally declare a state \nclearly threatens peace.\n  Mr. President, last week in a statement on the Senate floor, I asked \nhow can peace be reached while the Palestinian leadership teaches \nchildren to hate. Today I ask, how can peace be reached when the \nPalestinian leadership threatens to unilaterally impose a final status.\n  I rise today to oppose this threat to the peace process. I hope the \nPresident will join us in making this statement to Chairman Arafat.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, S. Con. Res. 5 expresses congressional \nopposition to a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state and urges \nPresident Clinton to unequivocally assert United States opposition to \nsuch a declaration. I agree with the sponsors of this resolution that \nit would be extremely unwise for the Palestinian Authority to take such \na provocative and destabilizing step.\n  In open forums and behind closed doors the administration has \nexpressed repeatedly its opposition to any unilateral action by either \nPalestinians or Israelis which would predetermine issues reserved for \nfinal status negotiations. There is no doubt that the United States \nfirmly opposes a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state.\n  Such a declaration would be a violation of the principles contained \nin the Oslo Accords, and it could imperil the hard won but fragile \nagreement reached at Wye River. At the signing of the Wye River \nMemorandum, the late King Hussein said, ``we are not marking time, we \nare moving in the right direction.'' A unilateral declaration of a \nPalestinian state would throw the entire process into reverse. It would \nbe a serious mistake.\n  So I support S. Con. Res. 5 as far as it goes, Unfortunately, it does \nnot reflect the inescapable fact that there are two sides to the Middle \nEast Conflict. Just as the Palestinian Authority has fallen short in \nits implementation of its Oslo commitments, so have some Israeli \nGovernment actions exacerbated the condition which have caused some \nPalestinians to demand that the issue of statehood be resolved outside \nthe scope of the Oslo process. Many have lost the hope that was kindled \nby the handshake between Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman Arafat on \nthe White House lawn in 1995. Had the resolution been better written or \nbalanced I could have co-sponsored it.\n  Despite these setbacks, the administration has played a key role in \nkeeping the peace process alive. Congress has been asked to provide \nover a billion dollars in new funding to support implementation of the \nWye River Memorandum. This is funding that we are very hard-pressed to \nfind, but lasting peace in the Middle East is in the strong interest of \nthe United States. Just as we are doing out utmost to bring the parties \ntogether, they need to demonstrate that they are fulfilling their \ncommitments. They must both refrain from taking provocative, unilateral \nactions that would jeopardize the prospects for peace and they must \nboth be willing to take the necessary risks to ensure a safe and \nprosperous future for their people.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor \nof S. Con. Res. 5, a resolution expressing opposition to a unilateral \ndeclaration of a Palestinian state. I am proud to join my colleagues in \nsupporting this resolution\n  We cannot allow the work of the past several years to be swept away \nby unilateral acts such as that threatened by Yasser Arafat. President \nArafat has threatened to declare a Palestinian state by May 4, 1999 if \nthere is no further progress in the Peace Process.\n  Mr. President, this act, in defiance of the Oslo Peace agreements \nsigned by the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Mr. Arafat, can \nonly destabilize the region. It would no doubt precipitate further acts \nand the entire Peace Process, as precarious as it is, could be \nshattered.\n  The only true path to peace is through negotiation with Israel. There \nis no other way to achieve a satisfactory conclusion to this one-\nhundred-year conflict. With the passage of this resolution Congress \nsends the message that if Yasser Arafat declares a Palestinian state on \nMay 4, the United States should not recognize the validity of the \ndeclaration and Congress will strongly oppose it.\n  Mr. President, if there is to be peace between Israel and the \nPalestinians, it will be accomplished through peaceful negotiations \nbetween the two parties, not through unilateral acts.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to offer my strong support to the \nresolution. For a long time now, the Palestinians and the Israelis have \nbeen negotiating a peace, based on compromise and a vision of peaceful \ncoexistence.\n  These negotiations have been difficult, for both sides. But, they \nhave progressed steadily towards an extraordinary agreement. One which \ncould be a model for all the world to marvel.\n  A unilateral declaration by Chairman Arafat would destroy the \nadvances he has made for his people in their quest for peaceful \npolitical and geographic autonomy. It is provocative, and it goes \nagainst every tenet of every accord to which he has affixed his \nsignature. It would destroy any goodwill he has developed in this body \nbecause of his good faith negotiation with the Israeli Government.\n  I am proud that this body has the courage to stand up and voice its \nopposition to any unilateral moves by Mr. Arafat. I hope that he can \nsee through the political fog he has created by floating this \nsituation, which was made obviously in an effort to pander to radical \nelements.\n  As an original cosponsor of this resolution, I call upon all my \ncolleagues to send a clear message that we could not accept such a \ndeclaration.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have no doubt that S. Con. Res. 5 is a \nwell-intentioned effort by the members of this body to express their \nopposition to any unilateral declaration of statehood by the \nPalestinians. I support that position--such a reckless action on the \npart of the Palestinians would be disastrous to the Middle East peace \nprocess-- but I cannot support this resolution. It is, in my opinion, \nill-timed and unnecessary.\n  The Administration has made clear its opposition to any unilateral \naction that would preempt the negotiations between Israel and the \nPalestinian Authority. But the Palestinians are not the only players in \nthis drama. The Israelis are also partners in the peace process, and \nhave an equal stake in refraining from provocative and destabilizing \nactions. This resolution, however, does not address the \nresponsibilities of the Israelis.\n  If Yasser Arafat has not yet gotten the message that the United \nStates is opposed to a unilateral declaration of statehood, this non-\nbinding resolution is not sufficient to drive the point home. But it \ncontains the kind of rhetoric that could be used by those who wish to \nfurther disrupt the peace process. Given the tensions inherent in the \nefforts to negotiate a peaceful settlement between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians, the Congress should not take up what amounts to little \nmore than a self-serving resolution that may do more harm than good.\n  If the United States Congress wishes to make a meaningful \ncontribution to\n\n[[Page S2541]]\n\nthe Middle East peace process, we should, first, keep pressure on both \nsides to negotiate in good faith and to avoid provocative words or \nactions, and second, we should act promptly when the Administration \nsends to Congress its request for supplemental appropriations to \nimplement the Wye River peace agreement. In this way, we can \ndemonstrate our commitment to peace in the Middle East without adding \nfuel to an already incendiary situation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for Senator \nBrownback's legislation, Senate Concurrent Resolution 5, regarding the \nunilateral declaration of a Palestinian state. As an original cosponsor \nof this legislation, I believe it is important for the Senate to \nindicate its opposition to any unilateral declaration of statehood by \nthe Palestinian Authority before Chairman Yasser Arafat's visit to the \nUnited States to meet with President Clinton.\n  The legislation underscores three important points:\n  First, the final political status of the territory controlled by the \nPalestinian Authority can only be determined through negotiations and \nagreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\n  Second, any attempt to establish Palestinian statehood outside the \nnegotiating process will invoke the strongest congressional opposition.\n  Third, the President should unequivocally assert United States \nopposition to the unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state making \nclear that a declaration would be a grievous violation of the Oslo \naccords and that a declared state would not be recognized by the United \nStates.\n  As we all know from reading the newspapers, this legislation is \ndirected toward those Palestinians, including Chairman Yasser Arafat, \nwho have made statements about the possibility of issuing a unilateral \ndeclaration on or about May 4 of this year. Last month a top \nPalestinian official said, ``We are moving forward in our preparation \nfor the day, May 4th, the date of the declaration of the Palestinian \nstate that would encompass a portion of Jerusalem. The cabinet \nannounced that ``At the end of the interim period [the Palestinian \nAuthority] shall declare the establishment of a Palestinian state on \nall Palestinian land occupied since 1967, with Jerusalem as the eternal \ncapital of the Palestinian state.''\n  On several occasions over the past year, the Clinton administration \nhas refused to express U.S. opposition to the unilateral declaration of \nan independent Palestinian state, and has left it an open question as \nto whether the United States will recognize a unilaterally declared \nPalestinian state. As an example, his intention to establish a \nPalestinian state with its capital in Jerusalem. Unfortunately, the \nPresident may have only encouraged this course when he said: ``[T]he \nPalestinian people and their elected representatives now have a chance \nto determine their own destiny on their own land.''\n  This legislation is intended to set the record straight. Despite the \nPresident's ambiguous statements, there should be no confusion among \nthe Palestinian leadership about where the United States Congress \nstands on the issue of a unilateral declaration of statehood.\n  Mr. President, this matter brings to the fore another issue in which \nthe administration's mixed signals and inconsistent policy in the \nMiddle East has enabled false hopes and fantasy to flourish. I am \nreferring to the policy of the United States regarding the status of \nJerusalem.\n  With support from 90 percent of the members in both Houses, in 1995, \nCongress passed the Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act, the principle \nfeature of which was the requirement to establish an American embassy \nin Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999. Another key element of the \nlegislation, which the administration has repeatedly refused to \nacknowledge, is the statement of U.S. policy regarding Jerusalem. The \nlegislation states: ``It is the policy of the United States that \nJerusalem is the capital of Israel.'' Despite that the legislation is \nnow law, the Clinton State Department has repeatedly refused to \nacknowledge this policy.\n  So, with the acquiescence of the Clinton administration, the \nPalestinian Authority has chosen to ignore American law and continues \nto hold out hope that the United States will recognize Jerusalem as the \ncapital of a Palestinian state, perhaps even the capital of a state \nestablished unilaterally.\n  This will not happen.\n  The United States Congress has a clear policy regarding Jerusalem. \nToday, we are stating our position regarding the unilateral \nestablishment of a Palestinian state. While the administration's \npolicies are confusing, ambiguous statements of general support for \neverything on the table, the Congress is clear and direct. No \nunilateral declaration. No Palestinian sovereignty over Jerusalem.\n  I commend Senator Brownback and my colleague from Arizona, Matt \nSalmon, who is the principal sponsor of this legislation in the House \nof Representatives.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this resolution, and I \nurge the Senate to approve it. I oppose the unilateral declaration of \nan independent Palestinian state. Such a provocative action would \nviolate the letter and the spirit of the peace process in the Middle \nEast, and could well be an irreparable blow to that process.\n  The issue of an independent state is clearly one of the most critical \nissues in the peace process, and just as clearly, it is an issue that \nmust be negotiated by the parties themselves.\n  I hope very much that Chairman Arafat will be successful in resisting \nthe pressure he is under to take this irresponsible action. The peace \nprocess is too important, and the parties have come too far, to allow \nthis to happen.\n  It is very important for all of us in the United States who care \nabout peace in the Middle East to make our views clear on this \nfundamental issue. I commend the Senate leadership of both parties for \nenabling the Senate to go on record today in strong opposition to any \nsuch unilateral declaration.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, when the Prime Minister of Israel, the late \nYitzhak Rabin, and the Chairman of the Palestine Liberation \nOrganization, Yasser Arafat, signed the Declaration of Principles on \nSeptember 13, 1993, they each made a commitment to put nearly a century \nof conflict behind them and agreed to settle their differences through \nnegotiation.\n  Since then, the process they set into motion has had its ups and \ndowns. Many innocent lives have been lost at the hands of those opposed \nto peace and reconciliation. But progress has been sustained because \nboth sides have ultimately demonstrated a willingness to resolve their \ndisputes at the bargaining table.\n  Were Chairman Arafat now to take the unilateral step of declaring a \nPalestinian state, I fear that it would threaten the progress that has \nbeen made over the past 6 years.\n  The Declaration of Principles stipulates that the toughest issues--\nJerusalem, refugees, settlements, borders--are to be resolved by \npermanent status negotiations. It is dangerous to argue that the end of \nthe interim period on May 4 gives either side the right to decide an \nissue that both sides agreed to negotiate.\n  Any action or proclamation by either side that prejudges the outcome \nof negotiations can only hurt the cause of peace. it invites the other \nside to respond in-kind, and it serves only to delay a lasting peace \nsettlement.\n  Mr. President, last August, I had the opportunity to meet with the \nChairman Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu. At the request of \nPresident Clinton, I discussed with them some of the key issues in \ndispute.\n  Contrary to what many were saying at the time, I found both leaders \nto be committed to the peace process. Not many believed that these two \nindividuals would overcome the profound differences over territory and \nsecurity that were holding up an agreement on the second redeployment. \nWith the Wye River Memorandum, both leaders proved that negotiations \ncan resolve disputes, if both sides share the same goal.\n  It is in that spirit that I trust that the Palestinian leadership \nwill not proceed with a unilateral declaration of statehood.\n  I am confident that they will realize that their aspirations can best \nbe realized through a commitment to the principles of negotiation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I yield time to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S2542]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my expectation--and really \nprediction--that this resolution will pass the U.S. Senate by \noverwhelming numbers and that it should be heeded by any of those who \nwish to have a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state. My \ncolleagues have already articulated the point that Chairman Arafat has \nmade a commitment to determine issues such as the Palestinian state by \nnegotiations, and we would expect that commitment to be preserved. \nThere are very delicate matters involving Israel and the Palestinian \nAuthority with respect to withdrawals, and there are major risks in \nceding as much real estate, as much ground, as much territory as Israel \nhas ceded to the Palestinians.\n  There is an element of great emotionalism, over and above the issue \nof security. I recall the famous handshake on the White House lawn on \nSeptember 13, 1993, with the expectation of working out a permanent \npeace in the Middle East.\n  In December of 1993 I had occasion to travel with a congressional \ndelegation and visited Egypt. President Mubarak arranged a meeting with \nChairman Arafat at that time, where he renewed his pledges to live by \nthe Oslo accord.\n  A few weeks later I was in Israel, in Jericho, and found for sale at \nthe roadside stands, flags of the Palestinian state. The ink was barely \ndry on the Oslo accords and the handshakes were barely unclasped on the \nWhite House lawn before people were talking about a Palestinian state \nand there was, in fact, the Palestinian flag.\n  I recall visiting in Amman, Jordan, in the mid-1980s, awaiting a \nmeeting with King Hussein and looking at a map of the Mideast. Where I \nexpected to see the designation of ``Israel,'' there was the \ndesignation of ``Palestine.'' I mentioned that to King Hussein, the \nleader of Jordan, and had the comment that ``it was an old map.'' Well, \nmaps can be redrawn. But for years the State of Israel was not \nrecognized in the Arab world. Instead of having ``Israel,'' which had \ncontrol of the land and was the sovereign controlling that land, \n``Palestine'' was still noted on the maps.\n\n  There is also the issue of a very substantial appropriation which is \nbeing sought from the Congress of the United States. I am not saying \nthat appropriation would be conditioned on the Palestinian Authority \nabiding by the terms of the Oslo accord with respect to settling the \ndeclaration of a Palestinian state by negotiations, but certainly it \nwould be in mind, it would be a factor to be considered, with many, \nmany others.\n  So, in sum total, there is much to recommend restraint by the \nPalestinian Authority and to leave this issue, as to whether there will \nbe a declaration or not, to final status negotiations in accordance \nwith the terms of the Oslo accord.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my colleague from Ohio for yielding the \ntime. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, Senator Lautenberg, the Senator from New \nJersey, is interested in speaking on this as well. He is not here at \nthis time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of our time be allowed to \ngo to Senator Lautenberg. I believe it is just under 5 minutes. It is \nmy understanding there will be a vote on this measure at 2 o'clock or \nsometime in that time vicinity, so he would have to get here, \nobviously, fairly soon. But I ask unanimous consent the remainder of \nour time be allocated to Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I understand there is a unanimous \nconsent agreement that says I should be permitted to use the remainder \nof the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution, \nof which I am an original cosponsor, opposing Palestinian statehood as \na unilateral declaration. We need to send an unequivocal signal of the \nSenate's opposition to any unilateral declaration of Palestinian \nstatehood.\n  I know the players here very well. I knew Israeli Prime Minister \nRabin. I considered him a close friend. I had a lot of contact with him \nover a period of more than 20 years. I got to know Chairman Arafat when \nhe came to Washington, and I have seen him in Jericho. I have seen him \nhere several times; I have seen him in New York. When they got \ntogether, shook hands, and signed the Declaration of Principles that \nwas negotiated in Oslo, it was a tremendous historical moment.\n  The Oslo accords set in motion a process to end violence and bring \npeace to this troubled region. Despite obstacles and delays, Israel and \nthe Palestinians have come a long way down the road to a better future. \nLast year, with the peace process stalled, President Clinton brought \ntogether Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat for intensive \ndiscussion on a plan that would achieve further progress in \nimplementing the Oslo accord. With the help of a good friend to the \nUnited States, to Israel, and to the Palestinians--King Hussein of \nJordan--President Clinton convinced the parties to sign the Wye River \nagreement.\n  Both Israel and the Palestinians implemented their commitments in the \nfirst phase of the Wye memorandum. Unfortunately, the process remains \nstalled there, though important cooperation between Israeli and \nPalestinian representatives continues.\n  President Clinton has rightly urged the parties to respect and \nimplement the Wye memorandum, despite the pending election in Israel. \nProspects for further implementation are good, in my view, even if this \nis not happening right now.\n  The point is that, on the whole, the Oslo framework is still intact. \nFinal status negotiations to resolve the most challenging issues should \nbegin within a matter of months. In that context, the resolution we are \nconsidering today makes a vital point. The Palestinians must not \njeopardize the peace process by unilaterally declaring statehood, as \nChairman Arafat and other Palestinian leaders have suggested. By \nadopting this resolution, we send an unequivocal message that, \ncertainly as far as the Congress is concerned, the United States would \nnot recognize a unilateral statehood declaration and would instead \ncondemn it as a violation of the Oslo accords.\n  Mr. President, this resolution represents our strong commitment to a \nnegotiated peace in the Middle East. I, on a personal basis, look \nforward to the fact that one day they will put aside violence there and \nthey will get along. It is a necessity; this is not a matter of choice. \nI welcome the overwhelming support that is indicated for this message \non the part of my colleagues, that no unilateral declaration of \nstatehood will receive the support or the encouragement of the United \nStates.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I think this is a terribly important issue \nin that we understand that the bottom line is that threats undermine \nthe peace process. It is that simple. Autonomy has to be determined \nthrough the process of negotiations. We are not talking about \nstatehood. I applaud all of the Members who have joined in cosponsoring \nthis resolution.

The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, under the previous order, I yield \nmyself 10 minutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, there is understandably much \ndiscussion in our country about the ways and means to continue the \nrather extraordinary economic prosperity that has been visited upon our \ngeneration. Theories abound about how to maintain this economic growth \nthat is providing employment, a growing Federal surplus, and a rising \nquality of life in America.\n  It is one thing upon which I suspect we can all agree, as we think \nabout continuing the current economic expansion, that this prosperity \nis built upon a foundation of quality education. Indeed, I would argue \nthat it is the investment of our parents' generation in quality \nschools, rising standards of excellence, attraction of good teachers, \n30 and 40 years ago, that we are now reaping in dividends of \nprosperity. There is no question that in those years our parents \nunderstood that the security of our Nation and our prosperity would be \nno stronger than the investment we made in education.\n  I believe that as our parents recognized the opportunity and made the \ninvestment and that investment yielded these dividends, the problems of \nAmerican education now stand like a dagger at the heart of our economy. \nToo many of our children are now attending schools that would be a \nsource of embarrassment for any Member of this institution. I have \nvisited schools across New Jersey where children meet in hallways, in \ngymnasiums, because there are no longer classes available. The very \nschools that our parents provided for us that helped build this \nprosperity are crumbling around our feet.\n  The GAO has reported that one-third of all schools in America, \nserving 14 million students, are in serious need of repair. Teachers, \nno matter how hard they try, no matter their level of effort, can only \ndo so much with old textbooks and with the dearth of modern technology. \nAll the inventions and services on the Internet in the world won't make \nany difference in American education when only 27 percent of public \nschools are even connected to the Internet. Far too few communities can \nany longer afford the extra curricular activities, the extra hours of \ninstruction that we enjoyed as students ourselves.\n  Across America, school districts are canceling sports activities. The \nclub activities, the tutoring activities, the activities where students \nexcelled a generation ago are being lost, leaving between 5 and 15 \nmillion students left alone at home after school. The reality of the \ntwo-wage-earner family means that millions of these students not only \ndo not have supervision in school or activities but are left alone. \nEven if they did not need the instruction, even if they did not need \nthe socialization or activities, these students are going home, where \nwe are laying the groundwork for drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, \ntruancy, with a direct correlation between students who do not have \nactivities after school and failing grades and dropouts.\n  Local schools are so overwhelmed with these social problems, the \novercrowding, the crumbling schools, sometimes they have no choice but \nsocial promotion, take a student who is failing and send them through \nthe system and on to the streets. The reality of this education debate \nis, there are a lot of good answers, and they are represented by many \nSenators on this floor--efforts to help local communities deal with the \ncost of reconstructing our schools, dealing with the problems of social \npromotion, the problems of rising standards, the problems of getting \nbetter teachers, retaining good teachers.\n\n  What is unique about this education debate is--everybody is right--\nthere is no one good idea. There are no two good ideas. This is a \nproblem of such complexity that is so central to quality of life and \neconomic opportunity in America that succeeding requires everybody's \nbest efforts. What is most important is that it is a debate that \nrequires a competition of the best ideas between Democrats and \nRepublicans and liberals and conservatives.\n  There is no monopoly on creative thinking in dealing with the \nproblems of education in America. Indeed, the underlying legislation, \nthe Education Flexibility Partnership Act, is a good idea, it is a \nsound idea, but it is one idea that in and of itself does nothing about \novercrowding or rising standards or new technology. It is one idea. I \nwill vote for it, and this Senate should enact it. But at the end of \nthe day it leaves us with this question: What do we do about these \nvarieties of other problems?\n  Indeed, can this Senate say at the conclusion of the 106th Congress \nthat we have dealt with educational flexibility, but that is all we \nhave done, and seriously argue that we have dealt with the issue of \neducation in America?\n  Last year, in this Senate, I joined with Senator Coverdell in the \nbelief that we should establish savings accounts to help fund private \nand public education. I believed it was a good idea. But even then, I \nargued, in answer to my own legislation, that if that is all that we \nhave done, we haven't begun to address the problems of education in \nAmerica. I return to that argument today.\n  Consider the dimensions of the problem, if you are to disagree and \nargue that educational flexibility alone will deal with this national \ndilemma. Forty percent of fourth grade students are failing to obtain \nbasic levels of reading; 40 percent of eighth graders fail to obtain a \nbasic level of mathematics. High school seniors across the Nation are \nranked 19th out of 21 industrialized nations in math and science. Of \ncourse, I support legislation for educational flexibility, but I am \nalso here to support the Murray amendment to hire more teachers and \nreduce class size, because we know, according to the Department of \nEducation in their 1998 May report, that one element most directly \nrelating to improved student performance is a reduction of class size \nin the early grades. The Murray amendment is the one answer we know \nwill improve student performance in early grades. The Murray amendment \nwould finish the process we began last year of adding 100,000 new \nteachers in America to reduce class size.\n\n  Indeed, I would have liked to have today added to the efforts of \nSenator Murray with an amendment of my own, and that would have been to \ngive\n\n[[Page S2544]]\n\nsigning bonuses to people who will become teachers. Where our best \ncollege graduates will go to schools most in need, I would have offered \nthem a signing bonus to get them into the classroom immediately.\n  It confronts the reality of the fact that a starting teacher in \nAmerica today could hope to earn, in a public school, $25,000. For a \nsoftware engineer, our leading high-tech companies are offering $50,000 \nto the same person, with a signing bonus. Teachers are prepared to make \nsacrifices because they are dedicated, but how much of a sacrifice? We \nknow they are our most important asset in dealing with the issue of \neducational quality.\n  So, my colleagues, I urge that we all come together to support \neducational flexibility. But I would have liked to have offered my \namendment, which will not be allowed today. I urge my colleagues to \nconsider Senator Murray's amendment, and also Senator Feinstein's to \nend social promotion in our schools--the passing of the problem along \nto the streets because we will not deal with it in the classroom--and \nSenator Bingaman's amendment to help stem the tide of dropouts. \nUnfortunately, one of the most important problems of all--deteriorating \nschools--we won't be able to vote on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank you for yielding me the time. \nI support the underlying legislation but also the amendments being \noffered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I stand before you today in strong \nsupport of Senator Frist's Educational Flexibility Partnership Act. But \nthen again, most of the Senate, and all 50 Governors, Secretary Riley, \nand even the President want this wonderful piece of legislation to pass \ntoday.\n  It is a big day personally for me. Some people are not aware of the \nfact that this effort for flexibility started in Ohio in 1981, when I \ncommissioned a private-sector audit of the department of education to \nmake it more friendly to our school districts. At the same time, it was \ncommand and control. The private-sector management audit came back and \nsaid it was riddled with paperwork, and the shocking thing was that \nhalf the paperwork the department had to do and the schools had to do \nwas as a result of Federal regulations, and we were only getting 6 \npercent of our money from the Federal Government.\n  I recall going to Washington at that time and sitting down with \nSecretary Lamar Alexander and asking him if he could do something about \nit. Unfortunately, he could not. Later on when President Clinton became \nPresident and Dick Riley, a former Governor, became Secretary of \nEducation, in the Goals 2000 legislation he provided for States to take \nadvantage of some flexibility.\n  I want to underscore that a State cannot take advantage of this \nprogram unless they agree themselves to waive their regulations, and in \nsome instances--for example, in Ohio--even waive statutes. This \nprovided an opportunity for school districts to get waivers that, prior \nto Ed-Flex, had to go directly to Washington in order to get a waiver. \nIt allows them to go to their superintendents of public instruction in \ntheir respective States.\n  I am proud that we have had an opportunity to take advantage of this. \nIn Ohio we have 186 schools using a title I waiver, with over half of \nthese schools increasing their proficiency test scores in math and \nscience. Those school districts have taken advantage of waivers in the \nEisenhower grants. As you know, in the Eisenhower grants, 85 percent of \nthe money is supposed to be used for math and science. But in the \nelementary schools, how can a kid learn math or science if they cannot \nread? So as a result of the waiver program, we were able to get waivers \nto allow the money to be spent on reading, and today in those schools \nwe have seen a dramatic increase in the math and science scores as a \nresult of the fact that those schools were able to take advantage of \nthe waiver.\n  There are some people who would argue that we need more \naccountability. I argue that we have accountability in most States. In \nOhio, for example, we have our report cards, not only by districts but \nby individual buildings. With Ed-Flex, a building or a classroom that \ntakes advantage of a waiver has to agree that within a year they will \nreport back on how they are taking advantage of that waiver and whether \nit is making a difference in the classroom.\n  I would say that if I could get every title I school in the United \nStates of America to become an Ed-Flex waiver school, we would have a \nlot more accountability with that title I money that is going into \nthose districts--for those that are concerned about title I.\n  I think this idea is so overwhelming that last year, as chairman of \nthe National Governors' Association, I made Ed-Flex one of my top \npriorities. I recall going to the White House and talking to President \nClinton about it and his indicating that he thought it was a good idea. \nLast year, we almost got it done with the help of Tom Carper, the \nDemocratic Governor of the State of Delaware. Again, we are bringing it \nback to Congress for their consideration.\n  To my Democratic colleagues I say this: There are a lot of ideas that \nhave been proposed here on the floor. My attitude is that they all \ninvolve money. This is not a money bill. Ed-Flex does not require one \nadditional dime from the Federal Government. What it does do is that it \nallows school districts to save the paperwork and the redtape so their \nadministrators can spend time on education, and the teachers can, and \nthey can take more of the money that is coming in from the Federal \nGovernment and put it in the classroom to improve the education of our \nchildren.\n  And if you want to talk about priorities: Rather than 100,000 new \nteachers, I would rather put the money in funding the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Assistance Act or, in the alternative, my \nfavorite: If I had the choice, instead of 100,000 teachers, I would put \nthe money into 0 to 3, or conception to 3, a time in a child's life \nthat is being, quite frankly, neglected in this country, not only by \nthe Federal Government but by the local governments. We can prove that \nif you put money in during that period of time, when it is most \nimportant to the development of a child's ability to learn, you can get \nthe best return on your investment.\n  So let's debate how we want to spend this Federal money and where we \nought to be spending it, but let's not make that part of the debate on \nEd-Flex. We will get to that. We will have that debate. We will look at \nwhat is available and decide how it is to be spent.\n  So today I ask the Members of the Senate to support Ed-Flex. Let's \nhave a clean Ed-Flex bill. Let's get it done. It has made a great \ndifference for the people of Ohio and those States that have taken \nadvantage of it. I think it is long overdue to give the other 38 States \nof this Nation the same opportunities that we have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I first thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding me time \nbut, more importantly, thank him for his tremendous efforts on the \nfloor of this Senate for the last several days. Hour upon hour, he has \nbeen battling to ensure that this education flexibility bill is not \nsimply a blank check to the States but it also has the kind of \naccountability that will be necessary to ensure that this flexibility \nwill result in improved student performance. In fact, it is a battle \nthe Governors urged us to take up because they are as concerned as \nanyone else to ensure that this flexibility is accompanied by \naccountability.\n\n  He has also taken up the fight on two important issues of unfinished \nbusiness. Last year, we appropriated significant amounts of money over \nthe next several years to ensure that we could reduce class size by \nhiring additional teachers. It is now imperative that we authorize that \nappropriation, that we give a sense of continuity, stability, and \nassurance to the local communities that this money, this program, will \nbe in place over time. Second, last year we also went a long way\n\n[[Page S2545]]\n\ntoward developing programs to prevent students from dropping out of our \nschools. Senator Bingaman has been the champion of this program and \nthat is unfinished business that we want to take up.\n  What has happened in the course of this debate is we have moved \nbeyond both Ed-Flex and accountability and some unfinished business to \nembrace other issues. The positive value of that is any debate about \neducation, I believe, is inherently healthy, and I am pleased to do \nthat, but we have taken some steps away from the main topic.\n  There is one issue I particularly want to concentrate on and focus \non. That is an amendment I introduced that would go directly to the \nissue of educational flexibility, directly to the issue of \naccountability. I had hoped to have the opportunity to offer the \namendment as a stand-alone, that I could debate it and engage in a \nprincipled discussion, but because of the parliamentary condition of \nthe floor, because of the unanimous consent, the only opportunity I had \nto have the amendment offered was to do so in conjunction with one of \nSenator Lott's amendment.\n  I am in the awkward position of supporting my amendment and grateful \nthat Senator Lott included it in his amendment, but respectfully \ndiffering with Senator Lott on his proposal with respect to IDEA. What \nSenator Lott is essentially providing to the school districts of \nAmerica is a Hobson's choice, a choice between decreasing class size or \nadditional resources for IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act. I don't think we should present that choice to school \ndistricts. I think we should do all we can to ensure that we properly \nfund IDEA and at the same time we are able to reduce class sizes \nthroughout the country.\n  In fact, I argue that a reduction in class size will materially \nbenefit the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act programs \nthroughout the country because the reality of many schoolrooms is that \nthere are IDEA students in large classrooms. They are not getting the \nattention they need and deserve. At the same time, the other students \naren't getting that type of attention. By reducing class size--and this \nis an amendment that Senator Murray has championed and I salute her--we \nwill help both programs, but ultimately we should be able to find the \nresources to fund both reduced class sizes and also keep up our \ncommitment to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act program.\n  Let me speak specifically about my amendment that goes to the heart \nof Ed-Flex. It goes to the heart of accountability. What it would do is \ninvolve parents, which I think is a topic we have not paid enough \nattention to. I hope in this oncoming reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, we would put a special emphasis on \ninnovative ways of involving parents in the educational process. We \nknow it works. We know it is important. We know that good schools are \nschools not only with robust and intellectually curious children and \ngood teachers, they are those schools that have strong parental \ninvolvement.\n  My amendment would simply require the States to have a comment period \nwith respect to their proposals for educational flexibility. \nSpecifically, ask that parents and other interested parties be allowed \nto comment. These comments would be taken pursuant to State laws. We \nare not trying to create a special unique procedure. We don't want to \nadd to the burden of States, but we want States to listen to the \nparents in their communities when they talk about educational \nflexibility.\n  More than that, we want these comments to be incorporated in the \napplication to the Secretary of Education so that the Secretary \nunderstands not just the perspective of the Governor, but just as \nimportantly--in fact, one might argue more importantly--the perspective \nof parents in the communities of that State.\n  I am pleased to say after spending a great deal of discussion with \nSenator Frist, particularly, we have reached an accommodation \nacceptable to both sides. In fact, it represents a movement on my part \nfrom the amendment I suggested last year which would have required a \nformal 30-day period of comments that would require an evaluation of \nthe comments by the States in terms of their goals for educational \nflexibility and incorporating that in the application. We have decided \nto move closer together in terms of a more streamlined process.\n  I point out that just a few days ago the Committee on Education and \nthe Workforce in the other body, by an overwhelming vote of 30-9, \npassed my amendment of last year requiring a much more rigorous \nparental involvement, a more heavily regulated, if you will, approach \nto the issue.\n\n  In order to have a position in conference that will give us the \nopportunity to discuss this and discuss this with a principle proposal \nalready on the table, I am extremely pleased that this amendment, the \nReed amendment, has been incorporated into Senator Lott's proposal. \nThis Reed amendment is going forward.\n  It also, I might add, follows precedents we established last year \nwith respect to parental involvement, in particular with respect to the \nWorkforce Investment Act and the Reading Excellence Act. I hope this is \nthe beginning of a trend to involve parents directly with the issue of \neducational reform at the local level.\n  I hope it also represents an opportunity that we will follow up in \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act to think about ways we can \nget parents more involved in the education of their youngsters. I also \nadd that the Parent Teachers Association of America supports my \namendment, the Education Trust supports it, the American Federation of \nTeachers and the Center for Law and Education supports this. Also, this \nwas one of the provisions that was pointed out specifically in the \nstatement of administration policy dated March 3 as part of their \nreview of the underlying Ed-Flex legislation.\n  I say with some regret I cannot support Senator Lott's proposal \nbecause I do think it is presenting a Hobson's choice. I think we can \ndo better. I don't think we have to choose between some children versus \nothers. I think we have to recognize that class size will help all \nchildren. It may, in fact, be additionally beneficial to children with \nspecial needs.\n  Again, I think as we all recognize that we have a special \nresponsibility to put our money where our noble words are when it comes \nto the issue of individuals with disabilities and their education in \nthe United States, that requires looking for additional resources \nrather than simply trying to play one off the other in terms of some \nchildren versus other children.\n  I thank, again, Senator Kennedy's leadership and certainly Senator \nFrist and Senator Wyden who have been doing a remarkable job on the \nfloor. I hope at the end of the day we will have a bill we can all \nsupport. There are some provisions, as I outlined, that I opposed, but \nI conclude by strongly supporting my amendment which would give parents \na real say in the educational flexibility plans that emanate from the \nStates.\n  With that, I yield back any time I have to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will be managing the time on our side \nuntil Senator Jeffords arrives. I yield myself 6 minutes and then I \nwill yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, first, I rise in strong support of the Education \nFlexibility Partnership Act. I begin with a brief quote:\n\n       An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.\n\n  Benjamin Franklin stated that in the early years of our Republic.\n  Building upon this statement, I say it is a simple fact--which the \noccupant of the Chair, as a distinguished Governor in a State that has \nseen great economic growth and prosperity and better jobs and more \nopportunity--it is a simple fact that the future is prejudiced in favor \nof those who can read, write, and do math.\n  A good education is a ticket to a secure future in this United \nStates. And obviously, the opposite is equally true. As the earning gap \nbetween brains and brawn grows even larger, almost no one doubts that \nthere is a link between education and the individual's prospects, even \nin this great land of opportunity.\n  Today, the Senate is taking a first step to improve our Nation's \neducational system, because everyone acknowledges that our children are \nthe\n\n[[Page S2546]]\n\nfuture of this country and we must make every effort to provide them \nwith the tools to succeed. Our action provides States with increased \nflexibility to ensure that our students have an even better opportunity \nto succeed. I submit that because we have so many programs at the \nnational level, small and large--and I will allude to the number \nshortly--that if you are looking for a place to reform, maybe you ought \nto start right here.\n  Maybe we ought to look at the whole package of targeted educational \nprograms at the national level and see how far off the mark they really \nare when it comes to helping children in the United States. This takes \nsome of our programs and says that one size doesn't fit all, and \nWashington bureaucrats and interpreters of these various laws don't \nalways know best, so we are going to give local teachers and \nadministrators who know the problems the opportunity to create \nflexibility in terms of how these various programs are used in the \nfield for our children.\n  I want to move ahead to a summary that was given to us by the GAO \nthat, in conjunction with the Budget Committee staff and under the \nleadership of Senator Frist, looked at a whole myriad of U.S. Federal \nprograms to see just what we were doing and what we were not doing. And \nso, Mr. President, I want to inform you that your concern when you were \nGovernor of Ohio of all the bureaucracy and paperwork and missing the \ntarget by Federal programs, if you wondered why, this is why. Our \nNational Government has funded over 86 teacher training programs in 9 \nagencies and offices; 127 at-risk and delinquent youth programs in 15 \nagencies and offices; and over 90 childhood programs in 11 Federal \nagencies and 20 offices.\n  Now, it is quite obvious that the U.S. Government, our committees, \nand our Secretary, are not the know-all and end-all of good education \noccurring in Ohio, New Mexico, Arizona or Massachusetts. How could we \nbe the end-all and the know-all when, essentially, we contribute less \nthan 7 percent of the funding? Now, it almost makes us, standing on the \nfloor speaking so eloquently about what the Federal Government is doing \nwith its money on education, to some extent, borderline unreasonable in \nterms of credibility, because how can you change this big education \nsystem--and I am going to estimate that we are spending $427 billion a \nyear on kindergarten through 12 in all our sovereign States and all the \nschool districts. You tell me how that $200 million or $300 million \ntargeted in some way--Mr. President, a former Governor, tell me how \nthat $200 million or so spread across this land can have a real impact \non a system that is as diverse as America and into which we are \nspending $417 billion and we can't get the job done. It can't be that \nthe million dollars is going to help. It is only that we make it appear \nas if it is going to help. We invent the amendments and the bills, and \nsometimes we even take a poll before we invent them to see what it is \nthe people want.\n  Who can be against more teachers? But if you fund the States with \nmore money for IDEA, the disabled children, which we are already \nobligated to do, it relieves an equal number of dollars for them to use \nfor teachers if they would like. Some are frightened, however, that the \nStates and the schools might not use it for more teachers. They might \nuse just a little piece of it for that because they already might have \nsufficient teachers.\n  It is not a new thing in education that we dreamt up here in \nWashington that we need more teachers in our schools, although it is \nstill not unequivocal as to whether reducing the size to the level we \ncontemplate nationally is what every school system thinks would do the \njob best for their children. That is not decided yet. That is still out \nthere feverishly being tossed around with many other concepts in terms \nof education.\n  So, Mr. President, this is just the beginning--this flexibility--of \nwhat I hope is a real effort by the U.S. Government to reform its own \neducation commitment to our States. We are all saying we want the \nStates to reform, we want them to be more accountable. Well, when the \nbill comes up this year on primary and secondary education, it is my \nhope that we will not do more of the same. It is my hope that we will \nseriously consider a total reform of those programs, because if we are \nasking the States to do better, it is pretty obvious that we can do \nbetter also. As a matter of fact, I believe it is borderline these days \nas to just how much the Federal Government's assistance is really \nraising the education level of our children.\n  I repeat, if I had my way, and we could focus it into the right \nchannels, I would be for more Federal aid to education, not less. But I \nguarantee you, with the myriad of programs, as I have described them, \nspread throughout Government with no accountability, one program to \nanother, I would not be for spending more money to feed that kind of \neducational assistance when I have very serious doubts as to whether it \nhas contributed significantly to helping our young people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from South Dakota was here \nbefore I was. Does he wish to have time on the Democratic side?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we were rotating. I will take the \nprivilege of saying that Senator Kennedy would yield to Senator \nJohnson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I will be brief.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Susan Hansen of my staff be permitted to \nbe on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues, Republican and \nDemocrat, in expressing support for the underlying Ed-Flex legislation \nthat we are taking up today. This legislation recognizes that the final \nthought in how to prioritize educational needs in our school districts \nand our States does not reside exclusively here in Washington. It will \ncommit to a level of innovation that I think is needed in the 50 \nStates, and with the proper accountability, provide for many different \nstrategies designed to improve student achievement all across this \ncountry.\n  However, I think Congress would be remiss if it stopped there. I \nthink there are a number of very constructive amendments being offered \nrelative to this legislation, not least of which is the afterschool \nprogram amendment being offered by the Senator from California, Senator \nBoxer, to provide for what I believe is a commonsense kind of Federal, \nState and local partnership, to provide for an enhanced ability to deal \nwith afterschool programs for children K through 12.\n  This is not a new idea and it is not the province of either \nparticular political party. There has been a tremendous amount of \neffort through the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program \nacross some 46 States today that have afterschool programs of one kind \nor another, in 800 different schools, involving some 190,000 students. \nThis amendment would create the kind of partnership that would not \ninvolve Federal bureaucracy or Federal micromanagement, but would \nprovide some additional resources for our States and our schools to \nexpand afterschool efforts to 1.1 million additional students in the \nUnited States.\n  Our school budgets are strapped. Property taxes that fund school \ndistricts in many of our States are already too high.\n  It is apparent to anyone who has had any discussions with school \nleaders and community leaders and child advocacy leaders that they \nsimply cannot go it alone, that this kind of effort requires a new form \nof partnership.\n  Not least of all, one of the great gains that we have already seen \ndemonstrated by effective afterschool programs in this country has been \na significant reduction in juvenile crime. At a time when we see crime \nrates going down nationally but yet crime rates among children, among \nyoung juveniles, in too many instances going up, there is a need for an \nadditional strategy, an additional partnership to address that crisis.\n  Every study we have presented to the Senate indicates that most \njuvenile crime occurs between 3 o'clock in the afternoon and \ndinnertime. That is when experimentation with drugs, with alcohol, with \nsexual activity, and with gang participation most often occur, it is \nwhen it is initiated, and it is the\n\n[[Page S2547]]\n\ntime when we most need this kind of partnership not just with our \nschools but with other community organizations and civic organizations \nto provide alternative kinds of activities for young people.\n  The studies have already shown that to the degree we have these \neffective programs in place, they have cut juvenile crime by anywhere \nfrom 40 to 70 percent. That is why we have such broad-based support \nfrom national law enforcement and police groups across this country. \nAnd it is why we can make a contrast between the modest expenditure \nrequired to significantly increase these afterschool programs and the \nalternative cost of incarceration. The cost of keeping a young person \nin a juvenile facility and ultimately in a prison equates roughly to \nthe cost of sending them to Harvard for a year. For a much more modest \nexpenditure, we can keep whole communities intact, have the kind of \nresponsible adult supervision, and have the kind of focus in these \nyoung people's lives that they so badly need.\n  I have been holding meetings all across my home State of South \nDakota, meeting with parents, with teachers, with law enforcement \nofficials, with child care providers, and the need for expanding after \nschool programs is obvious. More and more families are working. Both \nspouses are in the workplace, neither of them at home, because of the \neconomic necessity of having a two income household. South Dakota has \none of the highest ratios of two-spouse incomes in the Nation. More and \nmore single-parent households as well find themselves confronting the \nlatchkey option with their young people in the family.\n  As a consequence of this very apparent reality, South Dakota. Has \nstruck a bipartisan level of cooperation and understanding about the \nneed for these programs. My Governor, Republican Governor William \nJanklow, has been one of the more forceful advocates of an expanded \nState-local partnership on afterschool programs. I applaud his \nleadership on the issue. He has secured the services of Loila Hunking, \nthe state coordinator for child care services and a long-time Democrat \nactivist, to head up his afterschool program. It has been a model in \nmany ways and reflects what States in other parts of the country have \nbeen doing to bring both sides together to set aside political \npolarization and, instead, to focus on what in fact is in the best \ninterest of our kids and our communities.\n  But it is all too apparent--even though we have been building \nfacilities and afterschool program facilities that can be used for \nafterschool programs, and day-care centers, even though we are scraping \nto find private funds to match local school funds and State funds--that \nthe resources simply are not there, and all too often the communities \nwhere the need is the greatest are the communities that have the least \nfinancial capability of providing for these kinds of programs.\n  So, again, if we can come up with this amendment to authorize \nadequate funding for an afterschool program, we will, make a long \nstride forward not only to anticrime strategy but a pro-education \nstrategy and one that both political parties can rally around. I think \nit compliments our Ed-Flex legislation. It compliments everything else \nthat we are doing here on the floor today.\n  I want to again applaud Senator Boxer, Senator Kennedy, and others \nwho have worked hard to promote this afterschool amendment and the \nunderlying Ed-Flex legislation as well.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six and one-half minutes on your side.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I retain my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first I will yield 10 minutes to the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. I want to \ncongratulate the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Tennessee, \nSenator Frist, for having brought this bill finally to a vote after \nwhat was considerable resistance from the other side and what amounted \nto essentially a blocking of this bill as initiative after initiative \nafter initiative was brought forward from the other side.\n\n  I think you have to look at the context of this bill in the context \nof those amendments from the other side that were offered. The concept \nof this bill is to give local communities, local teachers, local \nprincipals, and local school boards the ability to apply the Federal \nfunds and to be released from the burden, the cost, and the \ninterference of Federal regulations. That is what Ed-Flex is all about.\n  Thus, it is with some irony and significant inconsistency of the \nproposals that we have seen thrown at this bill from the other side do \njust the opposite. They create new program initiatives, almost all of \nwhich have been subject to no hearings, no disclosure in the sense of \nthe congressional process, almost all of which create brand new, \nfederally mandated, programmatic initiatives which tell the local \ncommunities, you must do this in order to get these Federal dollars: \nYou must do this in order to get these Federal dollars. And the \ndirective comes from here in Washington. It says that some group of \nbureaucrats sitting in the Department of Education, or at the White \nHouse, or maybe just the leadership on the other side of the aisle, is \ngoing to tell some school district in New Hampshire, or Vermont, or \nMissouri, or wherever, how to manage their day-to-day activity of \nmanaging the education of children.\n  Those proposals, which are being put forward--whether it is the \n100,000 teachers, the afterschool program, the school building \nprogram--are all fundamentally inconsistent with the underlying purpose \nof this bill, which is to free up the local communities from the burden \nof Federal regulation.\n  More significantly than that, every one of those proposals suggests \nas its funding mechanism taking money from the special education \naccounts, money that is due the special education children of this \nNation under the law that was already passed by this Congress--taking \nthat money and using it for a brand new Federal program instead of \nputting it where it is supposed to be, which is with the special \neducation child through 94-142.\n  Let's review that issue for a second, because it is so critical to \nthis whole debate.\n  We have put forward an amendment on our side that says: Before you \nstart a new program, before you create a new panoply of Federal \nregulations, let's do the job that we said we were going to do for the \nspecial education kids in this country; let's pay, or begin to pay, a \nhigher percentage of the cost of special-education education.\n  When the special education bill was originally passed, the Federal \nGovernment said it was going to pay 40 percent of the cost. It dropped \ndown to where the Federal Government was only paying 6 percent of the \ncost 3 years ago. And that difference, that 34 percent, was having to \nbe picked up by the local taxpayers. The Federal share was having to be \npaid for by the local taxpayer. So that skewed education at the local \ncommunity.\n  So, if the local teacher needed some assistance in their classroom, \nmaybe a teaching assistant, or, if a principal needed an addition onto \nthe school, or needed some new computers, they couldn't buy those kinds \nof things, they couldn't hire that new teacher. Why? Because the \nFederal Government wasn't paying its fair share, its obligated share, \nof the cost of special education. And the local community was having to \ntake local dollars to support the Federal obligation for special \neducation.\n  So what did the other side come forward and suggest? We are not going \nto pay any more money to special education. We are not going to \nincrease that money at all. This administration set up a Federal \nbudget. Instead of new money for special education, it essentially \nflat-funded that program and took the money that was supposed to go to \nspecial education and put it in all these new programs they created.\n  What does the local school district do now? They get hit twice: \nFirst, they get hit by the Federal Government, which refuses to pay for \nthe special education children to the tune of the 40 percent they are \nsupposed to. Then, they get told, if you want to get the dollars from \nthe Federal Government, which is supposed to be coming to you\n\n[[Page S2548]]\n\nfor special education, you have to follow one of these brand new, great \nideas that the President has held a press conference on. You have to \nfollow one of these press conference initiatives, whether it happens to \nbe more teachers, more classroom size, or more afterschool programs.\n  So the local school district, in order to get this money, first loses \nit, and then it is told, ``Oh, but we will give you the money that we \njust took from you, but you are going to have to follow what we want \nyou to do here in Washington.''\n  How arrogant can we get? At what point does the arrogance of this \nadministration stop in the area of education?\n  I do not believe that there is one person in this administration who \ncan name more than maybe one child at Epping Elementary. I do not \nbelieve they have any idea what the child in the Epping Elementary \nSchool needs for education. When that teacher in the Epping Elementary \nSchool walks into that classroom and that teacher knows every child at \nevery desk and knows what the child needs for education and knows that \nthey need more books or more computers or maybe they need another \nteaching assistant, it should be that teacher who makes the decision as \nto what is used to help that child's education. It should not be here \nin Washington that that decision is made. And yet, that is exactly what \nthese proposals suggest: Don't give the local school districts the \nflexibility to spend their own money on special ed, to spend their own \nmoney on general education activities. Instead, force the local school \ndistricts to take up the Federal share of special education costs and \nthen tell the local school districts that because we want you to have \nmore teachers in order for you to get the money which was supposed to \ngo to special ed, you have to apply and take on this new Federal \nprogram.\n  It is total hypocrisy. It is total arrogance. And yet, it is these \nproposals that are coming forward. Fortunately, the people in this \nCongress, at least in the Senate, are going to have a chance to make a \nchoice. They are going to have a chance today, because we are going to \ngive them the option. We are saying that the money last year which was \nappropriated for the teachers' program, $1.2 billion, let's free that \nmoney up so that local school districts can make the choice: Do they \nwant a new teacher or do they want the money to come to the special \neducation accounts?\n  That is the simple choice that comes on the Lott amendment which was \ndrafted by the Senator from Vermont and myself and the Senator from \nTennessee, and it is really an excellent idea. We will find out what \nthe local school districts need more. Do they want the dollars for \nspecial ed, or do they want the dollars for teachers? It is a perfectly \nreasonable proposal, and it is flexibility in the tradition of Ed-Flex.\n  So this amendment, this underlying amendment, about which I have \nheard people on the other side get up and say, oh, I can't support that \nbecause it pits one group of students against another group of \nstudents, well, ladies and gentlemen, the people who are pitting one \ngroup of students against the other group of students is the \nadministration and the people who support these administration \ninitiatives, because what they have done is to say we are going to pit \nthe special ed students, who we are supposed to be funding, against our \nprograms coming from Washington because we are going to take their \nmoney and use it.\n  That is where the real conflict comes. So we are going to give you an \nopportunity. We are going to give you an opportunity to live up to the \nobligations which the Federal Government put on the books back in 1976 \nand has refused to live up to. And we are going to give the communities \nthe option of choosing whether they want a teacher, a program directed \nfrom Washington, designed by Washington, told to them how to operate by \nWashington, or whether they want to free up their local dollars by \ngetting more special ed dollars that the Federal Government was \nobligated to pay in the first place and use those local dollars to \neither, one, hire a teacher; two, buy books, add new computers, add a \nnew classroom, whatever they want to do with it. That is the ultimate \nflexibility.\n  The choice is going to be pretty clear here today as to how you want \nto manage education in this country. You can vote for all these \ndirectives from Washington, all these programs which are made for the \ncreation of press conferences but give the local communities no \nflexibility and no opportunity to make their choices as to how they \nspend the money, or you can vote to give the local communities true \nflexibility by funding an obligation that has been on the books since \n1976 and thus freeing up the dollars for the local community to either \nhire teachers, buy books, add classrooms, or create afterschool \nprograms. I opt for the side of giving local communities, teachers who \nknow their kids, principals who know their schools, parents who know \ntheir children, the opportunity to make decisions on dollars rather \nthan the Federal bureaucracy or even an American President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time back to the floor \nmanager.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  I appreciate the work Senator Jeffords has done.\n  Mr. President, I would like to share just a few thoughts. I have been \ninvolved in education with my children. I have taught, my wife has \ntaught in public school. We care about education. We have school boards \nall over America that care about education. I know one of the school \nboard members in my hometown of Mobile, AL, exceedingly well. His \nabilities and talents will match any Member of this body. He knows a \nlot more about the education going on in his area than we know in this \nbody. Who is to say what is the best way to expend money to improve our \nchildren's education? The thing that counts is that magic moment in a \nclassroom when learning occurs and children are motivated and inspired \nto do better.\n\n  I do not believe this Congress has the ability or has a proven track \nrecord of improvement. We now have a host of amendments. We have 788 \nFederal programs--788. We had an amendment offered yesterday that would \nmean the 789th; it would create a dropout czar for America.\n  I have been involved in local programs to deal with dropouts. \nPrograms like that are happening all over America. It is not going to \nbe solved by some Federal dropout czar.\n  This legislation is precisely what we need. It needs to go out of \nhere clean, not as an appropriation, big Government spending bill, but \na bill that gives flexibility to the schools.\n  The Presiding Officer was Governor. He knows how much benefit was \ngained when welfare reform was accomplished and we gave flexibility to \nGovernors. I think it is time we give flexibility to our State and \nlocal school systems to improve education.\n  I thank the chairman, the Senator from Vermont, for his leadership. \nThis is good legislation. It is time for us to pass it, and we can \ndebate these issues about how further to help education when the \nelementary and secondary education bill comes up, which the Senator \nwill be leading later this month.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today the Senate debates an important bill \ndesigned to facilitate education administration and free more resources \nfor our students. The ``Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999'' \nwould extend the ``Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration \nProgram,'' otherwise known as ``Ed-Flex.'' Ed-Flex allows eligible \nlocal school districts to forgo Federal red tape that consumes precious \neducation resources. In return, States must have sufficient \naccountability measures in place and continue to make progress toward \nimproving student education. States must also comply with certain core \nFederal principles, such as civil rights. The concept of Ed-Flex is \nsimple, yet the benefits would be significant. In other words, let's \nput more money into educating our kids in the classroom rather than \nlining the pockets of bureaucrats.\n  The Ed-Flex demonstration program is currently in place in 12 States. \nThe ``Ed-Flex Act of 1999'' would allow all 50 States the option to \nparticipate in\n\n[[Page S2549]]\n\nthe program. With good reason, the program has been very popular. \nUnnecessary, time-and-money-consuming Federal regulations are rightly \ndespised by school administrators. Did you know that the Federal \nGovernment provides only seven percent of local school funding, but \nrequires 50 percent of all school paperwork? That is ridiculous. Again, \nlet's put money into the classroom instead of bureaucracy.\n  Ed-Flex is a step toward allowing more localized decisionmaking \nauthority--the power to decide when the Federal regulations are more \ntroublesome and expensive than they are worth. Today, there are simply \ntoo many regulations which are despised by school administrators.\n  Giving more decisionmaking authority to States and local school \ndistricts is good common sense. Naturally, those who are closest to our \nstudents are in the best position to make the most appropriate and \neffective decisions concerning their education. One-size-fits-all \nlegislation may work well in other areas, but not in education. Some of \nthe most successful classrooms across our Nation vary tremendously in \ntheir structure, functioning, and appearance.\n  In my home State of Minnesota, for instance, we have very rural \ncommunities, urban communities, and everything in between. We have got \nfarm kids, suburban kids, and city kids. And all of these kids are \nstudents. And I know this sort of rural-to-urban community-mix is \ntypical for most States. How much sense does it make then, to require \nlocal school districts and classrooms--all with their own particular \nstrengths and weaknesses--to follow, in lock-step, the homogenized, \nuniform routine of Federal bureaucracy? Not much.\n  We have some opportunities before us to do something meaningful for \nour children's education. A complementary possible amendment to Ed-Flex \nwhich promotes local decisionmaking power is Senator Gorton's block \ngrant amendment, as well as Senator Hutchinson's Dollars to the \nClassroom Act. Under these proposals, many federally funded K-12 \nprograms would be consolidated and the dollars sent directly to states \nor local school districts--free from the usual Washington red tape. \nThis helps to ensure that our education dollars go to students, as \nopposed to bureaucrats.\n  Similarly, Senator Coverdell's Education Savings Accounts and School \nExcellence Act is an important step forward in restoring decisionmaking \nauthority to parents and families--where it is needed. The bill simply \nallows families to save for their children's education, without tax \npenalty. It would expand the college education savings accounts \nestablished in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to include primary and \nsecondary students. It would also increase the annual contribution \nlimit from $500 to $2,000 per child. The money could be used without \ntax penalty to pay for a variety of education-related expenses for \nstudents in K-12, as well as college expenses.\n  This is a simple, straight-forward initiative for families and \nstudents. Common sense would have had us pass the Education Savings \nAccounts bill long ago. Unfortunately, tired, groundless attacks \ncontinue. The charge I hear most frequently is that ``education savings \naccounts and tax breaks for parents would shift tax dollars away from \npublic schools.'' That is simply not the case.\n  More education dollars under parental control would promote education \nby encouraging parents to save, invest in, and support programs and \nmaterials that facilitate and provide the right option for a child's \neducation.\n  We all want the best education available for our children, and to \nimprove the state of American education and schools for all children. \nIt would be nice to think that we could solve the problems of education \nby spending more and more money. Unfortunately, that doesn't work. The \nUnited States is the world leader in national spending per student. Yet \nour test scores show that our system is failing our children.\n  Test results released last year show that American high school \nseniors score far below their peers from other countries in math and \nscience. We are at rock bottom. It is going to take more time and \neffort to solve these problems--and the most important work will be \ndone by those in the best position to do so: parents, teachers, and \nlocal administrators. We must give them the freedom they need to \naccomplish the job. This freedom comes with the authority to make \ndecisions based on a variety of specific needs. I will continue to \nsupport measures like the Ed-Flex legislation that return money and \ncontrol--from Washington--to parents, teachers, and local school \ndistricts. After all, they know best how to spend education dollars.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999, which would \nfree all fifty states from many of the costly and burdensome federal \nregulations which are imposed on them by the federal government. These \nunnecessary regulations prevent their schools from providing innovative \nand effective academic opportunities for millions of young Americans. I \nam proud to be an original cosponsor of this measure which would expand \nthe current Ed-Flex program to all fifty states.\n  One of the most important issues facing our nation is the education \nof our children. Providing a solid, quality education for each and \nevery child in our nation is a critical component in their quest for \npersonal success and fulfillment. A solid education for our children \nalso plays a pivotal role in the success of our nation; economically, \nintellectually, civically and morally. We must strive to develop and \nimplement initiatives which strengthen and improve our education \nsystem, thereby ensuring that our children are provided with the \nessential academic tools for succeeding professionally, economically \nand personally.\n  The most exciting aspect of this bill is that it brings teaching back \nto our classrooms and frees our schools from excessive filing, \ncorrelating, faxing and shuffling of paper. It would allow schools like \nBarbara Bush Elementary School in Mesa, Arizona to focus on helping \nchildren learn essentials like reading and using a computer. It would \nallow Barbara Bush Elementary School to focus on teaching its students \nrather than wasting its valuable educational resources for filing, \ntyping, refiling, and faxing paper to the bureaucrats in Washington, \nDC.\n  It is important to note that all states which obtain an Ed-Flex \nwaiver must adhere to basic Federal principles, including the \nprotection of civil rights, educational equity and academic \naccountability.\n  Like many Americans, I have grave concerns about the current \ncondition of our nation's education system. If a report card on our \neducational system were sent home today, it would be full of \nunsatisfactory and incomplete marks. In fact, it would be full of \n``D's'' and ``F's.'' These abominable grades demonstrate our failure to \nmeet the needs of our nation's students in kindergarten through twelfth \ngrade.\n  Our failure is clearly visible throughout the educational system. One \nprominent display of our nation's failure is seen in the results of the \nThird International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). Over forty \ncountries participated in the 1996 study which tested science and \nmathematical abilities of students in the fourth, eighth  and twelfth \ngrades. Tragically, our students scored lower than students in other \ncountries. According to this study, our twelfth graders scored near the \nbottom, placing 19th out of 21 nations in math and 16th in science, \nwhile scoring at the absolute bottom in physics.\n\n  Meanwhile, students in countries which are struggling economically, \nsocially and politically, such as Russia, outscored U.S. children in \nmath and scored far above them in advanced math and physics. Clearly, \nwe must make significant changes in our children's academic performance \nin order to remain a viable force in the world economy.\n  We can also see our failure when we look at the Federal Government's \nefforts to combat illiteracy. We spend over $8 billion a year on \nprograms to eradicate illiteracy across the country. Yet, we have not \nseen any significant improvement in literacy in any segment of our \npopulation. Today, more than 40 million Americans cannot read a menu, \ninstructions, medicine labels or a newspaper. And, tragically, four out \nof ten children in third grade cannot read.\n\n[[Page S2550]]\n\n  Another clear sign of our failure is displayed by the inadequate \npreparation of many students when they exit the system. The number of \ncollege freshmen who require remedial courses in reading, writing and \nmathematics when they begin their higher education is unacceptably \nhigh. In fact, presently, more than 30 percent of entering freshman \nneed to enroll in one or more remedial courses when they start college. \nEqually dismal is a Wall Street Journal report that two-thirds of job \napplicants for a division of the Ford Motor Company ``fail a test in \nwhich they are asked to add fractions.'' It does not bode well for our \nfuture economy if the majority of workers are not prepared with the \nbasic skills to engage in a competitive global marketplace.\n  I am also disturbed by the disproportionate amount of federal \neducation dollars which actually reach our students and schools. It is \ndeplorable that the vast majority of federal education funds do not \nreach our school districts, schools and children. In 1995, the \nDepartment of Education spent $33 billion for education and only 13.1 \npercent of that reached the local education agencies. It is \nunacceptable that less than 13 percent of the funds directly reached \nthe individuals schools and their students.\n  My home state of Arizona receives approximately $420 million each \nyear in federal education funding. These funds account for seven \npercent of Arizona's education budget, yet it takes almost half of the \nstaff at the State Department of Education to administer the numerous \nrules and regulations which accompany the federal dollars. This means \nthat half of the Arizona Department of Education staff is busy working \non Federal paperwork rather than developing improved curriculum, \nhelping teachers with professional development skills and working to \nimprove the quality of education for Arizona children. This is a sad \ncommentary on the current structure of our educational system.\n  Much of the Federal Government's involvement in education is \nhighly bureaucratic, overly regulatory, and actually impedes our \nchildren's learning. Clearly, we need to be more innovative in our \napproach to educating our children. We need to focus on providing \nparents, teachers, and local communities with the flexibility, freedom, \nand, yes, the financial support to address the unique educational needs \nof their children and the children in their communities. This is \nprecisely what the Ed-Flex program does. It removes the obstacles for \ninnovative, productive and successful educational initiatives in our \nclassrooms and frees our schools from the choking grip of federal \nbureaucrats.\n\n  Mr. President, it is absolutely crucial, as we debate this and other \nproposals to reform our educational system, that we not lose sight of \nthe fact that our paramount goal must be to increase the academic \nknowledge and skills of our nation's students. Our children are our \nfuture, and if we neglect their educational needs, we threaten that \nfuture.\n  I am gravely concerned that goal is sometimes lost in the very \nspirited and often emotional debate on education policies and \nresponsibilities. Instead, this should be a debate about how best to \nensure that young Americans will be able to compete globally in the \nfuture. I believe the key to academic excellence is broadening \neducational opportunities and providing families and communities both \nthe responsibility and the resources to choose the best course for \ntheir students.\n  Ed-Flex is an important step in our journey to improve our nation's \neducation system and better prepare our children so that each of them \nhas much more than their individual dreams of becoming an astronaut, \nfire fighter or pilot. The bill is an important step towards ensuring \nthat our children not only dream but have the capacity to make their \ndreams a reality. This is what education is all about--providing an \nendless realm of possibilities through knowledge. But it is just the \nfirst of many steps which we need to make to ensure that the best \ninterests of our children, our future are being realized. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues as we continue this journey \ntowards a strong and successful educational system.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have long been concerned about our \nnation's education system and the many problems that individual classes \nacross the country grapple with every day. When I reflect on my days in \na two-room schoolhouse, I have fond memories of my teachers and \nclassmates, and, most importantly, my learning experience. The students \nwere disciplined, my teachers were serious about their work, classes \nwere small and well-kept, and students thrived on learning for \nlearning's own sake. We did not have the kinds of problems so common in \nschools today.\n  I do, however, recognize that with each passing year, educating our \nnation's children becomes an even more formidable challenge. I am \npleased that we were able to address a few of the many concerns facing \nparents, students, and educators as part of the Senate's debate on this \nbill, S. 280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. With \nclassrooms bursting at their seams with students, there is a definite \nneed for smaller class size. Students do better when they have the \nindividual attention of a teacher. Moreover, I believe that this kind \nof environment provides teachers and students with a setting truly \nconducive to quality instruction. We, as a nation, need to do more in \nthis regard.\n  But, Mr. President, there are also other pressing education \npriorities for states, including funding for the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA), which remains underfunded to date. \nDisabled children deserve the same opportunity to receive a good \neducation as those without a disability. I am hopeful that we in \nCongress will continue to build toward the forty-percent funding \ncommitment that was established as part of the IDEA legislation. I \nbelieve, however, that reducing class size and providing for the needs \nof disabled children are both worthy goals that are not mutually \nexclusive, and I am troubled that efforts to provide sufficient \nresources to achieve one of those goals may have the effect of \nundercutting the other. The notion of pitting these two worthy goals \nagainst one another to score partisan political points is embarrassing. \nCertainly, both can, and should, be accomplished.\n  While many important education programs and new initiatives have been \ndiscussed during the Senate's debate of S. 280, I believe that the \nunderlying legislation offers some benefits in the form of flexibility. \nI do have concerns that there is little substantive performance data on \nthe impact of Ed-Flex in the states now operating with it. I would have \npreferred to see some positive results on student achievement levels \nprior to making this type of expansion. But I am hopeful that the \neducation accountability built into this legislation will hold states \nto a higher standard and serve as an incentive to all states seeking \nEd-Flex status. I am also somewhat comforted by the fact that the bill \ncontains a sunset provision, which will force the Congress to revisit \nthis issue, and, I hope, live up to its oversight responsibilities.\n  Mr. President, it disturbs me greatly to witness the political divide \nin this body on such an important issue which affects us all, whether \nit be our own child's education, that of a grandchild, or a neighbor's \nchild. We are all for education--it is the country's number one \npriority, and with many problems to solve, it is time for us to work \ntogether to make every child's educational experience a rewarding one.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, during the consideration of S. 280, the \nEducation Flexibility (Ed-Flex) Partnership Act of 1999, several new \neducation proposals have been advanced by my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. In particular, an issue that has received prominent \nattention is an amendment that would authorize federal monies for the \nhiring of 100,000 new teachers.\n  Like my colleagues, I am strongly committed to improving K-12 \neducation and ensuring that the unique needs of our nation's schools \nare addressed. While the federal government provides only a fraction of \nour nation's total K-12 education spending, the amount that it does \nprovide is critical to ensuring that our nation's children receive the \nquality education that they need and deserve.\n  Mr. President, as I look at the various challenges and issues facing \nour nation's schools, it is clear that every state and every community \nhas different needs, even if some of these\n\n[[Page S2551]]\n\nneeds are fairly pervasive. While one community may feel that its \ngreatest need is the hiring of more teachers, another may feel that \nbuying new textbooks or purchasing computers for the classroom may be \nthe most pressing need.\n  Over the years, various federal education programs have been created \nto assist state and local governments in addressing their disparate \nneeds, including programs that are designed to address issues that \ndemand national oversight. For instance, more than 20 years ago, the \nfederal government appropriately demanded that individuals with \ndisabilities receive a quality education, and the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act (IDEA) was enacted accordingly.\n  Unfortunately, even as the federal government appropriately mandated \nthat disabled children be educated at the local level, it has continued \nto fall woefully short in fulfilling its promised commitment to cover \n40 percent of the associated cost. In fact, as several of my colleagues \nhave emphasized, the federal government only funds approximately 10 \npercent of the cost today--and that paltry percent has only been \nachieved through Republican-led efforts over the past three years to \nincrease funding for IDEA by 85 percent!\n  As a result of the ongoing federal shortfall, state and local \ngovernments are not only forced to cover the 60 percent share that was \nagreed to--but they also pick-up the missing 30 percent federal share.\n  Mr. President, this broken promise on the part of the federal \ngovernment must not continue. Not only does it represent a failure on \nthe part of the federal government to meet an important obligation to \nour nation's disabled children, but it also forces states and \ncommunities to divert their scarce resources for this unfunded \nmandate--resources that could otherwise be used to address a wide \nvariety of local needs, including the hiring of new teachers.\n  To demonstrate the impact of this unfunded mandate, consider that in \nmy home state of Maine, the federal government currently provides \napproximately $20 million for the education of the disabled, while the \nstate and local governments are forced to shoulder more than $200 \nmillion of the cost. Therefore, if the federal government were to \nfulfill its 40 percent commitment, an additional $60 million would flow \nto the state.\n  That's $60 million now spent by Maine's state and local governments \nto cover a federal commitment--$60 million that would otherwise be \nfreed-up to address distinct and pressing local needs. Sixty million \ndollars.\n  Needless to say, this shortfall has not been overlooked by officials \nat the state or local level. During a recent meeting with \nrepresentatives of the Maine Municipal Association, local officials \nemphasized to me the need for the federal government to fulfill its \ncommitment to fund 40 percent of the cost of educating the disabled \nbecause of the substantial budgetary impact it is having on their \ncommunities.\n  And during the recent gathering of the National Governors Association \n(NGA), the Governor of Maine, Angus King, interrupted President Clinton \nduring his presentation on education issues to hammer home the need for \nspecial education funding. As quoted in a March 1, 1999, article in the \nPortland Press Herald, Governor King ``raised his hand and \ninterrupted'' the President saying:\n\n       Mr. President, I'm bringing you a report from Franklin, \n     Maine, and a lot of other places in Maine. What I'm telling \n     you is that if you want to do something for schools in Maine, \n     then fund special education and we can hire our own teachers \n     and build our own schools.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't believe the thoughts and comments by the \nGovernor of Maine are unique to our state. This is a national problem \nthat requires federal action. Paying ``lip-service'' to this funding \ncommitment is no longer enough. We cannot simply brush off the comments \nof governors and local leaders by expressing support for the full-\nfunding of education for the disabled and not achieving it--rather, \nit's time to actually deliver on the promise made more than 20 years \nago.\n  For this reason, I believe Congress should ensure that the federal \nshare of education for the disabled is fully-funded before new programs \nare created. Not only will this ensure that a long-standing federal \npromise will finally be met, but it will also ensure that distinct \nlocal needs--which may include the hiring of new teachers--can be \nreadily addressed.\n  During the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation (ESEA) Act, there will be countless opportunities to reform \nand improve federal education programs that are intended to address \ndistinct needs. But the time to create truly new federal education \nprograms--and to devote federal resources to these new proposals--\nshould not occur until we have met our outstanding federal obligation \nto disabled children and to the states and communities that educate \nthem.\n  Mr. President, the time to fully-fund the federal share of education \nfor the disabled is now. I urge that my colleagues vote to ensure that \nany new K-12 education monies be used to meet this commitment, and to \nfinally fulfill a federal promise made to state and local governments \nmore than 20 years ago.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my intention to vote \nfor final passage of the Education Flexibility Act. Although this bill \nis far from perfect, I support the underlying principle of flexibility \nin education, and believe we should move this bill forward.\n  Despite my support for giving local school districts more flexibility \nin improving education, I have serious concerns about this bill. Last \nyear, we passed a new initiative to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce \nclass size in the early grades. We approved this program on a \nbipartisan basis, recognizing that research has shown that smaller \nclasses give teachers more time to spend with individual students and \nimproves student achievement.\n  School districts in Wisconsin are already putting together their \nbudgets and planning to use this Federal money to hire teachers. They \nare looking to Congress to send them assurances that the teachers they \nhire today will receive Federal support over the next six years. I am \nextremely disappointed that the Senate failed to adopt Senator Murray's \nclass size amendment, which would authorized the program for six years \nand given our school districts that assurance. I am hopeful that we can \nstill address this important issue later this year.\n  In addition to the Senate's failure to authorize the class size \ninitiative, I am also concerned that the bill, as amended, pits \nstudents with special needs against other students in fighting for \neducation funding. This is inexcusable--and unnecessary.\n  I agree that the Federal government must live up to its obligation to \npay for 40% of the costs of special education. It is a responsibility \nwe have failed to meet for far too long, and I will continue to fight \nfor full funding of special education. However, I believe it is time \nthat we make education of all our children--including those with \nspecial needs--our top priority. There is no reason why we cannot fully \nfund all of our educational needs in this country. We should fully fund \nspecial education, and we should fully fund class size, and after-\nschool programs, and school construction. We can do all of these \nthings--and we should not pit any of these vital programs against one \nanother as some have tried to do here today.\n  I am extremely concerned about the amendments that were added to this \nbill today. Although I recognize that school districts need additional \nresources for special education, I believe these amendments wrongly \nforce them to choose between special education and hiring teachers--\nanother essential need they face. We should not force them to make this \nchoice--we should provide enough funding to fill both needs.\n  Although I am deeply troubled about these amendments, I will vote for \nfinal passage of the bill because I believe in the original intent of \nproviding more flexibility to States and local school districts. I am \nvoting for it now because I think we need to move this bill forward. \nHowever, I strongly believe these amendments should be dropped in \nconference. If this bill comes back from the Conference Committee with \nthese amendments still included, I will be forced to oppose the bill.\n  Mr. President, I still hold out hope that these problems can be \nworked out in conference, and that we can move\n\n[[Page S2552]]\n\nthis bill, which was originally a bipartisan bill, forward \nexpeditiously.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. 280, \nthe Education Flexibility Act. This legislation will give greater \nresponsibility, flexibility, and control to local schools. That's where \nthe students, parents, and teachers are. That's where the education \nhappens.\n  That's where the control ought to be. I have been fighting for our \nteachers and local school administrators for many years, and I think \none of the most important things we can do for them is liberate them \nfrom Federal red tape--so they can do what they do best: Teach our \nkids.\n  In offering this bill, our distinguished colleague from Tennessee, \nSenator Frist, is striking a blow for freedom in American education.\n  This bill would expand an existing pilot program to all eligible \nstates. It is a good deal for the states--in this bill we offer to free \nthe states from the burden of unnecessary, time-consuming Federal \nregulations. In return, all states have to do is comply with certain \ncore principles, such as civil rights, and establish a system of \naccountability. The bill also would require states to have a system of \nwaiving their own regulations.\n  My own home state of Ohio has been one of the pilot programs and has \nprovided over 200 waivers for local schools. For example, the \nEisenhower teacher training program only supported math and science \ntraining. Using ed-flex, Ohio waived this requirement--and today \nschools can use this program for training teachers in other subjects \nsuch as reading and social studies.\n  The Ohio Department of Education, in its annual report to the \nSecretary of Education, reached the following conclusion, and I quote: \n``The greatest benefit to having Ed-Flex authority is that it, combined \nwith the ability to waive State rules and statutes, establishes a \nschool-planning environment unencumbered by real or perceived \nregulatory barriers. This environment encourages creativity, thoughtful \nplanning, and innovation.''\n  Mr. President, that's as true everywhere else in America as it is in \nOhio. And that's why this Ed-Flex bill has such strong bipartisan \nsupport.\n  But I should note that while Ed-Flex is an important step forward, it \nis just a single step. We need to do more. Over the next year, the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on which I serve, \nwill be working on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1999--\nwhich will deal with almost all of the federal programs that impact K-\n12 grade education. When the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was \npassed in 1965, it was 30 pages long, today it is more than 300 pages \nlong. As a member of that committee, I will be looking to empower \nparents, support local control, promote effective teacher training \nprograms, recognize and reward excellent teachers, and send more money \nback to the states and local schools with no strings attached.\n  Remember: The Federal Government provides only 6 percent of local \nschool funding, but demands 50 percent of the paperwork that burdens \nlocal teachers and administrators. That burden demands nearly 49 \nmillion hours each year--or the equivalent of 25,000 school employees \nworking full time--on paperwork, not kids. There are over 700 separate \nfederal education programs spread across 40 separate federal \nbureaucracies.\n  Mr. President, I am concerned about the quality of our children's \neducation. The Third International Math and Science Study recently \nreported that out of 21 countries, the U.S. ranked 19th in math and \n16th in science, barely ahead of South Africa. Verbal and combined SAT \nscores are lower today than they were in 1970. Businesses spend more \nthan $30 billion annually in retraining employees who cannot read \nproficiently. Nearly 30 percent of college freshmen need remedial \nclasses.\n  Mr. President, these are disturbing statistics. As we move forward to \nimprove our children's education, I urge my colleagues to remember that \nthe most important education tool in any classroom is a qualified, \nhighly trained teacher. After parents and families, America's teachers \nplay the most important role in helping our children realize their \npotential. Our current teachers are doing a good job--indeed, a great \njob--given the resources they have to work with. Clearly, it's time to \nchange the way we allocate resources. It's time that today's teachers \nget more support and training and less paperwork from the federal \ngovernment.\n  I want to thank the sponsor of the Ed-Flex legislation, Senator \nFrist, for his work with all members to improve this bill. The \nmanager's amendment that we accepted last week addresses many of the \nconcerns that have been raised about this legislation. Without going \ninto the details of the amendment, I would simply point out that it \nwill strengthen accountability measures currently in the bill, require \nstates to coordinate their Ed-Flex applications with state \ncomprehensive plans, emphasize school and student performance as an \nobjective of Ed-Flex and add additional provisions for public notice \nand comment regarding Ed-Flex proposals.\n  Ultimately, our children's success in education depends on the \nsupport they receive at home and in the classroom. Our focus in \nWashington should be to take every opportunity to empower parents and \nthen free local schools from regulations that prevent improvements and \ninnovations in local schools.\n  Mr. President, that's why I strongly support this bill.\n\n\n                       prevention of truancy act\n\n  Mr. DODD. In the 105th Congress, I offered my legislation, the \nPrevention of Truancy Act, as an amendment to the Ed-Flex bill during \nthe Labor and Human Resources Committee's consideration, where it \nfailed on a tie vote. It was my intention to offer it on the floor on \nthis bill. However, I am pleased instead to be on the floor with my \ncolleague from Alabama, Senator Sessions, to discuss our common \ninterest in assisting communities address this real and serious problem \nand express our intent to offer legislation similar to the bill I \noffered last year soon. We will also be working with Senator Bingaman \nwho offered similar legislation last Congress and Senator Collins who \nsupported my amendment in Committee last year.\n  Senator Sessions, a new member to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions and the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee's \nSubcommittee on Youth Violence, believes as I do that truancy is a \ngateway offense, and that this legislation would present us with an \nopportunity to catch good kids before it is too late. The Senator from \nAlabama has worked hard for the duration of his career on finding \nsolutions to difficult issues such as truancy. I believe this \nlegislation will truly make a difference in the lives of many children \nand, at the same time, prevent juvenile crime. I also believe that our \nworking together will produce strong, solid legislation that we should \nall be able to support.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be working with the \nSenator from Connecticut on truancy legislation. I am struck by the \nalignment of our interests here. I believe this is a national problem \nand one that deserves federal attention. I am pleased that Senator Dodd \nand I have been able to work out an agreement here that avoids an \namendment to the Ed Flex bill on this subject, which would be a concern \nfor me and a number of my colleagues who very much want to be \nsupportive in this effort to address truancy. I look forward to working \nwith the Senator to bring forward a strong bill from my committee to \nsupport efforts to assist local governments in their efforts to reduce \ntruancy.\n\n\n                            afterschool care\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I'd like to thank my colleague from Vermont \nfor his cooperation in working out an agreement to address the need for \nafterschool programs as part of the Health and Education Committee's \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act later \nthis year.\n  As my colleagues know, I was planning to offer an amendment to the \nEducation Flexibility Act, that I offered when this bill was in \ncommittee, to increase funding for programs serving children during \nout-of-school hours through the Child Care and Development Block Grant \nand the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program.\n  I know that my colleague from Vermont shares my strong interest in \nensuring that children have safe alternatives during the hours they are \nnot\n\n[[Page S2553]]\n\nin school. He has been a leader for years on this specific issue as \nwell as a tireless advocate for many other critical concerns of \nAmerican families.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. This is a very important issue for me, but not nearly \nas important as it is to the parents of the nearly 24 million school-\nage children who need care while their parents work. The issue of how \nbest to meet the needs of school-aged children and youth will be \naddressed--not just in the context of one program, like the 21st \nCentury Community Learning Centers Act, but within the framework of a \ncomprehensive, cohesive review of Federal public education policy.\n  Mr. DODD. Out of consideration for the Senator's interest in moving \nthis bill forward expeditiously, I have agreed to withdraw my \namendment. I am pleased that Senator Jeffords has agreed instead to \ntake up this issue as part of ESEA and to hold comprehensive hearings \non the issue of afterschool care this year.\n  I am particularly pleased that Senator Frist shares our concern about \nthe documented rise in juvenile crime that we see in the hours \nimmediately after school. I also appreciate his pledge to work with us \nto increase support for afterschool programs.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I want to thank Senator Dodd for helping us move the \neducational flexibility legislation along. I want to assure him and my \nSenate colleagues that the withdrawal of Senator Dodd's amendment does \nnot signal the end of the Senate debate on school-aged child care, but \nthe beginning of our work.\n  Senator Dodd has been a leader on child care and other youth issues \nfor his entire congressional career. He has continually worked to craft \neffective legislation that will help children and their families, and I \nappreciate his tireless efforts.\n  By working together, I have little doubt that we can greatly improve \nthe Federal Government's response to the needs of school-aged children \nand their families.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of the \nEducation Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999. I am pleased to join \nwith a bipartisan group that includes thirty-three of my colleagues and \nalmost all of the nation's governors, to ensure that all states have \nthe flexibility to encourage education reforms of the highest standards \nin our schools. This legislation enjoys the support of the National \nEducation Association, the National School Board Association, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, and the National Governors' \nAssociation.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the Ed-Flex Program was established in \n1994 under the Goals 2000 Program. It originally authorized 6 states to \nparticipate in a demonstration program that would allow States the \nability to waive certain Federal regulations and statutes for local \nschool districts and schools in return for high standards and \naccountability. In 1996, Congress expanded the Ed-Flex Program in the \nOmnibus Appropriations Act to include six more states. While this \nwaiver authority may seem broad, Ed-Flex States may only grant waivers \nfor selected Federal programs. Most importantly, these states may not \nwaive Federal requirements relating to health, safety, civil rights, \nparental involvement, allocation of funds, participation by pupils \nattending private schools, and fiscal accountability.\n  With over 14,000 school districts in this nation, there cannot be one \neducation reform plan that fits every community. Ed-Flex allows states \nand local education agencies to commit to common goals and purposes and \nyet allows them to choose the best path to achieve these results. Ed-\nFlex is not a cure-all for education reform. It is just a common-sense, \npractical tool that allows local school districts and schools to get \nback to the business of educating our youth and away from the business \nof filling out forms.\n  Most waivers granted under Ed-Flex have dealt primarily with the use \nof Title I funds on a school-wide basis and the allocation of \nEisenhower Professional Development Funds for teaching disciplines \nother than math and science. These are common sense changes that have \nallowed local school districts and schools to use Federal dollars in a \nsmart and efficient manner. Ed-Flex has also encouraged several states \nto streamline their own regulations and statutes, thus providing their \nschools with better guidance and clarity on state requirements.\n  Some of the requirements of Federal programs have produced \nnonsensical results. For instance, in my home state of Indiana, the \ntown of Elwood operates two separate elementary schools. One of these \nschools meets the 50 percent threshold for Title I so it can implement \nTitle I programs school-wide. However, the other school just misses \nthis threshold and must restrict Title I resources to only Title I \nstudents. That particular elementary school in Elwood, Indiana would be \ncited by the State Board of Accounts if they were to allow non-Title I \nstudents the use of their computer lab which was paid for with Title I \nfunding. These Federal requirements have not only produced two systems \nof elementary education for this town, but has created confusion over \nwhat sort of educational programs can be implemented. This kind of \nstrict regulation is not only absurd, but counterproductive to school \nreform. As long as Title I students are being targeted for additional \nassistance, there is no reason a school should be prohibited from \nsharing its resources with all of its students. In twelve states, Ed-\nFlex has allowed local education agencies and schools to operate Title \nI programs on a school-wide basis thus equalizing the standard of \nlearning for all students.\n  Some have raised the issue that Ed-Flex does not address the major \nconcerns of our nation's school districts. While Ed-Flex will not on \nits own solve our education problems, it can spur our States and \nschools to creatively approach old problems in a new way. As a former \nGovernor, I know first-hand how easing strict Federal requirements can \nhelp states achieve positive results. Any school teacher will tell you \nthat there is no one lesson plan from which to educate all of our \nnation's students. Just as each child is unique in his or her capacity \nto learn and grow, so too our are nation's school districts unique. No \nmatter how well-intentioned, the Federal Government cannot continue \ndown the path of a one-size fits all educational system for our \nnation's children. Education is now and will continue to be the primary \nresponsibility of local communities and states. Educators, community \nleaders, and parents are the best judges of what is good education \npolicy for their schools. Each community has different needs and by \nexpanding the Ed-Flex Program, we can allow them to partner with the \nFederal Government to achieve some truly outstanding results.\n  For example, a Maryland school district was able to identify a trend \nin math and science performance of middle school students who came from \ntwo elementary schools. After looking at the assessment results and the \ndemographic make-up of the student population, they were able to use \nthe waiver authority to implement comprehensive planning and greater \nresource coordination. The result has been improved reading and math \ninstruction for this school district's elementary and middle school \nstudents.\n  Our nation's schools will face many challenges in the next century. \nDilapidated school buildings, overcrowding in the classrooms, and a \nshortage of qualified teachers will place great demands on our \ncountry's educational systems. While Ed-Flex alone will not solve all \nof these problems it can ease the burdens placed on our educators so \nthey can rise to meet the challenges of the future. I am pleased to \nvote in favor of final passage of the Education Flexibility Partnership \nAct which expands this successful program so that all states, not just \ntwelve, have the opportunity to waive Federal requirements that present \nan obstacle to innovation in their schools.\n  I thank Senators Frist and Wyden for re-introducing this effective \ntool of reform. I believe this bipartisan approach is a step in the \nright direction towards helping our nation's schools achieve positive \nresults.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999, better known as Ed-\nFlex. This bill will help to restore the proper respect for the ability \nof states and local communities to educate our children. I applaud the \nwork done by my colleagues, Bill Frist and Ron Wyden,\n\n[[Page S2554]]\n\nand I am pleased to join them as a cosponsor of this bill. Ed-Flex is a \ncommon sense, bipartisan, cost-effective approach that empowers states \nand local communities to put their focus where it belongs--on educating \nour children, not on complying with federal mandates.\n  The principle of federalism is vital to our democracy. This principle \nholds that the Federal Governmental has limited powers and that \ngovernment closest to the people--states and local communities--is best \npositioned to serve the people. Our Founding Fathers had serious \nconcerns about the tendency of our government to centralize power and \nto encroach on a state's ability to improve the lives of its citizens.\n  This federal encroachment has been particularly pronounced in the \narea of education. The U.S. Constitution assigns Washington no \nresponsibility at all for education. Indeed, for its first two \ncenturies, America's Federal Government understood that the 10th \namendment left responsibility for education to the states. America's \neducation system works best when parents, teachers, and local school \nofficials, who know our students best, make the decisions about where a \nschool spends its money. But as federal involvement in education \nincreased since the 1960's, Washington began to regulate how our \nschools spend their funds. Even after all these new regulations, \nAmerica's dropout rates are near 40 percent in many urban areas, three-\nfourths of all 4th graders in high-poverty communities cannot read at a \nbasic level, and our most disadvantaged communities remain in need of \nreal education reform.\n  Americans understand that Washington can't possibly know what is best \nfor a particular student in Memphis or in Los Angeles or in Miami. \nPatrick Jacob of Germantown, TN, wrote to me earlier this month to \nremind me that when the Federal Government tells our schools how to \nspend their money, it reduces the community's ability to take \nresponsibility for educating our children.\n  There are real solutions in education and they are coming from states \nfrom Texas to North Carolina and Arizona and from cities from Milwaukee \nto New York. However, federal regulations often prohibit states from \nexpanding these reforms. Ed-Flex will give state and local school \nofficials greater freedom from burdensome requirements of federal \neducation statutes or regulations that impede local efforts to improve \neducation. For example, if the parents, teachers and leaders of a \nparticular school district decide that additional money is needed for \nreading instruction, that school district should not be precluded from \nshifting its resources to achieve that goal. Ed-Flex will free our \nschools to make more of these critical choices for themselves. Ed-Flex \ncosts American taxpayers nothing. And instead of sending another \nunfunded mandate down from Washington, it provides our states with what \ngovernors from both parties asked us for when they came to Washington \nlast week--flexibility.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of final passage of S. \n280, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999 and would like \nto take a brief moment to describe my reasons for supporting this \nlegislation. Despite serious concerns about the amendments that will be \noffered here on the floor today, I am voting for this legislation as a \nstrong supporter of both increased federal flexibility and additional \nfederal funding for special education.\n  First and foremost, I am in favor of making federal education \nprograms as flexible as possible. Over the years, requirements and \nregulations in many areas have crossed the line from responsible \nmonitoring to redundant paperwork. Much has been done in recent years \nto lessen administrative burdens and eliminate federal regulation. \nHowever, I strongly believe that federal education programs need to go \nfarther in to set clear goals and then provide as much flexibility as \npossible to local policymakers, as well as principals and classroom \nteachers.\n  To that end, this bill will allow schools in all 50 states to apply \nfor waivers from a set of state and federal education laws. I voted for \nexpanding Ed-Flex in 1998, and I am proud to have supported creation of \nthe demonstration program that gave New Mexico this flexibility three \nyears ago.\n  I am also supporting this bill because I am a strong advocate of \nincreased funding for special education. Special education provides \nspecialized services to students that can require significant \nadditional costs to schools and local school districts. These services \nare essential to these students, and the federal government should do \nits part to support these efforts.\n  During the past 3 years, I have worked with my colleagues in the \nSenate to help increase funding for the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act by billions of dollars. My goal, as stated in the IDEA \nstatute, is that the federal government meet its commitment to IDEA \nfunding by providing 40 percent of the costs of educating special \neducation students. And this bill sends a strong signal that additional \nfunding in FY2000 and beyond is required for IDEA grants to states.\n  For these reasons, I am voting in favor of final passage. However, I \nwill carefully watch the final legislation that is produced by the \nconference committee on S. 280 before deciding how to cast my final \nvote before this bill is sent to the President.\n  For example, in my view it is unfortunate that the final version of \nthis legislation could have the unintended and unnecessary effect of \ndiverting funding from the new class size reduction program started \nlast year. Under this program, New Mexico is slated to receive $9.6 \nmillion in FY99, which would allow schools around the state to hire \nmore than 250 teachers.\n  There is no reason that the Senate cannot support this program as \nwell as increased funding for IDEA. In fact it would have been \npreferable to have extended the authorization for the class size \nreduction program so that these efforts could continue into the future. \nI am concerned that, by merging two viable streams of funding into what \nis in effect just one source, the overall amount of funds awarded for \neducation may not increase as much as is needed.\n  Because of these concerns I voted against several amendments to S. \n280 that would make schools decide between the special needs of \ndisabled students and the clear imperative to lower class size in the \nearly grades. Ideally, there would be two strong programs that would \nboth receive the funding they deserve.\n  I am also concerned that the Senate version of this legislation may \nnot have sufficient accountability measures to go along with the \nexpanded flexibility that is in the Ed-Flex bill. The taxpayers expect \nus to account for the roughly $15 billion per year that is sent to \nlocal schools, and in my view there should be stronger measures of \nperformance and review in the final conference report.\n  Finally, it is extremely unfortunate that this version of the bill \ndoes not create the national dropout prevention program that I had \noffered as an amendment. This amendment, which passed last year by 74 \nto 26, would address the fact that 500,000 students drop out of school \neach year. There is no funded program to help lower dropout rates. And \nyet students in too many schools have just a 50-50 chance of \ngraduating. Those that don't will earn less, be more likely to need \npublic support, and more likely to get involved in crime. That affects \nall of us, not just the individual students.\n  It is my hope that some of these concerns can be addressed during the \nconference between the House and Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 24 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 6 minutes, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, in the last 3 or 4 weeks, we have heard our majority \nleader on three different occasions indicate that the most important \nissue we are going to address in the early part of this session was \neducation. Over the period of the last 6 days, we have tried to debate \na number of the ideas that we have on this side of the aisle, and \ncertainly there ought to be the opportunity to debate amendments from \nthe other side of the aisle as well.\n  We have tried to do that, but have been effectively closed out from \nthat opportunity.\n\n[[Page S2555]]\n\n  I would like at this time, to read a statement by Senator Patty \nMurray, who, because of a death in the family, will be unable to be \nhere to make this representation in the final few minutes of \nconsideration before we go into a series of votes--the most important \nbeing the time-sensitive issue of smaller classes for grades K through \n3. This is what Senator Murray says:\n\n       Mr. President, I want to express how deeply disappointed I \n     am. The Senate had a tremendous opportunity to work together \n     to make a tangible difference in our children's lives and \n     their futures. But instead, Republicans have chosen the path \n     of partisanship and division.\n       Last October, the Senate reached a bipartisan agreement to \n     reduce class size and improve teacher quality. Republicans \n     and Democrats worked together to reach a compromise that is \n     sending funds to local school districts this July. We did it \n     because we knew it was the right thing to do. That simple \n     fact has not changed in the last 5 months.\n       So I am absolutely baffled about why we could not reach \n     this agreement again. The Senate's failure to pass this \n     amendment was irresponsible and inexcusable.\n       The Senate Republicans have broken their promise to \n     teachers, to parents, and worst of all, to children in the \n     first, second, and third grades across the country.\n       The Senate Republicans are hoping that this issue will just \n     fade away, but the education of our children is far too \n     important for me to allow that to happen. I will be back for \n     as long as it takes to get them to recognize they cannot \n     continue to stall. Until they take real steps to reduce the \n     class size, Mr. President, the Republicans owe the children \n     of this country an explanation.\n\n  This is what we heard last fall. At that time, leading Republicans in \nCongress hailed the class size agreement. House Majority Leader Dick \nArmey said, ``We were very pleased to receive the President's request \nfor more teachers, especially since he offered a way to pay for them,'' \neffectively supporting the first year of getting smaller class sizes. \nRepublican Congressman Bill Goodling, Chairman of House Education \nCommittee, declared that the Class Size Reduction Act was ``. . .a real \nvictory for the Republican Congress but, more importantly, a huge win \nfor local educators.'' Senator Slade Gorton said the same thing about \nthe Class Size Reduction Act, representing the Republicans in \nnegotiation on education, ``On education, there s been a genuine \nmeeting of the minds involving the President and the Democrats and \nRepublicans here in Congress. . . .''\n  Now before the Senate we have the amendment of the Senator from \nWashington, to fulfill that commitment--which Republicans were taking \ncredit for 5 months ago--and we are being denied this opportunity.\n  We will have a chance this afternoon to vote on it. This is the time, \ntoday is the day, where the U.S. Senate can go on record for smaller \nclass sizes in grades K-3. Today--today is the day to do it.\n  I say to my good friend from New Hampshire, all of us are very \nconcerned about our nation's children. We, on this side, do not yield \nthat there is anyone who is more concerned about those needy children \nin our local communities. The fact of the matter is that his battle is \nnot with us--it is with the Republican leadership that supported this \nprogram 5 months ago.\n  Special ed educators all over this country are supporting the Murray \namendment. Why? Because they think you can serve special needs children \nin many different ways, not just in targeting money for a particular \nfunding program, but in smaller classes. We put that in the record. So \nwe reject this idea that we are pitting one group of children against \nanother, which effectively is what the Republican amendments are doing.\n  Mr. President, today in just 8 minutes we will start a series of \nvotes. They are on amendments that can make a major difference in \nstudent achievement. They are supported by parents, local school \nboards, principals, and teachers all across this Nation for smaller \nclass size, expanding after-school programs, reducing drop out rates, \nand ending social promotion. We have a chance on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, to take votes and declare that we want action in those areas. \nThat is what we are trying to do. We have been trying to do it for 6 \ndays and have been denied that through parliamentary mechanisms of our \nRepublican friends.\n  I hope those Americans who care so deeply about those issues know how \nimportant it is to the children of this country. It is intuitive. Every \nparent knows if you have a child in a smaller class the child is going \nto do better. We have an opportunity to do something about that and I \nhope this afternoon we will have a strong vote in support of the Murray \namendment--the children in this country deserve it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee, the sponsor of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is an exciting day because education in \nthe United States is off to a fresh start. The underlying bill, which I \nam hopeful and confident will be passed later today, does something \nthat previous bills out of this body did not do, and that is cut \nredtape. It combines flexibility and allows local innovation, local \ncreativity to emerge, with strong accountability built in to give our \nstudents--and that is the purpose--to give our students the best chance \nto receive a solid and a strong education to prepare them for the \nmillennium which is just around the corner.\n  Ed-Flex is not a panacea. We have been very careful, as sponsors of \nthis bill, to point out it is not a panacea to our Nation's educational \nsystems' woes, but it is a strong bipartisan, bicameral first step. It \nis a first step to unshackle the hands of our teachers, to unshackle \nthe hands of our administrators, of our principals--all who are working \nhard every day to educate our children. You look around at the success \nof Ed-Flex, whether it is just around the corner in Phelps Luck School \nin Maryland where waiver authority was granted to reduce class size, or \nin Kansas where Ed-Flex has made it possible to implement all-day \nkindergarten, or in many of the States that have access to Ed-Flex now \nto reduce paperwork. After today, coupled with the passage in the House \nof Representatives just a few hours ago, and ultimately to be signed by \nthe President, we can give these opportunities to all States, to all \nchildren, to all schools in this country.\n  I am proud to have been an original author and original sponsor of \nthis particular bill. I am very appreciative of the manager and his \nconduct of the floor proceedings over the last several days, and I \nespecially want to thank the Governors with whom I have worked very \nclosely over the last several weeks to accomplish passage of this bill. \nI yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Maine 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and again commend \nSenator Frist, chief sponsor of this legislation, and the chairman of \nthe committee. I am pleased to join with them in this effort.\n  Mr. President, the question before us is simple. This is not a \nquestion of who is for better schools; this is not a question of who is \nfor putting more Federal resources in education; because both Democrats \nand Republicans alike share those two goals. The question before us is \nwhom do you trust to make education decisions? Should education \ndecisions be decided in Washington? Should every Federal dollar be \nattached to a string? Or should we trust the people at the local \nlevel--our school board members, our teachers, our parents, to make the \nbest decisions for the students in local schools? To me, the answer is \nclear. We should increase the Federal commitment to education, but \nempower local school boards, teachers and parents to make the best \ndecisions in keeping with the needs of their communities. That is the \nquestion before us.\n  The second question before us is, Is the Government, is Congress, \ngoing to keep its promise with regard to funding special education? I \nsay the answer to that should be yes. Let's keep the promise that was \nmade more than 20 years ago when Congress passed the legislation \nmandating special ed. Let's keep our promise. Let's fully fund that \nimportant program before creating a whole lot of new categorical grant \nprograms with strings attached. That is the debate.\n  Everyone here is for better schools, better teachers, but that is not \nthe issue.\n\n[[Page S2556]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield the remainder of my time to myself.\n  I have noticed over the years with my good friend from Massachusetts, \nthat the weaker his arguments, the louder the volume. He exceeded all \nmy expectations today.\n  My Democratic friends have a number of amendments that will be coming \nup for votes shortly. As I have pointed out this week, we will be \nconsidering the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act this Congress. The Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions has already held several hearings on the ESEA, and many \nmore are in the works. I will oppose all amendments that are relevant \nto the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I will do this, not \nbecause I am callous to these issues, in fact, I ve championed them, \nbut because these amendments should be discussed in the normal \ncommittee process. I will, however, support amendments that are \ndesigned to let local educators direct more money to special education. \nThe reauthorization of special ed occurred last year, and it is open to \nhave more money. The amendment I introduced on behalf of Senator Lott \nand others will provide local communities with a choice regarding how \nmuch they will use their share of the $1.2 billion included in last \nyear's omnibus appropriations bill for education.\n  Under our amendments, a school system may use the funds either to \nhire teachers or to support activities under the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. What fairer system can you have under the \ncircumstances? That is all we are doing. We are saying give them an \noption, give the locals an option: More teachers or more money for \nspecial ed. Our amendment will permit local school officials themselves \nto decide whether they need more money to educate children with \ndisabilities or whether they need funds to hire more teachers.\n  In Vermont, I am betting the funds will be used for IDEA. Time and \nagain, Vermonters have made clear to me that special education funding \nis far and away the most pressing need of our communities. And time and \nagain, Vermonters have pressed me to find out whether the Federal \nGovernment will honor its promise to pay 40 percent of the costs of \nspecial education. We are fortunate in Vermont to have already achieved \nthe small class sizes which the President is trying to promote with his \nteacher hiring program. We do not need more. We need more money for \nspecial ed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 24 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is it appropriate or is it in order to ask for the yeas \nand nays on all of the amendments this afternoon? I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the Senator's \nrequest? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on amendment No. 60 offered by \nSenator Jeffords for the majority leader. There is 5 minutes of debate \nequally divided. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It is my understanding the yeas and nays have already\n\n[[Page S2557]]\n\nbeen ordered on all of these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. President, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment for your local \nschool districts. This is the most important amendment you will have \nthis afternoon. I emphasize that this is extremely important for your \nlocal school districts.\n  The pending amendment would amend the class size reduction provisions \nof the fiscal year 1999 Department of Education Appropriations Act. It \nwould allow any local educational agency the choice of using its share \nof the $1.2 billion provided under those provisions either to hire \nteachers or to carry out activities under part B of the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, IDEA.\n  We reauthorized IDEA last year, and this is the perfect time to do \nthis. Local school officials would have the opportunity to determine \nwhich of these two activities is a greater need for their schools, and \nto spend the additional funds accordingly.\n  In addition, the amendment contains a finding that reemphasizes a \nsimple fact--full funding of IDEA would offer LEAs the flexibility in \ntheir budgets to develop class size reduction, or other programs that \nbest meet the needs of their communities.\n  I believe this approach offers a good middle ground. It is a \ncompromise between those of us who are urging we live up to our \npromises, with respect to IDEA funding, and those who believe we should \nundertake a massive new effort to hire teachers for local schools.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it \nought to be unanimous.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last year we made a bipartisan agreement \nto support the hiring of additional teachers. We had a $500 million \nincrease in IDEA and $1 billion increase in terms of the teachers, \nincluding special needs teachers.\n  Communities need funds both for IDEA and smaller classes--and for \nother top priorities too. We can reduce class size and give children \nwith disabilities a better education. There is no reason to choose one \nor the other--both are priorities and both can be met.\n  Every local community in this country is trying to decide whether \nthey are going to hire additional teachers within the next few weeks. \nIf we say now we are going to accept the Lott amendment, you are \nemasculating this particular provision, which the local communities \nhave been basing their judgment on, and saying, no, that isn't what you \nare going to do, you are going to have to come up with a new kind of a \nprogram.\n  If we make a commitment to a local community that permitted them to \nhire general teachers or special needs teachers, I daresay one of the \nprincipal reasons that the special needs community supported this \namendment last year was because we added that specific provision. We \nare saying let us, let the local communities live out the bipartisan \ncommitment that we made to them 5 months ago. They can make that local \njudgment depending upon the needs of the community.\n  How can you have greater flexibility than that--rather than overturn \nthe whole proposal that was out there and dump this on the school \ncommittees that are all finalizing their budgets in the next few weeks?\n  I hope that the amendment would not be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 minute 9 \nseconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I reiterate what I said before. If you want \nflexibility, vote yes. This amendment gives the local communities total \nflexibility to meet the needs they have. If you want to limit them down \nto one thing, hiring new teachers, vote no.\n  All of our schools want total flexibility, especially in order to \nhave money for special education. We have promised them 40 percent, but \nhave given them 11 percent. We are the cause of the terrible problems \nlocal schools have in trying to do what they can to improve their \nschool systems.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is the language:\n\n       . . . to carry out effective approaches to reducing class \n     size with highly qualified teachers to improve educational \n     achievement of both regular and special needs children.\n\n  That is defined as ``providing professional development to teachers, \nincluding special education teachers and teachers of special-needs \nchildren. . . .'' We already have it. The local school communities are \ncommitted to making their own judgment and decision. Why are we turning \nthat all over, Mr. President, now in the final hours of this? It makes \nabsolutely no sense whatsoever. The special needs community supported \nthat amendment last year.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Under the prior order, we are now on amendment \nNo. 64. There are 5 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Am I correct that the 5 minutes is for debate only?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, the 5 minutes is for debate \nonly. It is equally divided.\n  Who yields time? The 5 minutes is equally divided.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the Murray amendment. Senator \nMurray is not here today, due to a death in the family, otherwise, she \nwould be making the presentation at this particular time.\n  Basically, the Murray amendment builds on what was agreed to in the \nbudget last October by providing 6 years of funding. It gives certainty \nto school boards all across the country that we are making a national \ncommitment to see smaller class size in schools all across the Nation.\n  In the President's budget, there is $11 billion that is effectively \nallocated for this particular purpose. It follows the pattern that was \nagreed to last year that states if a particular district has already \nachieved 18 students, they can use the funds for professional \nenhancement or for special needs children. That is why it has the \nsupport of the special education community.\n  This amendment has the wholehearted support of all the school boards, \nof all the parent-teacher organizations, of the school teachers and \nlocal authorities across the Nation. It is a major national effort to \ntry to get smaller class sizes.\n  We are going to need 2 million teachers over the next 10 years. This \nis only going to provide 100,000, but it will make sure that they are \nwell-qualified teachers. It will place support the early grades, which \nought to be our priority. I hope it will be accepted.\n  It also includes, Mr. President, the sense of the Senate that the \nbudget resolution shall include an annual increase for the IDEA part B \nand funding so that the program can be fully funded within the next 5 \nyears. So, we are committed to that as well. And it also says these \nincreases shall not come at the expense of the other education \nprograms.\n  If you support this amendment, you are also supporting a commitment \nto fund the IDEA over the period of the next 5 years.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will not support the amendment offered \nby my colleagues from Washington and Massachusetts.\n  First and foremost, the 100,000 teacher proposal is flawed. It puts \nquantity over quality. There is little or no emphasis on improving \nteacher quality in the proposal. Yet, the research shows with certainty \nthat the quality of the teacher leading the class is significantly more \nimportant than the size of the class.\n  Furthermore, adopting a new, untested, multi-billion dollar program \nwithout hearings or local input is no way to make good public policy. \nWe have begun the process of reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, and we should examine this proposal during consideration \nof that bill. I give my assurance to my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle that I intend to fully examine this question. But the proper \nway to do it is under the orderly committee process. We are in the \nmiddle of that right now. We have begun the process of reauthorizing \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and this issue should be \nappropriately addressed during this process.\n  So I inform my colleagues that I will, at the time of the vote, move \nto table the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenator Murray, Senator Kennedy and others in introducing this Class \nSize Reduction amendment, which builds on last years successful effort \ntowards reducing class sizes in grades 1-3 to 18 or fewer students \nnationwide. Last year, President Clinton proposed this historic \ninitiative and Congress approved a down payment on this request last \nyear, providing a $1.2 billion appropriation to help communities hire \napproximately 30,000 teachers nationwide.\n  Under the initiative enacted into law last year, school districts \nwill begin to receive funding this July 1 in order to hire teachers to \nbegin reducing class size this fall. While last year's appropriation \nprovided an important start on this seven year initiative, the \namendment before us gives us a chance to support effective local \nplanning by giving school districts the confidence they need that \nfunding will be available under this initiative for future years.\n  The average U.S. class size is 24 students with some as high as 30 \nstudents per class. A consensus of research indicates that students \nattending small classes in the early grades make more rapid educational \nprogress than students in larger classes and that those achievement \ngains persist through at least the middle grades. More specifically, \nclass size reduction leads to enhanced teacher-student quality \nrelationships, higher student achievement, solid foundation for further \nstudent learning, and the ability of students to read independently by \nthe end of the 3rd grade.\n  Mr. President, there are 3,750 schools in my state of Michigan. Some \nof these schools have been fortunate enough to reduce some of their \nclasses in the early grades. Last month, I visited about a dozen of \nthem, witnessing first\n\n[[Page S2559]]\n\nhand the benefits of smaller classes. I also visited several of the \nnumerous schools in my state that are disadvantaged by large class \nsizes. For example, at the Calvin Britain Elementary School in Benton \nHarbor, where the student to teacher ratio is higher than the national \naverage, teachers worry that they are not able to identify their \nstudents' learning needs. When I asked 2nd grade teacher Louise \nHufnagel what it would mean to reduce her class of 26 down to 17 or 18, \nshe said, ``It would make a world of difference. A lot of the children \nhave special needs and it would make it easier to give them the \nindividual attention they need.''\n  At East Leonard Elementary School in Grand Rapids, principal Tina \nBarwacz said she is convinced that lower class size improves academic \nperformance. Teachers there are now giving more personalized attention \nto their students because their classes are smaller. Third grade \nteacher Dan Mayhew, with 17 students this year down from 23 last year, \nsays that now he can get to each student more often and make sure the \nindividual masters the standards and the core curriculum. Another third \ngrade teacher, Sharon Uminski, with 17 students this year, down from 28 \nlast year, says she gets to know her class better, including learning \nfaster students strengths and weaknesses. She went on to say that it \nalso allows her to initiate remedial education in a subject when \nnecessary on an individual basis; and that she encounters less \ndiscipline problems resulting in more class time for instruction. First \nGrade teacher Teresa Guinnup who had 25 students last year and 17 this \nyear says now she can talk to each child and check his or her ability. \nThe students told me that they like smaller class sizes because it was \neasier to concentrate, there was more room and some kids get to sit at \ntheir own desk.\n  At Winchell Elementary School in Kalamazoo where some classes have \ngone from 29 down to 17, teachers are seeing major improvements in \ntheir pupil's reading skills. First grade teacher, Mary Trotter, who \nhad 28 students last year and has 19 this year said, ``I'm able to give \nchildren much more individual help. It's a dream.'' First grade teacher \nKitty Wunderlin who had 29 students last year and 19 this year, said \n``it is divine to have 19 students. I can give them one to one \nattention. With 29 students I felt overwhelmed.'' And, first grade \nteacher Kathie Gibson told me, ``I've seen great gains in my students \nreading skills this year.''\n  In Lansing, at Harley Frank Elementary School, kindergarten teacher \nMrs. Zimmerman, who has been teaching for 34 years and who last year \nplanned to retire until she heard class sizes were going to be reduced, \nsaid that she now has more control over her class, the kids are happier \nand more adjusted and in short, they are able to learn more. With \nsmaller classes, teachers can assess each student's progress in a more \ntimely manner and students develop more interest in learning, all of \nwhich create higher student achievement.\n  Many other direct experiences of teachers and students were shared \nwith me. For instance, at Merrill Community Elementary school in Flint, \nwhich started a class downsizing program five years ago for grades K-4. \nBefore this program began, their student to teacher ratio was 30-1. One \nteacher, Mrs. Stephanie Thibault told me that ``having 30 first and \nsecond graders in a classroom was overwhelming and exhausting.'' \nTeachers would literally find themselves counselling some of their \nstudents in the hallways because their buildings and classrooms were so \novercrowded. After the implementation of their new program, that ratio \nchanged to 17 students to 1 teacher, and listen to the difference \nexpressed by Mrs. Thibault. She exclaims ``As a teacher, my role has \nexpanded beyond instruction. Having a 17-1 ratio allows me to know my \nstudents and their families better, allows me to personalize learning \ntasks for each child and it gives me opportunities to provide one-on-\none help. Students benefit because they receive the attention and \ncaring they deserve.''\n  Because of a class size reduction program, Mrs. Thibault can now give \nstudents the instruction they deserve. Isn't that exactly what we \nshould strive for? Our teachers should not be overwhelmed and exhausted \nat the end of each day. Our students should not be competing with each \nother to get the attention of their teachers. Each child deserves that \nattention and caring that teachers like Mrs. Thibault can provide. But \nsome teachers are not capable of providing that teaching environment. \nToo many of our classrooms are spilling out into the hallways and until \nwe change this by reducing class size, our young people will be at a \ndisadvantage.\n  When we reduce class size, we not only help our teachers and \nstudents, but we meet needs of parents whose children are learning more \nand performing better in school. When the program to reduce class size \nfirst began in the Flint Community School District, test scores for \nstudents were low. For the 1994-95 school year, only 8 percent of the \nstudents at Merrill Elementary passed the ``Reading/Story'' portion of \nthe Michigan Education Assessment Program, the MEAP test. For that same \nyear, only 26 percent passed the ``Reading/Info'' section and just 10 \npercent passed the Math portion of the MEAP test. Since the \nimplementation of the program, the students at Merrill Elementary \nschool have seen their scores rise dramatically, and I'm not just \ntaking about a couple of percentage points. Last school year, after \njust 4 years of smaller class sizes, 54 percent of those elementary \nstudents passed the ``Reading/Story'' portion of the test, an increase \nof 45 percent. In addition, 70 percent of Merrill elementary students \npassed the ``Reading/Info'' portion, a 44 percent increase and 55 \npercent passed the ``Math'' section of the MEAP test, a 44 percent \nincrease. In just a few years, these students were receiving more \nattention in a better academic environment and were simply, learning \nmore.\n  Let's take the important lessons from these elementary schools in \nMichigan and apply them to this legislation. We must start reducing \nclass sizes now. If we fail to pass this amendment, reducing class \nsize, we fail the students of Michigan and the rest of the nation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor \nof the Murray/Kennedy Class Size Amendment. This amendment continues a \nmajor six year effort to help local school districts hire 100,000 \nteachers nationally. It is one the most important pieces of legislation \nthe Senate will consider this year. This amendment will strengthen our \nschools today and build a framework for the future.\n  Last year we made a down payment by including $1.2 billion in the \nbudget for class size. This year, we must continue the fight for our \nschools and the fight for our kids. We must give our schools the \nsupport they need to lower class size. We must get behind our kids by \npassing this critical legislation.\n  Last year, we worked together in a bipartisan fashion to reduce class \nsize in the FY99 Omnibus Appropriations Act. Last year we got $1.2 \nbillion in the Omnibus to reduce class size using highly qualified \nteachers. Nationally, this allowed us to hire some 30,000 new teachers \nthis year. My state of Maryland alone received $17.5 million and will \nget about 425 new teachers this summer.\n  Mr. President, I have visited these classrooms and I have talked to \nthese kids. These children have told me over and over again that they \nwant to learn. They have told me they need more individualized \nattention. I have received letters from kids in school who are begging \nfor our help. They tell me their schools are overcrowded and the \nteachers can't control the large classrooms. They tell me they are \nscared to go to school and that they can't learn because the teachers \nare too busy trying to manage the overcrowded classes.\n  Mr. President, this is a sad time for our students. A child should \nnever fear going to school. We need to work and work hard to ensure \nthat our efforts are not short circuited because of politics. I have \ntold many teachers and students about the important strides we made \nlast year to make sure they will have smaller and more effective \nclassrooms. These children are excited about having more opportunities \nto learn. They are eager to learn to read and learn about science and \ntechnology. They are excited about all the wonderful possibilities that \nlie ahead for them with a proper education. But we need to do more. By \npassing this amendment today, we in the Senate\n\n[[Page S2560]]\n\nhave an opportunity to prove our commitment to education.\n  Efforts are already underway in my state of Maryland to reduce class \nsize. I have heard from at least five counties in my state that they \nhave class reduction programs already in place or in development. The \nschools in Montgomery County, Maryland, for example, are reducing class \nsize for reading at the primary grade level. In the primary grades, \nthey have started a program where there are only 15 students per \nteacher for a 90 minute reading block. They are also reducing class \nsize in math at the middle and high school levels and have added an \nextra math teacher to each school to ensure success in algebra. I \napplaud these efforts, but they need federal help to do more.\n  These programs started this school year and are being phased in over \nthe next three years focusing initially on low-performing schools. And \ndo you know what these programs will do? They will prepare Maryland \nkids for the new millennium. They will prepare our children to go onto \ncollege and gain the important skills they will need in the future. \nThese class reduction programs are the building blocks that will help \nprepare our kids to be our future leaders.\n  The American people are counting on us to help fix an education \nsystem which failed so many children. Our education system has been \nignored for far too long. If we don't pass this amendment today, we are \nsending the wrong message to the American public. Because of our \nefforts last year, our schools will be able to hire new teachers this \nsummer. If we don't pass this amendment, we are telling those school \nthat we are not committed to improving America's education system. We \nneed to continue this effort to provide 100,000 new teachers for \nAmerica. Let's get behind our kids and pass this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Do I have any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 minute. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has no time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 66\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, we will now debate \nLott amendment No. 66 with 5 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is very similar to the amendment we \npreviously voted on, referred to as the Lott-Jeffords amendment. The \npending amendment would amend the class size reduction provisions of \nthe fiscal year 1999 Department of Education Appropriations Act to \nexpand the choices available to local school officials. They would have \nthe opportunity to determine whether hiring teachers or educating \nchildren with disabilities is a greater need for their schools, and to \nspend the additional funds accordingly.\n  I am sure that many areas would choose to hire teachers, although I \nstrongly suspect that most communities in my home State would choose to \nuse their funds for IDEA. A number of small States are already at the \nlevel of teachers they need, but we are grossly underfunded in taking \ncare of our special needs children. I have heard many times during my \ntrips home, that the current level of funding for IDEA falls far short \nof the 40 percent we promised in 1975. Full funding of IDEA would offer \nlocal school officials the flexibility in their budgets to develop \ndropout prevention or other programs that best meet the needs of their \ncommunities. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is very difficult to hear. The Senate is \nnot in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment and do \nso with a sense of some regret. I offered an amendment a year ago with, \nin fact, Senator Coverdell, our colleague from Georgia, on the $7 tax \nbreak proposal as an alternative where real money--$1.6 billion--would \ngo toward IDEA.\n  I think all of us appreciate the fact that many of us over the years \nwanted to raise our level of support for that program. But in this \nparticular issue, to kind of ask in a sense that we now take needed \ndollars to try to bring down class size and throw this item in--by the \nway, I lost on that amendment where we would have had $1.6 billion for \nIDEA. I got voted down on that proposal. Here we have a real issue of \nclass size.\n  One of the major problems in IDEA is the learning disabilities. Two-\nthirds of IDEA kids are learning disabled; primarily speech, and \nlanguage is the second disorder. That problem is not discovered until \nthe third or fourth grade in most schools. You don't discover that with \na younger child.\n  The irony here, in a sense, is that we are trying to reduce class \nsize, which is what the underlying amendment would do, so that you try \nto avoid the problems from being created in the first place. Here we \nare sort of competing against each other. We have a legitimate issue \nthat we are trying to get dollars into, and that is to reduce class \nsize. To the extent that we do that, we are going to reduce the IDEA \nproblem. That is what we ought to be trying to do, instead of creating \nthis false choice out here, in a sense. If you can choose between these \ndollars, clearly, in many communities, because it is a tax issue, they \nare going to go with IDEA. The underlying problem with IDEA gets \naddressed if we reduce the class size.\n  I urge my colleagues in this particular case--after we increased by \n$500 million last year IDEA funding--that we reject the amendment. Do \nwhat we can in this partnership and bring down class size, which is \nwhat most Americans would like us to do across the board, and still \nwork on the IDEA issue and reducing the obligations there.\n  For those reasons, I urge the rejection of this amendment.\n\n[[Page S2561]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I point out that all we are doing is \ngiving flexibility to States like Wyoming, North Dakota, Vermont, and \nother States that are already at the reduced class size. Why not let \nthem spend it for IDEA, which is grossly underfunded? That is where the \nmoney is really needed. That is where the kids will be helped.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Mississippi.

We are now on amendment No. 63. There are 5 \nminutes equally divided for debate. But before we begin that, we will \nneed to get the attention of the Senate. Will Members in the well take \ntheir conversations to the Cloakroom?\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to commit the \nFederal Government to help local school districts deal with a very \nserious problem, the problem of students dropping out of school before \nthey graduate. There is no Federal program that is intended to resolve \nthis problem. I hear a lot of talk about how there are other Federal \nprograms. There is no Federal program that is funded that is intended \nto solve this problem. This amendment would help us do this.\n  Clearly, this is a major issue in all of our States.\n  This is particularly an important issue in our States where we have \nlarge numbers of Hispanic students. The dropout rate is 30 to 50 \npercent among that community.\n  I yield the rest of the time to the Senator from Nevada who is a \ncosponsor on this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have over 1 million people, men and \nwomen, in prison in this country. Let's round it off and say we have 1 \nmillion people in prison, and 820,000 of those people in prison, men \nand women, have not graduated from high school. If there were no better \nreason to do something about the dropout problem, that would be it. We \nhave to keep young men and women in school. Three thousand children \ndrop out of school every day, 500,000 a year. This amendment would do \nnothing to take away from local school districts absolute control as to \nhow they handle dropouts, but it would give them additional resources \nand assets they now do not have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am reluctant to oppose this amendment \nbecause I have such great empathy and sympathy for the problem, and, \nbecause I respect the Senator from New Mexico a great deal. We have \nworked together on so many programs and problems over the years, and we \nwill continue to do so. And I respect his judgment. However, to address \nthis issue at this time is not appropriate. This is a program already \nin existence, though obviously, not working well. The program is within \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I am dedicated to working \nclosely with the Senator from New Mexico to find out how and what we \nshould do to amend existing programs in order to have better dropout \nprograms. So I hope he would understand that, and that by opposing this \namendment, which I will move to table eventually, I am not doing \nanything other than saying wait--wait until we go through the \nreauthorization of the ESEA this year. We are going to hold hearings \nand make sure we do the best thing possible to solve the dropout \nproblem.\n  Right now, I cannot accept this amendment. I retain the remainder of \nmy time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, is there additional time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 minute. The \nSenator from New Mexico has no more time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. That is all the time that is available?\n  Mr. President, for the reasons that I have stated, I move to table \nthe amendment. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe motion was agreed to, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me explain what we intend to do on \nthis side of the aisle. I intend to arrange for a voice vote on the \nnext two amendments. They are Lott amendments. They are very similar to \nthe ones that we had before. I do not believe it is worthy of time to \nget votes on those, because that dye is well cast by the previous vote.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 67\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The amendment we have now is Lott No. 67. Fulfilling a\n\n[[Page S2562]]\n\npromise is not as exciting as raising new expectations with new \nprograms. We don't get much press coverage, presumably, for doing the \nright thing, but if we fulfill our obligation to fund IDEA, State and \nlocal agencies will be able to target their own resources toward their \nown, very real needs. These may be needs for afterschool activities, or \nfor dropouts, or for any number of the pressing needs facing our \nNation. All of this is going to be discussed in the reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  With that, Mr. President, I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Are there further remarks on \namendment No. 67?\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Just a point of information, is this the Boxer amendment \nthat the Senator has just spoken against?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. This is the Lott amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Fine, I will withhold.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask to vitiate the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 67.\n  The amendment (No. 67) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 65\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. In 2\\1/2\\ minutes I hope to \nconvince my colleagues to support this afterschool amendment.\n  The Senator from Vermont said it is not so exciting to fund new \nprograms. This is not a new program. This is a tried and true program. \nThis is a program that works. This is a program that we all agreed we \nwould spend $200 million on last year. The response in the community \nhas been overwhelmingly positive and we need to fund it at a greater \nlevel.\n  What we do in this amendment is authorize the same amount of funding \nthat the President has put in his budget; $600 million would \naccommodate over 1 million children. Look at these children, look at \ntheir faces, look at how they are involved with a mentor after school. \nAfter school programs keep children like them from getting into trouble \nby involving them in positive activities. We can see here, if we look \nat this chart, that the time when juvenile offenders commit violent \ncrimes is during the after school hours. You do not need a degree in \ncriminology or sociology or psychology to understand that youth \noffenders are more likely to commit crime or become involved in \ncriminal activity when they are home alone or unsupervised. We see \ncriminal activity among youth peaking here at 3 p.m., when schools let \nout. Gradually, as the hours move into the early evening and parents \ncome home, the peak drops. Additionally, law enforcement supports \nafterschool programs. We call this particular amendment an anticrime \namendment. It has been endorsed by police athletic leagues from across \nthe Nation. Members have been calling in favor of this amendment. Here \nis the list of the many law enforcement groups, just a handful of them, \nto show you how popular this program is.\n  Who supports afterschool programs in America? In a recent poll, \nAugust of 1998, 92 percent of Americans support afterschool programs. \nAfter school programs are anticrime, pro-education, pro-community, and \nmake common sense. Again, I hope Senators will vote in favor of \nafterschool programs. This is not a new program. I thank my colleagues \nfor their attention.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation \nto provide quality after school programs for our nation's youth. There \nare 23.5 million school-age children who have working parents, and of \nthese children, 5 to 7 million are considered ``latchkey'' kids, or \nchildren who are alone at some point in the day.\n  Mr. President, law enforcement statistics show that from the hours of \n3:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., students between the ages 12 to 17, are more \nlikely to commit violent acts or be the victims of violent activity. We \nknow that they are more likely to engage in these activities if young \npeople are without adult supervision. According to a report published \nby the U.S. Departments of Education and U.S. Department of Justice in \nJune of 1998, entitled Safe and Smart: Making After School Hours Work \nfor Kids, ``first and foremost, after school programs keep children of \nall ages safe and out of trouble.''\n  There is no question that after-school programs keep most kids out of \ntrouble, unfortunately, there are not enough of them to keep all kids \non the right track. According to findings of Mr. Herbert Moyer of the \nMichigan State Board of Education, which were published in the March \n10, 1999 Oakland Press:\n\n       More than 80 percent of parents want their children to \n     attend an after-school program, but only 30 percent of \n     elementary and middle schools offer such programs. After-\n     school hours are when juvenile crime rates triple and youth \n     without positive alternatives may do drugs, smoke, drink or \n     engage in sexual activity . . . eighth-graders who are left \n     unsupervised for 11 hours or more a week are twice as likely \n     to abuse drugs or alcohol as those under adult supervision.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment would make a substantial effort to \nresolve that problem. By increasing the appropriations for the 21st \nCentury Learning Centers program to $600 million, a three fold increase \nover last year's funding, public schools will be able to develop after \nschool centers for children that provide educational, recreational, \ncultural, health and social services. Specifically, activities and \nservices may include: Literacy programs, telecommunications and \ntechnology education programs, mentoring, academic assistance, job \nskills assistance, expanded library services, nutrition and health \nprograms, summer and weekend school programs, services to individuals \nwith disabilities, drug, alcohol, and gang prevention.\n  Last year, 21st Century Community Learning Centers grants were \nawarded to four school districts in my State. Schools in Armada, Benton \nHarbor, Grant Rapids and the Highland Park School have received these \ngrants. I would like to share with you some of the possibilities that \nthese grants can provide to local school districts around my state and \nnationwide.\n  In the Armada Area Schools, the district planned a virtual network of \nmiddle school computer centers (called ``clubhouse''). The centers are \nmeant to increase student engagement in learning through computer use; \nfoster collaboration among students, schools and communities; and \ndevelop a model of statewide collaboration through the sharing of \nresources.\n  The Benton Harbor Area Schools planned to partner up with local \ncommunity groups and Western Michigan University to provide Community \nLearning Centers, which are established to assist middle school \nstudents in developing literacy and technology skills and they plan, \nproduce, and present constructive projects that deal with community-\nwide issues such as poverty, violence, drug use, and teen pregnancy.\n  The Grand Rapids Public Schools planned to create four local Learning \nCenters in its middle schools. The program is designed to operate on \nafternoons, one evening per week, and several hours on Saturdays and \nprovide enrichment activities, recreational activities, parent and \nchild activities and community support activities.\n  The Highland Park School District, which collaborated with \ngovernment, nonprofit groups, and local universities, planned to create \ntwo Learning Centers in their area. At these centers, students and \ncommunity members can participate in academic programs, sports and \nrecreational activities, literacy and family recreational activities.\n  I would like to applaud the innovative ways in which Michigan \neducators have provided students with after school programs. These \nschool districts were selected for the 21st Century Learning Centers \ngrants because of their innovative projects in addressing their after-\nschool needs. And, let me say, Mr. President, that Michigan students \nand parents are lucky to have people like Kathleen Strauss, Vice \nPresident of the Michigan Board of\n\n[[Page S2563]]\n\nEducation, who has championed the cause of after-school programs for \nour youth for many years. We are also lucky to have such dedicated \neducators, especially in Armada, Benton Harbor, Grand Rapids and \nHighland Park, who have helped students gain access to computers and \nnew technologies, and to encourage student involvement in the \ncommunity.\n  I am pleased that Michigan schools are benefiting from these grants, \nand am hopeful that the model set by these school districts will \nencourage the establishment of similar initiatives in communities \nthroughout my state and the nation. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I rise today as an original cosponsor of Senator \nBoxer's After School Education and Anti Crime Amendment. I am very \npleased to support this important legislation with Senator Boxer. One \nof my highest priorities as Senator is to promote structured, \ncommunity-based after school activities to help kids stay safe. I will \nsupport this amendment for three reasons. First, there is a desperate \nneed in this country for constructive after school programs for our \nyouth. Second, it authorizes increased funding for after school \nprograms. Third, this amendment specifically includes Police Athletic \nLeagues as part of the after school effort.\n  Mr. President, America's youth needs our help. Kids need constructive \nafter school activities to keep their young minds healthy and active. \nIn many families today, both parents have to work. And that's if they \nare lucky enough to have two parents. Many kids are raised by single \nmoms who hold down one or more often, even two jobs just to make ends \nmeet. I talk to single moms in my state of Maryland who can barely get \nby. Many of them hold down steady jobs while trying to go to school. \nThey are trying to improve themselves so they can get better jobs and \ntake care of their families. These parents can't always be there after \nschool to supervise their children. They cannot leave their jobs at \n3:30 when school lets out. They cannot quit their jobs because even if \nthere are two parents working, they still need every dime.\n  So what do we tell these people to do with their kids after school? \nWhat if they aren't lucky enough to have grandparents or aunts and \nuncles to take care of the kids after school? Most of these parents \ncan't afford the high costs of day care. Do we just blame the parents \nwhen their kids get in trouble? No. This is a responsibility for us \nall. This situation presents a problem for us all. Gangs, drugs, and \nviolent crimes has become an epidemic among our children. These kids \nare the future of our country. One day, they will be our leaders. Here \nin Congress we have the ability and the duty to save our youth. And \nthis amendment helps communities build after school programs for our \nyouth.\n  I also support this amendment because it authorizes $600 million for \nafter school programs. This money will allow 1.1 million kids each year \nto go to an after school program. In the budget last year, we put $200 \nmillion in after school programs. Last year, we made the downpayment. \nThis year, the President has tripled that amount to $600 million. And \nwhat will this funding mean? It means that after school programs could \nget more space. They could hire more staff and add programs and \nservices. It means that these program can serve more young people.\n  Mr. President, I will also support this amendment because it \nspecifically includes Police Athletic Leagues as part of the after \nschool effort. I have made it a priority to do all I can to help the \nPAL programs in Maryland. We have 27 PAL centers in Baltimore, \nMaryland. The first PAL center in Maryland was in 1995, in northeastern \nBaltimore, located in a transformed convenience store. Our PAL centers \nwere not started with the help of the federal government. The success \nof this program is due to the hard work of the Baltimore Police \nDepartment and the support and involvement of members of the community. \nBut now it's time for the federal government to help fund the PAL \ncenters and the excellent work that they do.\n  The PAL centers provide adult role models for our kids. They promote \ncharacter & responsibility. The people there help kids with their \nhomework. They teach them about art, cultural activities and sports. \nThis is all part of our effort to get behind our kids and combat \njuvenile crime. PAL centers help to make our streets safe and give kids \nthe tools for success. These programs recognize that we need to give \nkids alternatives to the streets.\n  Mr. President, after school programs must be a priority. We don't \nhave the luxury of funding after school programs just because we want \nto do something extra for our kids. After school is not an extra \nanymore. After school programs are now a necessary fact of life. We \nneed to give kids a fighting chance. I will be fighting to enact this \nbill into law and I encourage all of my colleagues here to get behind \nour kids and vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will likely oppose this amendment \nbecause, again, this will be reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. Actually, this program is already part of the law in a \nway. It is the 21st Century Schools program I got in in 1994. The \nadministration has, by regulation, kind of changed it into an \nafterschool program. I do not mind that, but I think the 21st Century \nSchools was much broader and a better program. We can argue this out, \nand we will have hearings on it and evidence presented during the next \nfew weeks and months. At this point, I would have to oppose the Boxer \namendment, and eventually, after time runs out, I will move to table \nit.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California has 58 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President. I will take that time, if I \nmight. I knew I could speak fast, but I did not realize I had left all \nthat time.\n  Again, I say to my friend, this is a moment, an opportunity for us. \nWe have an education bill before the U.S. Senate. Why would we wait to \nput more teachers in the classroom? Why would we wait on afterschool \nprograms when, in fact, it is so necessary? Throughout America, people \nare asking us to act. If you go to the community and say, well, we are \nwaiting for a different vehicle to come before the Senate before we \naddress after school programs, they will look at you and say, wait a \nminute, we need these funds now. Our kids are getting into trouble \nafter school. We have an opportunity, with a good bill that Senator \nWyden has brought to us and Senator Frist, to make it even better. I \nurge my colleagues, please vote in favor of this amendment for \nafterschool programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, again, I just reiterate, this is not the \ntime to be arguing about this. The time is with reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. Therefore, I would strongly \nurge Members of both sides to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator ask for the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the motion to lay on the table the amendment \nof the Senator from California.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 68\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am going to now ask for a voice vote \non Lott amendment numbered 68. This is basically the same amendment we \nhave been voting on. I think I talked to the other side of the aisle \nand they have no reason not to have a voice vote.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays \non Lott amendment No. 68.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, let me explain this amendment. Like the \nprevious Lott amendment, this would amend the class size reduction \nprovisions of the fiscal year 1999 Department of Education \nAppropriations Act to expand the choices available to local school \nofficials. They would have the opportunity to determine whether hiring \nteachers or educating children with disabilities is a greater need in \nthe schools and spend the additional funds accordingly.\n  I am sure that many areas will choose to hire teachers, although I \nstrongly suspect that most communities in my home State would choose to \nuse their funds for IDEA, special education. If a locality has a \nplentiful supply of unemployed qualified teachers and lacks only the \nfunds to hire them, that locale will use the $1.2 billion to hire \nteachers. If that is not the case, those funds will be put to better \nuse by supporting existing efforts to educate special education \nstudents.\n  I urge my colleagues support this amendment. I retain the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to make it crystal clear that I am \nnot in favor of amending IDEA in any significant way, now or in the \nnear future. In the last Congress, members of both the House and the \nSenate worked hard to bring all sides together to reauthorize IDEA. \nNow, Congress owes children and families across the country the most \neffective possible implementation of this legislation.\n  The amendments enacted in 1997 were the product of comprehensive, \nbipartisan negotiations involving Congress and the Administration, with \nextensive public input. The final product involved compromises on many \nsensitive and complex issues, and it has been widely recognized as a \nsignificant improvement of this landmark legislation, to protect the \nrights of 6 million children to a free, appropriate public education. \nThe Department of Education moved quickly to propose regulations, and \nthe final regulations are expected this Friday.\n  In many communities, schools are only just beginning to use the tools \nthat are available to them under current law in cases where \ndisciplinary action is warranted for a disabled student. Schools have \nbroad power to develop and implement behavioral intervention plans for \nchildren with disabilities, and to use early intervention in ways that \ncan avoid the need for disciplinary actions at all.\n  The 1997 changes in the law and the implementation of the regulations \nunder it must be given a chance to work. At this point, it is clearly \npremature to make substantive changes in the statute. The goal of this \nCongress should be to give all children the educational opportunity to \npursue their goals and dreams. We should not prematurely undermine the \nimplementation of this landmark legislation.\n  Mr. President, for the reasons outlined earlier, we were prepared to \nmove towards a voice vote.\n  There is one change in terms of the IDEA regulations. There will be \nsome IDEA regulations with regard to discipline that have been included \nin this amendment that are generally not objectionable. However, since \nit does effectively undermine the previous agreement, I hope it would \nnot be accepted.\n  Mr. President, I have three letters--one from the National Parent \nNetwork on Disabilities, the Disability Rights Education and Defense \nFund, and the National Organization on Mental Retardation--from \norganizations that are opposed to this amendment, and I ask unanimous \nconsent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Parent Network\n\n\n                                              on Disabilities,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1999.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the board and members of \n     the National Parent Network on Disabilities (NPND) we are \n     opposed to any amendments to the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) now or in the near future. \n     In the last Congress, members of both the House and Senate \n     worked hard to bring all sides together to pass the \n     rauthorization of IDEA. The vote in both Houses was near \n     unanimous in favor of reauthorization.\n       Tomorrow the regulations to implement this law will be \n     promulgated. With these regulations there is an opportunity \n     to move forward with full implementation of the law. Congress \n     owes the children and families across the country the most \n     effective possible implementation of this legislation.\n       The amendments which were enacted on June 4, 1997 were the \n     product of comprehensive, bipartisan negotiations involving \n     both chambers of Congress and the Administration, with \n     extensive public input. The final product, which involved \n     compromises on many sensitive and complex issues, has been \n     widely recognized as a significant improvement of this \n     landmark legislation, which protects the rights of 6 million \n     children to a free, appropriate public education.\n       In many communities, schools are only just beginning to use \n     the tools that are available to them under current law in \n     cases where disciplinary action is warranted for a disabled \n     student. Schools have broad power to develop and implement \n     behavioral interventions plans for children with \n     disabilities, and to use early intervention in ways that can \n     avoid the need for disciplinary actions at all.\n       The NPND represents 147 organizations nationwide that serve \n     parents and families of students with disabilities. NPND \n     provides a voice and a presence at the national level to \n     influence public policy on behalf of its constituents. NPND \n     is opposed to any amendments to IDEA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Patricia M. Smith,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Disability Rights Education\n\n\n                                       and Defense Fund, Inc.,\n\n                                                   March 11, 1999.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy, the Disability Rights and Education \n     Fund (DREDF), is an organization which specializes in \n     disability, civil rights and education law. We are strongly \n     opposed to any amendments to the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).\n       In the last Congress, the House and Senate worked hard in a \n     bipartisan manner to bring all sides together to pass the \n     reauthorization of IDEA. The amendments which were enacted on \n     June 4, 1997 were the product of intense negotiations \n     involving both chambers of Congress and the Administration, \n     with extensive public input. Parents, family members, \n     educators, administrators and legal scholars came together \n     week after week prior to passage to provide input to assist \n     in crafting this landmark legislation which protects the \n     rights of 6 million children to a free, appropriate public \n     education.\n       The final regulations for IDEA are going to be promulgated \n     tomorrow. With these regulations, we expect full \n     implementation and enforcement of the law. We believe that it \n     is imperative that Congress allow this law to be implemented \n     on behalf of these students nationwide.\n       One of the major points of contention in the \n     reauthorization was the subject of discipline. Section 615 of \n     IDEA reflected very carefully crafted language dealing with \n     discipline. In many communities, schools are only beginning \n     to use the tools that are available to them under Section 615 \n     in cases where disciplinary action is warranted for a \n     disabled student. Schools have broad power\n\n[[Page S2565]]\n\n     to develop and implement behavioral intervention plans for \n     children with disabilities.\n       Please, as you have done so many times before, continue to \n     fight to protect the rights of children with disabilities and \n     their families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Patrisha Wright,\n     Director of Governmental Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     The Arc of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Governmental Affairs Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1999.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Ranking Minority Leader, Health, Education, Labor and \n         Pensions Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy, it has come to the attention of The \n     Arc that the Senate intends to vote on the Ed-Flex \n     legislation, S. 280, today. Much to our chagrin, a last \n     second amendment which would amend the discipline provisions \n     of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has been \n     added to S. 280. While we know that IDEA funding has been \n     heavily debated during consideration of this bill, there has \n     been no debate on the IDEA discipline provisions. Amending \n     IDEA at this time and under this circumstance is absolutely \n     unacceptable to the disability community and The Arc. The \n     last Congress, after more than 2 years of intense \n     negotiation, made major changes to the IDEA discipline \n     provisions. These provisions have not had a chance to be \n     fully understood and implemented since we still do not have \n     the final regulations to implement these complicated \n     provisions. Further amending IDEA this way is fraught with \n     danger and will lead to considerable more confusion in the \n     education and special education communities. It is simply not \n     the time and the Ed-Flex bill is not the place to amend IDEA. \n     Thus, we reluctantly recommend you oppose final passage of \n     the Ed-Flex bill.\n       We thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Lorraine Sheehan,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to yield to the Senator from \nMissouri, Senator Ashcroft, so that he can explain a provision that he \ndrafted for Amendment No. 68, an amendment that he and I have offered \nto the Ed-Flex bill.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Majority Leader for this opportunity to \ngive an explanation of the provision.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is my understanding that the Senator from Missouri's \nprovision makes an important clarification to a discipline provision \nwithin the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, that is correct. I am proposing this provision in \nresponse to specific concerns I have heard from Missourians.\n  Mr. President, a message that I am hearing from parents and teachers \nand students is the issue of school discipline. For the past few months \nmy staff and I have been looking into this issue to see if there are \nchanges that can and should be made to the Individuals with \nDisabilities Act Reauthorization legislation, in order to give local \nschools the flexibility they need to apply disciplinary measures in a \nfair, uniform, and logical manner. I will have more to say on this \nissue when the Senate takes up the reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act.\n  But one issue has come to my attention that I believe Congress should \naddress right now, and it involves the issue of a school's ability to \ndiscipline IDEA students who carry or possess weapons to or at schools.\n  Mr. President, I have proposed a provision within Amendment No. 68 \nwhich makes an important addition to a provision in the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act. The revision I propose will ensure \nthat the IDEA legislation accurately reflects the intent of Congress \nthat schools should have the ability to place a child with a disability \nin an alternative setting for discipline situations involving weapons.\n  Specifically, this provision revises the law to explicitly allow a \nschool to place a child with a disability in an appropriate interim \nalternative educational setting for up to 45 days if the child carries \na weapon to or possesses a weapon at school, on school premises, or to \nor at a school function. Currently, the law says that a school could \ntake such action only if the child carries a weapon to school or to a \nschool function.\n  The problem with the current statutory language is that it creates an \nunintended loophole which could prevent a school from placing a child \nin an alternative placement if the child at question is in possession \nof a weapon.\n  Some school boards in my state have expressed concerns about the \nlanguage in the IDEA reauthorization allowing a 45 day change in \nplacement of a child who ``carries'' a weapon to school. Schools want \nto know whether that language means they can change the placement of a \nchild whom they found to be in ``possession'' of a weapon, as well as a \nchild found to be simply ``carrying'' the weapon to school. They are \nafraid that the language of the statute sets up a distinction that is \ngoing to create a big loophole which kids can jump through to avoid the \n45 day change in placement.\n  Right now, there is a situation in a school district in my state \ninvolving two students, both with individualized education programs \n(IEPs). I have been asked not to name the specific school district at \nissue because proceedings are still pending on this matter. But here \nare the facts: Student A carried a weapon into the school and gave it \nto Student B, who then put the weapon into his (Student B's) locker. \nThe school knew that it could put Student A into an alternative \nplacement, since Student A literally ``carried `` the weapon into \nschool. But could the school also change Student B's placement, since \ntechnically he didn't ``carry'' the weapon into school, but instead was \nsimply ``possessing'' it?\n  The school went ahead and also placed Student B in an alternative \nplacement as well. However, the school is now worried that at the \npending proceeding, Student B will raise the issue of ``carrying'' as \nopposed to ``possessing'' the weapon. The school says that it doesn't \nknow how it will be able to get around an argument from the child or \nhis parent that the child did not literally carry the weapon to school.\n  Surely Congress did not intend to set up such a situation in the 1997 \nIDEA reauthorization. Surely we intended that schools have the ability \nto place a child in an alternative setting for up to 45 days if the \nchild possessed a weapon on school premises, as well as carried a \nweapon to the school. And this is why we should pass this amendment: to \nensure that schools have the ability to take the appropriate measures \nagainst students when weapons are involved.\n  I would like to point out that even the Department of Education has \nacknowledged that the current statutory language ``carries a weapon to \nschool or to a school function'' is ambiguous, and that it was the \nclear intent of Congress to cover instances in which the child is found \nto be in possession of a weapon at school.\n  Now this amendment, if passed, would not apply to the school district \nin Missouri that is facing this dilemma, since that is a pending case. \nBut we would be addressing this problem for any future situations, \nproviding the clarity that schools, parents, and children need.\n  Mr. President, schools, teachers, principals, and administrators want \nand need to be able to treat all students on a uniform basis when \nweapons are involved. We need to be sure that our laws allow a school \nto remove any student from the regular classroom if that student is \nfound with a weapon at school. We need to close up any loopholes in the \nlaw that would prevent a school from taking this immediate action to \nmaintain a safe learning environment for our students.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join with me in making \nthis vital addition to the IDEA law, so that schools will be able to \nexercise the authority we intended to give them to maintain a safe \nschool environment for all our children.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, this is an amendment which I think \neveryone would agree is an appropriate amendment regarding the rules \nwith respect to discipline and carrying a weapon into a school. A \ndecision was made, that the law only applied to those individuals who \ncarried a weapon to the school. But, if the weapon was in the \npossession of someone within the school, the law did not apply. This \nwould make sure that possession, as well as carrying it in, is a \nviolation.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 61\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SMITH of Oregon). There are now 5 minutes \nevenly divided on amendment No. 61.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to share my 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes with Senator Dorgan. The amendment before the body right now is \na combined amendment. My amendment is on social promotion and provides \nfunding for--\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, may we have order the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before the body is a combination \namendment with Senator Dorgan. It is remedial education and a report \ncard amendment. He will speak on the report card provisions. My \namendment is on social promotion and remedial education. I hope this is \none area this body can agree on; that is, the practice, formal or \ninformal, of promoting youngsters from grade to grade when they \nsometimes don't even attend school and often fail classes. That is not \nthe way to educate young people in the United States of America.\n  Increasingly, States are doing away with the practice of social \npromotion and providing standards and enabling school districts to \nimplement those standards in the basic core curriculum--reading, \nwriting, math, and social sciences.\n  This amendment tries to provide Federal incentives and Federal help \nfor the remedial education that is necessary to make the abolition of \nthe policy of social promotion a realistic possibility.\n  So it would authorize $500 million to school districts for remedial \neducation for afterschool, summer school, intensive intervention for \nstudents who are failing or at risk of failing. As a condition of \nreceiving the funds, the school districts would have to adopt a policy \nthat prohibits social promotion. District would have to require \nstudents to meet academic standards. And they would test students for \nachievement.\n  Now, I think the problem is clear. This course of least resistance, \nof simply promoting youngsters, has really led to declining test \nscores, failure, frustration, and certainly the inability of many to \neven fill out an employment application to be able to get a job after \ngraduation.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, could we have order in the Chamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  So I feel very strongly that the linchpin of reform of the public \neducation system is the elimination of social promotion. But if you \neliminate it and you do not provide any help for failing students, it \nwill not work. So this is a small authorization, $500 million to help \nthose students and not just leave them languishing. I very much hope \nthat both sides of the aisle will vote for it.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am sorry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to my good friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The second half of this amendment would allow for the opportunity to \nhave a standardized report card on schools--not students, schools. What \ndoes it mean if your child gets the best grades in the worst school in \nthe school district? We know about our children. Our children bring \nhome report cards every 6 weeks or 9 weeks. We don't know about our \nschools.\n  Do you get a report card on your school? You sure don't. Oh, there \nare some 30 States that call for a certain kind of report card. Most \nparents have never seen one. This would suggest that parents ought to \nbe able to understand what they have received from that school with the \ninvestment they have made. How does that school compare to other \nschools? How does your State compare to other States?\n  That is what this report card proposal would do. It would say, let's \ndo for schools what we do for students, and let's allow parents the \nopportunity to understand how well their school does in educating \nchildren.\n  I have been joined by Senator Bingaman in offering this amendment. We \nhave added it to the Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise in opposition and \nalso will move to table after I finish. But I oppose it only because it \nshould be in the reauthorization act which we are doing for elementary \nand secondary education. I promise my colleagues that I will work with \nthem to improve programs that make sure that we do a better job in \nending the problems we have with so-called social promotion.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty seconds.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will yield it back.\n  I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There are now 5 minutes evenly divided on the \nWellstone amendment. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, following is a list of requirements \nthis amendment will make unwaivable under Ed-Flex: providing \nopportunities for all children to meet challenging achievement levels; \nusing learning approaches that meet the needs of historical underserved \npopulations, including girls and women; provide instruction by highly \nqualified professional staff; provide professional development for \nteachers and aides to enable all children in the school to meet the \nState's student performance standards.\n  I am for flexibility, but we ought to also have, in addition, \naccountability. These are the core requirements of the title I program \nas a part of ESEA passed in 1965. There is a reason for these core \nrequirements. We want to make sure that there will be no loophole so \nthat we give protection to poor children in this country. Right now, \nthis ed flexibility bill, unless this amendment is agreed to, creates a \nloophole whereby a State could allow a school district to be exempt \nfrom these basic core requirements, which is our effort as a national \ncommunity to make sure that poor children have educational \nopportunities.\n  The Ed-Flex bill, if this amendment is not agreed to, could take away \nopportunities for poor children. I ask for your support in relation to \ntitle I, in relation to the vocational education program. This is the \nright thing to do. If this amendment is not agreed to, this piece of \nlegislation will not be a step forward for low-income children in \nAmerica. It will be a great leap backward.\n  Please support this amendment, colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am sorry that I must disagree with the \nwords of my colleague and member of my committee.\n  Ed-Flex, as it currently operates, demands accountability of \nparticipating States. It is important to keep in mind that \naccountability has been a part of Ed-Flex since its inception, and the \nmanager's package builds upon those strong accountability provisions. \nThe manager's package, adopted last week, adds the following \naccountability features: State Ed-Flex applications must be coordinated \nwith the title I plan or with the State's comprehensive reform plan; \nemphasis on school and student performance; requires additional \nreporting by the Secretary regarding rationale for approving waiver \nauthority.\n  It is very important to keep in mind that the Department of \nEducation, the Secretary, is the entity that determines whether or not \na State qualifies as an Ed-Flex State. That is retained.\n  The September 1998 GAO report stated:\n\n       The recent flexibility initiatives increase the amount of \n     information districts need, rather than simplifying or \n     streamlining information on Federal requirements. Federal \n     flexibility efforts neither reduce districts' financial \n     obligations nor provide additional dollars.\n\n  For those reasons, I ask my colleagues to oppose the Wellstone \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Minnesota yield back the \nbalance of his time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I move to table the Wellstone amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe we are through with the list of \namendments and we will be ready to go to final passage.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, the Senate after this \nvote will be finished for the day. We will not have any recorded votes \non Friday, and because we have been able to work out an agreement on \nhow to proceed on the national missile defense issue, we will not have \nany recorded votes on Monday either. We will be on the bill. We worked \nit out where we would not have to have a cloture vote on the motion to \nproceed. I think this is a positive. I want to commend the Democratic \nleader for working with us on that.\n  Also, before we vote, I want to say how pleased I am that we have \ncompleted this Education Flexibility Act. The managers of the bill have \ndone a good job. We have been through all these votes today and we are \ngoing to complete this legislation, and the story will be that the \nSenate passed a bipartisan education bill that is going to help the \nchildren at the local level.\n  I commend all who have been involved with it, and I am pleased that, \nas a result of that, we will not have to have recorded votes on Friday \nor Monday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to vote for the Jeffords \nsubstitute to the Ed-Flex bill today because it is a small step forward \nin improving the federal, state, and local partnerships in education. \nIt helps to guarantee that accountability goes hand in hand with \nflexibility, and that increased flexibility will in fact lead to \nimproved student achievement.\n  But I'm concerned that we are not fulfilling the 7-year commitment we \nmade only a few months ago to help communities reduce class size. It \nmakes no sense to take a small step forward by passing Ed-Flex, and a \ngiant step backward by breaking the class size commitment.\n  The National Parents and Teachers Association, the American \nFederation of Teachers, the Council of Chief State School Officers, and \nthe National Education Association strongly oppose the Lott Amendment, \nbecause it undermines the commitment to class size reduction that was \napproved with broad bipartisan support only a few months ago, and \nbecause it pits class size reduction against helping disabled children.\n\n[[Page S2568]]\n\n  Congress made a specific promise last fall to help schools hire \n100,000 new teachers over the next seven years to reduce class size. We \nshould keep that promise, not undermine it, and not put it in \ncompetition with IDEA.\n  School districts can't choose to do what is right for some children \nand not for others. They must--and do--serve all children. They need a \nfederal helping hand to make sure all children get a good education. We \nshould not force communities to choose between smaller classes and \nstudents with special needs. Pitting one child against another is \nwrong. We should meet our commitment to improving education for all \nchildren.\n  Nothing is more important on the calendar of schools right now than \ntheir budgets. Over the next few weeks, schools across the country will \nbe making major decisions on their budgets for the next school year. \nAnd in many of these communities, the budgets are due by early April. \nIn Memphis, school budgets are due on March 22. In Fayette County, \nKentucky, school budgets are due on March 31. In Boston, Savannah, Las \nVegas, and Houston, school budgets are due in the first week of April. \nIn San Francisco, they are due by April 1. In Council Bluffs, Iowa, \nschool budgets are due April 15th. In Altoona, Pennsylvania, school \nbudgets are due in April.\n  Communities can't do it alone. They want the federal government to be \na strong partner in improving their schools--not sit on the sidelines--\nand certainly not break its promises to help.\n  The Senate should not turn its back on our promise to help \ncommunities reduce class size in the early grades. We need to act now, \nso that communities can plan effectively for the full seven years. No \nschool can hire teachers one year at a time. That makes no sense. \nCommunities want to reduce class size--and they need to be sure that \nCongress will do its part to help them over the long term, as we \npromised.\n  I intend to vote for the final Ed-Flex bill to move this defective \nlegislation to the next stage, where I hope we can reach a satisfactory \ncompromise.\n  Clearly we should not break promises to communities. We should make \ncommitments and keep them. And I will oppose a conference report that \nincludes any provisions to undermine our commitment to reducing class \nsize.\n  I will continue to work to make sure that we meet our commitments to \nhelping communities give all children a good education. The nation's \nfuture depends on it.\n  I want to thank the leaders, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, for \ntheir courtesy and I want to congratulate my friend and colleague, the \nchairman of the committee, on his work, too.\n  I want to thank Danica Petroshius, my education advisor, for her able \nassistance on this legislation and tireless work, along with Jane \nOates, Dana Fiordaliso, Connie Garner, and Mark Taylor, along with my \ncommittee staff director Michael Myers.\n  I also thank Greg Williamson of Senator Murray's staff, Suzanne Day \nof Senator Dodd's staff, Elyse Wasch of Senator Reed's staff, Bev \nSchroeder of Senator Harkin's staff, Roger Wolfson of Senator \nWellstone's staff, and Lindsay Rosenberg of Senator Wyden's staff.\n  And I also thank Sherry Kaiman, Jenny Smulson, and Susan Hattan of \nSenator Jeffords' staff, and Meredith Medley of Senator Frist's staff.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, across our Nation, courageous teachers and \nschool administrators, parents and Governors, are working to find \ncreative ways to ensure that our children receive a world class \neducation. The United States Senate is prepared to promote and support \nthese efforts. Nothing is more important to the future of our Nation \nthat the education of our children.\n  The ideas we propose today are confident reform, rooted in tested \nprinciples, parents, teachers and principals, the ones who know our \nchildren best, should have the greatest influence on their classrooms. \nThe needs of America's schools differ from community to community, and \nwe help them most when we empower them to make wise choices for the \nchildren in their care. Our money, manpower and energy should be \nprimarily devoted to teaching children, not to filing paperwork and \nfueling bureaucracies.\n  These commonsense proposals have broad appeal. They have received \nstrong bipartisan support. Every Democratic Governor in the country \nsupports this bill. Last year, the President promised he would expand \nthe program we are considering today to all fifty States. The bill \npassed out of committee by a vote of 17-1 last July, and Secretary \nRiley strongly supported its enactment at that time. There is no reason \nwhy the Senate should not quickly pass the bill sponsored by Senators \nFrist and Wyden.\n  So the question before the Senate is really quite simple. It is not \nwhether we will pass the Ed-Flex bill, for in the end the overwhelming \nmajority of the Senate will support it. Rather, the question is whether \nthe Senate will keep faith with the American people, by working \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion, to help America's school children. \nRepublicans stand ready to do just that. The evidence of our commitment \nis the fact that we offer a bipartisan bill as one of the very first we \nbring to the Senate floor.\n  Republicans and Democrats have honest disagreements on many education \ninitiatives. Democrats believe that new Federal categorical grant \nprograms that distribute money to States and counties based on complex \nformulas are the best way to hire more teachers. Republicans believe \nthat Federal dollars should be sent directly to the classroom so that \nparents, teachers, and principals can address the unique educational \nneeds of their particular students, whether it be to hire more \nteachers, to provide special tutors, to buy new books or to teach \ncomputer skills. These differing philosophies will be debated, and \nought to be debated, fully by the Senate. We will have ample \nopportunity throughout this Congress to do just that.\n  However, there is simply no need to have divisive debates on a \nbipartisan bill. So I urge my colleagues from across the aisle to \nchoose constructive progress over political posturing for the sake of \nimproving America's schools.\n  Ed-Flex works for America's children. It proposes a simple exchange. \nStates will hold schools accountable for their performance in return \nfor granting each school the freedom to determine how best to achieve \nthose results. This is not an untested premise. Currently, twelve \nStates have this authority. The results have been promising.\n  In Texas, Ed-Flex schools outperformed those without waivers by \nseveral percentage points on student achievement scores. An elementary \nschool in Maryland now provides individual tutors for its students who \nlag behind in reading. The same school has dramatically reduced class \nsize in math and reading, providing one teacher for every twelve \nstudents.\n  The bill before us today simply expands the right to become an Ed-\nFlex State to all fifty States. It is strongly supported by our \nNation's Governors, both Democrats and Republicans. Last month, the \nNational Governors Association stated, ``The expansion of the Ed-Flex \nprogram is a high priority for Governors. . . . We strongly support \nthis legislation as well as your decision to move forward at this \ntime.'' The Nation's Democratic Governors joined together unanimously \nsaying, ``S. 280 is commonsense legislation that we believe deserves \nimmediate consideration. We hope, therefore, that you will join in \nsupporting its prompt enactment.''\n  Governors across America are united. There is simply no reason why \nthe Senate should not be as well. I urge my good friends and colleagues \non the other side of aisle to listen to their Governors. Join us in \nsupporting the prompt enactment of a simple bill that will provide \nmeaningful reform to schools throughout our Nation.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Education Flexibility \n     Partnership Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) States differ substantially in demographics, in school \n     governance, and in school finance and funding. The \n     administrative and funding mechanisms that help schools in 1 \n     State improve may not prove successful in other States.\n       (2) Although the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 and other Federal education statutes afford flexibility \n     to State and local educational agencies in implementing \n     Federal programs, certain requirements of Federal education \n     statutes or regulations may impede local efforts to reform \n     and improve education.\n       (3) By granting waivers of certain statutory and regulatory \n     requirements, the Federal Government can remove impediments \n     for local educational agencies in implementing educational \n     reforms and raising the achievement levels of all children.\n       (4) State educational agencies are closer to local school \n     systems, implement statewide educational reforms with both \n     Federal and State funds, and are responsible for maintaining \n     accountability for local activities consistent with State \n     standards and assessment systems. Therefore, State \n     educational agencies are often in the best position to align \n     waivers of Federal and State requirements with State and \n     local initiatives.\n       (5) The Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Act \n     allows State educational agencies the flexibility to waive \n     certain Federal requirements, along with related State \n     requirements, but allows only 12 States to qualify for such \n     waivers.\n       (6) Expansion of waiver authority will allow for the waiver \n     of statutory and regulatory requirements that impede \n     implementation of State and local educational improvement \n     plans, or that unnecessarily burden program administration, \n     while maintaining the intent and purposes of affected \n     programs, and maintaining such fundamental requirements as \n     those relating to civil rights, educational equity, and \n     accountability.\n       (7) To achieve the State goals for the education of \n     children in the State, the focus must be on results in \n     raising the achievement of all students, not process.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Local educational agency; state educational agency.--\n     The terms ``local educational agency'' and ``State \n     educational agency'' have the meanings given such terms in \n     section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965.\n       (2) Outlying area.--The term ``outlying area'' means Guam, \n     American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of \n     Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the \n     Federated States of Micronesia.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Education.\n       (4) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the 50 States, \n     the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, \n     and each outlying area.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, as an Oregonian, I am especially proud this evening \nthat a program that began in my home State--we were the first to get an \nEd-Flex waiver--on the basis of this vote in the U.S. Senate, this \nprogram that began in my State is going to be expanded across the \ncountry.\n  I would like to spend just a couple of minutes of the Senate's time \nthis evening, and first begin by thanking my colleagues who put so much \neffort into this.\n  Senator Frist is here this evening. He and I have been living and \nbreathing this legislation for well over a year.\n  I think it is worth noting that this began in the Senate Budget \nCommittee. Senator Domenici worked on a bipartisan basis with a number \nof us. And this legislation began with hearings in the Senate Budget \nCommittee.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for the opportunity to work with \nhim.\n  I also see Senator Jeffords here. He was especially gracious to me \nthis afternoon. He pointed out that from time to time it felt a little \nlonely on their side. But I want to assure him that I think that this \nis truly bipartisan.\n  Senator Daschle every step of the way was enormously supportive in \nthis legislation. I thank Senator Kennedy. He had to leave this \nevening. But he worked very closely with us, especially on the \naccountability provision.\n  Now, shortly after dealing with the impeachment matter, the Senate \ncan show that we have dealt with the premier domestic issue of our \nday--the premier domestic issue of our day--education, in a bipartisan \nfashion. It is always possible in the Senate and just about anywhere \nelse to find something on which to disagree. The Senate ultimately \nresisted that proposition, and we went forward with something we could \nagree on, which is the principle that you ought to squeeze every dollar \nof value out of the Federal budget for education in order to help the \nkids, to help them raise their scholastic performance, to deal with the \nissues that were debated on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  I think my only regret is that to some extent in the last hours of \nthis discussion it became a debate about whether you are for more \nresources for education or whether you are for more efficiently \nallocating the dollars that are currently obligated. I think that is a \nfalse choice.\n  I happen to believe that we are going to need some additional \nresources for the key education areas. We want our young people to get \na good quality education so they will be ready for the high-skill, \nhigh-wage jobs of tomorrow.\n  But the single best way to go to the taxpayers when additional \nresources are needed is to show the taxpayers that you are efficiently \nspending the dollars that are currently obligated.\n  That is why Ed-Flex is so important. All across the country we saw \nthat without Ed-Flex what you have is sort of a ``one-size-fits-all'' \napproach to education. Folks inside the beltway will say, ``Well, what \nworks in Coos Bay, OR, is what we ought to do in the Bronx, and what \nworks in the Bronx ought to be done in the State of the majority \nleader, the State of Mississippi.'' That doesn't make sense.\n\n  We ought to hold school districts accountable. But we also ought to \ngive them the freedom to be innovative and creative and make those \ndollars stretch so that we can serve more poor schoolchildren.\n  The fact of the matter is that there is a school very close to the \nU.S. Capitol that has cut class size in half with Ed-Flex using \nexisting dollars. They didn't spend $1 more, not one, and they cut \nclass size in half.\n  In my home State of Oregon, in one rural district, the poor kids \nweren't able to get advanced computing, because their school district \ndidn't have the technology and they didn't have the instructors. There \nwas a community college close by with Ed-Flex. Without any additional \nexpenses to the taxpayers, those kids could go to the community college \nand get the skills they needed. Again, we see a concrete example of how \nwith just a little bit of flexibility we can better serve the poor kids \nof this country.\n  We were on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I guess, for the better part \nof 2 weeks dealing with Ed-Flex, and not one single example of abuse \nwas ever shown on the floor of the Senate--not one. But there were \nplenty of examples of how this program worked. I just cited one close \nby the Capitol that cut class size in half. In Texas, the scores went \nup with better use of technology. From one end of the country to the \nother, we see how this program has worked.\n  I know that my colleagues wish to speak tonight on this issue. But I \njust wanted to take a minute or two to talk about why I think this is a \nparticularly good day for the U.S. Senate. There is no issue more \nimportant than this.\n  I see the majority leader is here. I want to express my thanks to \nhim, and to Tom Daschle.\n  The fact is that this important legislation could have blown up 15 or \n20 times in the last few days. And Tom Daschle and Trent Lott said that \nthis was too important to let that happen.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Jeffords hung in there as well, with \nSenator Frist, who constantly came to the floor and just appealed to \nlet this bipartisan idea, which every Governor in the country wants, to \ngo forward. We were able to get it done.\n\n[[Page S2572]]\n\n  I suspect the conference on this legislation will not be for the \nfainthearted. There are certainly differences of opinion on a number of \nthe issues.\n  But this is a very good day for the U.S. Senate, and a good day for \nAmerican families, because we have shown that we could tackle important \nissues.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to say thank you to the Senator \nfrom Oregon, because without him we would have had a much more \ndifficult time. It was bipartisan from the start, and it ended up very \nbipartisan. We ended up, I think, with a 98 to 1 vote.\n  Also, Mr. Frist, I am going to use 30 seconds, and then allow those \nwho wish to speak longer to do so.\n  I want to express my particular gratitude to all the members of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, who have worked \nespecially hard on this legislation. I very much value the time, \neffort, and commitment they have brought to this task.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the two sponsors of the Ed-Flex \nbill, Senators Frist and Wyden. It is in large part due to their \ndedication and commitment that we were able to pass this bill with such \noverwhelming bipartisan support.\n  Finally, I would like to extend my sincerest thanks to the many staff \npeople who contributed to the passage of this important Ed-Flex \nlegislation:\n  Sherry Kaiman, Mark Powden, Jenny Smulson, Heidi Scheuermann and \nSusan Hattan of my staff;\n  Townsend Lange and Denzel McGuire with Senator Gregg;\n  Lori Meyer, Meredith Medley, and Gus Puryear with Senator Frist;\n  Paul Palagyi with Senator DeWine; Chad Calvert with Senator Enzi: \nHolly Kuzmich with Senator Hutchinson; Julian Hayes with Senator \nCollins; Cherie Harder with Senator Brownback; Jim Brown with Senator \nHagel; and Jim Hirni with Senator Sessions.\n  I also want to acknowledge the extraordinary assistance offered by \nMark Sigurski with Senate Legislative Counsel, and Wayne Riddle with \nthe Congressional Research Service.\n  Mr. President, I also thank all of the staff here who have worked so \nmany hours to expeditiously pass this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I, too, will be very brief.\n  I believe that today has been almost a momentous day, and a very \nimportant day to set the stage, I believe, for the way, the manner, and \nthe spirit in which I hope to see a lot of legislation be addressed \nover the coming months in the remainder of this Congress.\n  We started off with a bill that originated out of really a town \nmeeting format where we have had people come and testify on the task \nforce, and listen very carefully. People came forward, and said, ``We \nhave a program that works.''\n  To be honest with you, 2 years ago I didn't know what Ed-Flex was. \nBut somebody came forward, and said in a community, as my colleague has \njust pointed out, that this program works.\n  We fulfilled exactly what the Federal mandate was, and what the \nFederal intention was. We took the appropriate funding--the Federal \ndollars that came down. But what the Federal Government allowed us to \ndo through a waiver was to participate through Ed-Flex to accomplish \nthat stated goal of fulfilling the intent of Congress, but in a way \nthat we knew was best for us based on our local circumstances.\n  Not everybody needs a computer, not everybody needs tutoring, not \neverybody needs kindergarten, not everybody needs an extra teacher, but \nthat varies from community to community, and the beauty of that is we \ntook that idea, we discussed it, we developed legislation, we passed it \nthrough the committee last year, but we ran out of time last year. It \nwas brought to the floor. It was one of the first major bills brought \nto this body, and after 7 days of intense debate, a lot of negotiation, \nwe passed the bill here 10 minutes ago.\n  It is a momentous day also because the House passed a very similar \nbill, almost an identical bill, about 6 hours ago. And that means, \nbecause in a bipartisan way, in a bicameral way, meaning both the House \nand Senate, in a Federal, State and local way, meaning we worked very \nclosely with the Governors, together we were able to pass legislation \nwhich, once it is signed by the President, can inure to the benefit of \nmillions of children within 6 months or 8 months--millions of children. \nAnd that is nice. That is what people expect Government to do; produce \nin a spirit, in an environment where you can work together to \naccomplish the goals that we all care about.\n  A lot of people should be thanked, and again most of those names will \nbe made a part of the Record, but I do want to recognize the coauthor \nand cosponsor of this particular bill, Senator Wyden, who just had the \nfloor.\n  Again, this is a bipartisan bill. Both of us knew what our goals \nwere. We worked very hard on both sides. I appreciate his support, his \ncollegiality as we addressed these issues.\n  As is so often the case, what we have accomplished in large part is \nas a result of the work of many staff members, and I do want to take \nthis opportunity to thank the staff who were most immediately involved \nover the last year and a half. My own staff of Meredith Medley, Lori \nMeyer and Gus Puryear have literally been here with other staff members \nuntil early hours of the morning each night.\n\n  Again, most everybody has been recognized already, but I am going to \ntake the liberty of going ahead and verbally mentioning them. Lindsay \nRosenberg of Senator Wyden's staff has been somebody whom my staff has \nenjoyed and I personally have enjoyed working with in this process as \nwe have gone through it.\n  Senator Jeffords, the chairman, who has literally been in the Chamber \nevery day for the last 7 days, does have the patience of Job going \nthrough this, looking at every bill and every word that comes forward \nwith a response. And I just want to express my appreciation because he \nushered this thing through in a very direct way and really put in both \nthe time and the effort. He is the leader on our side in education. We \ncited again and again the number of bills passed last year under his \nleadership as chairman of the former Labor, Health and Education \nCommittee. Currently, he is examining all public education, K through \n12, through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I have the \nprivilege of working on that committee with him and his wonderful staff \nwho have been at his side. Mark Powden, Susan Hattan and Sherry Kaiman \nreally all deserve our gratitude for their tremendous work over the \nlast several days.\n  I am not going to list all the staff, but Senator Gregg, again, from \nwhom we have heard so much about special education; Senator Lott, who \nneeds to be thanked because it would have been very easy after 3 or 4 \ndays, when it looked as if gridlock--it was gridlock, but he, with the \nDemocratic leader, agreed to keep this bill in the Chamber so we could \naddress those issues, and that is what the American people expect. We \naddressed it with very good, very strong debate, sometimes too strong \nmaybe, but we were able to work it out. And that bipartisanship in \ncoming together, again, is what the American people expect. I thank the \nmajority leader for allowing us to bring this to a resolution, to \ncompletion, to a product that we know will benefit, as I said, millions \nof children in the short term as well as the longer term.\n  I have to just briefly mention the Governors because it has been a \nfantastic relationship for me over the last month in that at least \nevery day we, a Federal body, the Congress, the Senate, were in touch \nwith all of our Governors, Democrat and Republican. I have talked to as \nmany Democrat Governors as I have Republican, and America doesn't see \nthat sort of interaction, but I think it is important for people to \nhear because so many problems, whether they be welfare, health care, or \neducation, demand that constant dialog and discussion about what we do \nhere at the Federal level, at the State level, as well as the local \nlevel.\n  Senator Voinovich, who is new to this body but a former Governor, \nspearheaded much of that. Governors Carper of Delaware, Ridge of \nPennsylvania, Leavitt of Utah, O'Bannon of Indiana, and House Members \nCastle and Roemer\n\n[[Page S2573]]\n\nall played a major role and were significant participants in what we \nhave accomplished today.\n  With that, I think I will stop. I am very excited about this \nparticular bill. It accomplishes much in a way that I think will really \nset that track for the next several months as we consider other \nlegislation. We do have a fresh start for education. It is a first \nstep. It does not address all the problems, all the challenges in \neducation, but it is a major first step.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. 595 \nare located in today's record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Pennsylvania may wish \nto make a statement in a moment also, but if I could just do a couple \nof things here.\n  First, before the Senators leave the Chamber, the Senator from \nTennessee and the Senator from Oregon, I want to again thank them for \ntheir effort. It was bipartisan because the Senator from Oregon, Mr \nWyden, made it so, stayed in there, worked with us, but I particularly \nwish to thank the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist, the doctor, who \ngave us an education. He took us to school. He used apples and \ninformation and examples. He acted like a good teacher should. I \ncongratulate him for that. He even showed us how you could use a \nscalpel to cut the redtape, and that is what this Ed-Flex bill will do.\n  So to the two Senators, I thank them for their leadership, for their \nwork, for their persistence because they both have been heckling me \nabout this bill for a year, and I am glad it is done. I congratulate \nthem for their effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2573-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now turn \nto S. 257, the Missile Defense Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 257) to state the policy of the United States \n     regarding the deployment of a missile defense system capable \n     of defending the territory of the United States against \n     limited ballistic missile attack.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, then, \nthe Senate will be able to have the initial statement by Senator \nCochran, the manager, tonight. We will resume the missile defense bill \non Monday, and it is our hope that an agreement can be reached on a \ntime agreement and that amendments will be offered during Monday's \nsession.\n  I urge that Members be present on Monday to make their statements on \nthis legislation and to offer amendments, if they have them. This is a \nvery important defense initiative. I am pleased that we are going to be \nable to go straight to the bill, and I hope that within short order \nnext week we will be able to get to the conclusion of this very \nimportant national defense issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, let me thank the distinguished majority \nleader for calling up the national missile defense bill and also \ncompliment the Democratic leader for refraining from objecting to \nproceeding to consider this bill at this time.\n  Senators may remember that this is the bill that was brought up on \ntwo occasions during the last session of the Senate and objections were \nmade to considering the bill, a motion to proceed to consider the bill \nwas filed, and then it was necessary to file a cloture motion to shut \noff debate to get to the bill. On both of those occasions we fell one \nvote short of invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to consider the \nbill. So this Senate has agreed to take up this legislation without \nobjection. This is progress, and we are very proud to see this momentum \nto address this issue that is so important for the national security \ninterests of the United States.\n  For the information of Senators, the operative part of this \nlegislation is simply a statement of policy as follows:\n\n       It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as \n     is technologically possible an effective National Missile \n     Defense system capable of defending the territory of the \n     United States against limited ballistic missile attack \n     (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).\n\n  I look forward to discussing questions that Senators might pose about \nthis bill when we reconvene on Monday. The Armed Services Committee has \nconsidered it and reported it out without amendment, and we are ready \nto proceed to consider the bill. We look forward to discussing this \nimportant issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2573-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe important education bill which we passed on its substantive merits, \nand also to speak briefly on the politics, where the bill might have \nappeared at some points to be partisan, with three votes on amendments \nbeing cast along party lines. I am convinced that we had a very strong \nbipartisan vote on final passage. At the same time that the Senate will \npass this Education Flexibility Partnership Act, the House of \nRepresentatives is working on similar legislation, so it will be \npresented to the President for his signature, which we are optimistic \nof obtaining.\n  I think it is important to note that there were important provisions \nin amendments offered by Members on the other side of the aisle, where \nthere were good programs which can be taken up in due course. The \nprogram for new teachers I think is a good idea. The program for \ndropout prevention is another good idea. The program for afterschool \nprovisions I think, again, is sound and can be taken up at a later \ntime. But had they been pressed on this bill, we would have had \ngridlock and this bill would not have been enacted.\n  Last year, the President proposed $1.2 billion as a starter for \n100,000 new teachers. That was accepted by the Congress. Before the \nPresident came forward with that proposal, in the subcommittee of \nLabor, Health, Human Services, and Education which I have the privilege \nto chair, we had put provisions in for some $300 million which would \nhave provided for as many new teachers as could have been hired during \nfiscal year 1999. The President came in with a bigger figure at a later \ndate. That was ultimately accepted by the Congress.\n  But I do think the idea for new teachers is a good idea. The question \nof how to fund it is always the tough issue. Similarly, the proposals \nfor dropout prevention and afterschool programs again are sound and it \nis a question of finding the adequate funding for these kinds of \nimportant programs.\n  I believe the Senate spoke very loudly and very emphatically on the \nquestion of giving local school districts the choice as to whether to \nuse the money for special education, or whether to use the money for \nnew teachers, or what to use the money for. The local education \nagencies were given that discretion on a vote of 61 to 38, where 6 \nDemocrats voted with 55 Republicans on that choice issue. Funding \nspecial education is a very major problem in America today. The Federal \nGovernment has imposed a mandate on the States, and the Supreme Court \nin a recent decision has broadened the terms of that mandate.\n  In the subcommittee that I chair, which funds education, we have \nprovided very substantial increases for special education, but the \nFederal Government has made a commitment for 40 percent funding and we \nare nowhere near that. So when you talk about the priorities of more \nnew teachers or money for special education, that matter was put to the \nSenate for a vote and, not strictly along party lines, the Senate voted \nto have the option with\n\n[[Page S2574]]\n\nthe local education agencies; with the vote being 61 to 38, some 6 \nDemocrats joined the 55 Republicans.\n  When the choice issue was articulated along a slightly different \nline, the vote was 78 to 21, with some 23 Democrats joining 55 \nRepublicans. That amendment also had provisions to keep the guns out of \nschools, which was doubtless an incentive to make that a stronger \nbipartisan vote than on some of the others.\n  Two of the other amendments were 59 to 40, with 4 Democrats joining \nthe Republicans and, 57 to 42, 2 Democrats joining--and although we did \nhave 3 votes along party lines, 55 to 44, there was a very definite \nbipartisan flavor to the votes on this matter.\n  It is always difficult when we have votes which are 55 to 44, \nstrictly along party lines, with the question being raised: Isn't there \nany independence among 55 Republicans or the 44 Democrats? But the \nparty line was adhered to in order to get the bill passed, even though, \nas I say, in voting against new teachers, against dropout prevention \nprograms, and against afterschool programs--those are good ideas, and \non another day we will be able to take them up. But if we were to \nmaintain these programs, I think this bill could not have been passed; \nif we had not drawn the line to focus on Ed-Flex in this bill.\n  The flexibility I think is a very good idea. The Federal Government \nfunds some 7 to 8 percent of the total funding. Last year, again in the \nsubcommittee, we increased the funding by about $3.5 billion, about 10 \npercent, bringing the total Federal share to about $34.5 billion. But \nthe principle of federalism continues to be sound, and that is that we \nought to leave as much to the States as we can and we ought to leave as \nmuch to the local education agencies as we can, with the people at the \nlocal level knowing best what their needs are. So if there is a limited \namount of funding, let them make the choice among special education or \nnew teachers or dropout prevention programs or afterschool programs; \nleave it to the people who are closest to the problems.\n  So, all in all, there was a bit of partisanship here but I think it \nwas justified to get the bill passed--not too much, with only three \nvotes being along party lines--and deferring to another day the \nimportant programs which were not enacted today, but maintaining a very \nimportant point of flexibility to allow local education agencies to \nhave the dominant voice in meeting their needs as they see them, being \nclosest to them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

His \ngoals on these trips are simple: to raise money for his political \ncampaigns; to recruit supporters for his Presidential endeavors; and to \ndistract Washington State voters from the administration's true agenda \nfor the Pacific Northwest.\n  The Vice President's visits to Washington State are nothing new, but \nrecently the administration, of which he is a vital leader, has chosen \nto adopt policies that pose a threat to the continued vitality of our \neconomy. Those policies are aimed at the destruction of two of \nWashington State's economic crown jewels: our hydropower system and \nMicrosoft.\n  During the past year, I have welcomed the Vice President to \nWashington State by repeatedly asking him two questions: The first, \nWill you commit to the preservation of each of the dams on the Columbia \nand Snake Rivers unless Congress or the people of the Northwest agree \nto the removal of each or all of them? The second question: Mr. Vice \nPresident, if you are elected President, will you end the Justice \nDepartment's suit against Microsoft?\n  At first, these questions were answered with silence. Now the Vice \nPresident answers them with personal attacks. Whether it is silence or \npersonal attacks, the Vice President makes clear that he does not \nintend to answer these two questions so fundamental to every family and \ncommunity in the Northwest. These questions deserve and should receive \nstraight answers from the Vice President, and I will continue to ask \nthem until the Vice President does so.\n  His silence, of course, is eloquent. Vice President Gore's \nadministration is responsible for the Microsoft lawsuit and for a \nflatout refusal to subject dam removal either to congressional \nauthority or to the consent of the people of the Northwest. What is \nmost illuminating is that the Vice President's silence and personal \nattacks in response to these questions about dams and Microsoft run \ncounter to positions taken by top Democratic officeholders in \nWashington State. When it comes to protecting dams on the Columbia \nRiver, our Democratic Governor and Democratic U.S. Senator, two of the \nmost powerful Democrats in Washington State, have already publicly \nopposed efforts by national environmental organizations to take out \ndams. But the Vice President is silent.\n  Last week I suggested that he had a political motive. That is my \nopinion, but, frankly, it doesn't matter why he pursues policies to \ndismantle our hydro system without being willing to say so openly. What \nmatters is whether he will make his position clear. So who loses out on \nthe equation? The people of Washington State, of course. And then there \nis Microsoft.\n  The good news is that most Democrats in Washington State have come \nforward to defend Microsoft's freedom to innovate, but the Vice \nPresident won't stand with his fellow Democrats in Washington State in \nsupport of the company. When he answers this one, he is either silent \nor he attacks and then attempts to evade the question.\n  Here is a recent example of the Vice President's verbal dance when it \ncomes to the issue of protecting Microsoft: Last week, I admonished the \nadministration for its assault on that company. In responding to my \nstatement, the Vice President's spokeswoman said that I am ``suffering \nfrom a Y2K bug'' and have forgotten all the wonderful things Al Gore \nhas done for Washington State. Specifically, the spokeswoman cited \nhundreds of thousands of new jobs, higher home ownership rates and \nlower welfare rolls, as if he were responsible for them.\n\n  There was no answer to the central question--will you work to end the \nsuit against Microsoft?\n  There was another troubling side to this statement. The Vice \nPresident, of course, was attempting to take credit for the booming \neconomy in the State that I represent. He should understand that that \nsuccess comes from the hundreds of thousands of hard-working \nWashingtonians, plus Microsoft and the amazing group of entrepreneurs \nwho have developed new and better systems, plus our natural resources, \nnot the least of which is our low-cost electricity, or all of the \nsmaller high-tech companies that have sprung up overnight. This success \ndoes not come from the Vice President.\n  As to the specifics of the Justice Department's case against \nMicrosoft, the so-called high-tech Vice President says he will not \ncomment on or involve himself in the Justice Department's case against \nthe company. Can we believe that as the administration's point man on \nhigh-tech issues, he has no opinion whatsoever on the highest profile \nhigh-tech issue before his administration--the future of Microsoft? I \ndo not believe it, nor does anyone else.\n  To claim that he is not involved in an action spearheaded by his own \nadministration is unbelievable. When the Vice President continually \nrefuses to answer the question of whether or not he supports this \nattack, he has not been straight with the people of the State of \nWashington.\n  There is a simple answer to the Microsoft question. The answer is for \nthe Vice President to tell us that if he is elected President, he will \nstop the Justice Department's pursuit of Microsoft. We Washingtonians \nare 3,000 miles away from the center of Al Gore's universe, but we know \nonly too well that the actions of this administration can have a long \nand detrimental impact on our economy, our way of life and on our \nfuture. We deserve more from the Vice President than silence, \ndistraction and personal attacks.\n  We will remember his silence on what are perhaps the most important \nFederal public policy questions to face our State in years. We will \nremember his evasive comments. We will remember\n\n[[Page S2575]]\n\nhis refusal to denounce or even comment on the antitrust case against \nMicrosoft and his unwillingness to make clear his position on \nprotecting Columbia and Snake River dams. I challenge the Vice \nPresident again today to tell us plainly whether he supports this \nadministration's assault on two of Washington State's economic crown \njewels.\n  Do you, Mr. Vice President, support the Justice Department's \nantitrust action against Microsoft or not? And do you, Mr. Vice \nPresident, support the efforts by national environmental groups to \ndestroy dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers or not?\n  We in the Northwest await the Vice President's answers, and you can \nbe sure that so long as silence and evasiveness carry the day, I will \ncontinue to ask these questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2575-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RETIREMENT OF WILLIAM D.

A bill to require health insurance coverage for certain \nreconstructive surgery; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n\n\n                   reconstructive surgery act of 1999\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill \nto require health insurance plans to cover medically necessary \nreconstructive surgery for congenital defects, developmental \nabnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease.\n  This bill is modeled on a new California law and responds to the \ngrowing incidence of denials of coverage by insurance, often managed \ncare. Despite physicians' judgment that surgery is often medically \nnecessary, too many plans are labeling it ``cosmetic surgery.'' The \nAmerican Medical News calls the HMO's response that these surgeries are \ncosmetic as, ``a classic health plan word game. . . .''\n  Testifying before the California Assembly Committee on Insurance, Dr. \nHenry Kawamoto put it well. He said:\n\n       It used to be that if you were born with something \n     deforming, or were in an accident and had bad scars, the \n     surgery performed to fix the problem was considered \n     reconstructive surgery. Now, insurers of many kinds are \n     calling it cosmetic surgery and refusing to pay for it.\n\n  The Los Angeles Times reported on July 9, 1997, ``There has been a \nvirtual wipeout of coverage to repair the appearance of children whose \nlooks are affected by illness, congenital abnormalities or trauma.''\n  Similarly, the New York University Physician reported in their spring \n1998 issue:\n\n       Before the advent of managed care, repairing abnormalites \n     was considered reconstructive surgery and insurance companies \n     reimbursed for the medical, hospital and surgical costs of \n     their rehabilitation. But in today's reconfigured medical \n     reimbursement system, many insurance companies and managed \n     care organizations will not pay for reconstruction of facial \n     deformities because it is deemed a ``cosmetic'' and not a \n     ``functional'' repair.\n\n  This bill is endorsed by the March of Dimes, the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the National Organization for Rare Disorders, the American \nSociety of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, the American College of \nSurgeons, the American Association of Pediatric Plastic Surgeons, the \nAmerican Society of Craniofacial Surgery, the American Society of \nMaxillofacial Surgeons, the American Society of Plastic and \nReconstructive Surgeons and the National Foundation for Facial \nReconstruction.\n  The children who face refusals to pay for surgery are the true \nevidence that this bill is needed.\n  Hanna Gremp, a 6-year old from my own state of California, was born \nwith a congenital birth defect, called bilateral microtia, the absence \nof an inner ear. Once the first stage of the surgery was complete, the \nGremp's HMO denied the next surgery for Hanna. They called the other \nsurgeries ``cosmetic'' and not medically necessary.\n  Michael Hatfield, a 19-year old from Texas, who has gone through \nsimilar struggles. He was born with a congenital birth defect, that is \nknown as a midline facial cleft. The self-insured plan his parents had \nonly paid for a small portion of the surgery which reconstructed his \nnose. The HMO also refused to pay any part of the surgery that \nreconstructed his cheekbones and eye sockets. The HMO considered some \nof these surgeries to be ``cosmetic.''\n  Cigna Health Care denied coverage for surgery to construct an ear for \na little California girl born without an ear and only after adverse \npress coverage reversed its position saying that, ``It was determined \nthat studies have show some functional improvement following surgery.''\n  Qual-Med, another California HMO, denied coverage for reconstructive \nsurgery for a little boy without an ear, a condition called microtia, \nand after only many appeals and two years delay, authorized it.\n  The bill uses medically-recognized terms to distinguish between \nmedically necessary surgery and cosmetic surgery. It defines medically \nnecessary reconstructive surgery as surgery ``performed to correct or \nrepair abnormal structures of the body caused by congenital defects, \ndevelopmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors, or disease to \n(1) improve functions; or (2) give the patient a normal appearance, to \nthe extent possible, in the judgment of the physician performing the \nsurgery.'' The bill specifically excludes cosmetic surgery, defined as \n``surgery that is performed to alter or reshape normal structures of \nthe body in order to improve appearance.''\n  Examples of conditions for which surgery might be medically necessary \nare the following: cleft lips and palates, burns, skull deformities, \nbenign tumors, vascular lesions, missing pectoral muscles that cause \nchest deformities, Crouson's syndrome (failure of the mid-face to \ndevelop normally), and injuries from accidents.\n  The American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons has \nreleased a survey on reconstructive surgery, concluding that 53.5 \npercent of surgeons surveyed have had pediatric patients who in the \nlast two years were denied coverage for reconstructive surgery. Of \nthose same surgeons surveyed whose pediatric patients were totally or \npartially denied coverage, 74 percent had patients denied for initial \nprocedures and 53 percent denied for subsequent procedures.\n  Another reason for this bill is that only 17 out of 50 states have \nstate legislation which requires insurance coverage for children's \ndeformities and congenital defects. My own state, California, passed \nlegislation in 1998 requiring insurance plans to cover medically \nnecessary reconstructive surgery, and on September 23, 1998 it was \nsigned by former Governor Pete Wilson. This bill was enacted after many \nsad personal stories, and hours of testimony were presented to the \nstate legislators.\n  This bill is an effort to address yet one more development in the \nhealth insurance industry that almost daily is creating new hassles \nwhen people try to get coverage for the plan they pay for every month.\n  We need our body parts to function and fortunately modern medicine \ntoday often make that happen. We can restore, repair and make whole \nparts which by fate, accident, genes, or whatever, do not perform as \nthey should. I hope this bill can make that happen.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, and Mr. Sessions):\n\n[[Page S2577]]\n\n  S. 586. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to limit the \nvalue of certain real property that a debtor may elect to exempt under \nState or local law, and for other purposes to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                  bankruptcy abuse reform act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator Sessions, to \nintroduce the bipartisan Bankruptcy Abuse Reform Act of 1999, \nlegislation which addresses a serious problem that threatens Americans' \nconfidence in our bankruptcy laws. The measure would cap at $100,000 \nthe State homestead exemption that an individual filing for personal \nbankruptcy can claim. It passed the Senate last year when it was \nincluded in the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998 (H.R. 3150), and \nI hope that we can all support this measure again this year. The goal \nof our measure is simple but vitally important: to make sure that our \nBankruptcy Code is more than just a beachball for crooked millionaires \nwho want to hide their assets.\n  Let me tell you why this legislation is critically needed. In chapter \n7 Federal personal bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor is allowed to \nexempt certain possessions and interests from being used to satisfy his \noutstanding debts. One of the chief things that a debtor seeks to \nprotect is his home, and I agree with that in principle. Few question \nthat debtors should be able to keep a roof over their heads. But, in \npractice, this homestead exemption has become a source of great abuse.\n  Under section 522 of the Code, a debtor may opt to exempt his home \naccording to local, State, or Federal bankruptcy provisions. The \nFederal exemption allows the debtor to shield up to $15,000 of value in \nhis house. The State exemptions vary tremendously: some States do not \nallow the debtor to exempt any of his home's value, while a handful of \nstates set no ceiling and allow an unlimited exemption. The vast \nmajority of states have exemptions under $40,000.\n  Our proposal would amend Section 522 to cap State exemptions so that \nno debtor could ever exempt more than $100,000 of the value of his \nhome.\n  Mr. President, in the past few years, the ability of debtors to use \nState homestead exemptions has led to flagrant abuses of the Bankruptcy \nCode. Multimillionaire debtors have moved to one of the states with \nunlimited exemptions--most often Florida or Texas--bought multi-\nmillion-dollar houses, and continued to live like kings even after \ndeclaring bankruptcy. This shameless manipulation of the Bankruptcy \nCode cheats honest creditors out of compensation and rewards only those \nwho can ``game'' the system. Oftentimes, the creditor who is robbed is \nthe American taxpayer. In recent years, S swindlers, convicted \ninsider trader convicts, and others have managed to protect their ill-\ngotten gains through this loophole.\n  The owner of a failed Ohio S, who was convicted of securities \nfraud, wrote off most of $300 million in bankruptcy claims, but still \nheld on to the multimillion dollar ranch he bought in Florida. A \nconvicted Wall Street financier filed bankruptcy while owing at least \n$50 million in debts and fines, but still kept his $5 million Florida \nmansion with 11 bedrooms and 21 bathrooms. And just last year, movie \nstar Burt Reynolds wrote off over $8 million in debt through \nbankruptcy, but still held onto his $2.5 million Florida estate. These \ndeadbeats stay wealthy while legitimate creditors--including the U.S. \nGovernment--get the short end of the stick.\n  Simply put, the current practice is grossly unfair and contravenes \nthe intent of our laws: People are supposed to get a fresh start, not a \nhead start, under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that I have introduced today is \nsimple, effective and straightforward. It caps the homestead exemption \nat $100,000, which is far more than estimated median home equity of \npeople in bankruptcy. It is endorsed by the National Bankruptcy Review \nCommission. And it will protect middle class Americans while preventing \nthe abuses that are making the middle class question the integrity of \nour laws--the abuses the average American taxpayer is paying for out of \npocket.\n  Indeed, it is even generous to debtors. Less than ten states have a \nhomestead exemption that exceeds $100,000. More than two-thirds of \nstates cap the exemption at $40,000 or less. My own home state of \nWisconsin has a $40,000 exemption and that, in my opinion, is more than \nsufficient.\n  Mr. President, this proposal is an effort to make our bankruptcy laws \nmore equitable. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 587. A bill to provide for the mandatory suspension of Federal \nbenefits to convicted drug traffickers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          no federal benefits for drug traffickers act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the time for mixed messages in our war \nagainst drugs has passed. There was a time when our message on illegal \ndrugs was crystal clear. ``Just say no.'' The results of that simple \nmessage were also clear: The decade of the 1980's saw substantial and \npersistent decreases in the level of drug use, and in the level of \nteenage drug use in particular. Sadly, however, the current \nAdministration has offered America and its children a mixed message on \ndrugs.\n  The President himself has shifted the message from ``just say no'' to \n``just don't inhale.'' Even the head of the Drug Enforcement Agency \ncandidly has admitted that in the current climate we lack the will to \nwin the war against drugs. This is intolerable. We must return to a \nclear message in the war against drugs--a message of zero tolerance for \nthose who would attempt to ruin our children's lives through the \nscourge of illegal drugs. The government must speak clearly and \nunequivocally. Trafficking in illegal drugs will not be tolerated.\n  However, we will not succeed in convincing either drug dealers or our \nchildren that we are serious about the war on drugs if we send them \nmixed messages. One mixed message sent by current law is that convicted \ndrug dealers remain eligible for federal government benefits. We need \nto change that practice.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today, the ``No Federal Benefits \nfor Drug Traffickers Act'' requires the suspension of federal benefits \nto convicted drug traffickers. This bill will send a clear message that \nwe mean what we say in the war against drugs. Current federal law \nprovides for the denial of federal benefits (excluding certain programs \nlike food stamps, aid to families with dependent children, and approved \ndrug treatment programs) for individuals convicted of drug trafficking \noffenses. Unfortunately, however, the law gives judges unlimited \ndiscretion to decide whether or not to suspend a convicted drug \ntrafficker's federal benefits. For example, under current law a repeat \noffender could retain his full federal benefits.\n  The ``No Federal Benefits for Drug Traffickers Act'' addresses this \nloophole in the current law by mandating the suspension of a convicted \ndrug trafficker's federal benefits for at least a minimum period of \ntime. Specifically, the bill requires the suspension of a convicted \ndrug offender's federal benefits for a minimum of one year. The bill \nalso mandates suspension of benefits for at least three years upon a \nsecond conviction.\n  In addition, the bill closes a loophole that allowed drug trafficker \nwho were supposed to be barred from receiving federal benefits for life \nbecause of three separate drug trafficking convictions to regain their \neligibility for federal benefits. Once again we need to make our \nmessage clear and unmistakable. Under the bill I introduce today, life \nmeans life and it is truly three strikes and you're out.\n  This is what we need in the war against drugs--a clear message. Those \nwho choose to traffic in drugs have no legitimate claim to federal \nbenefits. This is common sense. There is no need for exceptions or \ndiscretion. There is a need for clarity, and this bill provides that \nclarity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 589. A bill to require the National Park Service to undertake a \nstudy of the Loess Hills area in western Iowa to review options for the \nprotection and interpretation of the area's natural, cultural, and \nhistorical resources; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  loess hills preservation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \ncalling\n\n[[Page S2578]]\n\nupon the National Park Service to conduct a study of the Loess Hills in \nwestern Iowa. This study would be the first official step towards \npossible national protection for the Loess Hills.\n  Specifically, this legislation would require the National Park \nService to monitor the area between Waubansie State Park and Stone Park \nto study the possibility of a portion of this area to receive National \nPark status.\n  Loess Hills is a unique national treasure that was formed by ancient \nglaciers and hundreds of centuries of westerly winds. Only the loess \nsoil in China has accumulated as high as Iowa's. Although these hills \nhave survived for hundreds of centuries, today they are beginning to \ncrumble. Urban sprawl is unfortunately beginning to take its toll on \nLoess Hills. Protecting this area must be given a high priority.\n  In 1986, the Loess Hills area was designated as a National Natural \nLandmark by the National Park Service. This gives recognition to this \narea as an area of national significance. Although this designation \nencourages landowners to use conservation practices in use of the area, \nthis designation does nothing to control land ownership or to restrict \nland use.\n  The only thing holding the loess in place is the roots of the \nvegetation. Today, however, as the human exploitation of the hills \ncontinues to increase the destruction of the vegetation, loess is left \nonce again blowing in the winds as the fragile hills begins to flatten.\n  This is of great concern to me. This area which marks one of the only \nremaining natural ecosystems in the state is one of the few areas where \nIowans can experience nature. Iowa presently ranks 49th among the 50 \nstates in National Park and Forest space. Iowa is also 400 miles away \nfrom a sizable national recreation area (the Boundary Waters Canoe \nArea). The Loess Hills, however, is an area of national significance \nand has the potential to be a much needed National Park for the Plains \nStates.\n  Mr. President, since 1992, I have secured funding through the United \nStates Department of Agriculture to design better bridges and other \nstructures in the Loess Hills area to reduce soil erosion. But more \nneeds to be done.\n  One thing I would like to make clear--this study can only be \nsuccessfully implemented with the participation of local governments in \nwestern Iowa and private property owners.\n  The Loess Hills are an Iowa treasure. This legislation would begin \nthe process of making Loess Hills a national treasure.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me as co-sponsors of this much needed \nlegislation. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe percentage depletion allowance for certain hardrock mines, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\nELIMINATION OF DOUBLE SUBSIDIES FOR THE HARDROCK MINING INDUSTRY ACT OF \n                                  1999\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \neliminate from the federal tax code percentage depletion allowances for \nhardrock minerals mined on federal public lands. I am joined in \nintroducing this legislation by my colleague from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n\n  The President proposes the elimination of the percentage depletion \nallowance on public lands in his FY 2000 budget. The President's FY \n2000 budget estimates that, under this legislation, income to the \nfederal treasury from the elimination of percentage depletion \nallowances for hardrock mining on public lands would total $478 million \nover five years, more than $95 million in this year alone. These \nsavings are calculated as the excess amount of federal revenues above \nwhat would be collected if depletion allowances were limited to ``sunk \ncosts'' in capital investments. Percentage depletion allowances are \ncontained in the tax code for extracted fuel, minerals, metal and other \nmined commodities. These allowances have a combined value, according to \n1994 estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, of $4.8 billion.\n  Mr. President, these percentage depletion allowances were initiated \nby the Corporation Excise Act of 1909. That's right, 1909. Provisions \nfor a depletion allowance based on the value of the mine were made \nunder a 1912 Treasury Department regulation, but difficulty in applying \nthis accounting principle to mineral production led to the initial \ncodification of the mineral depletion allowance in the Tariff Act of \n1913. The Revenue Act of 1926 established percentage depletion much in \nits present form for oil and gas. The percentage depletion allowance \nwas then extended to metal mines, coal, and other hardrock minerals by \nthe Revenue Act of 1932, and has been adjusted several times since.\n  Percentage depletion allowances were historically placed in the tax \ncode to reduce the effective tax rates in the mineral and extraction \nindustries far below tax rates on other industries, providing \nincentives to increase investment, exploration and output. However, \npercentage depletion also makes it possible to recover many times the \namount of the original investment.\n  There are two methods of calculating a deduction to allow a firm to \nrecover the costs of their capital investment: cost depletion, and \npercentage depletion. Cost depletion allows for the recovery of the \nactual capital investment--the costs of discovering, purchasing, and \ndeveloping a mineral reserve--over the period during which the reserve \nproduces income. Using\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\ncost depletion, a company would deduct a portion of its original \ncapital investment minus any previous deductions, in an amount that is \nequal to the fraction of the remaining recoverable reserves. Under this \nmethod, the total deductions cannot exceed the original capital \ninvestment.\n  However, under percentage depletion, the deduction for recovery of a \ncompany's investment is a fixed percentage of ``gross income''--namely, \nsales revenue--from the sale of the mineral. Under this method, total \ndeductions typically exceed, let me be clear on that point, Mr. \nPresident, exceed the capital that the company invested.\n  The rates for percentage depletion are quite significant. Section 613 \nof the U.S. Code contains depletion allowances for more than 70 metals \nand minerals, at rates ranging from 10 percent to 22 percent.\n  In addition to repealing the percentage depletion allowances for \nminerals mined on public lands, Mr. President, my bill also creates a \nnew fund, called the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund. One fourth of the \nrevenue raised by the bill, or approximately $120 million dollars, will \nbe deposited into an interest bearing fund in the Treasury to be used \nto clean up abandoned hardrock mines in states that are subject to the \n1872 Mining Law. Mineral Policy Center estimates that there are 557,650 \nhardrock abandoned mine sites nationwide and the cost of cleaning them \nup will range from $32.7 billion to $71.5 billion.\n  There are currently no comprehensive federal or state programs to \naddress the need to clean up old mine sites. Reclaiming these sites \nrequires the enactment of a program with explicit authority to clean up \nabandoned mine sites and the resources to do it. My legislation is a \nfirst step toward providing the needed authority and resources.\n  Mr. President, in today's budget climate we are faced with the \nquestion of who should bear the costs of exploration, development, and \nproduction of natural resources: all taxpayers, or the users and \nproducers of the resource? For more than a century, the mining industry \nhas been paying next to nothing for the privilege of extracting \nminerals from public lands and then abandoning its mines. Now those \nmines are adding to the nation's environmental and financial burdens. \nWe face serious budget choices this fiscal year, yet these subsidies \nremain a persistent tax expenditure that raise the deficit for all \ncitizens or shift a greater tax burden to other taxpayers to compensate \nfor the special tax breaks provided to the mining industry.\n  Mr. President, the measure I am introducing is fairly \nstraightforward. It eliminates the percentage depletion allowance for \nhardrock minerals mined on public lands while continuing to allow \ncompanies to recover reasonable cost depletion.\n  Though at one time there may have been an appropriate role for a \ngovernment-driven incentive for enhanced mineral production, there is \nnow sufficient reason to adopt a more reasonable depletion allowance \nthat is consistent with those given to other businesses.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for the Federal Government to get \nout of the business of subsidizing business. We can no longer afford \nits costs in dollars or its cost to the health of our citizens. This \nlegislation is one step toward the goal of ending these corporate \nwelfare subsidies.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 590\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, one year ago today, the Birth Defects \nPrevention Act passed the House of Representatives, clearing its way \nfor the President's signature.\n  With this new funding, the Centers for Disease Control has \nimplemented a national strategy, in conjunction with the States and \nlocal organizations such as the March of Dimes, to prevent the \ndevastating incidence of birth defects.\n  Building upon that success, today I rise to introduce the Healthy \nKids 2000 Act--comprehensive approach which addresses the broad \nspectrum of health issues affecting our nation's children.\n  And I want to thank the March of Dimes and the National Association \nof Children's Hospitals for supporting me in this effort to improve the \nhealth of our nation's children and pregnant women as we move into the \nnew millennium.\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\n  I also want to thank my colleague from Ohio, Mike DeWine, for his \nwork on children's health issues, and for allowing me to adopt some of \nhis ideas for inclusion in this bill. Senator DeWine has been a \ndedicated leader on children's health, and has been essential to the \ndevelopment of the sections of this bill that focus on poison control \ncenters and pediatric research within the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  I am struck, every time I go into the neonatal wards across my home \nstate of Missouri, at the tiny one and two pound babies, hooked up to \nmonitors and tubes and looking so helpless. Many of them will survive; \na few may not. My first thought is always one of thanks that I have \nbeen blessed with a very healthy son.\n  The good news is that we are making progress in preventing diseases \nand in making sick and injured children well. Healing never thought \npossible a few years ago for those who are burn victims, or born with \nbirth defects, or trauma victims, or even cancer patients, now occurs \non a daily basis around our country.\n  The question about how to finance health care and how to improve \naccess to and the quality of health care, however, are the hottest \nchallenges we face as a nation.\n  There are some things we can all agree on: that the care and well-\nbeing of our children should come first, particularly those who are \nill. Prenatal care is also paramount, because a great deal of child \nhealth is determined in the womb.\n  Thus as a nation, we must stand up and speak for those who cannot \nspeak for themselves.\n  That is why I am introducing the ``Healthy Kids 2000 Act.'' The idea \nbehind it is simple: we want pregnant women to be healthy, and we want \nchildren to be healthy. So we are going to remove some of the barriers \nthey encounter in receiving good, appropriate health care.\n  This bill will give States the flexibility to enroll eligible \npregnant women in the State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) \nand to coordinate essential outreach efforts to enroll qualified \nchildren. This program has already been funded by Congress to assist 10 \nmillion children whose families lack health insurance. These children \nare eligible to receive basic health care services like immunizations \nand antibiotics for ear infections, but pregnant women are not now \neligible. Since so much of a child's health is determined in the womb, \nit is imperative that low-income pregnant women receive quality \nprenatal care.\n  Similarly, we need to ensure that the National Institutes of Health \nresearch machine is focusing on diseases and conditions which afflict \nour nation's children, such as birth defects, SIDS, cystic fibrosis, \njuvenile diabetes, and arthritis, just to name a few. A simple \nstatistic will highlight this need: 80% of prescription medications \nmarketed in the U.S. today are not approved by the FDA for use by \nchildren under 12 because studies have not been conducted to document \ntheir safety or whether or not they work for children. That is a \nterrible disservice to the young people of our country who may need the \nrelief of a particular prescription drug.\n  This bill will also consolidate programs and provide more funds for \nlocal initiatives to prevent birth defects and maternal mortality.\n  150,000 infants are born each year with a serious birth defect, and \nbirth defects are still the leading cause of infant death. During the \n1990s we have witnessed an increase in maternal death during pregnancy \nand childbirth. There is no question that we need better approaches to \nensure that women have healthier, safe pregnancies, and healthier \nbabies. And my bill will help fund these vital prevention strategies.\n  This bill will also ensure direct access to obstetric care, and \ndirect access to pediatric care. Children have health needs that are \nvery different than those of the adult population. Diseases and \nmedications behave differently than in adults, and when children are \ntreated, it should be by those who understand those differences.\n  Finally, this initiative will assist children's hospitals in \neducating the next generation of pediatricians. Even with strapped \nbudgets, teaching children's hospitals offer the more egalitarian \nhealth care in this country. These hospitals turn no one away. And it \nis essential that we support this noble mission by equipping children's \nhospitals with the tools to continue their educational and research \nefforts.\n  So much of the most important work in our society goes unnoticed, and \nunrewarded. Saving the lives of our children, improving the health of \nour children, even caring for our children on a daily basis is not \nglamorous work, or sometimes even all that much fun. Doctors, nurses, \nmothers, fathers, child-care workers and teachers are performing the \nmost difficult, and the most important, work of our society: raising up \nthe next generation to be happy, healthy, and productive citizens.\n  We must assist them in their efforts, and we can take a positive step \nby debating and enacting Healthy Kids 2000.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                         Children's Hospitals,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, March 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Christopher ``Kit'' Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: The National Association of Children's \n     Hospitals (N.A.C.H.), which represents more than 100 \n     children's hospitals across the country, strongly supports \n     your efforts to address the full spectrum of children's \n     health care needs through your new ``Healthy Kids 200 Act,'' \n     legislation that knits together several important individual \n     initiatives to improve the health and well-being of our \n     nation's children.\n       This legislation takes a comprehensive approach to \n     addressing barriers and obstacles, both health system and \n     governmental, that families and pediatric providers encounter \n     in improving the health care of children. Its focus on \n     strengthening health coverage, graduate medical education, \n     research, and public health protections for children clearly \n     reflects the children's hospitals' own four-fold missions of \n     clinical care, education, research, and public health \n     advocacy for child health. Together, they are essential to \n     the ability of communities to meet the unique health care \n     needs of their children.\n\n\n                       children's health coverage\n\n       This legislation recognizes that the prescription for good, \n     comprehensive health care for children is not only health \n     insurance coverage but also quality and access to care. The \n     ``Healthy Kids 200 Act'' would provide important health care \n     protections for children as well as enable providers, \n     professionals, systems, and workers to assure improved \n     quality of health care for children.\n       By providing families access to providers that specialize \n     in pediatrics for the care delivered to their children, the \n     legislation takes the important step of ensuring that \n     children receive health care in the most appropriate setting \n     and condition possible.\n       The legislation recognizes that, as the President's \n     Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the \n     Health Care Industry writes, ``[c]hildren have health and \n     development needs that are markedly different from adults and \n     require age-appropriate care. Developmental changes, \n     dependency on others, and different patterns of illness, \n     disability and injury require that attention be paid to the \n     unique needs of children in the health system.''\n       In addition, the legislation improves upon the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) by allowing \n     states the option to use SCHIP to provide health insurance \n     coverage for pregnant women. The linkages between prenatal \n     care and healthy children have long been understood in \n     American social policy, including Medicaid, the Maternal and \n     Child Health Block Grant and WIC. As the GAO found in its \n     report Health Insurance; Coverage Leads to Increased Health \n     Care Access for Children, Medicaid coverage of maternal and \n     child health improves health care access but also decreases \n     infant and child mortality.\n       For these reasons, N.A.C.H. supports giving states the \n     option of covering low income, uninsured pregnant women \n     through SCHIP, as well as the bill's provision to establish \n     automatic enrollment of their infants upon birth through that \n     critical first year of life.\n\n\n                          Pediatric Education\n\n       N.A.C.H. applauds you for including in the ``Healthy Kids \n     2000 Act'' the commitment to commensurate federal graduate \n     medical education support for independent children's \n     hospitals proposed by the ``Children's Hospitals Education \n     and Research Act,'' which you have twice co-sponsored with \n     Senator Bob Kerrey (D-MO). Through the establishment of a \n     capped time-limited fund, the legislation would go a long way \n     toward providing a more equitable competitive playing field \n     for independent children's hospitals.\n       Like all teaching hospitals, children's hospitals receive \n     less and less support for their graduate medical education \n     (GME) programs from most insurers. Unlike other teaching \n     hospitals, independent children's hospitals receive virtually \n     no support for GME from the one remaining, stable source of \n     GME support--the Medicare program--because\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\n     they serve children, not the elderly. Yet, these hospitals \n     play a critical role in training the next generation of \n     health care providers for children. Although they represent \n     less than one percent of all hospitals, they train nearly 30 \n     percent of all pediatricians and nearly half of all pediatric \n     subspecialists.\n\n\n                           pediatric research\n\n       As centers of research devoted to improving the prevention, \n     diagnosis, treatment, and evaluation of children's illnesses \n     and conditions, children's hospitals very much appreciate \n     your efforts to bring new visibility the need for increased \n     NIH investment in pediatric biomedical research overall and \n     in pediatric research training in particular. While there are \n     a variety of ways to structure this increased investment in \n     NIH, we know that you share our conviction that in the end, \n     the result must be a real increase in total support for \n     pediatric research. Its purpose should be to stimulate \n     significant additional pediatric research investment and \n     growth in the number of researchers focusing on children's \n     health, not to cause a shift in funding that comes at the \n     expense of any current NIH research efforts for children.\n\n\n                   pediatric public health promotion\n\n       With so many children's hospitals serving as their states' \n     or regions' poison control centers, N.A.C.H. especially \n     appreciates the provisions of your legislation to stabilize \n     and improve our nation's poison control system. Over half of \n     the two million poisonings reported in 1996 were by parents \n     of children under age 6. Almost 2 out of 3 poison calls are \n     on behalf of children under age 18. Legislation that serves \n     to improve and stabilize this critical system will \n     undoubtedly improve the lives and health of children as well.\n       N.A.C.H. also supports the bill's provisions to improve \n     prenatal care and birth defects research through the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention, which are important to \n     reduce morbidity and mortality from birth, improving health, \n     and preventing life-long health care costs for children and \n     adults.\n       In conclusion, Senator Bond, we commend you for the breadth \n     and depth that this bill undertakes to improve the health of \n     our nation's children. This legislation certainly sets the \n     standard for what the 106th Congress should consider and pass \n     with respect to child health.\n       If you have any questions or need additional information, \n     call Peters Willson or Bruce Lesley at 703-684-1355.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence A. McAndrews.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March of Dimes,\n\n\n                                     Birth Defects Foundation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 8, 1999.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: On behalf of more than 3 million \n     volunteers and 1500 staff members of the March of Dimes, I \n     want to commend you for introducing the ``Healthy Kids 2000 \n     Act.'' We are particularly pleased that you have included in \n     this legislation three specific initiatives important to the \n     Foundation and to the health of mothers, infants and \n     children.\n       The first section of the bill, ``Health Care Accessibility \n     and Accountability for Mothers and Newborns,'' includes a \n     much needed initiative to improve access to health care for \n     pregnant women. Numerous studies have shown that prenatal \n     care improves the likelihood that a child will be born \n     healthy. Your proposal that states be given the flexibility \n     to cover prenatal care for income-eligible pregnant women \n     through the new State Children's Health Insurance Program (S-\n     CHIP) is an important step to take. If enacted, this \n     provision would help provide women the prenatal and maternity \n     care they need to have healthy, full term babies. The March \n     of Dimes strongly supports access to prenatal care. Because \n     of the Foundation's concern that more than 350,000 women do \n     not have access to these needed services, the Foundation has \n     identified the expansion of S-CHIP to cover pregnant women as \n     one of its highest federal legislative priorities for 1999.\n       The Foundation is also pleased to support the ``Pediatric \n     Public Health Promotion'' provision that would establish a \n     National Center for Birth Defects Research and Prevention at \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This change \n     in law would elevate the visibility of the birth defects \n     activities of the CDC, authorized by the Birth Defects \n     Prevention Act (P.L. 105-168), which you guided to enactment \n     in 1998. As you know, for many years the March of Dimes has \n     been a strong supporter of federal birth defects research and \n     prevention activities. We applaud you for proposing to \n     integrate the activities of various programs to further \n     promote the prevention of birth defects.\n       In addition, the March of Dimes commends you on including \n     the ``Pediatric Research Initiative'' in the ``Healthy Kids \n     2000 Act.'' If enacted, this initiative would establish the \n     authorization needed to obtain additional funding for \n     pediatric biomedical research within the National Institutes \n     of Health. The Foundation believes that a partnership between \n     the public and private sectors is the more effective way to \n     raise the level of investment in clinical research pertaining \n     to children. The March of Dimes urges Congress to strengthen \n     the national commitment to all children.\n       We thank you for your leadership and are eager to work with \n     you on this and other legislative initiatives important to \n     the health of the nation's mothers, infants and children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Dr. Jennifer L. Howse,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, and Mr. Abraham):\n  S. 593. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nmaximum taxable income for the 15 percent rate bracket, to provide a \npartial exclusion from gross income for dividends and interest received \nby individuals, to provide a long-term capital gains deduction for \nindividuals, to increase the traditional IRA contribution limit, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          the small savers act\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my good friends \nSenator Torricelli and Senator Abraham, to introduce legislation whose \ntime I believe has clearly come. We are faced with a real crisis. That \ncrisis is the state of personal savings, savings by families that let \nthem prepare for the bumps in the road.\n  Families are not saving, and I believe it is not happening because \nour government takes too much from them. A recent report by the \nCongressional Budget Office showed that taxes on the American public \nare at their highest level since World War II. Too many middle-class \nfamilies have been squeezed to the point where they live paycheck to \npaycheck without the option of saving for the future.\n  Today, the Nation's economy remains the envy of the world. The United \nStates has the first federal budget surplus in thirty years, \nunemployment is down and the stock market is up, but there are \ntroubling signs on the horizon. Manufacturing activity slowed in \nDecember for the seventh straight month, dropping to its lowest level \nin almost eight years as global economic problems continued to hinder \nexports. At the same time, personal savings are at Depression-era lows.\n  In 1982, families saved nine percent of their personal income. In \n1992, it was between five and six percent. Last year, it was one-half \nof one percent and headed into the red. Personal savings is so \nimportant because it helps prepare families for any crisis that could \noccur, such as a health emergency or job loss.\n  Having said that, I believe we would all do well to remember the \nlessons from the biblical parable of Joseph. Recall that Joseph warned \nPharaoh his kingdom would experience seven years of plenty followed by \nseven years of famine. His message to Pharaoh was to build reserves \nduring the years of plenty in preparation for the years of famine, so \nthat his people would not suffer. To ensure the longevity of our recent \neconomic gains, it is important to remember the lessons of Joseph and \nheed the words of President Kennedy who, in his second State of the \nUnion address said: ``Pleasant as it is to bask in the warmth of \nrecovery . . . the time to repair the roof is when the sun is \nshining.''\n  One-third of Americans have no savings at all, and the next third \nhave less than $3,000 in savings. Although the baby-boom generation has \ncontributed to the explosion of people investing in the equities, only \ntwo in five baby boomers will have enough savings to maintain their \ncurrent standard of living when they begin to retire in 2011.\n  The Small Savers Act would help to reverse these troubling trends. \nFirst, our proposal returns middle class taxpayers to the lowest \nFederal income tax bracket. Under our legislation, 7 million taxpayers \nwould no longer find themselves taxed at 28%. Instead, they would be \ntaxed at the 15% bracket.\n  Second, it would encourage modest savings and investment. We propose \nto enable savers to earn $500, or $250 for singles, in interest and \ndividends without paying a tax. According to the Joint Economic \nCommittee, 30 million low and middle income taxpayers would be able to \nsave tax free. Our proposal also would wipe out capital gains taxes for \n10 million low and middle income investors by exempting the first \n$5,000 of long-term capital gains. For those committed to ending the \ntaxation of capital gains, this would be an opportunity to take that \nfirst step while encouraging lower and middle class workers to invest \nfor their future.\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\n  Finally, we provide for a modest $1,000 increase in the contribution \nlimit for deductible IRA contributions, from $2,000 to $3,000, and \nindex for inflation after 2009. These contribution limits have not been \nraised since 1981.\n  The Nation faces many challenges in the years ahead. None is more \nimportant than sustaining economic growth and ensuring our retirement \nsecurity. The Small Savers Act is a modest and progressive step to \nbegin shoring up personal savings and to keep the Nation on the path to \nlong-term economic health.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 594. A bill to ban the importation of large capacity ammunition \nfeeding devices; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n         large-capacity ammunition magazine import ban of 1999\n\n  Mr. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will plug a gaping loophole in our gun laws and protect us all \nfrom the deadly, tragic violence of assault weapons.\n  This bill is not about gun control. This bill is not about politics. \nAnd this bill is not about partisanship. But this bill is about \nstopping foreign manufacturers from skirting the laws that already \napply to companies within our borders.\n  The bill we introduce today will address, finally, the loophole in \nthe law that allows foreign manufacturers to flood our shores with high \ncapacity ammunition clips, while domestic manufacturers are prohibited \nfrom selling those very clips.\n  Our bill bans future importation of all ammunition clips with a \ncapacity of greater than 10 rounds.\n  Mr. President, this legislation would not ban the sale or possession \nof clips already in circulation. And the domestic manufacture of these \nclips is already illegal for most purposes. Under current law, U.S. \nmanufacturers are already prohibited from manufacturing large capacity \nclips for sale to the general public, but foreign companies continue to \ndo so.\n  As the author of the 1994 provision, I can assure you that this was \nnot our intent. We intended to ban the future manufacture of all high \ncapacity clips, leaving only a narrow clause allowing for the \nimportation of clips already on their way to this country. Instead, the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms has allowed millions of foreign \nclips into this country, with no true method of determining date of \nmanufacture.\n  In fact, between March and August of last year alone, BATF approved \nmore than 8 million large-capacity clips for importation into America.\n  Many of these clips were surely manufactured after 1994, but ATF has \nno way to determining whether or not this is true. As a result, they \nsimply must take the word of the exporting company or country.\n  The clips come from at least 20 different countries, from Austria to \nZimbabwe.\n  The clips approved during this one short period accounted for almost \n128 million rounds of ammunition--and every round represents the \npotential for taking one human life.\n  These clips come in sizes ranging from 15 rounds per clip to 30, 75, \n90, or even 250 rounds per clip.\n  Twenty thousand clips of 250-rounds came from England;\n  Two million 15-round magazines came from Italy;\n  Five thousand clips of 70-rounds came from the Czech Republic.\n  And the list goes on, and on.\n  Mr. President, 250-round clips have no sporting purpose. They are not \nused for self defense. They have only one use--the purposeful killing \nof other men, women and children.\n  It is both illogical and irresponsible to permit foreign companies to \nsell items to the American public--particularly items that are so often \nused for deadly purposes--that U.S. companies are prohibited from \nselling. It is time to plug this loophole and close our borders to \nthese tools of death and destruction. Our domestic manufacturers are \ncomplying with the law, and we must now force foreign manufacturers to \ncomply as well.\n  In April of last year, President Clinton and Treasury Secretary Rubin \nclosed one loophole in the 1994 ban on assault weapons by blocking \nfurther imports of modified semiautomatic assault weapons. However, the \nDepartment of Justice advises me that the President lacks the legal \nauthority to take the same action regarding large-capacity clips. As a \nresult, we must take legislative action to stop further imports of \nthese killer clips.\n  In closing our borders to these high capacity clips, we will not put \nan end to all incidents of gun violence. But we will limit the \ndestructive power of that violence. We will not stop every troubled \nchild who decides to commit an act of violence from doing so, but we \ncan limit the tools that a child can find to carry out the act.\n  Each of us has been touched in some way by the devastating effects of \ngun violence. Each of our states has faced unnecessary tragedy and \nsenseless destruction as a result of the high-powered, high-capacity \nweapons falling into the hands of gangs, drive-by shooters, cop \nkillers, grievance killers, and yes, even children. My own state of \nCalifornia has too often been the subject of national attention due to \nincidents of gun violence.\n  Just a few short months ago in Oakland, California, officer James \nWilliams became yet another example of what can happen when a troubled \nteenager gets hold of a high-capacity weapon. Soon after midnight on a \nSunday early this New Year, Officer Williams and two colleagues found \nthemselves searching the side of the road for a gun that had reportedly \nbeen thrown by suspects involved in a recent chase. Officer Williams \nhad been out of the police academy for only eleven weeks, and was \nundoubtedly looking forward to getting home to see his three children.\n  But tragically, James Williams never made it home that night. While \nWilliams searched for the lost gun, a 19-year-old man stood on the \nfreeway overpass above and fired the shots that would change Williams' \nfamily forever. Using a Hungarian made AK-47 with a Chinese made high-\ncapacity ammunition clip, the teenager fired many shots--too many.\n\n  One Telfon-coated bullet from this high capacity clip fatally wounded \nofficer Williams, tearing through his bulletproof vest and leaving his \nthree children without a father. And that lone bullet tore through more \nthan just James Williams' body armor. It tore through the very fabric \nof his entire family, and its damage cannot be repaired.\n  To many, Officer Williams has now become just another statistic in \nthe fight against gun violence. But he is more than that to his family, \nand he must mean more than that to us, as well. We must fight to end \nthe tragedies faced by so many families across this nation. We must \nfight to give meaning to the countless lives that have been \nextinguished before their time.\n  One phenomenon which has most tragically revealed the problems \npresented by these high capacity clips has been the use of these clips \nby youngsters to kill other youngsters.\n  In Springfield, Oregon, a 15-year-old boy used a 30-round clip to \nkill two of his fellow students and wound 22 others.\n  In Jonesboro, Arkansas, one of two boys carried a Universal carbine \nequipped with a 15-round killer clip. Firing every one of those 15 \nbullets, the boy helped his partner kill five people and wound 10 more.\n  And just last December in Los Angeles, 27 year old LAPD officer Bryan \nBrown was shot and killed by an assailant with a rifle and double \nmagazine. Following the tragic shooting, Officer Brown's 7 year old son \nasked, ``Why did my daddy have to die?''\n  Mr. President, Officer Brown and Officer Williams gave their lives to \nprotect the lives of so many others, and their children have now been \nleft without a father. We must do what we can to make the lives of our \nlaw enforcement officers more safe.\n  And we must also do what we can to bring foreign companies into \ncompliance with the same laws we impose on companies here at home. The \nonly way we can accomplish these goals is to pass this simple bill.\n  In 1994, we fired a first shot in the fight against assault weapons \nand killer clips by banning the assault weapons most commonly used in \ncrime and to kill police officers. I am proud to have authored that \nlegislation, and many of my colleagues who joined me in that fight \nremember how hard we worked to make a difference. Our opponents told\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\nus our efforts would accomplish nothing--but they were wrong. They told \nus our efforts would infringe upon the rights of innocent gun owners--\nagain, they were wrong.\n  In fact, recent statistics prove that the assault weapons ban is \nworking to reduce crime and to save the lives of law enforcement \nofficers and countless others.\n  A recent study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms showed \nthat compared to other guns, the use of assault weapons in crimes is \nrapidly falling. In fact, while assault weapons accounted for more than \n6% of the guns traced in crimes before the 1994 crime bill went into \neffect, these guns now account for less than 2.4% of those traces.\n  But it has now become apparent that the 1994 ban on assault weapons \nleft open certain loopholes. Through those loopholes fall the lives of \ncourageous police officers like Officer James Williams.\n  There is no convincing reason to allow foreign manufacturers to \ncircumvent the ban on assault weapons while domestic manufacturers \ncomply. And there is no convincing reason to keep an unlimited supply \nof these clips flowing onto our shores and into the hands of American \ncriminals.\n  The ban on assault weapons is working to save lives and to keep us \nsafe. But we must act to fix those loopholes which still remain. Last \nyear we came close--we offered this bill as an amendment on short \nnotice and lost by only a few votes. I am confident that once my \ncolleagues understand what this bill does--and more importantly what it \ndoes not do--we will win our fight.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I look forward to \nvoting on this issue in the near future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 594\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nestablish a graduated response to shrinking domestic oil and gas \nproduction and surging foreign oil imports, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  THE DOMESTIC OIL AND GAS CRISIS TAX RELIEF AND FOREIGN OIL RELIANCE \n                          REVERSAL ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Domestic \nOil and Gas Crisis Tax Relief and Foreign Oil Reliance Reversal Act of \n1999.\n  It is a comprehensive, graduated approach to ensure that the United \nStates retains control of its foreign policy and its economic destiny.\n  I believe that oil is essential to our way of life. Oil is power.\n  It has been pointed out by numerous commentators that major oil \nreserves and political volatility go together. The Middle East has the \nworld's most abundant and cheapest oil, unfortunately, the U.S. does \nnot.\n  Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait are our current allies, \nbut Iran and Iraq are not. Russia is a major natural gas producer, but \nreliable Russia is not.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil is reaching 57 percent, projected to \nreach 68 percent by 2010 if current prices prevail.\n  This isn't the usual boom and bust that the oil and gas industry goes \nthrough. The price has dropped by half in the past two years. In real \nterms, oil now costs roughly what it did before 1973. And prices could \nstay low or drop lower according to the March 6th, Economist magazine.\n  Chairman Greenspan, thus, far has been more cautious.\n  At a Budget Committee hearing recently, I asked Chairman Greenspan \nabout the oil and gas depressed prices. For the first time that I can \nremember, Greenspan blessed Independent Petroleum Association of \nAmerica (IPAA) numbers.\n  Greenspan said, ``In the short term, profits for the oil and gas \nindustry are likely to come under pressure. According to industry \nsurveys, exploration and production spending in the U.S. is projected \nto decline 21 percent this year to $22.6 billion from $28.2 billion in \n1998. A recent survey by the Independent Petroleum Association of \nAmerica (IPAA) estimates that over 36 thousand crude oil wells and more \nthan 56 thousand natural gas wells have been shut down since November \n1997. During the same period, the IPAA estimates that 24 thousand jobs \nin the industry have been eliminated * * * The financial pressures are \nmost serious among small producers in the United States.''\n  Let me describe the financial pressures facing New Mexico.\n  One of the city officials told me that oil and gas revenues were so \nlow that the town of Eunice has to decide which it will keep open--the \nschool or the hospital. There isn't enough tax revenue in the coffers \nto do both! In New Mexico, the oil and gas industry is a major source \nof revenue. For some communities it is the only significant source.\n  The bill I am introducing today is a comprehensive, graduated \nresponse to the problem of the shrinking domestic oil and gas industry. \nIt builds upon, and includes all of the provisions included in S. 325 \nintroduced by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and cosponsored by Senators \nNickles, Murkowski, Breaux and Landreu and myself.\n  The Hutchison bill focuses on helping our independent producers and \nmaintaining marginal wells. These are wells that produce less than 15 \nbarrels a day by IRS definition, but in reality, on average produce \nabout 2.2 barrels of oil a day. There are a lot of marginal wells in \nthe United States, and together they produce as much oil as the United \nStates imports from Saudi Arabia.\n  I am also told if prices stay where they are the state could lose \nhalf of those wells by the end of the year.\n  Title I of the bill I am introducing today is part of S. 325. It \nincludes a marginal well tax credit designed to prolong marginal \ndomestic oil and gas well production. The credit is equal to $3.00 a \nbarrel.\n  The bill also provides a Federal income tax exclusion for income \nearned from inactive wells. It is an incentive for producers to keep \npumping and not to plug the wells because low prices make them \nuneconomic. Once a well is plugged, the oil from that well is lost for \never.\n  The bill expands the Enhanced Oil Recovery credit (EOR) that was \nenacted in 1990.\n  Enhanced oil recovery techniques can recover the other seventy-five \npercent of the oil left behind when regular techniques have pumped as \nmuch oil as they can from a well. The EOR credit is expanded to cover \nadditional techniques and to be used by AMT taxpayers.\n  The oil and gas industry is a capital intensive industry.\n  When the price of oil drops, the cash flow for small producers dries \nup. There are countless producers who haven't been able to make an \ninterest payment on their operating loans in months and as loans come \ndue, the banks haven't been willing to renew them.\n  The world is feasting on cheap oil, and yet the oil patch is starving \nfor capital. This credit crunch is made all the more painful because \nproducers know that they have accumulated tax\n\n[[Page S2584]]\n\nbenefits and credits that they have not been able to use, first, \nbecause they were Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) taxpayers, and more \nrecently, because low prices have devastated their bottomline.\n  The AMT was intended to make sure that profitable companies paid \ntheir fair share of taxes. It has not worked as it was intended. In \npractice, the AMT imposes four penalties on investments made by U.S.-\nbased taxpayers who explore for and produce oil and natural gas. \nPenalties are imposed on drilling investment and asset depreciation. \nThese penalties significantly increase the after-tax costs and the \nbusiness risks of drilling new wells. This is a very imprudent policy \nat a time when the U.S. is experiencing historically low drilling \nactivity and growing import dependency.\n  The AMT increases the cost of capital of AMT taxpayers by \napproximately 15 to 20 percent over what it would be under the regular \ncorporate income tax according to testimony given before the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  TITLE II of the bill tries to correct the past imprudence of the AMT \nand other tax cod provisions by providing domestic oil and gas industry \ncrisis tax relief triggered when the price of oil is below $15 a \nbarrel.\n  This title of the bill creates what I call a ``credits to cash'' \nprogram.\n  The purpose is to transform earned tax credits and other accumulated \ntax benefits into working capital for the cash-strapped domestic oil \nand gas producers and service companies.\n  This is accomplished by creating a ten year carry-back for unused AMT \ncredits, and unused percentage depletion for oil and gas producers. The \nbill would also eliminate one of the most restrictive limitations on an \noil and gas producer's ability to claim his intangible drilling costs--\nthe so-called 65 percent net income limitation. The bill repeals it so \nthat producers can finally recover their out of pocket costs.\n\n  The bill also includes a provision similar to a bill introduced by \nCongressman Thomas. My bill allows both producers and the oil and gas \nservice industry to go back ten years and use up their Net operating \nlosses (NOL)s.\n\n\n   Hard times tax relief when price of oil is less than $14 a barrel\n\n  The National Energy Policy Act partially eliminated Intangible \nDrilling Costs as a preference item under the AMT. This bill finishes \nthe job for any year when the price of oil is less than $14 a barrel \n(phased out when oil prices hit $17)\n  IDCs are up front, out of pocket costs that have to be paid before a \nproducer even knows whether there will be any oil produced.\n  IDCs are one of the principal ordinary and necessary business costs \nof the oil and gas industry. IDCs can comprise up to 80 percent of the \ntotal costs incurred in developing a well.\n  IDCs are comparable to research and development costs because they \nare incurred before a capital asset is known to exist. Examples of IDCs \ninclude amounts paid to negotiate and finalize drilling contracts; \ncosts to prepare the drill site, costs of transporting and setting up \nthe rigs and costs of cementing casing in place; costs for wages, fuel, \nrepairs, supplies, and other costs in the drilling, shooting and \ncleaning of wells, onsite preparation for the drilling of wells, and \nthe construction of the physical structures that are necessary for the \ndrilling of wells. IDCs are funded with cold, hard cash and typically \ncannot be financed by a bank or financial institution, and must be paid \nthrough an operator's internal cash flow or outside equity money \nsupplied by an investor.\n  Under the regular corporate tax, IDCs are generally allowed to be \nexpensed.\n  If they were the expenses of any other business they would not be \nincluded as add-back preference items for purposes of the AMT. We took \nthe first step to correcting this injustice in the National Energy \nPolicy Act. It is time to finish the job now.\n  Percentage depletion is also an ordinary and necessary business cost. \nIt recognizes that the economic profit from successful wells must \ncompensate for economic losses from dry holes and marginal wells that \ndo not recover their investment. Percentage depletion also recognizes \nthat oil and gas properties are wasting assets with no residual value. \nThese expenses correspond to ordinary business expenses that are \ndeductible for every other business without limitations.\n  The bill would also eliminate the depreciation adjustment under the \nAMT for oil and gas assets so that the depreciation schedules for the \nregular tax are also used for AMT.\n  The oil and gas industry must spend significant amounts of capital to \nacquire, find, develop and produce oil and gas resources The regular \ntax system's modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) is \ndesigned to encourage such investments. The incentive of accelerated \ntax depreciation is especially important in periods when oil is cheap \nand companies are under economic pressure to reduce capital investment \nand jobs. Yet, the depreciation adjustment required under the AMT \nresults in removing much of the regular tax incentive precisely when it \nis needed most. This occurs because companies in the industry are more \nlikely to be subject to AMT in periods of low commodity prices.\n  While the AMT is the second tax system imbedded in our Internal \nRevenue code, the Accumulated Current Earnings (ACE) effectively acts \nas a third system of taxation, in addition to the regular tax system \nand the AMT. ACE generally acts to measure income in the same manner \n``earnings and profits'' which is a measure of income used by ``C'' \ncorporations to determine whether their dividends will be taxable. \nUnder ACE, a corporate taxpayer must compute the deductions for \nequipment depreciation (pre-1994), and intangible drilling cost \nrecovery in a third manner in addition to that mandated under the \nregular tax system and the AMT.\n  Congress has nibbled at fixing the ACE several times in the 1990's. \nIt is time to get rid of it and its complexity. The bill eliminates the \nAdjusted Current Earnings adjustment (ACE) as it applies to IDCs.\n  The bill would also permit the EOR credit and the Section 29 credit \nto reduce the Alternative Minimum Tax.\n  The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) imposes tax penalties on the oil \nand gas industry. It taxes investment, not income, and it is more \npunitive the less profitable a company is. The longer prices are low \nand profits thin, the harsher is the AMT's impact.\n  The bill recognizes that the Oil for Food program is contributing to \nthe depressed oil and gas prices and is causing economic hardship for \nour domestic oil and gas producers. To compensate our domestic industry \nfor the economic loss that is being caused by this UN policy, the bill \nwould restore percentage depletion to 27.5 percent. It also would \ninclude the remaining tax provisions included in S. 325 e.g., Allows \nexpensing geological and geophysical expenditures Allows producers to \nmake an election to Expense Delay Rentals payments; and provides an \nExtension of Spudding rule\n  Title III of the bill would be triggered whenever foreign oil \nreliance exceeds 50 percent. The purpose of this title is to reverse \nthe trend of increased foreign dependence of oil and gas by encouraging \nexploration and development of oil and gas reserves here at home in the \nU.S. Our goal should be to double current domestic oil and gas \nproduction.\n  The bill provides a 20 percent exploration and development credit.\n  Title IV recognizes that 60 percent foreign oil dependence is a \nnational security risk and provides for an emergency procedure. When \nforeign imports exceed 60 percent the President is required to \nimplement an energy security strategic plan designed to prevent crude \noil and product imports from exceeding 60 percent. I will remind my \ncolleagues that when we experienced the economic disruption of the 1973 \noil embargo our dependence on foreign oil was only 36 percent.\n  Mr. President, we need a comprehensive response to foreign oil \ndependence. We need to have a healthy domestic oil and gas industry. \nThis bill along with measures to help the industry through the current \ncredit crunch are essential. I ask that my colleagues join me in \ndeveloping a comprehensive plan to insure our energy and foreign policy \nindependence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na summary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2585]]\n\n                                 S. 595\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; AMENDMENT OF 1986 CODE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Domestic \n     Oil and Gas Crisis Tax Relief and Foreign Oil Reliance \n     Reversal Act of 1999.''\n       (b) Amendment of 1986 Code.--Except as otherwise expressly \n     provided, whenever in this Act an amendment or repeal is \n     expressed in terms of an amendment to, or repeal of, a \n     section or other provision, the reference shall be considered \n     to be made to a section or other provision of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a graduated response to shrinking domestic \n     oil and gas production and surging foreign oil imports;\n       (2) to prevent the abandonment of marginal oil and gas \n     wells responsible for half of the domestic oil and gas \n     production of the United States;\n       (3) to transform earned tax credits and other tax benefits \n     into working capital for the cash-strapped domestic oil and \n     gas producers and service companies;\n       (4) to reverse the trend of increased dependence on foreign \n     oil and gas by encouraging exploration and development of oil \n     and gas reserves in the United States to achieve the goal of \n     doubling current domestic oil and gas production; and\n       (5) to provide an emergency procedure for times when \n     foreign imports exceed 60 percent of the total United States \n     crude and oil product consumption, thereby recognizing that \n     when imports exceed a statutory level a national security \n     threat exists that demands Presidential action.\n\n     SEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Foreign oil consumption in the United States is \n     estimated to be equal to 56 percent of total oil consumption \n     and could reach 68 percent by the year 2010 if current prices \n     prevail.\n       (2) The number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United \n     States is at the lowest count since 1944, when records of \n     this number began to be recorded.\n       (3) If oil prices do not increase soon, the United States \n     could lose at least half of its marginal wells which, in the \n     aggregate, produce as much oil as the amount of oil the \n     United States imports from Saudi Arabia.\n       (4) Oil and gas prices are unlikely to increase for the \n     next several years.\n       (5) Declining production, well abandonment, and the lack of \n     exploration and development are shrinking the domestic oil \n     and gas industry.\n       (6) It is essential in order for the United States to have \n     a vibrant economy to have a healthy domestic oil and gas \n     industry.\n       (7) The world's richest oil producing regions in the Middle \n     East are experiencing great political stability.\n       (8) The policy of the United Nations may make Iraq the \n     swing oil producing nation, thereby granting an enemy of the \n     United States a tremendous amount of power.\n       (9) Reliance on foreign oil for more than 60 percent of the \n     daily oil and gas consumption in the United States is a \n     national security threat.\n       (10) The United States is the leader of the free world and \n     has a worldwide responsibility to promote economic and \n     political security.\n       (11) The exercise of traditional responsibilities in the \n     United States and abroad in foreign policy requires that the \n     United States be free of the risk of energy blackmail in \n     times of gas and oil shortages.\n       (12) The level of the United States security is directly \n     related to the level of domestic production of oil, natural \n     gas liquids, and natural gas.\n       (13) A national energy policy should be developed which \n     ensures that adequate supplies of oil are available at all \n     times free of the threat of embargo or other foreign hostile \n     acts.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend section 922 of chapter 44 of title 28, United \nStates Code, to protect the right of citizens under the Second \nAmendment to the Constitution of the United States; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n             second amendment rights protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the \n``Second Anendment Rights Protection Act of 1999.'' I am pleased and \nhonored that Senators Inhofe, Burns, Enzi, and Murkowski are joining me \nas original cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, the Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 1999 \nencompasses all of the provisions of the Smith Amendment, which passed \nthe Senate by a vote of 69-31 on July 21, 1998, during consideration of \nthe Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill for fiscal year 1999. \nOnly a substantially modified version of the Smith amendment was \nincluded in the final omnibus appropriations measure.\n  The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) went \ninto effect on December 1, 1998. My bill would require the immediate \ndestruction of all information submitted by any person who has been \ncleared by the NICS to purchase a firearm. There is no reason why such \nprivate information on law-abiding gun owners should be retained. I \ncontinue to be troubled by the Clinton administration's insistence upon \ndoing so.\n  In addition, Mr. President, my bill would prohibit the imposition of \nany tax or fee in connection with the NICS. Once again, in his budget \nsubmission for fiscal year 2000, President Clinton is seeking to fund \nNICS with a gun tax.\n  With the Smith amendment last year, we told President Clinton ``no'' \nto the gun tax. Let us tell him ``no'' again, once and for all, by \nenacting the Second Amendment Rights Protection Act.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my bill would create a private cause of \naction for any individual who is aggrieved by a violation of its \nprovisions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the printing of the text \nof my bill, the Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 1999, in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to the printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 597\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Second Amendment Rights \n     Protection Act of 1999.''\n\n     SEC. 2. PROTECTION OF SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS.\n\n       Subsection (t) of section 922 of chapter 44 of Title 18, \n     United States Code, is amended by inserting at the end \n     thereof the following new paragraph:\n       ``(7) None of the funds appropriated pursuant to any \n     provision of law may be used for (1) any system to implement \n     this subsection that does not require and result in the \n     immediate destruction of all information, in any form \n     whatsoever, submitted by or on behalf of any person who has \n     been determined not be prohibited from owning a firearm; (2) \n     the implementation or collection of any tax or fee by any \n     officer, agent, or employee of the United States, or by any \n     state or local officer or agent acting on behalf of the \n     United States, in connection with the implementation of this \n     subsection, provided, that any person aggrieved by a \n     violation of this provision may bring an action in the \n     Federal district court for the district in which the person \n     resides; provided further, that any person who is successful \n     with respect to any such action shall receive damages, \n     punitive damages, and such other remedies as the court may \n     determine to be appropriate, including a reasonable \n     attorney's fee.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 598. A bill to amend the Federal Agriculture Improvement and \nReform Act of 1996 to improve the farmland protection program; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                    FARMLAND PROTECTION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would reauthorize the Farmland Protection Program that was \noriginally authorized with passage of the 1996 Farm Bill.\n  Every year more than one million acres of our nation's most \nproductive farmland is lost to urbanization. This is land that produces \nthree-quarters of America's fruits and vegetables, and more than half \nof our dairy products. While state and local governments have taken the \nlead in preservation efforts, the demand for assistance continues to \ngrow.\n  Considering the importance of agriculture to our nation, and to \ngenerations of families throughout our country, I was proud to take a \nlead role in the United States Senate to assist farmers and communities \nin confronting the obstacle of growing pressure on the use of farmland. \nAs such, I, with the support of many Senate colleagues, established the \nFederal Farmland Protection Program to stem the loss of valuable \nfarmland, and to provide states with adequate tools to accomplish that \ngoal. Those efforts resulted in a $35 million authorization in the 1996 \nFarm Bill.\n  This money has been used to help states leverage dollars in order to \npurchase development rights, and keep productive farmland in use--all \nthrough voluntary efforts. In just three short years, the funds were \nexhausted due to the overwhelming response by farmers and state \ngovernments. In fact, by the end of fiscal year 1997 the original $35 \nmillion authorization had been spent, and the demand outstripped \nfunding availability by 900 percent.\n  The legislation that I'm introducing today, the Farmland Protection \nAct of 1999, would provide a $50 million per year authorization for the \nmuch-needed funds to carry out the important work of farmland \npreservation. In addition, my bill would allow non-profit organizations \nto participate in the program--where there is no established government \nprogram--as they are currently precluded from doing so in certain \nstates.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to introduce this legislation that will \nenable us to take another giant step forward in protecting a valuable \nresource to many Americans. To date, nineteen states have capitalized \non this opportunity to augment their preservation efforts, and \nhopefully, the Farmland Protection Act of 1999 will give more states \nthe tools to assist their local farming community.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nadditional tax relief to families to increase the affordability of \nchild care, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      THE CARING FOR CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Caring \nfor Children Act, legislation to help all families with their child \ncare needs.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who have worked so hard to put this \nbill together. Senator Hatch, who was a leader in the development of \nthe child care block grant, and is always a stalwart supporter of \nchildren. Senator Snowe, who has worked on this issue for many years. \nSenator Roberts, who has taken an active interest in this issue. \nSenator Specter, who made an enormous contribution to the development \nof this bill. And Senators Susan Collins and Thad Cochran, who we are \nvery fortunate to have on our child care proposal.\n  Our proposal is straightforward and far-reaching. It makes the \ncurrent child care credit more equitable for lower and middle income \nfamilies. And, for the first time, makes the credit available to \nfamilies where one parent stays at home to care for the children. That \nis a critical step and an important change for families across America.\n  Raising children in today's world is a true challenge. In many \nfamilies, both parents must work in order to support the family. Often, \nthe child care expenses consume all or most of one parent's income. How \noften do we hear the refrain, particularly from women, that after they \npay for day care, there is little or nothing left of their wages.\n  Another common complaint is from parents who desperately want to stay \nhome and raise their children themselves--especially in those very \ncritical, early years of childhood--but who simply cannot afford to \nforgo that second income.\n  The legislation we are introducing today responds to both of these \nconcerns. We believe that parents should make their own decisions about \nwho is going to care for their children. The government and the Tax \nCode should not be promoting one choice over another.\n  By making more of the existing child care tax credit available to \nlower and middle income families, and making it available also to \nfamilies where one parent stays at home, we are sending the message \nthat the choice is yours, and we support your choice.\n  Our bill makes several changes to the existing dependent care tax \ncredit. First, the maximum credit percentage is increased from 30 \npercent to 50 percent to provide more benefits to those most in need. \nSecond, the income level at which the maximum credit begins to be \nreduced is moved from $10,000 to $30,000, so that more lower-income \nfamilies will qualify for the maximum amount of assistance. Third, we \npropose to completely phase out the credit for wealthier families. \nFinally, families where one spouse stays at home to care for the \nchildren will be eligible for a credit similar to the one they would \nreceive if both parents were working outside the home and the child was \nin daycare.\n  We also acknowledge that we cannot solve the entire child care \nproblem through the Tax Code alone. Many low-income families do not \nhave taxable income, and therefore cannot benefit from a tax credit. \nThe Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) provides critical \nfunding to help these lower-income families--and I have been a strong \nsupporter of the program. Recognizing the critical role CCDBG plays in \nsubsidizing daycare for low-income families in the states, our proposal \ndoubles the block grant over a five-year period.\n  Of course, the problem with child care is not limited to just \naffordability. Many parents cannot find an available child care slot. \nOur proposal addresses this issue of accessibility by providing a tax \ncredit to businesses to build or renovate on or near-site child care \ncenters for their employees.\n  Finally, there is the issue of quality daycare. Parents cannot be \nproductive in the workplace if they are constantly worrying about the \nhealth and safety of their children in daycare. We have all read the \nhorrifying stories in the newspapers about daycare facilities that are \nunsafe or unsanitary, about the poor record of enforcement of standards \nin many states.\n  While we acknowledge that the federal government should not be \nsetting standards for daycare providers, we do believe the states \nshould set at least minimum health and safety standards and enforce \nthem rigorously. Our legislation beefs up this enforcement by rewarding \nstates with a good enforcement record and penalizing those with poor \nrecords.\n  I am very proud of this legislation, and proud that this group was \nable to come together and produce this initiative. Child care is a \nproblem that must be solved, and we are committed to doing that. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Congress to find workable, \naffordable solutions for all families. I ask unanimous consent that the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 599\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as this decade nears a close, and as our \nNation has enjoyed an unprecedented period of economic growth, there \nremains an issue that affects many American families. I am referring to \nchild care.\n  It has been nearly 9 years since the passage of the bipartisan Child \nCare and Development Block Grant Act. I was proud to have been a \nsponsor of this legislation, and I remain committed to its goals, \nstructure, and principles.\n  Though the CCDBG has led to great improvements in the child care \nsituation facing low-income families in every State, it has become \nclear that more needs to be done to help the family. In my home State \nof Utah, an extraordinary 57 percent of mothers with children under the \nage of 6 are in the labor force, and 134,000 children under the age of \n6 in Utah will be cared for by someone other than their parents.\n  I am pleased to again join my colleagues--Senators Chafee, Snowe, \nRoberts, Specter, Collins, and Cochran--each of whom has a long record \nof concern and involvement in child care issues--in sponsoring this \nmeasure. The Caring for Children Act is a comprehensive, realistic \nchild care proposal, which we believe will benefit middle- and lower-\nincome American families who struggle to get ahead or struggle to keep \nup.\n  First, the Caring for Children Act will, by expanding the Dependent \nCare Tax Credit, cut taxes for many middle- and lower-income families. \nUnder the current system, the maximum credit of 30 percent is available \nonly to families with incomes of $10,000 or less. Our proposal \nincreases the Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) from 30 percent to 50 \npercent. The maximum income is also increased to $30,000. The maximum \nallowable expenses of $2,400 for one child and $4,800 for two or more \nchildren will remain the same.\n  For example, a working family in Vernal, UT, earning $30,000 with two \nchildren, could receive a tax credit of $2,400 (50 percent of $4,800), \ninstead of $960 under the current law.\n  Our bill also lowers the maximum credit more gradually than current \nlaw. This provides a form of tax relief for DCTC-eligible families \nearning between $30,000 and $75,000. This change is intended to benefit \nan often forgotten group--taxpayers who earn too much for Federal \nbreaks but not enough for child care expenses not to be a big bite out \nof their budget.\n  This proposal also breaks new ground. It recognizes, for the first \ntime, as a matter of Federal child care policy, that many families \nelect to have one parent remain at home to serve as the primary are \ngiver. We understand the value of a parent at home to care for a child, \nboth in terms of quality of care and monetary sacrifice. Such families \npay for their child care by forfeiting a second income. The Caring for \nChildren Act would expand eligibility for the Dependent Care Tax Credit \n(DCTC) to families with young children in which one parent remained at \nhome.\n  Our bill assumes child care expenses for such a family of $150 per \nmonth. Thus, a family earning $30,000 with two children, ages 3 and 1, \nin Farmington, UT, in which one parent remains at home, would receive a \ntax credit of $900 (50 percent of $15012 months).\n  Some have criticized our bill for not giving the same tax benefits to \nfamilies with a stay-at-home parent. Frankly, I support such parity in \nthe DCTC. I would like our bill to be able to provide a larger credit. \nBut, expanding eligibility for this credit is an expensive proposition. \nWhile we may not be able to propose DCTC parity in one fell swoop, we \nshould establish the concept in this bill and increase the level of \nbenefit as quickly as we can. But, we should not fail to do something \njust because we cannot do it all.\n  Many families across America elect to forego a second income in order \nto have a parent remain at home with children. Federal policy has so \nfar failed to recognize parental care as child care, even if many \npeople, myself included, consider it the best possible care. I happen \nto believe that parental care is the best care there is.\n  And, let me offer a word of praise and gratitude for my wife, Elaine. \nElaine could have had a successful career as a professional educator. \nInstead, she chose to stay home with our children--all of whom are now \nmarried with children of their own.\n  Of course, my daughters and daughters-in-law will make their own \nchoices about balancing career and family. Different families make \ndifferent choices and face different circumstances that drive their \nchoices. Our bill asserts that the Dependent Care Tax Credit should be \navailable to families regardless of their choice. The DCTC should be a \ntax credit to help families care for children, not just a credit for \nemployment expenses. We should not minimize the significance of this \nchange in the federal child care paradigm.\n\n  Yet, many working but low-income families have no tax liability and \nwill not benefit from our proposed changes to the DCTC. These families, \nmany of which may be headed by single parents or headed by individuals \nmoving from welfare to work, are struggling to make ends meet.\n  One of the family's biggest expenses is child care.\n  The cost of child care, like almost everything else, has increase in \nthe 9 years since the implementation of the Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant. When the CCDBG was enacted, the average cost of care per \nchild was $3,000. Today, it is estimated to be more than $4,000 per \nchild.\n  I invite senators to do the math: If a parent is making $10 an hour \n($20,800 per year before taxes) and has just one child, child care \nexpenses claim almost\n\n[[Page S2597]]\n\none-fifth of the family budget. It is no wonder that the Utah Child \nProtective Services told me some years ago about a mother who was \nforced to choose between groceries and child care.\n  The Caring for Children Act proposes to increase the authorization of \nappropriations for the Child Care and Development Block grant Act \n(CCDBG), which states use to subsidize child care for low-income \nparents and to develop new capacity in areas--both geographic and \nfunctional--where there are shortages.\n  In Utah, as in other states as well, smaller and more rural \ncommunities often have shortages of child care. And, nearly every \ncommunity suffers shortages of infant care, after school care, and care \nfor special needs children.\n  The CCDBG is the only federal program we have for assisting low-\nincome working families with child care expenses. We are not proposing \nto create another one. We are not expanding the statutory eligibility \nor entitlement for this program. The Caring for Children Act merely \nmakes it possible for states to serve more eligible people and to \naddress more of the problem of shortages under the provisions of the \nCCDBG.\n  I have said many times in this body that I do not support federal \nassistance for those who are able but do not help themselves. But, I \nlikewise believe that some help is warranted when people are working \nand doing all they can to provide for their families. This is why I \njoined as a sponsor of the Child Care and Development Block Grant 10 \nyears ago. I do not want Utah families to have to choose between child \ncare and food.\n  We still face issues of quality of care. Our bill affirms state \nprerogatives to set their own standards for child care. My colleagues \nare well aware of my strong opposition to any federal effort to set or \nimply federal standards. States must be allowed discretion in this. \nBut, our bill also recognizes that standards are worthless if they are \nnot enforced.\n  To encourage states to make a stronger commitment to enforce their \nown standards for child care, the Caring for Children Act provides a \nsystem of bonuses for states who exceed a threshold of inspections or, \nconversely, penalties for those who fail to conduct a minimum number of \ninspections. In my view, the most stringent standards in the world do \nnot provide any assurance of quality care if providers do not believe \nstandards will be enforced.\n  I also believe that the best assurance of quality is a parent's own \ngood judgment. The Caring for Children Act takes the very inexpensive, \nbut potentially very productive step of providing funds for beefed up \nconsumer information to parents.\n  There are other important provisions in our bill that are designed to \nencourage private sector initiatives in child care as well as to \nenhance training opportunities for child care providers.\n  All together, the Caring for Children Act attempts to address all \nthree of the major issues in child care: affordability, availability, \nand quality. I believe the bill we are introducing today is measured \nand responsible.\n  In no way is this a government knows best model of social problem \nsolving; rather, it builds on what we already know works and what we \nalready know that parents want. They want resources and information to \nmake their own decisions and to care for their own children. They want \ninput into the plans developed by states. They want control over child \ncare.\n  The bill we are introducing today endeavors to put government on the \nside of parents by returning resources to them through tax credits, by \nenabling states to do more under the CCDBG, by increasing available \nchild care information, and, finally by respecting the choices they \nmake.\n  I am again pleased to join my colleagues in this legislation and hope \nother Senators will support this measure as well.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nto reintroduce legislation to help meet the child care challenges \nfacing families in Kansas and around the nation.\n  Child care, in the home when possible and outside the home when \nparents work, goes right to the heart of keeping families strong.\n  Unfortunately, just being able to afford child care is a major issue \nfor most families. Some child care can cost as much as college tuition \nand consume up to 40 percent of a family's income. Finding quality care \nis another challenge.\n  Welfare reforms have cut Kansas welfare rolls in half since 1996. As \nmore and more of these families come off the rolls, child care needs \ngrow. About half of the 11,000 families that have left welfare rolls in \nKansas have young children. In order to continue the successful \ntransition from welfare to work, parents, especially single parents, \nmust have access to affordable, quality child care.\n  Only parents can and should decide what child care arrangements work \nbest for their children. This includes the decision to stay at home.\n  The Caring for Children Act includes provisions to allow a parent who \nis able to stay at home and care for a child to receive a tax credit to \nhelp cover expenses. This credit applies during the first three years \nof a child's life and amounts to about $900 per year.\n  The Caring for Children Act takes steps to assist small businesses \nthat want to provide child care. I am pleased that this bill includes a \nshort-term flexible grant program to encourage these businesses to work \ntogether to provide child care services. This program, which provides \n$60 million to the states, allows those closer to home to make \ndecisions necessary to improve child care in communities. This funding \nprovides the start-up assistance necessary to create self-sustaining \nchild care programs.\n  I have pledged to work to improve child care. I will continue this \neffort. I look forward to working with my colleagues to expand child \ncare options and protect our nation's most valuable resource, our \nchildren.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to once again \njoin my colleagues in introducing the Caring for Children Act, which \nwill ease the financial burden of child care for American families--for \nthose parents who work, and for those who choose to stay home to raise \ntheir children for a period of time. This legislation is identical to \nthe child care proposal my colleagues and I introduced during the 105th \nCongress, on January 28, 1998. I believe it is vital that the Congress \nrecognize the importance of affordable, quality child care to the \nsuccessful development of our children.\n  The Caring for Children Act is a middle-ground, targeted response to \nthe growing child care needs facing American families. Our bill \nincludes tax incentives for employers and parents, and an increase in \nfunding for programs that assist the most needy families. Most \nimportantly, our bill proposes prudent adjustments to discretionary \nprograms rather than implementing new mandatory spending.\n  Our bill would expand the Dependent Care tax credit to make it more \naccessible to families who need it, double the authorization for the \nChild Care Development Block Grant, and provide grants to small \nbusinesses to create or enhance child care facilities for their \nemployees. This bill also includes provisions from the proposal I \nintroduced during the 105th Congress with my colleagues, Congressman \nJon Fox, The Affordable Child Care Act, which provides a tax credit for \nemployers who provide on-site or site-adjacent child care to their \nemployees in order to reduce the child care expenses of the employee.\n  Not all families choose the same option for child care. Many families \nrely on relatives, centers operated by churches and other religious \norganizations, centers at or near their workplace, or make other \narrangements to provide care for their children while they work. In \nlight of the diverse needs for child care in America, this bill \nrepresents a good start toward expanding the choices for American \nparents. And, any such legislation must recognize that there is a need \nto provide some relief to families where one parent stays at home.\n\n  The need for affordable and accessible day care is critical given the \nincreasing numbers of working parents and dual-income families in the \nUnited States. According to the Bureau of the Census, in 1975, 31 \npercent of married mothers with a child younger than age one \nparticipated in the labor force. By 1995, that figure had risen to 59 \npercent. Almost 64 percent of married mothers and 53 percent of single \nmothers with children younger than age six participated in the labor \nforce in 1995.\n\n[[Page S2598]]\n\n  The cost of child care for families is also significant. Licensed day \ncare centers in some urban areas cost as much as $200 per week, and the \ndisparity in costs and availability of child care between urban and \nrural grows greater every day. For families which need or choose to \nhave both parents work outside the home, the burden of making child \ncare decisions is great. These figures serve to underscore the need for \naction on the part of the Federal Government to provide the necessary \nassistance to our Nation's working families.\n  As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I am pleased that this legislation would \nbuild on an existing Federal child care program by authorizing an \nadditional $5 billion over 5 years to the Child Care Development Block \nGrant program, bringing total spending for this program to nearly $2.5 \nbillion annually by fiscal year 2003. The child care block grant works \nwell to assist low-income families acquire child care, and helped over \n93,000 Pennsylvania families last year. Fiscal year 1999 funding for \nthis vital assistance program totaled $1.182 billion, $182 billion, \n$182 million above the currently authorized level. By increasing the \nauthorization, we can help even more families without creating a new \nentitlement program.\n  Our legislation will also require States to create and enforce safety \nand health standards in child care facilities, and provide money for \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to disseminate information \nto parents and providers about quality child care, through brochures, \ntoll-free hotlines, the Internet, and other technological assistance.\n  The Caring for Children Act complements my recent efforts to assist \nworking families in the context of welfare reform and children's health \ninsurance. When Congress debated welfare reform in 1995 and 1996, I \nworked to ensure that adequate funds were provided for child care, a \ncritical component for welfare mothers who would be required to work to \nreceive new limited welfare benefits. I am pleased that the welfare \nreform bill that became law provided $20 billion in child care funding \nover a 6-year period. Similarly, I was pleased to participate in the \nbipartisan effort in 1997 to enact legislation to provide $24 billion \nover the next 5 years for States to establish or broaden children's \nhealth insurance programs. Utilizing these new Federal funds, over \n10,000 previously uninsured children in Pennsylvania have been enrolled \nin this program since May of 1998.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that it is critical that the \n106th Congress not adjourn without enacting legislation to assist \nfamilies in their ability to afford safe, quality child care for their \nchildren, either at home with a parent or another arrangement. Our \nlegislation will provide peace of mind to millions of American families \nstruggling to balance career and child raising. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in cosponsoring this important legislation, and I urge its \nswift adoption.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE.\n  S. 600. A bill to combat the crime of international trafficking and \nto protect the rights of victims; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n international trafficking of women and children victim protection act \n                                of 1999\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this week across the globe, men and \nwomen have celebrated International Women's Day, highlighting the \nachievements of women around the world. From Qatar to Indonesia, the \nday was marked by women marching, meeting, and protesting for \nrecognition of their inherent dignity and fundamental human rights. I \nbelieve there is much work yet to be done to ensure that women and \ngirls' human rights are protected and respected.\n  One of the most horrendous human rights violations of our time is \ntrafficking in human beings, particularly among women and children, for \npurposes of sexual exploitation and forced labor. To curb this horrific \npractice, I am introducing the ``International Trafficking of Women and \nChildren Victim Protection Act of 1999'' which will put Congress on \nrecord as opposing trafficking for forced prostitution and domestic \nservitude, and acting to check it before the lives of more women and \ngirls are shattered.\n  One of the fastest growing international trafficking businesses is \nthe trade in women. Women and girls seeking a better life, a good \nmarriage, or a lucrative job abroad, unexpectedly find themselves \nforced to work as prostitutes, or in sweat shops. Seeking this better \nlife, they are lured by local advertisements for good jobs in foreign \ncountries at wages they could never imagine at home.\n  Every year, the trafficking of human beings for the sex trade affects \nhundreds of thousands of women throughout the world. Women and children \nwhose lives have been disrupted by economic collapse, civil wars, or \nfundamental changes in political geography, such as the disintegration \nof the Soviet Union, have fallen prey to traffickers. The United States \ngovernment estimates that 1-2 million women and girls are trafficked \nannually around the world. According to experts, between 50 and 100 \nthousand women are trafficked each year into the United States alone. \nThey come from Thailand, Russia, the Ukraine and other countries in \nAsia and the former Soviet Union.\n  Upon arrival in countries far from their homes, these women are often \nstripped of their passports, held against their will in slave-like \nconditions, and sexually abused. Rape, intimidation, and violence are \ncommonly employed by traffickers to control their victims and to \nprevent them from seeking help. Through physical isolation and \npsychological trauma, traffickers and brothel owners imprison women in \na world of economic and sexual exploitation that imposes a constant \nfear of arrest and deportation, as well as of violent reprisals by the \ntraffickers themselves, to whom the women must pay off ever-growing \ndebts. Many brothel owners actually prefer women--women who are far \nfrom help and home, and who do not speak the language--precisely \nbecause of the ease of controlling them.\n  Most of these women never imagined that they would enter such a \nhellish world, having traveled abroad to find better jobs or to see the \nworld. Many in their naivete, believed that nothing bad could happen to \nthem in the rich and comfortable countries such as Switzerland, \nGermany, or the United States. Others, who are less naive but desperate \nfor money and opportunity, are no less hurt by the trafficker's brutal \ngrip.\n  Last year, First Lady Hilary Clinton spoke powerfully of this human \ntragedy. She said: ``I have spoken to young girls in northern Thailand \nwhose parents were persuaded to sell them as prostitutes, and they \nreceived a great deal of money by their standards. You could often tell \nthe homes of where the girls had been sold because they might even have \na satellite dish or an addition built on their house. But I met girls \nwho had come home after they had been used up, after they had \ncontracted HIV or AIDS. If you've ever held the hand of a 13-year-old \ngirl dying of AIDS, you can understand how critical it is that we take \nevery step possible to prevent this happening to any other girl \nanywhere in the world. I also, in the Ukraine, heard of women who told \nme with tears running down their faces that young women in their \ncommunities were disappearing. They answered ads that promised a much \nbetter future in another place and they were never heard from again.''\n  These events are occurring not just in far off lands, but here at \nhome in the U.S. as well. According to a report in the Washington Post \nin 1997, the FBI raided a massage parlor in downtown Bethesda. The \nmassage parlor was involved in the trafficking of Russian women into \nthe United States. The eight Russian women who worked there, lived at \nthe massage parlor, sleeping on the massage tables at night. They were \ncharged a $150 a week for ``housing'' and were not paid any salary, \nonly receiving a portion of their tips.\n\n  According to recent reports by the Justice Department, teenage \nMexican girls were held in slavery in Florida and the Carolinas and \nforced to submit to prostitution. In addition, Russian and Latvian \nwomen were forced to work in nightclubs in Chicago. According to \ncharges filed against the traffickers, the traffickers picked the women \nup upon their arrival at the airport, seized their documents and return \ntickets, locked them in hotels and beat\n\n[[Page S2599]]\n\nthem. The women were told that if they refused to dance nude in various \nnightclubs, the Russian mafia would kill their families. Further, over \nthree years, hundreds of women from the Czech Republic who answered \nadvertisements in Czech newspapers for modeling were ensnared in an \nillegal prostitution ring.\n  Trafficking in women and girls is a human rights problem that \nrequires a human rights response. Trafficking is condemned by human \nrights treaties as a violation of basic human rights and a slavery-like \npractice. Women who are trafficked are subjected to other abuses--rape, \nbeatings, physical confinement--squarely prohibited by human rights \nlaw. The human abuses continue in the workplace, in the forms of \nphysical and sexual abuse, debt bondage and illegal confinement, and \nall are prohibited.\n  Fortunately, the global trade in women and children is receiving \ngreater attention by governments and NGOs following the UN World \nConference on Women in Beijing. The United Nations General Assembly has \ncalled upon all governments to criminalize trafficking, to punish its \noffenders, while not penalizing its victims. The President's \nInteragency Council on Women is working hard to mobilize a response to \nthis problem. Churches, synagogues, and NGOs, such as Human Rights \nWatch and the Global Survival Network, are fighting this battle daily. \nBut, much, much more must be done.\n  My legislation provides a human rights response to the problem. It \nhas a comprehensive and integrated approach focused on prevention, \nprotection and assistance for victims, and prosecution of traffickers.\n  I will highlight a few of its provisions now:\n  It sets an international standard for governments to meet in their \nefforts to fight trafficking and assist victims of this human rights \nabuse. It calls on the State Department and Justice Department to \ninvestigate and take action against international trafficking. In \naddition, it creates an Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat \nTrafficking in the Office of the Secretary of State and directs the \nSecretary to submit an annual report to Congress on international \ntrafficking.\n  The annual report would, among other things, identify states engaged \nin trafficking, the efforts of these states to combat trafficking, and \nwhether their government officials are complicit in the practice. \nCorrupt government or law enforcement officials sometimes directly \nparticipate and benefit in the trade of women and girls. And, \ncorruption also prevents prosecution of traffickers. U.S. police \nassistance would be barred to countries found not to have taken \neffective action in ending the participation of their officials in \ntrafficking, and in investigating and prosecuting meaningfully their \nofficials involved in trafficking. A waiver is provided for the \nPresident if he finds that provision of such assistance is in the \nnational interest.\n  On a national level, it ensures that our immigration laws do not \nencourage rapid deportation of trafficked women, a practice which \neffectively insulates traffickers from ever being prosecuted for their \ncrimes. Trafficking victims are eligible for a nonimmigrant status \nvalid for three months. If the victim pursues criminal or civil actions \nagainst her trafficker, or if she pursues an asylum claim, she is \nprovided with an extension of time. Further, it provides that \ntrafficked women should not be detained, but instead receive needed \nservices, safe shelter, and the opportunity to seek justice against \ntheir abusers. Finally, my bill provides much needed resources to \nprograms assisting trafficking victims here at home and abroad.\n  We must commit ourselves to ending the trafficking of women and girls \nand to building a world in which such exploitation is relegated to the \ndark past. I urge my colleagues to support the International \nTrafficking of Women and Children Protection Act of 1999.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 600\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``International Trafficking of \n     Women and Children Victim Protection Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The worldwide trafficking of persons has a \n     disproportionate impact on women and girls and has been and \n     continues to be condemned by the international community as a \n     violation of fundamental human rights.\n       (2) The fastest growing international trafficking business \n     is the trade in women, whereby women and girls seeking a \n     better life, a good marriage, or a lucrative job abroad, \n     unexpectedly find themselves in situations of forced \n     prostitution, sweatshop labor, exploitative domestic \n     servitude, or battering and extreme cruelty.\n       (3) Trafficked women and children, girls and boys, are \n     often subjected to rape and other forms of sexual abuse by \n     their traffickers and often held as virtual prisoners by \n     their exploiters, made to work in slavery-like conditions, in \n     debt bondage without pay and against their will.\n       (4) The President, the First Lady, the Secretary of State, \n     the President's Interagency Council on Women, and the Agency \n     for International Development have all identified trafficking \n     in women as a significant problem.\n       (5) The Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing \n     Conference) called on all governments to take measures, \n     including legislative measures, to provide better protection \n     of the rights of women and girls in trafficking, to address \n     the root factors that put women and girls at risk to \n     traffickers, and to take measures to dismantle the national, \n     regional, and international networks on trafficking.\n       (6) The United Nations General Assembly, noting its concern \n     about the increasing number of women and girls who are being \n     victimized by traffickers, passed a resolution in 1998 \n     calling upon all governments to criminalize trafficking in \n     women and girls in all its forms and to penalize all those \n     offenders involved, while ensuring that the victims of these \n     practices are not penalized.\n       (7) Numerous treaties to which the United States is a party \n     address government obligations to combat trafficking, \n     including such treaties as the 1956 Supplementary Convention \n     on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions \n     and Practices Similar to Slavery, which calls for the \n     complete abolition of debt bondage and servile forms of \n     marriage, and the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labor Convention, \n     which undertakes to suppress and requires signatories not to \n     make use of any forced or compulsory labor.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to condemn and combat the \n     international crime of trafficking in women and children and \n     to assist the victims of this crime by--\n       (1) setting a standard by which governments are evaluated \n     for their response to trafficking and their treatment of \n     victims;\n       (2) authorizing and funding an interagency task force to \n     carry out such evaluations and to issue an annual report of \n     its findings to include the identification of foreign \n     governments that tolerate or participate in trafficking and \n     fail to cooperate with international efforts to prosecute \n     perpetrators;\n       (3) assisting trafficking victims in the United States by \n     providing humanitarian assistance and by providing them \n     temporary nonimmigrant status in the United States;\n       (4) assisting trafficking victims abroad by providing \n     humanitarian assistance; and\n       (5) denying certain forms of United States foreign \n     assistance to those governments which tolerate or participate \n     in trafficking, abuse victims, and fail to cooperate with \n     international efforts to prosecute perpetrators.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to improve the foreign language assistance program; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n       foreign language education improvement amendments of 1999\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend \nthe Foreign Language Assistance Program which is administered under the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n\n[[Page S2601]]\n\n  The Foreign Language Education Improvement Amendments of 1999 make \nchanges that encourage and make possible the teaching of a second \nlanguage to students in elementary and secondary schools with limited \nresources--in particular, those schools heavily impacted by the unique \nproblems of educating a high population of disadvantaged students.\n  My bill also provides schools an incentive to initiate foreign \nlanguage programs, promotes technology, distance learning, and other \ninnovative activities in the effective instruction of a foreign \nlanguage.\n  Recent research about the human brain and language acquisition, which \nwe've heard a lot about in connection to the teaching of reading and \nearly childhood development, revealed that the ability to learn new \nlanguages is highest between birth and age six. ``Windows of \nopportunity'' is how a February 3, 1997, Time article described this \nneurological function, which effectively is open and pliable during the \nearly years of life and closes by the age of ten.\n  We all know, from personal and other practical experience, that of \ncourse, people learn foreign languages beyond the age of ten. But, the \nenlightening fact of the research is that humans learn languages \neasier, and best at an early age.\n  The National School Boards Association publication, School Board \nNews, printed an article in July, 1997 that describes early foreign \nlanguage programs, and the benefits of learning languages early:\n\n       According to the Center for Applied Linguistics (CAL) in \n     Washington, D.C., the early study of a second language offers \n     many benefits for students, including gains in academic \n     achievement, positive attitudes toward diversity, increased \n     flexibility in thinking, greater sensitivity to language, and \n     a better ear for listening and pronunciation. Foreign \n     language study also improves children's understanding of \n     their native language, increase creativity, helps students \n     get better SAT scores, and increase their job opportunities.\n\n  The evidence shows that children who learn foreign languages score \nhigher in all academic subjects than those who speak only English. Most \ndeveloped countries recognize this and, according to the National \nForeign Language Center, the United States is alone in not teaching \nforeign languages routinely before the age of twelve. Congress \nrecognized the need for foreign language study when it passed Goals \n2000 in 1994, making foreign language acquisition an education \npriority.\n  In February of this year, the Center for Applied Linguistics released \nthe results of a U.S. Department of Education funded survey of foreign \nlanguage teaching in preschool through 12th grade in the United States. \nThe results show a rising awareness and increase in the teaching of \nforeign languages, but in the 31 percent of elementary schools that \noffer foreign language instruction, only 21 percent have proficiency as \nthe goal of the program. Among the most frequently cited problems \nfacing foreign language programs were inadequate funding, inadequate \nin-service teacher training, teacher shortages and a lack of sequencing \nfrom elementary to secondary school.\n  This survey is a good snapshot of the state of the teaching of \nforeign languages K-12 in our country. It can be read as encouraging: \nthat we know we should be teaching languages earlier; that more schools \nare attempting to teach foreign languages; and that more languages are \nbeing taught. It also clearly shows where we need improvement: that we \nneed to show accomplishment in teaching our students foreign languages; \nthat more schools need to have the resources to offer the necessary \ncourse work for attaining this skill; and, that foreign languages \nshould be a priority.\n  The advantages of having foreign language ability range from greater \nopportunities for college admission to fulfilling national security \nneeds. The National Council for Languages and International Studies \nfound that the top attainable skill cited as a determining factor for \nlikely college admission is foreign language proficiency. There are \nalso social and cultural tolerance advantages that the National Council \nfor Languages and International Studies and others cite, which most of \nus can appreciate. According to a February 1998, USA Today survey, top \nexecutives of America's businesses cited a need for and lack of foreign \nlanguage skills twice as great as any other skill in demand.\n  The National Foreign Language Center published a 1999 report titled, \nLanguage and National Security for the 21st Century: The Federal Role \nin Supporting National Language Capacity. This report is very \ncompelling in its review of the need for military and civilian \npersonnel with foreign language capability, and the lack thereof in our \ncurrent and rising workforces. Here are some quotes from that report:\n\n       For example, the admission of a DEA official in September, \n     1997 that the agency lacks sufficient Russian language \n     expertise to combat organized crime in groups from the former \n     Soviet Union indicates a shortfall in supply of such \n     expertise.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Foreign Service reports that only 60% of its billets \n     requiring language are at present filled, with waivers \n     applied to the other 35%.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Clearly, the academic system falls short in producing \n     speakers minimally qualified to hold jobs requiring the use \n     of foreign language, which is why the federal language \n     programs exist and why the language training business in the \n     private sector is so successful.\n\n  The same report further explains that the language training business \nis estimated to be $20 billion internationally. That is money spent by \nour government, our businesses and individuals to teach adults a skill \nessential in the global relationships of industry, diplomacy, defense, \nand higher education.\n  The evidence of need is great, and yet there is a lack of sufficient \nforeign language training at the K-12 level. We have one program in the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act aimed at providing incentives \nand giving grants to schools for this purpose. It is a program that is \ncurrently funded at just $5 million for a few matching grants in a \nhandful of states. However, the section of this law providing a grant \nfor schools that offer foreign language instruction programs has never \nbeen funded. A frustrating aspect of this good program is that the \nschools in the most need of the assistance can't afford the ante. My \namendments establish a 50 percent set aside for schools serving the \nmost disadvantaged students, and eliminates the matching share \nrequirement for those schools. This bill also increases the annual \nauthorization for the program from $55,000,000 to $75,000,000.\n  I hope that we will give greater attention to this program when we \nmake funding decisions, so that schools without the advantages of \nplentiful resources can provide their students with a high quality and \ncompetitive education.\n  My amendments to the ESEA Foreign Language Assistance Program will \nprovide new opportunities and encouragement to our school children, \nteachers, and parents, so we can better meet our global business \nchallenges and national security needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Hagel, \n        Mr. Kyl, Mr. Burns, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Abraham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Helms, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \n        Grams, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Hutchinson and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 602. A bill to amend chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide for congressional review of any rule promulgated by the \nInternal Revenue Service that increases Federal Revenue, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Government Affairs.\n\n\n                     the stealth tax prevention act\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague Senator \nBond, to introduce the Stealth Tax Prevention Act. Among the many \npowers given to Congress by the Constitution of the United States, the \nresponsibility of taxation is perhaps the most important. The Founding \nFathers rationale behind bestowing this power to Congress is that \nbecause, as elected representative, Congress remains accountable to the \nvoters when they levy and collect taxes. Politicians are rightly held \nresponsible to the public for producing fair and prudent tax \nlegislation.\n  Three years ago, Mr. President, Congress passed the Congressional \nReview Act, which provides that when a major agency rule takes effect, \nCongress has 60 days to review it. During this time\n\n[[Page S2602]]\n\nperiod, Congress has the option to pass a disapproval resolution. If no \nsuch resolution is passed, the rule then goes into effect.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the Internal Revenue Service maintains an \nenormous amount of power over the lives and the livelihoods of the \nAmerican taxpayers through their authority to interpret the Tax Code. \nThe Stealth Tax Prevention Act, that Senator Bond and I are introducing \nalong with Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Burns, Mr. Gramm, Mr. \nAshcroft, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Helms, Mr. Inhofe, \nMr. Sessions, Mr. Grams, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Hutchinson, and Ms. Snowe, \nwill expand the definition of a major rule to include, Mr. President, \nany IRS regulation which increases Federal revenue. Why? Because we \nneed to return the authority of taxation to the United States Congress.\n  For example, if the Office of Management and Budget finds that the \nimplementation and enforcement of a rule would result in an increase of \nFederal revenues over current practices or revenues anticipated from \nthe rule on the date of the enactment of the statute, the Stealth Tax \nPrevention Act would allow Congress to review the regulations and take \nappropriate measures to avoid raising taxes on hard working Americans, \nin most cases, small businesses.\n  The discretionary authority of the Internal Revenue Service exposes \nsmall businesses, farmers, and others to the sometimes arbitrary \nactions of bureaucrats, thus creating an uncertain and, under certain \ncases, hostile environment in which to conduct day-to-day activities. \nMost of these people do not have lobbyists that work for them other \nthan their elected Representatives. The Stealth Tax Prevention Act will \nbe particularly helpful in lowering the tax burden on small business \nwhich suffers disproportionately, Mr. President, from IRS regulations. \nThis burden discourages the startup of new firms and ultimately the \ncreation of new jobs in the economy, which has really made America \ngreat today.\n  Americans are now paying a higher share of their income to the \nFederal government than at any time since the end of World War II. \nThey, Mr. President, as you well know, pay State income taxes. They pay \nproperty taxes. On the way to work in the morning they pay a gasoline \ntax when they fill up their car, and a sales tax when they buy a cup of \ncoffee.\n  Allowing bureaucrats to increase taxes even further, at their own \ndiscretion through interpretation of the Tax Code is unconscionable. \nThe Stealth Tax Prevention Act will leave tax policy where it belongs, \nto elected Members of the Congress, not unelected and unaccountable IRS \nbureaucrats.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I join my distinguished colleague from \nAlabama, Senator Shelby, in reintroducing legislation, which we proudly \noffered in the 105th Congress and will work to enact during the 106th \nCongress. Our goal is to ensure that the Treasury Department's Internal \nRevenue Service does not usurp the power to tax--a power solely vested \nin Congress by the U.S. Constitution. ``The Stealth Tax Prevention \nAct'' will ensure that the duly elected representatives of the people, \nwho are accountable to the electorate for our actions, will have \ndiscretion to exercise the power to tax. This legislation is intended \nto curb the ability of the Treasury Department to bypass Congress by \nproposing a tax increase without the authorization or consent of \nCongress.\n  The Stealth Tax Prevention Act builds on legislation passed \nunanimously by the Senate in the 104th Congress. As Chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business, I authored the Small Business Regulatory \nEnforcement Fairness Act--better known as the Red Tape Reduction Act--\nto ensure that small businesses are treated fairly in agency rulemaking \nand enforcement activities. Subtitle E of the Red Tape Reduction Act \nprovides that a final rule issued by a Federal agency and deemed a \n``major rule'' by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of \nthe Office of Management and Budget cannot go into effect for at least \nsixty days. This delay is to provide Congress with a window during \nwhich we can review the rule and its impact, allowing time for Congress \nto consider whether a resolution of disapproval should be enacted to \nstrike down the regulation. To become effective, the resolution must \npass both the House and Senate and be signed into law by the President \nor enacted as the result of a veto override.\n  Later this month, I will commemorate the third anniversary of the Red \nTape Reduction Act's enactment by highlighting the progress made to \ndate and the obstacles small businesses continue to face primarily due \nto agency noncompliance. Because of the IRS' significant impact on the \nactivities of small businesses, the Service's implementation of the Red \nTape Reduction Act and the Regulatory Flexibility Act is of utmost \nimportance to the Committee on Small Business.\n  The bill Senator Shelby and I introduce today amends this law to \nprovide that any rule issued by the Treasury Department's Internal \nRevenue Service that will result in a tax increase--any increase--will \nbe deemed a major rule by OIRA and, consequently, not go into effect \nfor at least 60 days. This procedural safeguard will ensure that the \nDepartment of the Treasury and its Internal Revenue Service cannot make \nan end-run around Congress, as it attempted with the ``stealth tax'' it \nproposed on January 13, 1997.\n  In that case, the IRS issued a proposal that is tantamount to a tax \nincrease on businesses structured as limited liability companies. The \nIRS proposed to disqualify a taxpayer from being considered as a \nlimited partner if he or she ``participates in the partnership's trade \nor business for more than 500 hours during a taxable year'' or is \ninvolved in a ``service'' partnership, such as lawyers, accountants, \nengineers, architects, and health-care providers.\n  The IRS alleges that its proposal merely interprets section \n1402(a)(13) of the Internal Revenue Code, providing clarification, when \nin actuality it is a tax increase regulatory fiat. Under the IRS \nproposal, disqualification as a limited partner will result in a tax \nincrease on income from both capital investments as well as earnings of \nthe partnership. The effect will be to add the self-employment tax \n(12.4% for social security and 2.9% for Medicare) to income from \ninvestments as well as earnings for limited partners who under current \nrules can exclude such income from the self employment tax.\n  Under the bill introduced today, this tax increase on limited \npartners, if later issued as a final rule, could not go into effect for \nat least 60 days following its publication in the Federal Register. \nThis window, which coincides with issuance of a report by the \nComptroller General, would allow Congress the opportunity to review the \nrule and vote on a resolution to disapprove the tax increase before it \nis applied to a single taxpayer.\n  The Stealth Tax Prevention Act strengthens the Red Tape Reduction Act \nand the vital procedural safeguards it provides to ensure that small \nbusinesses are not burdened unnecessarily by new Federal regulations. \nCongress enacted the 1996 provisions to strengthen the effectiveness of \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, a law which had been ignored too often \nby government agencies, especially the Internal Revenue Service. Three \nof the top recommendations of the 1995 White House Conference on Small \nBusiness sought reforms to the way government regulations are developed \nand enforced, and the Red Tape Reduction Act passed the Senate without \na single dissenting vote on its way to being signed into law on March \n29, 1996. Despite the inclusion of language in the 1996 amendments that \nexpressly addresses coverage of IRS interpretative rules, the IRS \ncontinues to bypass compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n  As 18 of my Senate colleagues and I advised Secretary Rubin in an \nApril 9, 1997, letter, the proposed IRS regulation on limited-partner \ntaxation is precisely the type or rule for which a regulatory \nflexibility analysis should be done. Although, on its face, the \nrulemaking seeks merely to ``define a limited partner'' or to \n``eliminate uncertainty'' in determining net earnings from self-\nemployment, the real effect of the rule would be to raise taxes by \nexecutive fiat and expand substantially the spirit and letter of the \nunderlying statute. The rule also seeks to impose on small businesses a \nburdensome new recordkeeping and collection of information requirement \nthat would affect\n\n[[Page S2603]]\n\nmillions of limited partners and members of limited liability \ncompanies. The IRS proposed this ``stealth'' tax increase with the \nknowledge that Congress declined to adopt a similar tax increase in the \nHealth Security Act proposed in 1994--a provision that the \nCongressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 1994 would have \nresulted in a tax increase of approximately $500 million per year.\n  The Stealth Tax Prevention Act would remove any incentive for the \nTreasury Department to underestimate the cost imposed by an IRS \nproposed or final rule in an effort to skirt the Administration's \nregulatory review process or its obligations under the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. By amending the definition of ``major rule'' under the \nCongressional Review Act, which is Subtitle E of the Red Tape Reduction \nAct, we ensure that an IRS rule that imposes a tax increase will be a \nmajor rule, whether or not it has an estimated annual effect on the \neconomy of $100,000,000. Our amendment does not change the trigger for \na regulatory flexibility analysis, which still will be required if a \nproposed rule would have ``a significant economic impact on a \nsubstantial number of small entities.'' We believe the heightened \nscrutiny of IRS regulations called for by this legislation will provide \nan additional incentive for the Treasury Department's Internal Revenue \nService to meet all of its procedural obligations under the Reg Flex \nAct and the Red Tape Reduction Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this important \nlegislation to ensure that the IRS neither usurps the proper role of \nCongress--nor skirts its obligations to identify the impact of its \nproposed and final rules. When the Department of the Treasury issues a \nfinal IRS rule that increases taxes, Congress should have the ability \nto exercise its discretion to enact a resolution of disapproval before \nthe rule is applicable to a single taxpayer. The Stealth Tax Prevention \nAct Senator Shelby and I introduce today provides that opportunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 603. A bill to promote competition and greater efficiency of \nairlines to ensure the rights of airline passengers, to provide for \nfull disclosure to those passengers, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            airline deregulation and disclosure act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the legislation that abolished the Civil \nAeronautics Board in 1978 and deregulated the airline industry has been \na huge success. Americans are flying more, and more Americans are \nflying; at the same time, air fares have dropped and air travel has \nbecome safer. The average price of an airline ticket has decreased \napproximately 33 percent in real terms since market forces replaced the \nwhims of federal bureaucrats in setting fares. The number of passengers \nflying domestic routes has more than doubled to approximately 600 \nmillion annually. It is not surprising, then, that air travel is no \nlonger an exclusive privilege of the elite and today is accessible to \nmost Americans.\n  While deregulation of the airline industry overall has yielded the \nbenefits that free markets promise, there are growing pains. As the \nnumber of air passengers increases, so has the number of consumer \ncomplaints against air carriers. Some members of Congress have \nconcluded that competition does not work for commercial aviation. They \nhave stepped forward with proposals to reimpose federal control over \nair fares and carrier routes, to offer taxpayer subsidies to fledgling \nair carriers to compete against industry goliaths, or to levy a variety \nof new fines that would add to the Department of Transportation's duty \nthe role of meter maid. We should be wary of any such effort to \nreintroduce the heavy hand of government under the auspices of \nprotecting airline passengers.\n  Mr. President, lets not rush to throw out the baby with the bath \nwater and undo twenty years of unprecedented growth and consumer \nsavings under deregulation. Now is the time to reinvigorate competition \nin the air passenger market, even if the air carriers do not welcome \nit. The best way to increase competition is to regulate less, not more. \nRegulations that serve as barriers to the commercial aviation market \nshould be removed. Regulations that promote the division of the \nmarketplace into regional cartels should be abandoned. Regulations and \nFAA management practices that delay the installation of new technology \nthat facilitates competition should be streamlined.\n  I believe that we can also increase competition in the airline \nindustry by providing the traveling public with more useful information \nand by giving consumers ownership of the commodity they have \npurchased--their seat on an airplane. Today, I am introducing \nlegislation that will provide passengers with greater information about \ntheir air fare and flight and with greater flexibility over unused or \npartially used fares.\n  The price of an airline ticket is as much a mystery as the Pyramids \nor the Hanging Gardens. In fact, The New York Times reported that on a \nsingle flight, passengers paid 27 different fares, ranging from $87 to \n$728. We should not adopt any measure that discourage air carriers from \ndiscounting fares or that chill the benefits airline consumers are now \nreceiving. Air carriers, however, should not be allowed to continue \nbait-and-switch advertising. If an air carrier offers a discounted \nfare, my bill permits all passengers to make a confirmed reservation at \nthat same price for a twenty-four hour period.\n  Under my bill, consumers will get more ticket and flight information. \nAirlines will be required to notify passengers about flight delays, \ncancellations, or diversions. Air carriers must also disclose if the \npassenger will be traveling on a carrier other than the one from whom \nthe consumer purchased the ticket or if the flight will require the \npassenger to change planes.\n  At the same time, my bill will ensure that air carriers are penalized \nfor canceling flights, bumping passengers, and holding travelers \nhostage on board an aircraft with inpunity. Whenever an airline \npassenger is unable to make a flight, the passenger will have the \nopportunity to board a similar flight on a standby basis. Whenever an \nairline cancels a flight for their convenience, it will have to offer \nto compensate each passenger. Whenever an airline keeps passengers on \nboard an aircraft that sits on the tarmac for more than two hours, it \nwill have to offer to compensate each passenger.\n  The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 started a revolution in the \nairline industry, a revolution that according to a Brookings \nInstitution study has benefitted consumers by $18.4 billion. That \nrevolution is unfinished. I want to take the next step and promote new \ncompetition in the passenger aviation marketplace. My bill does this by \ntaking away much of the mystery associated with flying.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Airline Deregulation and \n     Disclosure Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

and\n       Whereas the American Institute in Taiwan has played a \n     successful role in sustaining and enhancing United States \n     relations with Taiwan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should reaffirm its commitment to the \n     Taiwan Relations Act and the specific guarantees of provision \n     of legitimate defense articles to Taiwan contained therein;\n       (2) the Congress has grave concerns over China's growing \n     arsenal of nuclear and conventionally armed ballistic \n     missiles, the movement of those missiles into a closer \n     geographic proximity to Taiwan, and the effect that the \n     buildup may have on stability in the Taiwan Strait;\n       (3) the President should direct all appropriate officials \n     to raise with officials from the People's Republic of China \n     the grave concern of the United States over China's growing \n     arsenal of nuclear and conventionally armed ballistic \n     missiles, the movement of those missiles into a closer \n     geographic proximity to Taiwan, and the effect that the \n     buildup may have on stability in the Taiwan Strait;\n       (4) the President should seek from the leaders of the \n     People's Republic of China a public renunciation of any use \n     of force, or threat to use force, against democratic Taiwan;\n       (5) the President should provide annually a report \n     detailing the military balance on both sides of the Taiwan \n     Strait, including the impact of procurement and modernization \n     programs underway;\n       (6) the Secretary of Defense should inform the appropriate \n     committees of Congress when officials from Taiwan seek to \n     purchase defense articles for self-defense;\n       (7) the United States Government should encourage a high-\n     level dialog with officials of Taiwan and of other United \n     States allies in East Asia, including Japan and South Korea, \n     on the best means to ensure stability, peace, and freedom of \n     the seas in East Asia;\n       (8) it should be United States policy, in conformity with \n     the spirit of section 4(d) of\n\n[[Page S2606]]\n\n     the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3303(d)), to publicly \n     support Taiwan's admission to the World Trade Organization \n     forthwith, on its own merits as well as to encourage others \n     to adopt similar policies, without making such admission \n     conditional on the previous or simultaneous admission of the \n     People's Republic of China to the World Trade Organization.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President. April 10, 1999 will mark the twentieth \nanniversary of the signing of the Taiwan Relations Act (``TRA''). \nToday, I am submitting a concurrent resolution commemorating this \nimportant piece of legislation and the commitments that the United \nStates made to the people of Taiwan. The resolution is cosponsored by \nSenator Lott, the majority leader, Senator Helms, the chairman of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Thomas, the chairman of the \nEast Asia Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Torricelli, also on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nSenator Rockefeller, Senator Burns, and Senator Kyl. A similar \nresolution is being introduced today in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Dana Rohrabacher.\n  Mr. President. I was not here when Congress passed the TRA in 1979, \nbut I have great respect for the wisdom that those who proceeded me \nplayed in passing this enduring piece of legislation. As former Senator \nDole said in commenting on the changes the Congress made to the \nlegislation proposed by the Carter Administration:\n\n       [The changes in the bill] ``were meant only to recognize \n     the simple reality of U.S. concerns in the Asia-Pacific \n     region and our desire for peace for an old and faithful \n     ally.''--March 7, 1979.\n\n  In talking to colleagues and former Administration officials who were \nhere for the creation of the TRA, you get the sense that no one \nexpected Taiwan to be around for very long. But Taiwan not only \nsurvived, she thrived. Taiwan turned into one of the Asian Tigers, and \nhas managed to weather the Asian flu. She is a full-fledged multi-party \ndemocracy that respects human rights and civil liberties. She serves as \na model of successful democratic reform.\n  The positive changes in Taiwan are a tribute to the spirit and \nperseverance of her people, who have achieved an almost impossible \ndream in the view of many. The United States cannot take credit for \nTaiwan's achievements, but we can be proud of East Asia. So I think it \nis appropriate that we take up this resolution that commemorates the \nanniversary of this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President. The resolution praises the TRA for contributing to \npeace, security and stability in the Taiwan Strait. The resolution also \npraises the growth of democracy, human rights and civil liberties on \nTaiwan. And the resolution notes the successful role that the American \nInstitute in Taiwan has played in sustaining and enhancing our \nrelations with Taiwan.\n  The resolution does express concern about several issues including \nthe process for evaluating Taiwan's legitimate defense needs, the lack \nof high-level dialog between senior military officials on Taiwan and \nAmerican defense officials regarding regional stability. The resolution \nalso expresses Congress's grave concern over the possible threat to \nsecurity in the Taiwan Strait from China's defense modernization and \nprocurement as documented in the February 1, 1999, report to Congress \nby the Secretary of Defense on ``The Security Situation in the Taiwan \nStrait''.\n  Mr. president. This resolution calls for the Congress to reaffirm our \ncommitment to the TRA and to the specific guarantees to provide \nlegitimate defense articles to Taiwan. The Resolution also expresses \nour grave concern over the threat to Taiwan from China's growing \narsenal of nuclear and conventionally armed ballistic missiles, the \nmovement to those missiles into a closer geographic proximity to \nTaiwan, and the effect that the buildup may have on stability in the \nTaiwan Strait.\n  The resolution also encourages a high-level dialog with officials of \nTaiwan and our other East Asia allies concerning the best means to \nensure peace and stability in East Asia.\n  To provide the Congress with timely information to evaluate Taiwan's \nself-defense needs, this resolution asks the President to provide an \nannual report detailing the military balance on both sides of the \nTaiwan Strait.\n  Finally, this resolution notes that it should be United States policy \nto publicly support Taiwan's admission to the World Trade Organization \non its own merits as well as to encourage other countries to adopt \nsimilar policies, without making such admission conditional on the \nprevious or simultaneous admission of the People's Republic of China to \nthe World Trade Organization.\n  Mr. President. I hope that the full Senate will have the opportunity \nto vote on this resolution in the near future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2606-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2606-S2607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I rise to mark the ninth \nanniversary of the restoration of Lithuania's independence. I also rise \nto pay tribute to the Lithuanian people for their perseverance and \nsacrifice, which enabled them to achieve the freedom they now enjoy.\n  On March 11, 1990, the newly elected Lithuanian Parliament, \nfulfilling its electoral mandate from the people of Lithuania, declared \nthe restoration of Lithuania's independence and the establishment of a \ndemocratic state. This marked a great moment for Lithuania and for \nlovers of freedom around the globe.\n  The people of Lithuania endured a 51-year foreign occupation. \nResulting from the infamous Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939, this Soviet \noccupation brought with it communist dictatorship and cultural \ngenocide. But the Lithuanian people were not defeated. They resisted \ntheir oppressors and kept their culture, their faith and their dream of \nindependence very much alive even during the hardest times.\n  The people of Lithuania were even able to mobilize and sustain a non-\nviolent movement for social and political change, a movement which came \nto be known as Sajudis. This people's movement helped guarantee a \npeaceful transition to independence through full participation in \ndemocratic elections on February 24, 1990.\n  Unfortunately, the peace did not last. In January 1991, ten months \nafter restoration of independence, the people and government of \nLithuania faced a bloody assault by foreign troops intent on \noverthrowing their democratic institutions. Lithuanians withstood this \nassault, maintaining their independence and their democracy. Their \nsuccessful use of non-violent resistance to an oppressive regime is an \ninspiration to all.\n  On September 17, 1991, Lithuania became a member of the United \nNations and is a signatory to a number of its organizations and other \ninternational agreements. It also is a member of the Organization for \nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, the North Atlantic Cooperation \nCouncil and the Council of Europe. Lithuania is an associate member of \nthe European Union, has applied for NATO membership and is currently \nnegotiating for membership in the WTO, OECD and other Western \norganizations.\n  The United States established diplomatic relations with Lithuania on \nJuly 28, 1992. But our nation never really broke with the government \nand people of Lithuania. The U.S. never recognized the forcible \nincorporation of Lithuania into the U.S.S.R., and views the present \nGovernment of Lithuania as a legal continuation of the inter-war \nrepublic. Indeed, for over fifty years the United States maintained a \nbipartisan consensus that our nation would refuse to recognize the \nforcible incorporation of Lithuania into the former Soviet Union.\n  Our relations with Lithuania are strong, friendly and mutually \nbeneficial. Lithuania has enjoyed Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) treatment \nwith the U.S. since December, 1991. Through 1996, the U.S. has \ncommitted over $100 million to Lithuania's economic and political \ntransformation and to address humanitarian needs. In 1994, the U.S. and \nLithuania signed an agreement of bilateral trade and intellectual \nproperty protection, and in 1997 a bilateral investment treaty.\n  In 1998 the U.S. and Lithuania signed The Baltic Charter Partnership. \nThat charter recalls the history of American relations with the area \nand underscores our ``real, profound, and enduring'' interest in the \nsecurity and independence of the three Baltic states. As the Charter \nalso notes, our interest in a Europe whole and free will not be ensured \nuntil Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are secure.\n  Mr. President, I commend the people of Lithuania for their courage \nand perseverance in using peaceful means to regain their independence. \nI pledge to work with my colleagues to continue working to secure the \nfreedom and independence of Lithuania and its Baltic neighbors, and I \njoin with the people of Lithuania as they celebrate their \nindependence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2607-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ROBERT CONDON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Robert \nCondon, one of our nation's leading child literacy advocates, who died \nlast month, tragically, at the all-too-young age of 40. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in sending condolences to the Condon family.\n  Robert Condon was a successful businessman, but his true passion was \nreading. Throughout the 1980s, he took time from his career and family \nto read to children at local homeless shelters. He understood, far \nbefore many Americans did, that reading aloud to children is one of the \nmost effective ways to teach literacy and improve young people's lives.\n  In 1991, Robert Condon quit his regular job in order to work full \ntime promoting youth literacy. He founded the non-profit organization \n``Rolling Readers USA,'' where he and a small cadre of volunteers read \nto children in public housing developments, homeless shelters, and \nschools in the San Diego area.\n  Robert Condon's passion was contagious and Rolling Readers grew \nexponentially. Today, it has 40,000 volunteers reading to children in \n24 states. Rolling Readers has won acclaim from national organizations, \nincluding the International Reading Association and Reading Is \nFundamental.\n  In his short life, Robert Condon touched the lives of hundreds of \nthousands of children. In his memory, Rolling Readers USA is sponsoring \nMarch 27 as a national read-in day, when tens of thousands of \nvolunteers will spend part of their day reading to children, keeping \nRobert Condon's ideals moving forward.\n  Mr. President, I encourage all Americans to participate in Rolling \nReaders USA's national read-in day and to become involved throughout \nthe year to promote youth literacy. Volunteering our time and energy \nmakes a difference and is a fitting way to pay tribute to this \nremarkable Californian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2607-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2607-S2608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REMARKS BY BETH MACY HONORING SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I submit for the Record the \nfollowing remarks made by Ms. Beth Macy at an event honoring Senator \nClaiborne Pell, hosted by the National Association of Independent \nColleges and Universities (NAICU). Ms. Macy, a former Pell Grant \nrecipient, spoke eloquently about the positive difference that the Pell \ngrant made in her life and the difference it has made in the lives of \nthe students she now teaches. Senator Pell, a statesman committed to \neducation, was visionary in his creation of the grant that now bears \nhis name. The Pell Grant still serves as the very foundation of our \nfederal commitment to postsecondary study and it has helped make the \ndream of higher education a reality for millions of low-income \nindividuals. I was pleased and honored to participate in this event for \nSenator Pell.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the time to read Ms. Macy's remarks. \nThey remind us of why our support for the Pell grant program is \nimportant.\n\n[[Page S2608]]\n\n  The remarks follow:\n\n                          Remarks of Beth Macy\n\n       When a friend of mine, a writer who is in her 80s, heard I \n     was going to give a speech about having been a Pell grant \n     recipient, her first reaction was to joke: ``Don't do it,'' \n     she said ``Unless they promise to forgive any outstanding \n     loan payments.'' And then she said: ``You always hear about \n     Fulbrights, but nobody ever says how much they appreciated \n     their Pell grants.'' That was my thought exactly. And it has \n     been my thought since the day I realized just how much the \n     Pell grant has done for me and thousands of other people like \n     me. They say the G.I. bill changed America; that thousands of \n     people became the first in their families to go to college, \n     turning education from an elites-only business to a more \n     democratic enterprise. Well, the Pells did the same thing a \n     little later and went deeper, helping more women and \n     minorities than the G.I. bill did. And I say this to you \n     unequivocally because I believe it: Had I not gone to \n     college, I don't think I'd have any of the things I treasure \n     most today--my husband, my sons, my friends, my work, even my \n     psychological well-being.\n       I am not a rich person now, by any means. I drive a used \n     Volvo station wagon with 122,000 miles. My husband drives to \n     the inner-city school where he works in a 1986 Mustang \n     convertible--with a roof that leaks every time it rains. We \n     live in a three-bedroom, four-square house in Roanoke, \n     Virginia, with questionable floor joists and cranky plumbing. \n     The house was built in 1927, the same year my mother was \n     born. Both my house and my mother have character, as they say \n     of things that charm you and annoy you and sometimes make you \n     laugh. My mother was too poor to go to college, and my father \n     dropped out of school in the seventh grade. He told me once \n     that serving as a cook in World War II was the best thing \n     he'd ever done, but he came home from the war to a life of \n     alcoholism, depression and scattered employment. My three \n     older siblings--whose early-adult years predate the founding \n     of the Pell grant--didn't go to college, either; they didn't \n     even consider it. It was just not something people in our \n     family did. I don't want to give you the impression that we \n     grew up hungry or physically abused; we didn't. But we were \n     afflicted with the most serious side effect of growing up \n     poor: the inability to dream. We felt inferior to the kind of \n     people who took vacations and drove cars that started \n     every time.\n       A few years ago I was reminded of how small my world used \n     to be before I went away to college. My husband and I were \n     driving my 16-year-old niece, who lives in Ohio, to our house \n     in Virginia--on her first trip across state lines. We stopped \n     in Charleston, West Virginia, to refuel the car and our \n     bellies, when Sara removed her requisite teenage earphones, \n     bolted upright in her seat and gasped, ``You mean they have \n     McDonald's here, too?!''\n       Today I teach personal-essay and memoir writing as an \n     adjunct instructor at Hollins University. I also teach \n     freshman comp and remedial writing part-time at our community \n     college. When any of my students complain that their stories \n     aren't worthy of the written word--or that nothing \n     significant has happened to them--I have them make a list of \n     the defining moments in their lives. To find your plot, I \n     tell them, try to think of one event in your life that has \n     fundamentally changed the way you think and act.\n       This is mine: I am riding through the flat cornfields of \n     Northwest Ohio on my way to Bowling Green State University. I \n     am in my mom's rusting Mustang, which is packed to the roof \n     with stolen milk crates and cheap suitcases containing my \n     life's belongings: my clothes and books, my Neil Young album \n     collection and my beloved stuffed Ziggy. The year is 1986, \n     and I am 18 years old. I have never seen the beach, nor \n     written a check, nor spent the night any farther from home \n     than Mary Beth Buxton's house on the outskirts of town. As we \n     drive, there are thousands of station wagons packed with \n     thousands of suitcases; thousands of grinding stomachs \n     converging on universities across the country. As we drive, \n     I'm certain that I'm the only college freshman who fears \n     getting lost, not making any friends, failing courses, being \n     shipped back home. And I know I'm the only one arriving on \n     campus with a lucky buckeye from my Grandma Macy's tree in \n     the pocket of my brand-new too-blue jeans. Courage, as \n     defined by Emerson: having the guts to do the thing you've \n     never done before. The one time I drove off the city-pool \n     high dive, I land flat on my belly. They said you could hear \n     the smack at the tennis courts a quarter-mile away. Sure, I \n     tried something new, but I never climbed that ladder again. \n     In my mom's Mustang, my heart soars and plummets with every \n     mile crossed. I'm excited that I just might break into the \n     ranks of the Official Middle Class, but I fear being found \n     out as the impostor I believe I am. I consider asking my mom \n     to turn around and take me home, but for the life of me I \n     can't even talk. Courage, as defined by me: having the guts \n     to dive in over and over again, until the belly flop becomes \n     a perfect plunge. I climbed back up the high-dive ladder the \n     day I went to college. But I couldn't have done it without \n     the Pell grant, which paid my tuition. To cover room and \n     board, I worked two, sometimes three jobs at a time, and I \n     received several National Direct Student Loans.\n       This is why last year, on my first night of teaching--after \n     working as a journalist for 12 years and earning a master's \n     degree in creative writing at Hollins--the following people \n     inspired me: Sandy and Teree, sisters who both drive school \n     buses and dream of earning associate's business degrees so \n     they can help their truck-driver husbands start their own \n     company; Amy, a single mom who spoke of what it was like to \n     be diagnosed as having ADD (at age 30) and, with the help of \n     medicine, finally being able to THINK; Charles, who'd \n     recently moved to Virginia from a drug-treatment center in \n     Connecticut, ready to try life without drugs; Beth, mother of \n     four, who said she came to college because she doesn't want \n     her kids to grow up thinking she's stupid; And Randy, a \n     mechanic who came to class without first washing his \n     greasy hands. For our first in-class exercise, Randy wrote \n     about the best job he'd ever had, in construction. His \n     ideas were developed, his examples full of detail. But he \n     didn't have a single period or comma on the page. He said \n     he had no idea where to place a period. ``If I get me a \n     computer,'' he asked, ``won't that put in all the periods \n     for me?'' Randy wasn't exactly Hemingway by the semester's \n     end, but he did know how to punctuate a sentence. He came \n     to every class early, stayed late and never missed \n     dropping by during office hours to show me his work. He \n     improved more than any student I've ever taught, and I'm \n     told he's still in school--plugging away at ``The Great \n     Gatsby'' and ``Once More to the Lake'' after his eight-\n     hour shift fixing cars. He wants to buy his own business, \n     too, and I believe some day he will. He was one of several \n     who stayed late that first night to get me to sign his \n     Pell Grant form.\n       I know there are people who like to bash Pell grant \n     recipients. About 10 years ago, on our way to cover a \n     newspaper story, a photojournalist friend and I were riding \n     in a company car, when the subject of lost loves and old \n     boyfriends reared its ugly head. The daughter of a doctor, my \n     friend confided that she still pines over one ex-beau in \n     particular--but added that he was not worthy of her angst, on \n     account of, as she put it: ``He was a total loser. I mean, he \n     went to college on a Pell grant.'' Back then I was too \n     ashamed of my roots to confront that kind of elitism, so I \n     stewed and said nothing. But a few months ago at a teaching \n     conference I attended, a colleague made a similar comment. He \n     said that most of his Pell students are slackers; that they \n     take advantage of government hand-outs; that they don't have \n     what it takes to make it in a white-collar world. This time I \n     could not keep quiet. I told him that most of my Pell \n     students are even more driven than my middle- and upper-class \n     students, with a lot more riding on the success of their \n     papers than a letter grade or the refinement of their \n     creative-writing skills. Most of my Pell students are working \n     toward not only a degree and a decent job, but also a \n     fundamental shift in the direction of their lives. They want \n     to worry not about paying the bills, but about whether their \n     kids are more suited to playing soccer or the violin.

Mr. President, today I rise in recognition of \nWomen's History Month--a time to honor the many great women leaders \nfrom our past and present who have served our Nation so well. They have \nworked diligently to achieve social change and personal triumph usually \nagainst incredible odds. As scientists, writers, doctors, teachers, and \nmothers, they have shaped our world and guided us down the road to \nprosperity and peace. For far too long, however, their contributions to \nthe strength and character of our society went unrecognized and \nundervalued.\n  Women have led efforts to secure not only their own rights, but have \nalso been the guiding force behind many of the other major social \nmovements of our time--the abolitionist movement, the industrial labor \nmovement, and the civil rights movement, to name a few. We also have \nwomen to thank for the establishment of many of our early charitable, \nphilanthropic, and cultural institutions.\n  In Maryland, we are proud to honor the many women who have played \nsuch critical roles in the development of our State heritage. They \ninclude Margaret Brent, who, in 1648, became America's first woman \nlawyer and landholder, and Harriet Tubman, who saved thousands of lives \nduring the Civil War through the Underground railroad. Other great \nMaryland women include Henrietta Szold, the founder of Hadassah, the \nWomen's Zionist Organization\n\n[[Page S2609]]\n\nof America and Dr. Helen Taussig, who developed, in 1945, the first \nsuccessful medical procedure to save ``blue babies.''\n  Now more than ever, women are a guiding force in Maryland and a major \npresence in our business sector. As of 1996, there were over 167,000 \nwomen-owned businesses in our State--that amounts to 39 percent of all \nfirms in Maryland. Maryland's women-owned businesses employ over \n301,000 people and generate over $39 billion in sales. Between 1987 and \n1996, the number of women-owned firms in Maryland is estimated to have \nincreased by 88 percent.\n  During Women's History month we have the opportunity to remember and \npraise great women leaders who have opened doors for today's young \nwomen in ways that are often overlooked. Their legacy has enriched the \nlives of us all and deserves prominence in the annals of American \nhistory.\n  With this in mind, I have co-sponsored legislation again this \nCongress to establish a National Museum of Women's History Advisory \nCommittee. This Committee would be charged with identifying a site for \nthe National Museum of Women's History and developing strategies for \nraising private funding for the development and maintenance of the \nmuseum. Ultimately, the museum will enlighten the young and old about \nthe key roles women have played in our Nation's history and the many \ncontributions they have made to our culture.\n  However, we must do more than merely recognize the outstanding \naccomplishments women have made. Women's History Month also is a time \nto recognize that women still face substantial obstacles and inequities \nat every turn. Access to capital for female entrepreneurs is still a \nsignificant stumbling block, and women business owners of color are \neven less likely than white women entrepreneurs to have financial \nbacking from a bank. A female physician still only earns about 58 cents \nto her male counterpart's dollar, and female business executives earn \nabout 65 cents for every dollar paid to a male executive. At every age, \nwomen are more likely than their male contemporaries to be poor, and \nthe average personal income of men over 65 is nearly double that of \ntheir female peers. Tragically, the incidence of AIDS among black and \nHispanic women and teenage girls is far out of proportion to their \npercentage of the population.\n  On the other hand, we have made great strides toward ensuring a \nfairer place for women in our society. The college-educated proportion \nof women, although still smaller than the comparable proportion of men, \nhas been increasing rapidly. Black and white women's death rates from \nheart disease have dropped significantly since 1970. Women are now the \nmajority in some professional and managerial occupations that were \nlargely male until relatively recently.\n  Mr. President, as we begin a new millennium, it is my hope that our \nprogress in securing women's rights will accelerate. As we celebrate \nWomen's History Month, let us reaffirm our commitment to the women of \nthis Nation and to insuring full equality for all of our \ncitizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2609-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RECOGNIZING PHYLLIS MARCKWORTH OF THE PORT TOWNSEND SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the \noutstanding achievements of a local educator, Phyllis Marckworth, from \nPort Townsend in Washington State. Phyllis has been brought to my \nattention for her devoted efforts in singlehandedly taking charge of \nefforts to create an integrated system of technology throughout the \nPort Townsend School District. Indeed, Superintendent Gene Medina \ncredits Phyllis' enthusiastic efforts for literally transforming the \nfundamental nature of student learning in the district. It is \nindividuals like Ms. Marckworth that should remind all of us here in \nthe U.S. Senate of the indispensable role that the innovation of local \neducators play in our children's education.\n  Phyllis is the kind of rare and special educator which schools across \nthis country cherish. She serves as a teacher, a technology \nadministrator, and a staff developer. Thus, her contributions to the \nbetter education of students of Port Townsend are noteworthy for \nseveral reasons: first, her incredible zeal in tirelessly laboring on \nbehalf of the students she serves. In 1993, she was coordinating plans \nto purchase computers and telephones for the Port Townsend District. \nRather than follow the tradition path of initial hardware investment to \nsupply individual classrooms, Phyllis embarked on a bolder and \neventually more rewarding task of assembling an entire \ntelecommunications network for all the students in the district to \nutilize and learn from. That network has since become the backbone of \nthe improved communication and learning in Port Townsend that all \nschools hope technology will bring to our classrooms.\n  Secondly, her visionary innovation in implementing an integrated \nsystem of technology within the Port Townsend school district has \nresulted not just in a ``technology curriculum'' but technology that is \nfully integrated within the entire district's curriculum. This \nintegration has resulted in better education for students who now \nunderstand and utilize technology as a part of every aspect of their \nlives and learning, not just a computer that is used for typing term \npapers or biology lab reports.\n  Finally, this integration which Phyllis sparked has also corresponded \nwith a direct focus on developing the ability of staff throughout the \nPort Townsend district to make technology a part of their classrooms. \nHence, teachers can make technology a part of the whole education \nprocess rather than simply a small piece student learning. Too often \ntechnology is brought in to the classrooms of today without the \ntraining necessary for our teachers to best use that technology to \ntrain our students for tomorrow. Phyllis Marckworth has met that \nchallenge head on and has made her district and its students better \nbecause of the creative and dedicated way in which she has done so.\n  It is individuals like Phyllis Marchworth that make education across \nthis country and in our local schools great, not more rules and \nregulations from Washington, DC. As we in the Senate work on important \neducation legislation, I hope my colleagues will remember the \ninnovative work of educators like Phyllis Marchworth who show how local \ncommunities create education success stories when we give them the \nflexibility they need and deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2609-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2609-S2610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BRUMIDI IN NEW YORK\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to call the Senate's \nattention to works of an artist with whom we are all quite familiar. \nConstantino Brumidi is famous for having painted much of the fine \nmurals here in the Capitol. What is not as yet known, however, is that \nhis other major body of work, in fact the only other great body of work \nin the United States, is at the Our Lady of the Scapular & St. \nStephen's Church (St. Stephen's) in New York City. Located on 29th \nStreet and Third Avenue on Manhattan's East Side, St. Stephens is home \nto many Brumidi masterpieces, including a mural of the crucifixion \nwhich is believed to be the largest of its kind in the world. At one \ntime, St. Stephen's was home to the New York City Arch Diocese and the \nlargest Catholic Church in New York.\n  Unfortunately, many of the paintings and murals have fallen into \ndisrepair and are in need of restoration. The church has undertaken a \ncampaign to raise the funds necessary to complete this task. I am \nhopeful that some government funds may be available as well, perhaps \nthrough the Save America's Treasures program. Our own Barbara Wolanin \nfrom the Architect of the Capitol's office is familiar with St. \nStephen's and their efforts to preserve their collection of Brumidis. I \ninvite my colleagues to visit St. Stephen's the next time they are in \nNew York and see the other body of work by the artist we have all come \nto love.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an article written by members of St. \nStephen's about their Brumidi collection be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n   Constantino Brumidi--Artist of the Capitol--Classical Artist and \n                   Decorator of St. Stephen's Church\n\n       In a new publication, Constantino Brumidi: Artist of the \n     Capitol, Barbara Wolanin (curator for the architect of the \n     Capitol) and a host of other scholars present the first in\n\n[[Page S2610]]\n\n     depth biography of this important painter whose work at the \n     Capitol has recently been restored.\n       In addition to ``The Apotheosis of George Washington'' \n     which adorns the Capitol dome in the Rotunda, Brumidi painted \n     in the House of Representatives Chamber, the President's \n     Room, the Senate Reception Room, and throughout many of the \n     corridors of our nation's Capitol. The first floor Senate \n     corridors of the Capitol are known as the ``Brumidi \n     Corridors.''\n       Ms. Wolanin brings to our attention the fact that a large \n     body of Constantino Brumidi's work is in a Catholic church in \n     New York City. The Order of Carmelites, who serve the parish \n     of Our Lady of the Scapular & St. Stephen's Church in the \n     Rosehill District of Manhattan, have invested over a million \n     dollars of their own funds to restore the exterior of their \n     Romanesque Revival church built to the designs of the \n     architect James Renwick Jr. in 1854 (Mr. Renwick also \n     designed the Smithsonian Castle and the Renwick Gallery). \n     This initial investment has halted deterioration of the many \n     frescoes, murals and decorative elements by Brumidi on the \n     church's interior walls.\n       Brumidi's mural of the Crucifixion behind the main altar of \n     the church is believed to be the largest of its kind in the \n     world. Brumidi's frescoes of David, the Madonna and Child and \n     St. Cecilia on the south wall, once neglected and in danger \n     of irreversible damage, have been restored by Constance \n     Silver of Preservar in an effort to understand the \n     composition of the underlying wall and the materials and \n     techniques Brumidi used. The goal of the Carmelites is to \n     fully restore the baroque interior of the church, which may \n     be the only one of its kind in America.\n       Examples of ``trompe l'oeil,'' Brumidi's scheme of \n     architectural illusion which originally united all of the \n     artistic and architectural elements of the church, have been \n     exposed for study and may be seen on the partially restored \n     south wall.\n       From the mid 1850's through the early 1870's when not \n     working at the Capitol, Brumidi traveled to New York to work \n     at St. Stephen's. Today, the parish serves a small and \n     thriving community. In the 19th century, however, due to a \n     massive immigration of Irish fleeing the Great Famine, St. \n     Stephen's Church became, for a time, the largest and most \n     influential Catholic parish in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2610-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE NURSING HOME RESIDENTIAL SECURITY ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, one week ago today, the Finance \nCommittee unanimously voted to support legislation to protect from \neviction nursing home residents who rely on Medicaid. Our bill, S. 494, \nthe Nursing Home Residential Security Act of 1999, is supported by both \nthe nursing home industry and senior citizens' advocates.\n  Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 540, companion \nlegislation to our bill, by a vote of 392 to 12. I call on my \ncolleagues now to join me in voting in support of this important \nlegislation. Let us send it to the President and make it the first \npiece of health care legislation to become law this year.\n  Our legislation prohibits nursing homes that withdraw from \nparticipation in the Medicaid program from evicting the Medicaid \nresidents who are already in the facility. Essentially, we provide for \na phase-down rather than an immediate termination of participation in \nMedicaid.\n  Sixty-eight percent of all nursing home residents eventually end up \non Medicaid. Our bill protects these vulnerable senior citizens and \nindividuals with disabilities from finding themselves evicted. The bill \ngoes a long way toward assuring residents and their families that they \nwill continue to receive quality nursing home care without fear of \ninappropriate eviction.\n  S. 494/H.R. 540 is a modest but important proposal that will promote \nthe peace of mind of millions of Americans. I ask my colleagues for \ntheir support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2610-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IN MEMORY OF LOUISIANA STATE REPRESENTATIVE AVERY ALEXANDER\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, with the passing this week of \nLouisiana state Representative Avery Alexander, our nation and my state \nof Louisiana lost one of its most legendary and respected citizens. For \nmost of his 88 years, Reverend Alexander gave himself selflessly and \ncompletely to the service of others--as a dedicated and caring \nminister, as a fearless and principled civil rights leader and as a \ntireless and thoroughly honorable public servant.\n  To those who knew him, ``The Rev,'' as he was called, was a nothing \nshort of a living legend and the very embodiment of the courage, \npassion and vision that characterized the civil rights movement of the \n1950s and l960s. In a day and time when standing up for your rights as \nan American meant taking your life into your hands, Avery Alexander and \nhis allies took to the streets and helped transform our nation. Avery \nAlexander and his contemporaries in the civil rights movement helped \ngive our nation a new birth of freedom and for that we are internally \ngrateful.\n  Yet long after the great civil rights marches and protests of the \n1960s and well into his ninth decade of life, Reverend Alexander was \nstill as passionate and committed to the cause of human rights as he \nhad always been. It wasn't that long ago--three years to be exact--that \nthe people of Louisiana were treated to the familiar image of Avery \nAlexander on a ticket line in Baton Rouge, protesting changes to the \nstate's affirmative action laws that he believed were unfair and \nunwise. When Avery Alexander believed in something, especially civil \nrights, he gave it his all. And he knew better than most that the civil \nrights laws of the 1960s were only a beginning, not an end, of a great \nnational journey for every citizen, black, white, Hispanic or Asian.\n  Whatever one might have thought about him, and however one might have \ndisagreed with him, I know of no one who would have ever thought of \nquestioning Avery Alexander's motives. He was a supremely principled \nman, led by conscience and an innate sense of mission and morality to \nserve always as a voice for those who had lost or had never been given \nthe right to speak for themselves. If you were down and out, forgotten, \ndiscriminated against, despised or rejected by society, then Avery \nAlexander was your friend. I have known few people who lived up to the \nBiblical admonition to love unconditionally as well as he did. Avery \nAlexander will be missed. But he will also be long remembered for the \nways he taught and inspired us to love, to care, to serve and, most of \nall, to look beyond skin color and gender and age and creed and to see \nthat which is best, noble and God-given in each of us.\n  We will all miss the ``Rev!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2610-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING WTOP FOR 30 YEARS OF OUTSTANDING SERVICE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \n30th Anniversary of one of the area's finest news stations, WTOP, a \nstation that has been a trustworthy and informative source of regional \nand national news since 1969.\n  In our increasingly inter-connected society where technology has \nincreased the speed at which information is collected, disseminated and \nanalyzed, the importance of responsible journalism has become even more \nimportant. WTOP has maintained a reputation as an accurate news source \nby its reporting of events from Watergate to the recent impeachment \ntrial; from Vietnam to conflicts in the Persian Gulf; from issues \nregarding the District of Columbia to the politics of my home State of \nMaryland. In addition to news accounts on these issues, WTOP always has \nweather, traffic and sports reports to complete its effective coverage. \nMuch as CNN is the leader in television news coverage, WTOP leads the \nway in providing up-to-date radio news 24 hours a day.\n  I would also like to commend the service of one individual in \nparticular, WTOP's Congressional correspondent Dave McConnell, who has \nbeen with the station for almost 20 years. I have worked first-hand \nwith Dave over the years and have the utmost respect for his \njournalistic integrity and his dedication to reporting the news in a \nprecise yet understandable way. Indeed, his ``Today on the Hill'' \nbroadcasts have provided listeners with the most up-to-date information \non legislative activities on Capitol Hill by talking directly with \nmembers of Congress about the issues.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to have this opportunity to recognize the \nprofessionalism of this station and its employees on this auspicious \nanniversary, and to extend my best wishes to WTOP for the next 30 years \nand beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2610-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2610-S2611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT L.

He was 69.\n  Robert Ozuna was the oldest of four children born in Miami, Arizona \nto Mexican-American parents. In 1940, after his father's death, Robert \nmoved with his mother, brother and sisters to East Los Angeles, where \nhe worked steadily from an early age in order to help support the \nfamily.\n  As Founder and President of New Bedford Panoramex Corporation (NBP), \nRobert Ozuna became one of the most successful Mexican-American \nentrepreneurs in southern California. He gained his business experience \non the job and his engineering education by attending night school in \nthe California community and junior college system.\n  In 1966, Ozuna began to build his company with a second mortgage on \nhis home, and a few electrician's hand tools, hard work and \nentrepreneurial instincts into the thriving electronics manufacturing \nbusiness it is today in Upland, California. NBP designs, develops and \nmanufactures electronic communication systems and remote monitoring \nsystems for its primary client, the United States Government.\n  Robert Ozuna's hard work and dedication were given public recognition \nwhen he received the Department of Transportation Minority Business \nEnterprise Award for 1987 and again for 1991. He received the Air \nTraffic Control Association Chairman's Citation of Merit Award in 1994. \nHe was an active member of The California Chamber of Commerce for \nvarious cities and a founder of Casa De Rosa Annual Golf Tournament, \nwhich he started to raise funds for the Rancho de Los Ninos Orphanage \nin BajaMar, Mexico.\n  As industrious as Robert Ozuna was in business, he was equally \ninvolved sharing his prosperity with many philanthropic activities in \nhis community. He sponsored many events in the Hispanic neighborhood \nwhere he grew up, and he was a founding director of the East Los \nAngeles Sheriff's Youth Athletic Association, which promotes \neducational, athletic and drug awareness programs for more than 60,000 \nyouths in the Los Angeles Metropolitan area.\n  Robert Ozuna is remembered by his employees at New Bedford Panoramex \nCorporation as a man with a deep passion for life. His concern for his \nemployees and their families along with his abundant generosity to them \nwas always present.\n  Robert Ozuna was married for 35 years to Rosemary, who passed away in \nNovember of 1998. He is survived by his mother Amella Ozuna, his sons \nSteven Ozuna and Jeff Dominelli, his daughters Nancy DeSilva and Lisa \nJarrett, his sisters Lillian Gomez and Vera Venagas, and his brother \nTony Ozuna. He also leaves six grandchildren.\n  Robert Ozuna epitomized the American dream, which promises to anyone \nwho works hard and plays by the rules the opportunity to achieve great \nsuccess. Robert Ozuna lived that dream. Though he will be greatly \nmissed, his life and achievements will serve as an inspiration to \ngenerations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/11/senate-section/article/S2611-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2611]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 15, 1999\n\n  Mr. GORTON.
