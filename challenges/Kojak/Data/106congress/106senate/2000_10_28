Mr. President, the session is winding down. We are at a \npoint where we are doing pro forma things.\n  I have neglected to do something I think is important to do and that \nI have wanted to do. I will take the time available to us at the moment \nto fulfill my obligation.\n  I wish to pay appropriate tribute to the senior Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Moynihan, on the occasion of his retirement. I have already \ndone this within the committee on which we jointly sit, but I think at \na more formal setting it is also appropriate.\n  I first met Pat Moynihan when I was serving in the Nixon \nadministration. He was then a member of the White House staff. I was \nserving in the Department of Transportation. He was the President's \nprimary enforcer, if you will, of improvements and efficiencies in the \nexecutive branch, particularly in domestic departments. We at the \nDepartment of Transportation were a little bit in awe, if not in \nterror, of the thought of Pat Moynihan showing up and checking on us to \nmake sure we were doing things right.\n  I remember one meeting in the White House where we were outlining \nwhat we wanted to do, that which I considered to be fairly bold, and \nlistening to Moynihan saying: Well, in a Republican administration, \nthis is probably about the best you could expect. He wanted us to be \nconsiderably bolder than we were. He wanted to go into directions of \nnew initiatives that would have been very good for the country.\n  In addition to this, he was one of the architects of Nixon's program \nof family maintenance which, had it been enacted over the objections of \nthe Democrats, probably would have solved many of our welfare problems.\n  Mr. Moynihan was well respected then. President Nixon later used him \nas Ambassador to the United Nations and Ambassador to India. When he \nwas running for a seat in the Senate, even though he was a Democrat, I, \nfor one, was rooting for him to win.\n  I have just finished reading a book called ``The Trust,'' which is \nthe history of New York City. I was interested to find that the \neditorial board of the New York Times almost unanimously decided that \nin that primary they were going to endorse Bella Abzug for the Senate \nseat in New York. Fortunately, the publisher of the New York Times, \nPunch Sulzberger, came to his senses long enough to dictate a New York \nTimes endorsement of Pat Moynihan, and this body was spared the \nexperience of having Mrs. Abzug as the Senator from New York.\n  Senator Moynihan and I have disagreed about a number of issues since \nwe have been here. We have debated on many issues and clashed many \ntimes, but we have served together in many areas. He was a member of \nthe Senate Y2K committee, a committed, active member who scheduled \nhearings in his home State of New York. We went there often. I was \nalways impressed and uplifted by the amount of bipartisan support he \ngave to that effort. He was always well informed and completely without \nguile or without bitterness.\n  He now goes on to a career he loves, which is teaching. I have read \nsome of his books and wish I could be one of his students.\n  This country will hang on to Pat Moynihan as a major resource and a \nnational treasure for the remainder of his life. But we in the Senate \nhave been well served by having him here as our colleague.\n  One last thing I will say about Pat Moynihan, which is little known \nbut which demonstrates the man, there is a story going around in \nWashington that says when John F. Kennedy went down Pennsylvania Avenue \nin his inaugural parade, he saw how shabby the avenue was, and with \nthat vision often attributed to the Kennedy clan, he said we must do \nsomething to clean up Pennsylvania Avenue, and the restoration of \nPennsylvania Avenue then occurred. Well, in fact, from the scholarly \nwritings of Pat Moynihan, we find that it was not John F. Kennedy at \nall; it was Arthur Goldberg, who was in that parade and saw that \nshabbiness of Pennsylvania Avenue, who pointed it out to President \nKennedy and, to his credit, the President said, ``Yes, let's do \nsomething about it.'' But he probably gave it no more thought than \nthat.\n  The assignment of seeing that something was done to the Nation's most \nmonumental avenue ultimately fell to a young staffer named Pat \nMoynihan. It was he who drove the effort to see to it that Pennsylvania \nAvenue was cleaned up from the pawnshops and the other shabby \narchitectural edifices that were there to the monumental avenue that it \nis today. Interestingly enough, it was while he was chairman of the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee, leaning on the public \nworks side of that environment, where he led the effort within the \nCongress to see to it that the necessary money was appropriated to \nbuild the monumental buildings of which we are all so proud.\n  So we have a lasting architectural legacy to the public career of Pat \nMoynihan right here in the District of Columbia. I, for one, shall miss \nhim. But I look forward to staying in touch with him as he tells me \nthat he is going to stay in the Washington area and teach. I hope that \nat some point, when my career in the Senate ends, he is still teaching \nand I can take one of his classes. It has been a great privilege to\n\n[[Page S11297]]\n\nserve in the Senate with the senior Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/28/senate-section/article/S11297-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11297-S11298]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE WORK OF CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe pending status of the work of the Congress. Yesterday, Senator \nStevens took the floor and outlined the work of the Appropriations \nCommittee, making it plain that nothing could be done on the last bill \non appropriations for Labor, Health, Human Services, and Education, \nuntil Tuesday because there had to be a reading of the bill and the \nother procedural matters which had to be attended to, even if the \nconferees came to agreement on Friday.\n  Senator Stevens suggested that there was no point in having the \nSenate and the House in session on Saturday and Sunday and Monday. \nNotwithstanding that, and notwithstanding Senator Stevens' contacts \nwith the President and the President's men, we are here. We are here \nfor absolutely no reason. I chair the subcommittee which has \njurisdiction over that appropriations bill and we have been in \nnegotiations with the White House for weeks. We have not been able to \ncome to an agreement because of the intransigence of the White House. \nThey may say it is the intransigence of the Congress. We have a way of \nsaying the other party is intransigent. But there is no doubt that they \nare at least 50 percent responsible for the fact that we have not been \nable to come to terms on this bill.\n  On this bill, the subcommittee that I chair met the President's \nfigure of $106 billion. It was hard to do. My colleagues in this body \nand the Republicans in the House didn't like that figure; they thought \nit was too much money. But the chairman of the House committee and I \nprevailed to meet the President's figure so we can come to terms and \nhave an accommodation and get the bill passed. We put $600 million in \nthat bill--more for education than the President did. And the President \nasked for $2.7 billion for school construction and teachers. It was the \nview of many colleagues that that was not a Federal responsibility, but \nwe gave this figure. We put an addendum on that if the local school \nboards decided they wanted it for something else, they could use it for \nsomething else, so that there would be local control, which is the \nessence of education in America, contrasted with the Washington, DC, \nbureaucratic straitjacket.\n  Notwithstanding that, the White House, his negotiators, wanted every \nsemicolon their own way. So that bill is still languishing in \nnegotiations. But it is certainly not the fault of the Congress.\n  We are here today and we will be here tomorrow. The Members --535 of \nus--had thought we would have concluded our business a long time ago. I \ncan tell the American people--if anybody watches C-SPAN II--that the \nfault is not that of the Congress that we are still here. The President \nhas decided that we will be in session on 1-day continuing resolutions, \nas his way of trying to make a political point. He is not making a \ngovernmental point, he is making a political point. He is making a \npolitical point to try to blame the Congress as a ``do-nothing'' \nCongress, when that is not the fact. He is trying to blame the Congress \nfor a situation the White House is really responsible for--at least 50 \npercent responsible.\n  We have come to a situation where the quality and parity between the \nCongress and the executive branch has long since evaporated. When the \nGovernment was closed down at the end of 1995, that was an enormous \nshift of power, so that now the Congress is really over a barrel to \nyield to whatever the President has to say.\n  Being aware of that, we structured this final bill on Labor, Health, \nHuman Services, and Education to finish it so that it could be \npresented to the President in September. The Senate acted on it on June \n30, which established a record, going back to 1976 for the earlier set \nof action on this bill. Then we finished the conference report on July \n27. It should have been presented to the President in September, and \nthat projection was made so that we would be able to present it to the \nPresident and, if he vetoed it, have a national debate; and we thought \nwe would be in a position to make our priorities stand up because the \nConstitution does give the Congress the responsibility and authority to \nestablish the priorities.\n\n  Mr. President, the essential point that I am coming to is that if we \nwere not over a barrel in our relations with the President, we would \nsubmit to the President a continuing resolution for 3 or 4 days. But we \nare not doing that because it would be unseemly. We are not doing that \nbecause we don't want to engage in what might be viewed by the American \npeople as a childish food fight.\n  If we sent him a continuing resolution for 4 days, which would be \nreasonable under the circumstances, since we can't get anything done \nuntil Tuesday, and there was a stalemate and there was a closing of the \nFederal Government, the American people would say a plague on both of \nyour houses. But the reality is that the Congress is being intimidated \nby the President and we are, in fact, being humiliated by what the \nPresident is doing. There needs to be some semblance of good will and \ncomity between the Congress and the President. It doesn't exist and \nhasn't existed.\n  This Senator has gone out of his way to try to work with the White \nHouse and try to find accommodations. But when you have this \nintimidation and what is really humiliation, it lingers. It has to be a \nfactor considered, as we have so many delicate relationships with the \nexecutive branch of the Government. Frankly, I would like to see us \nsubmit a continuing resolution for 4 days and lay down the gauntlet to \nthe President, if he wants to keep us around here doing nothing. But \nthe parity between the branches has been lost and we are here wasting \nthe time of 535 Members of Congress.\n  We are wasting the time of the Congressmen, and we are also putting \nthe people of America to a disadvantage because we have \nresponsibilities to our constituents that will not be attended to \ntoday, or tomorrow, or Monday, or thereafter. I think it is high time \nthat the Congress stood up and confronted the President because of this \nsituation, which is simply intolerable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I certainly understand the \nfrustration of the Senator from Pennsylvania. He does a good job of \nchairing that subcommittee. But his facts are wrong.\n  Here it is 9 days until the election, and we are still in session. We \nare here because the leadership of the majority has simply refused to \nmove this Congress along like it is supposed to. Since the first of \nSeptember, we have passed only three or four appropriations bills. We \nstruggled through the month of September, and nothing happened.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator from Nevada yield?\n  Mr. REID. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. SPECTER. What facts are wrong?\n  Mr. REID. I was just laying those facts out.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Does the Senator from Nevada deny the fact that the \nPresident and the White House, or at least the people in question, are \nresponsible for the failure to come to agreement on the one outstanding \nappropriations bill?\n  Mr. REID. We have 13 appropriations bills. This debate cannot relate \naround one appropriations bill. The Senator from Pennsylvania worked \nhard on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. A number of us have worked \non it. But the Republicans have left this bill to the last bill so they \ncan attach everything to it that has not been done and that should have \nbeen done previously.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. No. I will not.\n  I say to the Chair and to those Members listening that the President \ndoesn't need to take any blame for what is taking place here in \nCongress. We have a constitutional framework that gives him separate \nbut equal power with the Congress. He is exerting that now. Thank \ngoodness he is able to exert that because what has gone on here, \naccording to pundits and according to what I believe having been here \nfor almost 20 years, is a travesty.\n  Here we are trying to work our way through Congress 8 days before an \nelection. This should have been completed a long time ago. We have not \nbeen able to have debates on issues in this Congress. Why? Because the \nmajority has\n\n[[Page S11298]]\n\ntaken the position they don't want to have to take any difficult votes. \nAs a result of that, we don't take any votes. We don't have debates.\n  It is interesting to note that we haven't done anything on a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We have done nothing on prescription drugs. \nOn education, for the past 2 years in this Congress, we only have spent \nparts of 6 days dealing with education. The American people say it is \nthe most important issue facing the American people. Members of \nCongress say it is the most important issue. It seems to me that we \ncould spend more than 6 partial days talking about education.\n  We need help with school construction. In Las Vegas, we have the \nsixth largest school district in America. We have to build one new \nschool every month to keep up with growth.\n  In the small State of Nevada, last year we spent $112 million just on \ninterest on the money we borrowed to build schools. We need help with \nschool construction and modernization. Schools all over America need \nhelp. The average age of schools in America is over 40 years. We also \nneed to reduce class size. Unfortunately, we haven't had a meaningful \ndebate that has allowed us to discuss how important and successful \nclass size reduction is for our schools.\n  A year and a half ago, following the Columbine massacre, we passed \nwhat we felt was minimal gun safety legislation. Nothing has happened \nsince then to move that forward. We have not had a conference. The \nresult is that we still have pawnshop loopholes where just anyone can \ngo in and buy guns. They can be felons. The same happens not only in \npawnshops but at gun shows. We need that legislation cleared for \nfurther action. We have been unable to do that.\n\n  I say to my friend from Pennsylvania that, again, I appreciate his \nfrustration. I appreciate his hard work.\n  But the fact is that constitutionally the President has a role, and \nhe is fulfilling that role. I repeat that I am glad he is fulfilling \nthat role.\n  We have so many things that we need to do in this Congress that we \nhave simply been unable to do.\n  As a result of our friend, Paul Coverdell, having unexpectedly passed \naway, the composition of the Senate changed. As such, we felt there \nshould be another vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We were denied \nthat.\n  There are so many things that have been taking place here that has \nprevented the Senate from operating as the Senate.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania is frustrated as a result of his dealings \nwith the subcommittee.\n  I am frustrated as a Member of the Senate that we are not able to \ntalk about issues that I think are important. We have been prevented \nfrom being able to talk about those issues.\n  In America today there are 3,000 children dropping out of school \nevery day. Shouldn't we be allowed to talk about that? The answer has \nbeen no. We haven't been able to have a meaningful debate about the \nserious problem of children dropping out of school.\n  The fact is the President is concerned about this $250 billion tax \nbill. The minority has been shut out of all negotiations. The ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee has not been involved in anything, let \nalone any other members of the Finance Committee.\n  We have conferences that are uniquely held with only one party.\n  There is a lot of frustration to go around.\n  I want to reassert and reemphasize that the President is doing the \nright thing. I believe he is doing the right thing, which is supported \ntotally by the minority. He is doing the right thing by having us work \nevery day.\n  What good does it do? We should have been having 24-hour continuing \nresolutions 2 weeks ago. If so, we would have already completed our \nwork 2 weeks ago. So, we are doing 24-hour continuing resolutions right \nnow. If, in fact, we had a 4-day continuing resolution, people would \nfly out of here and back to their parades and campaigning and leave the \nwork that needs to be done here in Congress undone.\n  I am supportive of what the President is doing.

Mr. President, if I may have the attention of the \nSenator from Nevada, I listened very carefully to what the Senator from \nNevada said and was looking for something which the Senator from Nevada \nsaid that factually disputed my representation of what has happened \nhere. I did not hear anything disputed about what I have said.\n  The facts are, No. 1, that there is one bill outstanding to finish \nthe work of the Senate; that is the appropriations bill on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education.\n  All of the other complaints which the Senator from Nevada made--the \nlitany that has been repeated day after day after day about what is \nwrong with the Republican Senate--is all prologue.\n  We are standing here today on a Saturday session--we are going to \nhave a Sunday session and we are going to have a Monday session--and \nnothing is going to be done because the President wants to gain \npolitical advantage.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No.\n  He wants to gain political advantage by trying to make a \nrepresentation that it is a do-nothing Congress.\n  I will tell you what he is in effect doing. He is creating a do-\nnothing Congress on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday because we can't do \nanything in Washington.\n  But there is a lot we could do in our States where we have a lot of \nmeetings and a lot of constituent business and a lot of legislative \nbusiness.\n  But it is going to be a do-nothing Congress today, tomorrow, and \nMonday because right now the appropriations bill on Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education has to be read, has to be printed, and \nhas to be completed. So we are not doing anything.\n  When the Senator from Nevada says that we ought to be working every \nday, I replied to the Senator from Nevada that he works every day. I \nhave seen him work. He works every day. I would say to the Senator from \nNevada and the other 98 Senators that I, too, work every day. So do the \nother 98 Senators.\n  But we don't work at the direction of the President. We don't work \nfor the President. We work for the American people. I work for 12 \nmillion Pennsylvanians. I don't work for the President.\n\n[[Page S11299]]\n\n  The Constitution has separation of powers. When the Founding Fathers \norganized the Constitution, they put Congress in article I. They didn't \nget around to the executive branch until article II. But today the \nsystem is inverted.\n  Since the Government was closed down in 1995 and our business has \ngone over into October and sometimes into November, there is no way for \nthe Congress to do anything--at least we think so--but to yield to the \nPresident. That is why, as I have said earlier, we structured this bill \non Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education so it could be \nfinished and be presented to the President in September.\n  The mistake we made, quite candidly, was that we were negotiating \nwith the President. We have undertaken in recent years \nnonconstitutional proceedings. The Constitution says that Congress will \npresent a bill to the President after the Congress decides what the \nlegislation should be, and then the President either signs it or vetoes \nit. But that has been turned around.\n  Now we have members of the President's executive branch sitting in \nour legislative conferences. We ought not have that. We ought to \npresent our bill and let the President sign it or veto it. This Senator \ntried mightily to get that bill presented to the President in \nSeptember. Then if the President wanted to veto it, so be it, that is \nhis constitutional prerogative. But he doesn't have a constitutional \nprerogative to sit in on the legislative process and the Congress \naccede to it. We ought to change that.\n  I think if the American people had seen this bill, they would have \npreferred the congressional priorities to the President's priorities. \nThe Congress gave the President 90 percent of what he wanted--more than \n90 percent. We have a bill which is $40.2 billion for education. The \nPresident's staff objected to $3.3 million, less than 10 percent of \n$40.2 billion. But we had some other priorities we wanted. We wanted \nspecial education. We also wanted money for the National Institutes of \nHealth, where they have made enormous strides in conquering Parkinson's \ndisease, Alzheimer's disease, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, heart \nailments, and a whole range of medical problems.\n  We had different priorities. I think if we had presented those \npriorities to the American people, the American people would have sided \nwith the Congress. So September went by the board. There were \nnegotiations in September. And I make the representation that it was \nthe intransigence of the White House which resulted in those \nnegotiations not moving forward. I make that representation because our \npriorities were as good as theirs or better.\n  But having given the President 90 percent, he should have been \nwilling to accommodate to the 10-percent change in our priorities \nwithout demanding to control every semicolon in the bill. I think we \nmet him more than halfway when we gave him $2.7 billion for school \nconstruction and for teachers, but we said this ought to be local \ncontrol if the local district needed something more.\n  I was interested to hear what the Senator from Nevada had to say \nabout the Las Vegas school system, its expanded school system and its \nneed for schools. I can understand the need in Las Vegas for schools. \nHowever, I have a hard time understanding why Las Vegas schools ought \nto be paid for from Washington by the American taxpayers.\n  If there is one area in the country which has a tax base to support \ntheir local needs, it is Las Vegas. Las Vegas is the gambling capital \nof the world, and I say that with respect. I have been there. I haven't \ngambled, but I have been there. They have an enormous tax base. If we \nare putting up $1.4 billion for school construction in the big bond \nissue for American cities such as Las Vegas where they can afford it \nthemselves, I have grave questions as to whether we ought to be doing \nthat. But we did it.\n  We presented it for the President. The President's men wouldn't come \nto a compromise. So what has happened is all the bills are finished \nexcept one bill. That bill can't be acted upon until Tuesday at the \nearliest. And the President is keeping us here to make a political \npoint.\n  My preference would be, as Senator Stevens said yesterday on the \nfloor, he was considering amending the continuing resolution to provide \nfor a 4-day continuing resolution which would carry us to Tuesday just \nto send to the President; then let the President sign it or veto it.\n  The difficulty with that is that the Government of the United States, \nthe executive and legislative branches, are not exactly held in high \nesteem by the American people. And my instinct is that if we got into \nthat sort of a situation, a game of chicken, a game which resembles a \nchildish food fight, the people of America would say a plague on both \nof your Houses. It reminds me just a little bit of the confrontation \nthat Piazza had with the Yankee pitcher. Piazza decided not to confront \nthe Yankee pitcher after he threw a bat at Piazza. I think Piazza did \nthe right thing, although people criticized him for not confronting the \nYankee pitcher.\n  We are in a situation where the President is keeping us here so he \ncan make a political point to try to have a democratically controlled \nSenate and a democratically controlled House and win the Presidency. We \nare not here doing the business of the people. We would be doing the \nbusiness of the people if we attended our regular schedules and were \nfree to do constructive work instead of sit around here on Saturday, \nSunday, and Monday.\n  I do believe, Mr. President--speaking to the President of the Senate, \nSenator Bennett, who is presiding--we have been intimidated. The \nPresident is doing this as a form of punishment, a form of humiliation. \nWe have a lot of very delicate relationships with the executive branch. \nIt has to linger in the background among some minds as to just what the \nexecutive branch is doing, whether they are operating in good faith.\n  I say bluntly, keeping the Congress in session without any purpose is \nthe worst of bad faith. We will do our job notwithstanding the \nexecutive branch and the President's men and women exercising the worst \nof bad faith, but we won't forget about it.\n  I yield the floor, and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett).

Mr. President, first of all, the President, I repeat, is \ndoing the right thing. The right thing is having Congress do its work. \nThis is all a game.\n  Now if we could complete our work by Tuesday, it seems to me if \npeople hung around here and did their work now--they said they have to \nstart reading the bill--let them read it now. I also say if people want \nto expedite matters and challenge the President's authority, I am \nstanding right where I am today and yesterday. I said we will agree on \na voice vote to the tax bill and send it to the White House this \nafternoon. Nope, objections from the other side. They wouldn't let us \ndo that. They wouldn't let us do that. They are here stalling for \nreasons that some of us are having a little trouble determining, but \nthey are stalling. They have continued to stall. That is why we \nwouldn't get any appropriations bills passed until very recently.\n  My friend from Pennsylvania said there is no factual variance. I was \ngoing to run through some of those, but the analogy is something like \nthis. He says we gave the President 90 percent of what he wanted. \nWhether that is right or not, the point is, it is like a football game. \nYou go to the 10-yard line and you almost make a touchdown; does that \nmean you should get the score? The answer is no. The score should not \nbe given to the majority because they have not done their work. They \nhaven't even gotten to the 10-yard line.\n  I say Members should be here working. The President is saying we \nshould work. We don't need to go home. Some of us have a long way to go \nto go home. We should be here doing our work. I think the American \npeople understand that the President is equal to the Congress.\n  I don't know why the framers of this Constitution had article I the \nlegislative branch, article II the executive branch, article III the \njudicial branch. They could have been reversed. It doesn't matter. They \nare separate but equal.\n\n[[Page S11300]]\n\n  I am so thankful that the President recognizes his ability to take a \nlook at what is going on here and say, ``I don't like it.'' That is \nwhat he said. He doesn't like it and 46 of us over here, we don't like \nit either.\n  Because of that, we are in the position we are now in. No one is \nbeing humiliated. The word was used twice by the Senator from \nPennsylvania. But, no one is being humiliated. The Constitution has \nbeen in effect for over 200 years. The President has an absolute right \nto do what he has done. If, in fact, the majority does not think the \nPresident will veto these bills, send them down and we will find out.\n  The problem is really that the bills are unfair. We have had very \nlittle input. We will let the American people decide who is right, \nwhether President Clinton is right in doing what he is doing or the \nRepublicans are right, doing what they are doing. I think the American \npeople will resoundingly proclaim that what has gone on over here has \nbeen not only procedurally unfair, it has been substantively unfair.\n  I also say, using Nevada as a State that doesn't need help--no one is \nasking that local control of schools be taken away. This is something \nthe majority always uses. Only about 7 percent of what any school \ndistrict in America gets comes from Washington. There is not a person \non the Democratic side who says they want to take control away from \nlocal schools. We are saying that schools need some help in helping pay \nthe interest on the bonds. The illustration I used was that the State \nof Nevada spends $112 million in interest without paying a single penny \non the principal. We are a small State, 2 million people. His State is \n12 million people. We believe the people of America realize the school \nproblems we have, the education problems in America are national in \nscope and Congress has to take a look at some of the national problems. \nSchools are crumbling, classes are too large, too many kids are \ndropping out of school. The solution the majority has is to take \ncontrol away from public schools and put all the money in private \nschools; do what you can to damage and destroy public schools. We are \nnot willing to do that. We believe that because the vast majority, in \nfact almost 95 percent, of kids go to public schools, we should do what \nwe can to improve public schools.\n  Again, I think the Senator from Pennsylvania does an excellent job as \nchairman of that subcommittee. I understand his frustration. A lot of \nthe control has been taken away from the subcommittee chairs and \nranking members in these last days of Congress. The majority leadership \nis calling a lot of the shots. That is what we read about. The \nDemocrats can only read about it because we are not in many of these \nnegotiations. But the Senator's frustration does not take away from the \nfact that the President of the United States has done the right thing \nin saying Congress should be working this weekend, every day, until \nCongress completes it work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to begin by commending the \nSenator from Nevada for his remarks, and to say that I agree with him \nand urge the President to veto the upcoming tax package. As written, \nthe tax bill allocates tax breaks and tax benefits to many different \ninterests and entities throughout America. While there are some good \nprovisions in this bill, it could be more fair, more just and could \ngive greater tax relief to those who need it the most. As it stands \nknow, the package fails to demonstrate our commitment to many of the \nprinciples that we claim to stand for here on this floor.\n  That is why I have come to this floor a number of times over the last \ncouple of days, to just raise awareness about one small, but I think \nvery important, part of the tax bill. I am happy to note that yesterday \nour majority leader, the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, and one of \nthe leaders on this issue, our colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, \ncame to the floor and recognized that there had been, perhaps, a \nmistake made or a phrase not included, that if left out, could have \nsome dire consequences for some of the children in this Nation--quite a \nlarge group, I might add, about 100,000 of them and potentially several \nhundred thousand more--who are really the most vulnerable among us.\n\n  These are children who no longer have parents. They are the orphans \nof living, if you will. They are the children who are in foster care. \nThese are the children who have already been abandoned once by an adult \nwho was supposed to be taking care of them.\n  I say to the Members on this floor--I see my good friend, Senator \nGrassley, who has been an outspoken advocate on this issue--that we \nhave the opportunity because when this bill is presented to the \nPresident, he has said he will veto it because it is not distributing \nthese benefits as equally across the board as they should be. I am \nhoping we can come to a bipartisan agreement, with Republicans and \nDemocrats and the President himself, to fix what is missing in this tax \ncredit.\n  Let me explain a little bit about that. In 1996, there was for the \nfirst time a credit put in our Tax Code to advance adoption. I am the \nproud mother of two adopted children. They have brought my husband and \nme the greatest joy. In fact, when he was 5 years old my husband was \nadopted from an orphanage in Ireland. We talk publicly about the great \njoy of adoption. We want people to know it is a wonderful way to build \na family.\n  There are Members in this Senate, Republicans and Democrats, who have \nadopted children and who speak regularly about the choice of building \nfamilies through adoption. The benefits to a birth mother, the benefits \nto the adoptive family, and most certainly the benefits to children, \nyoung and old. Some people think you don't need a family when you are \n18, you just sort of age out of the system and with a good education \nand diploma in your hand you can go on.\n  I am 45. I am looking forward to going home to Thanksgiving dinner \nwith my mother and father. My husband is 50. He is looking forward to \ngoing home for Christmas with his family. You are never too old to need \na mother and father, and that is what this is about, changing attitudes \nin America to say every child deserves a family.\n  We have a provision in this bill that is a good provision in that it \nproposes to increase and extend this very important adoption tax \ncredit. It is now $5,000. In this bill, it would be doubled from $5,000 \nto $10,000 for adoptions because, as we all know, the expense \nassociated with adoption can be high. There are legal expenses. There \nare expenses associated with home study, agency fees. In fact, those \nexpenses can range anywhere from a low of $2,000 to a high of $30,000, \ndepending on what agencies you use or whether you are going through a \ndomestic or an international adoption.\n  So far all is good because we have a tax credit in place and we are \nabout ready to double it. It could not be at a better time because the \nnumber of adoptions are up in America. Last year we had 130,000 \nadoptions, 130,000 families. That is a lot of people affected, if you \nthink about happy grandmothers and grandfathers and aunts and uncles \nand siblings. It is quite a number of happy Americans whose lives were \nmade better through adoption.\n  But there is a problem. I have tried to keep raising this issue until \nit is fixed. In the current bill, although the special needs adoption \nis being doubled to $12,000, this Treasury report which was issued this \nmonth and other letters and reports that have been written over the \nlast several years, have indicated that the credit is not working for \nthe special needs children. Because of the language in the law, not--\nlet me underline ``not'' because of a wrong interpretation by IRS--but \nbecause of our inability to write the proper phrase in the law--either \nour inability or our unwillingness--the tax credit is related to \nadoption-related expenses. We need to remove that phrase so the act of \nadoption itself of special needs children can get the credit.\n  I wish to show you pictures of a couple of the children who are going \nto be left out if we do not make this fix. There are 100,000 children \nin foster care. Jennifer is one of them. Because Jennifer has been in \nfoster care for some time, her adoption will not be handled by a \nprivate agency. Her adoption, if a family would come forward to\n\n[[Page S11301]]\n\nadopt her--and as you can see she is a beautiful and lovely child--if \nsomeone would come forward to adopt Jennifer, they would probably go \nthrough a public agency.\n  There would be minimum home study expenses. The agency might actually \npay for those.\n  There would really be no ``qualified adoption expenses'' because the \npublic agency, wanting to have Jennifer adopted, would minimize the \nexpenses to the adopting family. So this adoption could potentially go \nthrough with less than $1,000 of direct expenses to the family. \nTherefore, if a family adopted Jennifer, the expenses they had would \nnot qualify for a $5,000 tax credit or for a $10,000 tax credit because \nthey do not fit into the bill's definition. Yet adopting a child such \nas Jennifer can bring much added expense to a family, particularly a \nworking family, a middle-class family, perhaps having children already \nof their own but thinking God would like them to make room in their \nhomes for another child.\n  It is a tremendous financial responsibility, as all of us with \nchildren know, to raise a child. Much less, a child with special needs. \nA family who adopts a child with special needs does have additional \nexpenses, they just are not covered under the very narrow definition of \nthe code. Unless we change the law, they will not be able to get the \ntax credit. That is not what we intended.\n  They say Jennifer is very sweet and has a great sense of humor. She \nlikes to play outside, ride bikes, and swim. She is a very active \nchild. She has some emotional disorders. Anyone would have emotional \ndisorders if they were abandoned as a baby, abused, and grossly \nneglected. These children need healing, and we need to do everything we \ncan to support that.\n  This is Joshua and Jonathan. They are 5-year-old twins. As a sibling \ngroup, the hope is that they will be placed together. Therefore, a \nfamily who adopts them must have room in their hearts and homes for two \nchildren. Joshua is described as well-mannered, sneaky, and babyish. He \nenjoys school and its challenges. He has a nice smile and likes to \ncuddle. Jonathan is described as eager and easygoing. He likes to be \nhelpful around the house. He likes talking about his feelings and \nexplaining himself. Both are in excellent physical and mental \ncondition. These are children we hope a family will identify and bring \ninto their home and love.\n  There are many examples. If we do not fix the tax credit, the \nfamilies who adopt Jennifer, Joshua, and Jonathan will not get the full \nbenefit of the tax credit.\n  Some people have been critical about my passion with regard to this \nissue. They say: Senator, you shouldn't speak about it; at least the \nadoption credit is working for children from China, Honduras, and \nGuatemala. You know the desperate situation in those countries. Since \nthis is the only form of financial assistance for families who want to \nadopt these kids, if it expires, they will be left with nothing.\n  Yes, I want this tax credit to work when families choose to adopt \ninternationally, when families choose to adopt a domestic healthy \ninfant, and when they choose to adopt perhaps an older child, a sibling \ngroup, and give these kids who have already been let down once a chance \nto come into a family. I am here today because I want the tax credit to \nbe available for all families regardless of what type of adoption they \npursue. Mr. President, as I am sure you are aware, their are many \ndifferent types of adoptions, each with different costs, different \nprocesses, and different children. All I ask, is that we have a tax \ncode that recognizes and appreciates those differences.\n  I believe there is consensus. There is an easy and relatively \ninexpensive way to fix this problem once and for all. That is why I am \ntaking this time now to bring it to the attention of those who have the \npower to fix it at this late date, and hopefully we can.\n  Some say we should wait until next year to fix it. If we can fix it \nnow, why take another year out of the lives of some of these children? \nWhy not help parents now?\n  I will make one final point. The Senator from Iowa may be interested \nto know this. Yesterday, as I was on the floor speaking about this \nissue, the New York Times ran a full-length story about the problems \nwith our foster care system. For the first time in our Nation's \nhistory, two girls in the foster care system and their attorneys \nsuccessfully sued the Department of Social Services of Florida and \nreceived a judgment of $4.4 million.\n\n  The case was brought by an attorney who believed that the children \nhad been shortchanged. These two beautiful little girls had been \nabandoned by their mother. They were left in a Miami park or public \nplace when they were 2 or 3 years old. Instead of determining whether \nthese children could ever be reunited with their mother, father, or \nsome relative to make them safe, the Department of Social Services put \nthem in foster care. Those little girls spent the next 14 years of \ntheir lives going from home to home, with 30 different placements. They \nwere sexually molested and physically abused.\n  The court rightfully said the State of Florida now owes these two \nlittle girls 4.4 million dollars. There is a happy ending. They have \nsubsequently been adopted by a wonderful family.\n  I am here to say we had better fix this tax credit because if this \ncase goes forward--and I think it will--the taxpayers of the United \nStates are going to pick up a far greater expense than perhaps \nproviding a few thousand dollars to families willing to adopt these \nchildren.\n  Even if it is not the money, it is the justice and morality of this \nNation, which is the strongest nation in the world. We do not have our \nstrength represented by how high our stock market goes up. Our strength \nis represented by our willingness and ability to help kids and \nfamilies, and if we cannot do this, then I do not know what we are \ndoing here.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I thank Senator Lott, Senator \nCraig, and Senator Grassley for their great leadership in this area. I \nlook forward to working with them on this project.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the New York Times \narticle in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 27 2000]\n\n          Foster-Child Advocates Gain Allies in Injury Lawyers\n\n\nStates Face the Dual Threat of Class Actions and Huge Individual Damage \n                                 Awards\n\n                          (By Nina Bernstein)\n\n       The girls were 2 and 4 when their mother abandoned them \n     near a city park in Miami in 1986. Under federal law, the \n     Florida Department of Children and Family Services was \n     supposed to place them for adoption or return them home \n     within 18 months.\n       Instead, over the next 14 years the sisters were shuttled \n     through more than 30 foster homes and institutions, beaten, \n     raped and repeatedly separated from each other while a stream \n     of caseworkers overlooked such obvious evidence of abuse as \n     the diagnosis of syphilis in the older girl when she was 9.\n       The sisters' ordeal could have been just another horror \n     story in a national litany of foster care abuses. But last \n     year a Florida Circuit Court jury awarded them $4.4 million \n     in damages from the state.\n       The case laid the groundwork for a new strategy in which \n     advocacy groups for children and personal injury lawyers, \n     some fresh from winning billions of dollars in legal \n     settlements with the tobacco companies, are using the threat \n     of multimillion dollar damage awards to try to change the \n     deeply troubled foster care system.\n       In the past, individual damage suits for injured foster \n     children were typically settled behind the scenes for small \n     amounts. And efforts to win systemic changes through court \n     orders have often been frustrated by failures of enforcement.\n       But court rulings that make government agencies easier to \n     sue and sizable jury awards in foster care cases like the one \n     in Florida have encouraged advocates for foster children and \n     personal injury lawyers to join forces over the past few \n     months in two-track litigation. Their lawsuits ask the courts \n     to change the system, while separately seeking damages on \n     behalf of children already harmed.\n       ``This is for change, and to get the attention of the \n     powers that be--any money will go to the kids,'' said Robert \n     Montgomery, the lead counsel in the tobacco settlements in \n     Florida and one of a dozen top trial lawyers who began \n     working without pay on the foster care suits this summer.\n       The sisters' case was filed by Karen Gievers, who has a \n     lead role in both the lawsuits for damages and the class \n     action seeking changes in the Florida system.\n       Across the country, a similar pincer approach is typified \n     by Tim Farris, a Bellingham, Wash., trial lawyer who has \n     brought damage suits in state courts for 13 children shuttled \n     from foster home to foster home in a total of 208 placements. \n     The California-based National Center for Youth Law,\n\n[[Page S11302]]\n\n     a nonprofit children's advocacy group, recently joined his \n     effort to leverage those cases into a multi-million-dollar \n     overhaul of the state's child welfare system.\n       ``In my own small-town way I said, `Look, you can move \n     these children as often as you wish, but if you do, you're \n     going to have to pay for the damages you do to them.'' Mr. \n     Farris said, ``and it's going to be cheaper to treat them \n     right.''\n       Few suggest this kind of litigation is a shortcut either to \n     riches or to an overhaul of the state programs that are \n     trying to care for 600,000 children outside their homes. \n     State agencies typically can only be sued for compensation, \n     not punitive damages, and they can make it daunting in time \n     and money to unearth confidential records needed to prove a \n     case and collect. The $4.4 million Florida verdict is on hold \n     pending an appeal.\n       But at a time when child-friendly policies figure \n     prominently in election campaigns, the political potency of \n     such cases may outweigh the legal drawbacks, said John \n     Coffee, a professor of law at Columbia University. \n     ``Plaintiffs' lawyers have learned that the class action can \n     be very, very useful when the state agency has some \n     vulnerability,'' he said.\n       The vulnerability of government agencies has grown \n     considerably in some states. Jeff Freimund, as assistant \n     attorney general for Washington, said courts there had \n     rejected legislative caps on negligence awards, and \n     government payouts in civil cases in general have quadrupled \n     in six years, to $38 million in the last three months alone.\n       ``The courts have opened the door to litigation on child \n     welfare activities,'' Mr. Freimund said. ``They're very \n     difficult cases to defend in front of juries because juries \n     often have the benefit of 20-20 hindsight.''\n       Some officials, including Kathleen A. Kearney, the \n     secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Families, \n     say such litigation unfairly detracts from continuing efforts \n     to improve child welfare, diverting resources that \n     legislatures, not courts, should control. But others, \n     frustrated at the persistence of problems documented and \n     denounced for 20 years, welcome the new strategy.\n       ``Money talks, and money makes policy,'' said Jean Soliz, \n     who headed Washington's Department of Social and Health \n     Services for three years, until 1995. She recalled that state \n     legislators made all the right speeches during her tenure, \n     but put $30 million into a new sport stadium rather than \n     provide court advocates or mental health care for \n     Washington's 11,000 foster children. Today, fewer than half \n     have an advocate in court proceedings, and more than a third \n     have been moved through three or more foster homes, studies \n     show.\n       ``The torts give you leverage to make them take it \n     seriously; the torts don't fix anything,'' said Ms. Soliz, \n     who now directs the spending of a tobacco tax earmarked for \n     children in Nevada County, Calif. She emphasizes the \n     importance of enlisting national advocacy groups that can \n     draw on lessons from court consent decrees they have won in \n     suits against child welfare systems in at least 20 states.\n       Bill Grimm, a lawyer with the National Center for Youth \n     Law, said groups like his had become more open to alliances \n     with personal injury lawyers because conventional strategies \n     had run into obstacles. While Congress has enacted tougher \n     foster care requirements--foster care time limits, for \n     example, are now set at a year rather than 18 months--federal \n     judges in some states have recently made it harder for \n     children to seek enforcement of those laws in federal court. \n     Their rulings hold that Congressional requirements intended \n     to protect foster children do not constitute rights.\n       We are at a bit of a crossroads,'' Mr. Grimm said.\n       Even in states already operating under sweeping \n     settlements, damage suits are playing a more prominent role. \n     In New York City, where an ambitious child welfare consent \n     decree imposed a moratorium on new class-action lawsuits, the \n     Administration for Children's Services has paid hundreds of \n     thousands of dollars in settlements to fathers who were not \n     notified that their children were in foster care. And city \n     lawyers are negotiating to settle a multi-million-dollar \n     lawsuit over a toddler who was beaten to death by foster \n     parents with a known history of abuse.\n       But there are perils to trying to turn such cases into a \n     broader crusade in the absence of national allies or deep \n     pockets, said Lawrence Berlin, an Arizona lawyer who has won \n     settlements averaging $250,000 for a dozen children sexually \n     abused in foster care. His motion to turn the cases of some \n     children into a more powerful class action was denied in \n     federal court after six years of litigation that consumed his \n     practice, he said. The state rejected his offer to settle for \n     systemic changes.\n       ``I'm not saying children haven't been abused,'' said Tom \n     Prose, an assistant Arizona attorney general in charge of \n     liability cases, who emphasized that the current \n     administration had made child protection a top priority. \n     ``The issue is, is it pervasive and are we ignoring it? And \n     my answer to you is, in Arizona, it's neither.''\n       In Florida, where the number of children in foster care has \n     nearly doubled since 1998, to 15,000, the class-action suit \n     contends that foster children are now in greater danger of \n     emotional and physical injury from the state than from the \n     families from which they were taken.\n       ``We had a toddler in a foster home so overcrowded the kid \n     spent the weekend strapped into a car seat,'' said Marcia \n     Robinson Lowry, the director of Children Rights, a national \n     advocacy organization based in New York, which recently \n     joined the Florida class action.\n       Among the companion damage suits in Florida are some that \n     highlight the harm flowing from one bad foster home, that of \n     a couple in Hillsborough County. After the couple were \n     arrested in May on 40 felony charges of child abuse and \n     neglect, it emerged that the state had entrusted them with 28 \n     foster children over four years, even as caseworkers recorded \n     their abusive practices.\n       ``My brother has severe problems because of what happened \n     in that home,'' said Ashley Rhodes-Courter, now 14, who \n     entered foster care at 3 because of her mother's drug \n     problems, and endured 14 placements. She was 7 and her \n     brother 4 during their year in the couple's home.\n       ``He was abused,'' she said. ``He had hot sauce put on his \n     tongue; he was dunked in a bathtub until he was nearly \n     drowned. It was very frightening to watch someone you love \n     being mistreated and you being able to do nothing about it.''\n       For Ashley, a resilient and academically gifted child, \n     there was a happy ending. A family with the love, money and \n     persistence to extract her from the system adopted her in \n     1998. But her brother, who entered foster care at birth, \n     lives in a treatment center, still waiting for a family \n     capable of coping with the damage he suffered. He is one of \n     22 plaintiffs in the class action.\n       Separately, he and Ashley are plaintiffs in damage suits \n     brought or planned against the state on behalf of all the \n     Hillsborough County couple's former foster children, \n     including the 23 that the state has refused to identify, and \n     8 the couple adopted with state subsidies who are now back in \n     the foster care system.\n       Proponents of double-edged litigation say that even if \n     institutional change remains elusive, at least financial help \n     can be won for a few of the children the system has wronged--\n     children like the two Florida sisters, now 17 and 18, who are \n     both literate and both mothers.\n       ``You all hurt me all my life,'' the older sister told \n     officials in a deposition last year, declaring her \n     determination to keep her own baby daughter out of foster \n     care. ``I hate every last one of you.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss a \ncritical issue: adoption of children with special needs. I appreciate \nthe work of my Senate colleagues who cochair the Congressional \nCoalition on Adoption, Senators Craig and Landrieu. I thank them for \ntheir dedication in furthering adoption. Both have demonstrated their \ncommitment to adoption through word and deed. I respect their efforts \nand look forward to working with them in the coming years to increase \nadoptions and to improve the lives of vulnerable children.\n  The adoption tax credit which passed in 1996 was a step in the right \ndirection. It provided a 5-year credit for adoptions of nonspecial \nneeds children. It provided a permanent credit for adoptions of \nchildren with special needs. I commend Senator Craig for his efforts to \nextend the provision relating to nonspecial needs adoptions. As Senator \nCraig mentioned on the floor earlier today, while extending the credit \nis another step in the right direction, we must not rest on our \nlaurels. There is more to be done especially as it relates to adoption \nof special needs children. The cost of adoption varies widely. Private \nor international adoptions can cost as much as $30,000 per child. In \ncontrast, adoptions from foster care are often subsidized by the \ngovernment.\n  Parents who choose to adopt a child from foster care or through a \npublic\n\n[[Page S11303]]\n\nagency incur little, if any, expenses related directly to the adoption \nprocess. However, they incur a great deal of ``incidental'' expense \nrelated to adoption. The adoption tax credit is available only for \n``adoption related expenses'' which include necessary adoption fees, \ncourt costs, and attorneys' fees. This limitation works directly to the \ndisadvantage of families adopting children with special needs, because \nthe credit does not recognize the overwhelming indirect expenses \nassociated with adopting such a child. These expenses might include \nfitting the home with a ramp for a wheelchair bound child, to cite one \nexample.\n  When Congress passed the tax credit in 1996, it also directed the \nU.S. Department of the Treasury to issue a report on the effect of the \ncredit. According to the Treasury report released this month, for tax \nyear 1998, 77,000 adoptions were eligible for a tax credit--31,000 for \nspecial needs and 46,000 for non-special needs adoptions. However, of \nthe 31,000 eligible special needs adoptions, only 4,700 received \nbenefits from the tax credit. Compare that with 45,700 of the eligible \n46,000 adoptions of non-special needs children that received benefits \nfrom the tax credit.\n  Let me put it another way. The Treasury Department reports 15 percent \nof eligible special needs adoptions received tax benefits compared with \n99 percent of eligible non-special needs adoptions which received tax \nbenefits for 1998. For those wondering why so few special needs \nadoptions benefited from the tax credit in 1998, here is one reason. \nAverage expenses--allowed by current law--were reported for tax year \n1998 as $3,540 per special needs adoption and $5,890 per nonspecial \nneeds adoption. When you look at these expenses, it is clear that \nincreasing the amount of the tax credit for special needs adoptions \nwill have little to no impact on families seeking to adopt special \nneeds children.\n  I view this as one of the flaws in current law that must be fixed. \nLet me be clear: I support the extension of the tax credit for non-\nspecial needs adoption. I also support taking a hard look at how the \ncurrent tax credit impacts special needs adoptions. I urge my \ncolleagues to consider the impact of the tax credit on families \nadapting special needs children. Again, I commend Senators Craig and \nLandrieu for their efforts on behalf of vulnerable children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with \nthe remarks of my friends from Iowa and Louisiana on this matter. The \nFinance Committee is very much concerned with and for this legislation. \nIt will become law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/28/senate-section/article/S11303-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR ROBERT F. WAGNER\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise for the pleasant purpose of \nnoting the decision by the Committee on Rules to add two names to that \nvery special group that is portrayed in our reception room--six of the \nmost distinguished Senators in our history. We have now added two--or \nshortly will have done so--Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan and \nSenator Robert F. Wagner of New York.\n  The story of Robert F. Wagner is a quintessential and essential one, \ndescribing the life of a poor immigrant child born on the east side of \nNew York, who, by steady succession made his way to this Chamber. In \nthe process, he changed the United States, recognizing, at long last, \nthat we had become an urban Nation with needs, in legislative terms, \nthat such a transformation requires.\n  The census of 1920 determined, for the first time, that the majority \nof Americans lived in urban areas--rather loosely defined, but still--\nand intensely so on the island of Manhattan. It may seem difficult to \nbelieve, but in 1910, the population of Manhattan was twice what it is \ntoday, and the conditions were difficult indeed.\n  Yet there was a degree of social order, a very powerful and \nprogressive political organization, Tammany Hall, which dates from the \nRevolutionary War days. Aaron Burr was the head of Tammany at one \npoint. And in the person of Charles Francis Murphy, it became \nunexpectedly, but unmistakably, the single most powerful source of \nprogressive ideas for social legislation in our history--ideas that \nbecame law that changed lives.\n  Perhaps the critical event was the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire of 1911. \nIn downtown Manhattan, there were women in a sweatshop, as we would \ncall it. A fire broke out. The doors were locked. They were left to \nleap from eighth-story windows. And the city never got over it. Frances \nPerkins, having tea in Gramercy Park, five blocks away, never got over \nit. But it was Robert Wagner and Al Smith who did something about it.\n  They had gone to Albany under the auspices of their district leaders, \nbig Tom Foley in the case of Al Smith, from the lower east side, and \nMcCardle from the upper east side.\n  Smith became speaker of the assembly; Wagner, President pro tempore \nof the Senate.\n  They chaired together a commission on the Triangle Shirtwaist fire. \nThey came out with legislation calling for safety and sanitary \nconditions, restricting child labor, limiting the hours of working \nwomen and protecting the activities of trade unions--events which never \nbefore appeared on the legislative calendar of any State legislature, \nmuch less the Congress. And they passed.\n  Smith went on to become Governor of New York and created, with his \ncompany, a legislative agenda which Franklin D. Roosevelt, who \nsucceeded Smith as Governor, would take to Washington. We call it the \nNew Deal.\n  Wagner had already arrived in Washington and was well positioned to \ntake up his work, beginning with the National Industrial Recovery Act \nin 1933, and, in 1935, the defining Wagner Act, which is technically \nthe National Labor Relations Act. It created the National Labor \nRelations Board and gave labor unions a right to exist and to be heard \nand not to be harassed.\n  He went on under President Truman. He allied himself with Robert \nTaft, and the first major housing legislation passed this body. Then \nhealth care was proposed by Wagner, with Truman's support. A half \ncentury has gone by, and we are still dealing with that issue. But it \nis well that we recognize the person--a person, not the only one--who \nsingularly brought this matter to the nation's agenda.\n  I, as a New Yorker, am pleased, as all New Yorkers will be. I hope \nSenators will recognize that a just and honorable choice has been made. \nI am a member of the Rules Committee so it would not be appropriate to \ncongratulate the Rules Committee, but I certainly thank the chairman \nand the ranking member, Senators McConnell and Dodd.\n  I see my friend from New Mexico is on the floor, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know the parliamentary \nsituation. I need 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator Moynihan, I was listening to your speech on the \ntelevision set before I arrived on the floor. First, I thank you for \nwhat you said this morning. It is something we ought to hear, something \nthat ought to be placed permanently in our Record. And that is what \nhappened.\n  I personally want to say to you, over the years in my work as Budget \nCommittee chairman and other legislation, I have found you to be a real \nfriend. I think that is more important than talking about what you did \nhere in terms of this Senator. I can remember, believe it or not, when \nwe produced a most difficult budget, and it looked like a pretty good \nbudget. I was wondering whether it would pass. I had the votes counted. \nAll of a sudden, I won by one more vote than I thought. As he walked \nout, he put his hand on my shoulder and said: You did a great job. I \nvoted for you.\n  Now, we have talked a lot about other things, including you have \nasked me regularly about my wonderful family and my beautiful wife \nNancy. I thank you for that concern.\n  I guess in the remaining time I want to say to you, there are many \nways to be a great Senator. Sometimes you become a great Senator \nbecause you get a lot of big headlines. Sometimes you become a great \nSenator when you promote yourself, which is permitted\n\n[[Page S11304]]\n\naround here, and there is nothing wrong with it. But I can say, I think \nyou are a great Senator. I don't think you did either of those. I think \nyou just worked. And when people had to hear something that was vitally \nimportant, that had some history to it, I don't think we have had \nanyone around here in my 28 years--maybe there are Senators who have \nbeen here longer who might have experienced it, but I don't think I \nhave ever had a Senator who had so much impact because he knows a lot \nand he remembers history and he always calls matters to our attention \nwhen we ought to have them there. You have served on an important \ncommittee. Your knowledge of the world and trade and what it means to \nus in the world has been a tremendous asset for the Senate. I thank you \nfor that.\n  I am certain that many are not going to have time to commend the \ndistinguished Senator from New York because we are in some kind of a \nstrange, 1-day-at-a-time funding resolution. We are just adding to the \nappropriations by 1 day at a time, which I have never heard of before. \nI have never had it happen to me in 28 years. I don't think it has \nhappened. Nonetheless, we are here, and that is going to make it \ndifficult for Senators to find the time that they want to commend you \nin this Record. But I am sure many Senators are thinking today that \nthey would love to get down here and say thanks to you.\n  I thank Senator Moynihan very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I simply thank my revered friend. We have been \ntogether, even across the aisle, for a near quarter century. There is \nno one whose regard I greater value and whose remarks I could not be \nmore moved by.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed 2 \nminutes to respond to the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Indiana, Mr. Bayh, and I were here as you \nwere getting ready to speak. We talked, shared some of our thoughts \nabout you. The Senator from Indiana and I agreed on everything, but the \none thing that sticks out in my mind is we agreed that you have been a \nvisionary. You have been able to look out and find out what is going to \nhappen and try to alert us. Frankly, we haven't followed a lot of the \nvision that you have had as quickly as we should.\n  I always loved going to school from the time I was a little boy until \nthe time I finished my professional schooling. But the one thing that \nalways worried me was taking tests. So for me personally to be able to \nserve my entire time in the Senate on the same committee as you, during \nthe short period of time when you were chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, before you moved to chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, that it has been like going to school.\n  In fact, in the back of the Chamber today, I recited to the Senator \nsome of the things he taught me about transportation and some of the \nthings that need to be done. The good part of being educated by Senator \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan is that I haven't had to take any tests. As a \nresult of that, I feel I am a much better Senator and certainly a much \nbetter person for having had the good fortune to serve in the Senate \nand on the Environment and Public Works Committee with someone who the \nhistory books will write was one of the great Senators to serve in the \nhistory of our Republic.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I do so very much thank my friend. This is a very \nspecial moment for me.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments \nexpanding on some I made the other day on the economy and what is \nhappening. The reason I want to do that is there is a lot of discussion \nthese days about what is happening in this country. Some say, well, \nwhat has been done in 8 years?\n  That is a legitimate question. There is this old saying that bad news \ntravels halfway around the world before good news gets its shoes on. \nLet's talk about good news for a moment. Maybe we can get that fully \naddressed about this economy and what is happening in this country.\n  I want to talk about what has happened in the past 8 years. In 1992, \nwe had a $290 billion Federal deficit that was growing by leaps and \nbounds. On this chart, these are the red ink numbers from 1985 forward. \nAs you can see, there are massive quantities of deficits year by year. \nIn 1992, it was $290 billion alone. At this point, Congress developed a \nnew economic program. President Clinton proposed to change the \ndirection with a new program, and Congress adopted it by one vote in \nthe House and one vote in the Senate. You can see what has happened to \ndeficits since then. The deficits have been reduced and finally \neliminated. We have turned it around and we now have budget surpluses. \nThat is good news.\n  Mr. President, 22 million jobs have been created in the economy that \nhas been growing during the past 8 years. That is an extraordinary \nnumber of jobs compared to what had been created in the previous 12 \nyears.\n  This chart reflects what happened to the inflation rate. It has gone \ndown, down, and stayed down, which is wonderful news for our country. \nWe have the lowest poverty rate in two decades. What has happened in \nrecent years? You can see what happened here from 1993 on down. On this \nchart, the Federal spending related to the gross domestic product is \ndown to the lowest level since 1966--related to the GDP of this \ncountry. So we have a lot of good news.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Looking at where the chart is peaked up, who was President \nduring that time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The highest levels of spending relative to GDP occurred \nduring the Reagan and Bush administrations. That had a lot to do with \nthe size of the economy. As the economy has grown rather substantially, \nespecially in the recent 8 years, what has happened is that Federal \nspending as a percentage of GDP actually decreased.\n  I think it is important to talk about what has happened in recent \nyears because people raise the question of the tax burden for middle-\nincome taxpayers. As the chart shows, $39,000 is the average income. \nFederal income taxes, as a percentage, have actually decreased; the \nFederal income tax burden has decreased.\n  There are a couple of other things I want to mention about our \neconomy. In the last 8 years, the $290 billion deficit has gone, and \nnow we have the biggest surplus in history. Eight years ago, economic \ngrowth averaged 2.8 percent for the previous decade. All of the leading \neconomists in this country at that point said they expected we would \nhave in the entire 1990s anemic, slow economic growth.\n  In fact, they were all wrong. We have had economic growth averaging \n3.9 percent annually since 1993. Job growth: 22 million new jobs since \nJanuary 1993.\n  The unemployment rate from 1981 to 1992 averaged 7.1 percent \nannually. Now it is at 4.1 percent--the lowest level in 30 years.\n  Home ownership fell from 1981 to 1992, but the growth was the highest \nin history in the last 9 years.\n  The Dow Jones was 3,300 in 1993, and it is now over 10,000.\n  The point is this: A lot of good things have happened in this \ncountry. Some say: Well, it is the rooster taking credit for the Sun \ncoming up.\n  I don't know who is to share the credit here. It seems to me the \ncountry was headed in the wrong direction, and then President Clinton \ncame to office and said: Let's change direction and plans. The planning \nproposed was not\n\n[[Page S11305]]\n\nvery popular. It passed by only one vote in the House and one vote in \nthe Senate, and it gave the American people confidence that Congress \nwould make some tough decisions. It increased some taxes--not many but \nsome.\n  It cut some spending, and we had a new plan--a new direction. The \ncountry moved in the new direction.\n  The American people had confidence that things were going to change. \nOur economy rests on a mattress of confidence. If people are confident \nabout the future, they do things that manifest that confidence. They \nbuy a house and they buy a car. They do the things that represent their \nconfidence in the future. If they are not confident, they decide not to \ndo those things, and the economy then contracts.\n  The point is that we have an economic plan in this country that has \nworked very well. The results are self-evident.\n  The question is: What is the plan for the future?\n  That is why we have this Congress. We have debates in Congress about \nwhat to do about the future.\n  Some say: Well, we expect 10 years of budget surpluses for the next \n10 years. I don't know of a group of economists in this country that \nhas been right for 5 years, let alone 10 years.\n  We would be very wise in this country, in my judgment, to take the \nconservative course on the question of what we do in fiscal policy. \nEconomists don't know what is going to happen in the next year or in 3, \n5, or 10 years from now.\n  We ought to establish as a priority paying down the Federal debt \nfirst. If during tough times you run the Federal debt up, it seems to \nme that during good times you ought to pay down the Federal debt.\n  I inquire whether that is a continuing resolution. If it is, I will \nsuspend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/28/senate-section/article/S11305-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MAKING FURTHER CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, I rise today to attempt to put some \ntransparence on what is going on around here.\n  This summer, the Republicans very successfully convinced the American \npeople that their party was for estate tax relief and marriage penalty \nrelief and that the Democrats were not. Well, my friends, that is \nsimply not the case. The Democrats are for eliminating the estate tax \nfor small businesses and family farms valued at $8 million and for all \nother estates worth $4 million. And, Mr. President, it is the \nDemocratic plan for marriage penalty relief that completely eliminates \nthe marriage penalty found in 65 provisions in the tax code.\n  So, isn't it a bit frightening that the Republicans have so \nsuccessfully twisted the debate so as to mislead the American people \ninto thinking that they are actually the party supportive of tax cuts. \nReality is, however, that they are the party of political rhetoric and \npolitical maneuvering. If the Republicans really wanted to give the \nAmerican people estate tax relief and marriage penalty relief, they \ncould have--they had many, many opportunities for sending the President \nreal relief. Instead of giving the American people empty rhetoric--we \ncould be sitting here today with elimination of the estate tax and \nmarriage penalty tax relief for virtually all Americans.\n  Now, why do I bring all this up. Because it is happening over and \nover again. The Republicans are misleading the American people on a \nhost of critical pieces of legislation, including: patients bill of \nrights, prescription drug coverage, minimum wage increase, tax cuts, \nhealth insurance coverage and education.\n  Instead of actually providing the American people with real relief--\nthis year--the Republicans prefer the politics.\n  I have heard from constituents who ask me--``If both Republicans and \nDemocrats want patients bill of rights, then why can't the Republicans \nand Democrats just work together to get something done?'' That is an \nexcellent question. Why?\n  Why is it that we cannot just reach agreement? Is it that we are \nmissing\n\n[[Page S11306]]\n\nsome magical force here in Washington to bring bipartisanship to all? \nUnfortunately, the answer is that the Republicans want the rhetoric--\nand the Democrats want real reform. So, until the Republicans stop \npandering and posturing and start sincerely and openly working \ntogether, there can be no agreements. You see, the Republicans have a \nmore difficult time even working with each other--there is nothing \npartisan or bipartisan about that. Yet they have misled the American \npeople to think that the Democrats--not the Republicans--are the ones \nholding up the works and refusing to work in a bipartisan manner. Mr. \nPresident, that is truly overstepping the bounds of the reality of what \nis going on up here.\n  Our efforts to fight for fundamental fairness in health, education \nand tax cuts, are being twisted into political pandering and posturing \nby the Republicans. But all we are doing is fighting for the \nfundamental fairness that the American people have fought for by \nworking hard every day of their lives.\n  Let me illustrate this by highlighting the differences between the \npolicies of the Republicans and the Democrats with respect to the bill \nthat we have before us.\n  The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we do as much as possible \nto meet America's need for safe and modern schools.\n  Democrats solution--enact the bipartisan Rangel-Johnson proposal to \nfinance $25 billion in bonds to construct and modernize 6,000 schools.\n  Republican's bill--is thoroughly inadequate--it provides no \nguaranteed funding for urgent school repairs, provides only $16 billion \nin bonds, and does not include the important Davis-Bacon provision to \nensure that the construction workers who build and repair our nation's \nschools receive a fair wage for their work.\n  Result of their plan--the arbitrage provision encourages delay in \nurgently needed school construction and would disproportionately help \nwealthy school districts.\n  The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we promote bipartisanship \nin health care by coupling both the Republican and Democrat priorities \non health care and long-term care.\n  Democrats solution-- our FamilyCare proposal would expand coverage to \n4 million uninsured parents at a cost of slightly over $3,000 per \nperson.\n  Republican's bill--provides additional coverage to one-seventh of the \npeople at $18,000 per person--that is one-seventh of the people at 6 \ntimes the cost. Their approach is inequitable, inefficient, and \ncounterproductive to health care policy.\n  Result of their plan--completely ignores a proposal to cover millions \nof uninsured, working Americans and jeopardizes the insurance coverage \nof those individuals currently receiving employer-based coverage. In \nfact, on the Republican health deduction, the Joint Tax Committee \nestimates that while over 26 million individuals would receive benefits \nunder the proposal, only 1.6 million individuals would be newly insured \nas a result. In contrast, the Democrats in Congress and the Clinton-\nGore Administration plan would expand coverage to 5 million uninsured \nAmericans.\n  The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we help the families who \ncare for our nation's elderly.\n  Democrats solution--accept the Republicans deduction for long-term \ncare insurance in exchange for inclusion of a proposal to provide a \n$3,000 tax credit for long-term care costs.\n  Republican's bill--provide a health care deduction for long-term care \ncosts.\n  Result of their plan--they provide half of the benefits of the long-\nterm care credit that the Democrats provide.\n  The Democrats are fighting to ensure that all Americans are insured.\n  Democrats solution--bipartisan policies for health insurance options \nfor children with disabilities, legal immigrant pregnant women and \nchildren, and enrolling uninsured children in schools, needed payment \nincreases to hospitals, academic health centers, home health agencies \nand other vulnerable providers.\n  Republican's bill--provides over one-third of the cost of their \nmedicare bill to the HMOs.\n  Result of their plan--there is no accountability to prevent excessive \npayment increases to HMOs and failure to address the urgent health \nneeds of seniors, people with disabilities, and children.\n  The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we encourage medical \nresearch and expand vaccine distribution to proactively approach \nmedicine.\n  Democrats solution--a bipartisan tax credit for vaccine research and \npurchases for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and any infectious \ndisease that causes over 1 million deaths annually.\n  Republican's bill--nothing.\n  Result of their plan--this is a failure to address a problem of \nserious ramifications. These diseases cause almost half of all deaths \nworldwide of people under age 45, killing over 8 million children each \nyear and orphaning millions more.\n  The Democrats are fighting to ensure that low and middle income \nindividuals save and invest for their future.\n  Democrats solution--provide savings incentives to low and middle \nincome individuals through retirement savings accounts.\n  Republican's bill--they specifically dropped this provision from the \nbipartisan Senate Finance Committee bill.\n  Result of their plan--a failure to address the lack of pension \ncoverage for 70 million people. I want to just add one point here. \nEvery year, through tax incentives, private pensions cost the fisc $76 \nbillion. Yet 75 percent of American households in the 15 percent tax \nbracket--that means income of about $30,000--receive little or no tax \nincentive on their IRA or pension contribution.\n  The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we meet our current \nobligations before we promise new programs for distressed communities.\n  Democrats solution--fully fund the currently existing empowerment \nzones to spur economic development in distressed communities.\n  Republican's bill--create new renewal communities without meeting our \npromise to the existing empowerment zone communities.\n  Result of their plan--irresponsible pandering to wealthy business \nowners who will benefit from their new renewal communities at the \nexpense of low and middle income entrepreneurs.\n  The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we don't turn our backs on \nthose areas most in need.\n  Democrats solution--provide an economic activity credit to encourage \nbusiness investment in jobs for the residents of Puerto Rico.\n  Republican's bill--they specifically rejected this provision.\n  Result of their plan-- this equates to turning their backs on the \nhard working people of Puerto Rico. Even while at an historical low of \nabout 10.1 percent, the unemployment rate in Puerto Rico continues to \nremain well above that of any state; the per capita income in Puerto \nRico, which was $9,908 in FY 1999, is less than half that of any state; \nand well over 50 percent of the labor force in Puerto Rico are within \n$1.00 of the current minimum wage.\n  The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we encourage adoption of \nspecial needs children from foster care programs.\n  Democrats solution--change a few words in the current tax code to \nensure that families who adopt children from foster care can benefit \nfrom the same tax credit which is available to parents who adopt \ninternational children.\n  Republican's bill--specifically ignored a more inclusive approach.\n  Result of their plan--the Republicans turned their backs on those \nchildren with the greatest needs.\n  Let's look at some of those who do benefit under the Republican plan \nfor example--the Texas State Universities. Now, stay with me on this. \nThe Republicans--well I should say only about 4 or 5 Republicans, in \ntheir closed door, secret meetings included a couple of interesting \nrifle shots in their tax bill. The one, interestingly enough, would \nprovide a specific exception just for the Texas state universities, \nthat would make their interest on bonds nontaxable. The American people \nare giving the Texas state universities a $4 million gift --while our \npublic elementary and high school students are learning in trailers.\n  The bottom line is that the Republicans want to help big business and \nthe HMOs. The Democrats reject this approach. The Democrats are \nfighting for fundamental fairness for the American people--our \nchildren, our elderly,\n\n[[Page S11307]]\n\nand all individuals of every race, color, and creed.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President I rise again today to urge President Clinton \nnot to veto the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill that the \nSenate passed yesterday.\n  President Clinton has threatened a veto because we did not include \nhis so-called Latino fairness act. But have included something much \nbetter--the Legal Immigration Family Equity Act, the LIFE Act. This act \nreunites families and restores due process to those who have played by \nthe rules. Our proposal does not pit one nationality against another, \nnor does it pit one race against another. Our legislation provides \nrelief to immigrants from all countries. A veto of CJS would be a blow \nagainst immigrant fairness.\n  But a veto would do far more than that. A veto would cut off funding \nfor some of our most important programs.\n  CJS appropriations allocates: $4.8 billion for the INS and an \nadditional $15.7 million for Border Patrol equipment upgrades, $3.3 \nbillion for the FBI, and $221 million for training, equipment, and \nresearch and development programs to combat domestic terrorism, $4.3 \nbillion for the federal prison system; $1.3 billion for the Drug \nEnforcement Administration; and $288 million for the Violence Against \nWomen Act program--legislation that I have strongly supported and that \nprovides assistance to battered women and children.\n  Actions have consequences. If President Clinton vetoes this bill, \nhe's putting the public's safety and well-being at risk both at home \nand abroad. and he's doing this all in an effort to play wedge \npolitics. the President's veto threats ring especially hollow because \nthis appropriations bill provides many proposals to help immigrants. \nThe President himself has stated that he wants ``to keep families \ntogether and to make our immigration policies more equitable.'' Well, \nthis is exactly what the LIFE Act does.\n  So, please, I ask Mr. Clinton, sign CJS appropriations so we can keep \nall of these programs funded for the American people.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate has passed, H.R. \n2598, the Public Health Improvement Act of 2000, a bill which combines \na number of critical bills improving the health of our citizens.\n  Title I of this measure contains a bill which passed the Senate \nHealth, Education and Pensions Committee on June 14, 2000, the Public \nHealth Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000. This important legislation, \nwhich I drafted with my colleague, Senator Kennedy, is the culmination \nof three hearings and forums and a GAO report over the last two years \nwhich demonstrated the need to improve our public health infrastructure \nand address the growing threats of antimicrobial resistance and \nbioterrorism.\n  The conclusion is clear: we need to improve our public health \ninfrastructure to be able to respond in a timely and effective manner \nto these and other threats. For too long, we have not provided adequate \nfunding to maintain and improve the core capacities of our nation's \npublic health infrastructure. As the GAO report found, many State and \nlocal public health agencies lack even the basic equipment of a fax \nmachine or answering machine to assist in their work and improve \ncommunications.\n  Besides improving our core public health capacity, this Act addresses \ntwo specific problems faced by the nation: antimicrobial resistance and \nbioterrorism.\n  The first, antimicrobial resistance is a growing public health \nproblem. As a heart and lung transplant surgeon, I know all too well \nthat the most common cause of death after the transplantation of a \nheart or lung is not rejection, but infection. One hundred percent of \ntransplantation patients get infections following surgery. Infection is \nthe most common complication following surgery, the leading cause for \nrehopitalization, and the most expensive aspect of treatment post-\ntransplantation. Antibiotics are a mainstay of treatment, yet we are \nseeing increasingly resistant bacteria which are not killed by most \nfirst-line antimicrobials.\n  The second issue addressed by this act, bioterrorism, poses a \nsignificant threat to our country's strategic well-being. As a nation \nwe are presently more vulnerable to bioweapons than other more \ntraditional means of warfare. Bioweapons pose considerable challenges, \ndifferent from those of standard terrorist devices, including chemical \nweapons.\n  The mere term ``bioweapon'' invokes visions of immense human pain and \nsuffering and mass casualties. Pound for pound, ounce for ounce, \nbioagents represent one of the most lethal, but also covert, weapons of \nmass destruction known. Victims of a covert bioterrorist attack do not \nnecessarily develop symptoms upon exposure to the bioagent as the onset \nmay be delayed for days after the bioweapon is dispersed.\n  As a result, exposed individuals will likely show up in emergency \nrooms, physician offices, or clinics with nondescript symptoms or ones \nthat mimic the common cold or flu. Physicians and other health care \nproviders will likely not attribute these symptoms to a bioweapon. If \nthe bioagent is communicable, such as small pox, many more people may \nbe infected in the interim, including our health care workers. As \nStephanie Bailey, the Director of Health for Metropolitan Nashville and \nDavidson County pointed out in our hearing on bioterrorism, ``many \nlocalities are on their own for the first 24 to 48 hours after an \nattack before Federal assistance can arrive and be operational. This is \nthe critical time for preventing mass casualties.''\n  If experts are correct in their belief that a major bioterrorist \nattack is a virtual certainty, then it is no longer a question of \n``if'' but rather ``when''. In fact, my home town of Nashville last \nyear joined an ever-increasing number of cities to receive and respond \nto a package suspected to contain anthrax. Thankfully, this was a hoax.\n  The Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act provides greater \nresources and coordination to improve our public health infrastructure \nand bolster our preparedness against antimicrobial resistance and \nbioterrorism.\n  To strengthen public health infrastructure's ability to fulfill its \ncore functions and respond to emerging threats and emergencies, the \nbill authorizes the establishment of voluntary performance goals for \npublic health systems, grants to public health agencies for assessments \nand core capacity building, and funding to rebuild and remodel the \nfacilities of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC.\n  To combat antimicrobial resistance, the bill authorizes a task force \nto coordinate Federal programs related to antimicrobial resistance and \nto improve public education on antimicrobial resistance; National \nInstitutes of Health (NIH) research into new therapeutics against and \nimproved diagnostics for resistant pathogens; and grants to detect, \nmonitor, and combat antimicrobial resistance.\n  To prevent and respond to bioterrorism, the bill authorizes: two \ninterdepartmental task forces to address the joint issues of research \nneeds and the public health and medical consequences of bioterrorism; \nNIH and CDC research on the epidemiology of bioweapons and the \ndevelopment of new vaccines or therapeutics for bioweapons; and grants \nto improve the ability of public health agencies, hospitals, and health \ncare facilities to detect, diagnose, and respond to bioterrorism.\n  We must act now to improve our basic capacities to address all public \nhealth threats, including antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. \nThis legislation provides State and local public health agencies the \nnecessary resources so that we better protect the health and well-being \nof our Nation's citizens.\n  The Public Health Improvement Act also improves our nation's medical \nresearch infrastructure through two bills that I co-authored: the \nClinical Research Enhancement Act and the Twenty-First Century Research \nLaboratories Act.\n  As a physician, I am aware of the need to translate laboratory \ndiscoveries into advances in patient care, but I was troubled by \nnumerous reports and analyses showing insufficient support for patient-\noriented research in the United States. The ``Clinical Research \nEnhancement Act,'' which I also drafted with Senator Kennedy, addresses \nthis issue by establishing intramural and extramural clinical research \nfellowship programs and a continuing\n\n[[Page S11308]]\n\neducation clinical research training program at the NIH. In addition, \nthe bill provides grants for the establishment of general clinical \nresearch centers, which provide the infrastructure for clinical \nresearch, including clinical training and career enhancement.\n  The ``Twenty-First Century Research Laboratories Act,'' which I \ndrafted with Senator Harkin improves our research infrastructure that \nis central to our continued leadership in medical research. \nUnfortunately, many research facilities are outdated, and future \nincreases in federal funding for the NIH must include support for the \nrenovation and construction of extramural research facilities and the \npurchase of state-of-the-art laboratory instrumentation. To renovate \nbiomedical and behavioral research facilities, the bill authorizes \ngrants or contracts to public and nonprofit private entities to expand, \nremodel, renovate, or alter existing research facilities or construct \nnew research facilities, including centers of excellence. In addition, \nit provides grants to public and non-profit private entities for the \npurchase of high-end, state-of-the art laboratory instrumentation.\n  The ``Public Health Improvement Act'' also includes important public \nhealth bills such as the ``Cardiac Arrest Survival Act,'' the ``Rural \nAccess to Emergency Devices Act,'' the ``Lupus Research Act,'' the \n``Prostate Cancer Research and Protection Act,'' as well as important \ncritical pieces of legislation improving organ donation and \nprocurement.\n  The ``Cardiac Arrest Survival Act,'' which Senator Gorton introduced, \nallows the Secretary of HHS to make recommendations with respect to \nplacing automated external defibrillators, AEDs, in federal building \nand to expand liability protection to persons or organizations who use \nAEDs. The ``Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act,'' which Senator \nCollins introduced would improve access to AEDs in small communities \nand rural areas to boost the survival rates of individuals in those \ncommunities who suffer cardiac arrest. In many small and rural \ncommunities limited budgets and the fact that so many rely on volunteer \norganizations for emergency services can make acquisition and \nappropriate training in the use of these life-saving devices \nproblematic. This legislation is intended to increase access to AEDs \nand trained local responders for smaller towns and rural areas where \nthose first on the scene may not be paramedics or others who would \nnormally have AEDs. With more than 700 people dying of sudden cardiac \narrest each day, up to 30 percent of which could be saved through \nimmediate medical attention, including defibrillation and \ncardiopulmonary resuscitation, it is my hope this provision will lead \nto increased placement and use of this life saving equipment.\n  Senator Bennett introduced the Lupus Research Act, to require the \nDirector of the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and \nSkin Diseases to expand and intensify research and related activities \nof the Institute regarding lupus. Lupus is a disorder of the immune \nsystem that affects between 1,400,000 and 2,000,000 Americans. Many \nwith the disease are either misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all. Lupus \nis often life threatening and is nine times more likely to affect women \nthan men. The symptoms of lupus make diagnosis difficult because they \nare sporadic and imitate the symptoms of many other illnesses. If \ndiagnosed properly, the majority of lupus cases can be controlled with \nproper treatment. This measure will increase research into this disease \nso that it may be more effectively diagnosed and treated.\n  Title VI of the Public Health Improvement Act contains the Prostate \nCancer Research and Protection Act, which I introduced last year. Each \nyear an estimated 37,000 American men will die, and 179,300 will be \ndiagnosed with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-\nrelated death in American men. Cancer of the prostate grows slowly, \nwithout symptoms, and thus is often undetected until it's in its most \nadvanced and incurable stage. It is critical that men are aware of the \nrisk of prostate cancer and take steps to ensure early detection. The \n``Prostate Cancer'' bill expands the authority of the CDC to carry out \nactivities related to prostate cancer screening and overall awareness \nand surveillance of the disease. The bill also extends the authority of \nthe NIH to conduct basic and clinical research in combating prostate \ncancer.\n  Finally, I would like to talk about provisions of great personal \nsignificance to me relating to organ procurement and donation. Last \nyear, more than 21,000 lives were saved through transplantation in the \nUnited States. However, the demand for transplants has more than \ntripled in the past ten years, and 16 people die each day before they \ncan receive a transplant. As a transplant surgeon, I can't express \nenough to my colleagues and the nation how important organ donation is. \nThat is why the ``Public Health Improvement Act'' includes a resolution \nrecognizing the need for increased organ and tissue donation and the \nimportant role that families play in the process. The resolution \ndesignates November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a day to ``Give \nThanks, Give Life'' and to discuss organ and tissue donation with other \nfamily members. It encourages families to use the time of Thanksgiving, \na time dedicated to spending time with one another, to discuss this \ncritical life-saving issue among themselves so that they may make \ninformed decisions should the occasion to donate arise. Thanksgiving is \na time to reflect on our blessings, and it represents the perfect \nopportunity for family members to discuss this simple act that can give \nlife to those most in need.\n  The bill also includes the ``Organ Procurement Organization \nCertification Act,'' which was drafted by Senators Collins and Dodd. \nOrgan Procurement Organizations, OPOs, approach families regarding \norgan donation and arrange transportation of organs and transplant \nsurgery logistics. They must currently be recertified every two years \nby the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, in order to qualify \nfor Medicare reimbursement. This bill requires HCFA to change the \nstandards for recertification to account for variation in the number of \npotential donors in a given state and extends the current certification \ncycle from two to four years.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed this bill, \nwhich represents the work of many Senators which I have mentioned in my \nremarks. I am thankful to all my colleagues for their support and \nwillingness to help improve the public health of this nation. I would \nespecially like to thank Senators Jeffords and Kennedy and \nRepresentatives Tom Bliley, Michael Bilirakis, John Dingell and Sherrod \nBrown, and their excellent staffs for all the hard work and dedication \nthat has gone into negotiating this package of bills. I would also like \nto thank Mr. Bill Baird and Ms. Daphne Edwards of the Office of Senate \nLegislative Counsel, for their tireless work and great expertise in \ndrafting this bill. I would like to thank my Staff Director of the \nPublic Health Subcommittee, Anne Phelps, and my Health Advisors Dave \nLarson and Mary Sumpter Johnson for their work in making this bill \npossible. Finally, I would like to thank the many groups who have \nworked on the various provisions in this bill for their support, and I \nlook forward to enactment of this bill this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place in the record a \nsummary of the Public Health Improvement Act and letters of support for \nthe Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act, which is incorporated in \nthe Public Health Improvement Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               The Public Health Improvement Act of 2000\n\n\n               TITLE I--Emerging Threats to Public Health\n\n       Most Americans live longer, healthier lives today than ever \n     before. However, the nation also faces grave new threats \n     that, if unmet, will imperil the extraordinary medical \n     progress made in recent decades. These emerging threats \n     include new or resurgent infectious diseases, dangerous \n     microbes resistant to antibiotics, and bioterrorist attacks. \n     The provision under this Title strengthens the nation's \n     capacity to detect and respond to these serious public health \n     threats by:\n       Improving the capacity of national, state, and local public \n     health agencies to detect and respond effectively to \n     infectious disease outbreaks and other public health \n     emergencies;\n       Enhancing the nation's ability to detect and control the \n     spread of disease-causing microbes that are resistant to \n     antibiotics; and\n\n[[Page S11309]]\n\n       Upgrading the nation's preparedness for the public health \n     and medical consequences of bioterrorist attacks.\n     Improving the Capacity of Public Health Agencies to Combat \n         Disease Emergencies\n       Drug resistant diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis \n     continue to claim millions of lives across the world and will \n     pose an increasing danger to this country in years to come. \n     The recent outbreak of West Nile Fever in the Northeast is an \n     ominous warning of emerging infectious diseases. New plagues \n     like Ebola virus pose new threats to population around the \n     world, including the United States.\n       To respond effectively to these growing threats, we must \n     strengthen the capacity of our public health agencies to \n     detect, diagnose, and contain infectious disease outbreaks. \n     Many of these agencies lack the basic computer equipment to \n     share data electronically on disease outbreaks and cannot \n     perform simple lab tests to diagnose infections. Most \n     agencies don't have a complete assessment of their current \n     capacities and needs. To meet these challenges, Title I \n     establishes grant programs to allow state and local public \n     health agencies to:\n       Assess their current capacities and identify their areas of \n     greatest need.\n       Upgrade the ability of public health labs to identify \n     disease-causing microbes.\n       Improve and expand electronic communication networks.\n       Develop plans to respond to public health emergencies.\n       Train public health personnel.\n     Revitalizing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n       The mission of the federal Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC) is to prevent and control disease, injury, \n     and disability. However, most of CDC's laboratory facilities \n     are in a state of disrepair and require immediate \n     modernization. If nothing is done, these facilities may be \n     severely outmatched by undiscovered biological threats \n     encountered in the future. To better defend against and \n     combat the public health threats of the 21st century, this \n     bill authorizes funding to CDC for construction and \n     renovation of facilities.\n     Combating Antimicrobial Resistance\n       The widespread use of antibiotics beginning in the 1940's \n     provided--for the first time in history--effective treatments \n     for infectious diseases. These miracle drugs have saved \n     countless lives, but today they are increasingly prescribed \n     or used inappropriately. Antibiotics that once had the power \n     to cure dangerous infections are now often useless, because \n     microbes have become resistant to all but the newest and most \n     expensive drugs. Some ``superbugs'' are impervious to any \n     current pharmaceutical treatment.\n       Resistance to antibiotics takes a heavy toll on patients \n     across the nation. The World Health Organization (WHO) \n     estimates that 14,000 Americans per year, or one American \n     every 38 minutes, die from drug-resistant infections. The \n     financial burden of antibiotic resistance is also staggering. \n     WHO estimates that the United States spends $10 billion a \n     year treating antibiotic-resistant infections--and this \n     burden will grow heavier as more and more microbes become \n     resistant. To meet the grave and growing problem of \n     antimicrobial resistance, the provisions under Title I:\n       Directs HHS to conduct a nationwide campaign to educate \n     patients and doctors about the appropriate use of \n     antibiotics;\n       Authorizes HHS initiatives to monitor and contain the \n     spread of resistant microbes;\n       Authorizes grants for public health agencies to combat \n     antimicrobial resistance;\n       Establishes demonstration grants for hospitals and clinics \n     to promote the judicious use of antibiotics and to control \n     the spread of resistant infections.\n     Protecting the Public Health Against Bioterrorist Attacks\n       The Office of Emergency Preparedness estimates that 40 \n     million Americans could die if a terrorist released smallpox \n     into the population. An Anthrax attack could kill 10 million \n     people. The nation must be prepared to resist these threats \n     as vigorously if they were an invading army. To enhance the \n     ability of the nation's public health agencies to respond to \n     acts of bioterrorism against the civilian population, the \n     provisions under Title I:\n       Establishes grants to train health care professional in \n     recognizing and treating illnesses caused by such attacks;\n       Improves coordination among federal agencies to develop \n     public health countermeasures against bioterrorism, such as \n     stockpiles of necessary drugs; and\n       Reauthorizes an existing provision that allows the \n     Secretary of HHS to protect the public health in the event of \n     a bioterrorist attack or other disease emergency.\n\n\n                TITLE II--CLINICAL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT\n\n       Clinical research is needed to translate the discoveries \n     made in the laboratory into advances in patient care. \n     Numerous reports and analyses have proven that there is \n     insufficient support for patient-oriented research in the \n     United States. Title II will address these issues by:\n       Establishing intramural and extramural clinical research \n     fellowship programs and a continuing education clinical \n     research training program at NIH.\n       Providing statutory authority to the Director of the \n     National Center for Research Resources to award grants for \n     the establishment of general clinical research centers. These \n     centers provide the infrastructure for clinical research, \n     including clinical training and career enhancement. The \n     activities of the GCRCs will be expanded through the \n     increased use of telecommunications and telemedicine.\n       Establishing the Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career \n     Development Awards. These grants support clinical \n     investigators in the early phases of their independent \n     careers by providing salary and other support for a period of \n     supervised study.\n       Establishing the Mid-Career Investigator Awards in Patient-\n     Oriented Research. These grants provide support for mid-\n     career level clinicians to allow them protected time to \n     devote to clinical research and to act as mentors for \n     beginning clinical investigators.\n       Establishing the Graduate Training in Patient-Oriented \n     Research Awards. These two-year grants provide stipend, \n     tuition, and institutional support for individuals in \n     advanced degree programs in clinical research.\n       Creating a clinical research educational loan repayment \n     program to encourage recruitment of new clinical \n     investigators.\n\n\n             TITLE III--Research Laboratory Infrastructure\n\n       The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is the principal \n     source of federal funding for medical research at research \n     institutions in the United States. The infrastructure of our \n     research institutions is central to our continued leadership \n     in medical research, but many research facilities are \n     outdated and inadequate. Future increases in federal funding \n     for the NIH must include increased support for the renovation \n     and construction of extramural research facilities and the \n     purchase of state-of-the-art laboratory instrumentation.\n       To renovate biomedical and behavioral research facilities, \n     Title III authorizes the Director of the National Center for \n     Research Resources (NCRR) at the NIH may make grants or \n     contracts to public and nonprofit private entities to expand, \n     remodel, renovate, or alter existing research facilities or \n     construct new research facilities, including centers of \n     excellence. In addition, the provision under this Title would \n     also provide grants to public and non-profit private entities \n     for the purchase of high-end, state-of-the art laboratory \n     instrumentation.\n\n\n                   TITLE IV--Cardiac Arrest Survival\n\n       More than 700 people die each day from sudden cardiac \n     arrest, but immediate medical attention could save up to 30 \n     percent of these victims through immediate medical response, \n     including defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. \n     Title VI will increase public awareness about automated \n     external defibrillators and encourage their use.\n\n             Part A--Recommendations for Federal Buildings\n\n     Placement of AEDs in Federal Buildings\n       The Secretary of HHS shall make recommendations with \n     respect to placing automated external defibrillators (AEDs) \n     in federal buildings that include procedures for:\n       Implementing appropriate nationally recognized training \n     courses in performing CPR and in using AEDs;\n       Proper maintenance and testing of the devices, according to \n     manufacturer guidelines;\n       Ensuring direct involvement of a licensed medical \n     professional and coordination with EMS in the oversight of \n     training and notification when the devices are used; and\n       Ensuring that the local EMS agent is notified regarding the \n     location and type of device.\n     Extending Good Samaritan Protections\n       This legislation establishes Good Samaritan protection for \n     any person who provides emergency medical care through the \n     use of an AED unless the person engages in willful or wanton \n     misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct or a \n     conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of \n     the victim. This legislation does not supersede any existing \n     or future law of any state.\n       Organizations that purchase for defibrillators are extended \n     the same Good Samaritan protection unless they are grossly \n     negligent or engaged in willful or wanton misconduct, if (1) \n     they have notified local emergency personnel regarding the \n     placement of the device; (2) the AED is properly maintained \n     and tested in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines; \n     and (3) employees of the acquirer who are expected users \n     received proper training.\n     Part B--Rural Access to Emergency Devices\n       This legislation is intended to improve access to automated \n     external defibrillators (AEDs) in small communities and rural \n     areas to boost the survival rates of individuals in those \n     communities who suffer cardiac arrest. In many small and \n     rural communities limited budgets and the fact that so many \n     rely on volunteer organizations for emergency services can \n     make acquisition and appropriate training in the use of these \n     life-saving devices problematic. This legislation is intended \n     to increase access to AEDs and trained local responders for \n     smaller towns and rural areas where those first on the scene \n     may not be paramedics or others who would normally have AEDs.\n       Under this legislation, the Secretary of HHS, acting \n     through the Rural Health Outreach Office of the Health \n     Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), shall award \n     grants to community partnerships consisting of local \n     emergency responders, police and fire departments, hospitals \n     and\n\n[[Page S11310]]\n\n     other community organizations to enable them to purchase AEDs \n     and to provide defibrillator and basic life support training \n     through the American Heart Association, the American Red \n     Cross, or other national recognized training courses. The \n     bill authorizes $25 million a year over three years for this \n     purpose.\n\n\n                    TITLE V--Lupus Research and Care\n\n       Lupus is a disorder of the immune system that affects \n     between 1,400,000 and 2,000,000 Americans and many more with \n     the disease are either misdiagnosed or not diagnosed at all. \n     Lupus is often life threatening and is nine times more likely \n     to affect women than men. The symptoms of lupus make \n     diagnosis difficult because they are sporadic and imitate the \n     symptoms of many other illnesses. If diagnosed properly, the \n     majority of lupus cases can be controlled with proper \n     treatment.\n       Provisions under this Title would require the Director of \n     the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and \n     Skin Diseases to expand and intensify research and related \n     activities of the Institute regarding lupus. Requires the \n     Director to coordinate such activities with similar \n     activities conducted by other national research institutes \n     and agencies of NIH; and conduct or support research to \n     expand the understanding of the causes of, and to find a cure \n     for, lupus, including research to determine the reasons \n     underlying the elevated prevalence of the disease among \n     African-American and other women. The provisions also creates \n     grants for the establishment, operation, and coordination of \n     effective and cost-efficient systems for the delivery of \n     essential services to individuals with lupus and their \n     families.\n\n\n           TITLE VI--Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention\n\n       This year 37,000 American men will die, and 179,300 will be \n     diagnosed with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of \n     cancer-related death in American men. Cancer of the prostate \n     grows slowly, without symptoms, and thus is often undetected \n     until its most advanced and incurable stage. It is critical \n     that men are aware of the risk of prostate cancer and to take \n     steps to ensure early detection.\n       The provisions under this Title expands the authority of \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to carry \n     out activities related to prostate cancer screening and \n     overall awareness and surveillance of the disease. The bill \n     also extends the authority of the National Institutes of \n     Health to conduct basic and clinical research in combating \n     prostate cancer.\n\n\n               TITLE VII--Organ Procurement and Donation\n\n       Last year, there were almost 22,000 transplants, nearly \n     double the roughly 13,000 transplants performed ten years \n     ago. Unfortunately, the demand for transplants has more than \n     tripled in the past ten years from 19,095 in 1989 to 72,255 \n     in 1999.\n       Last year, 6,125 patients were removed from the OPTN \n     waiting list due to death, an increase of over 350% in the \n     last ten years. Moreover, since 1988, 38,574 patients have \n     died before they could receive a transplant, and the yearly \n     figures only continue to increase. OPOs are organizations \n     that approach families regarding organ donation and arrange \n     transportation of organs and transplant surgery logistics. \n     (OPOs are not responsible for the allocation of organs.) Each \n     state has one or two OPOs that cover non-overlapping \n     geographic regions. Currently, OPOs must be recertified every \n     two years by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) \n     in order to qualify for Medicare reimbursement. Because \n     Medicare funds make up a large percentage of OPO budgets, \n     decertification essentially shuts down an OPO.\n       Requires HCFA to change the standards for recertification \n     to account for variation in the number of potential donors in \n     a given state, extends the current certification cycle from \n     two to four years, ensures rights of OPOs, and reinstates \n     certification for all OPOs who were decertified in April.\n       The bill also recognizes the need for increased organ and \n     tissue donation and the important role that families play in \n     the process--noting that designation as an organ donor on a \n     driver's license or similar instrument does not ensure \n     donation. The provision designates Thanksgiving as a day to \n     ``Give Thanks, Give Life'', and encourages families to use \n     the time of Thanksgiving to discuss organ and tissue donation \n     to foster informed decisions among family members if the \n     occasion to donate arises.\n\n\n         TITLE VIII--Alzheimer's Clinical Research and Training\n\n       To address the devastating disease of Alzheimer's, the \n     provisions under this Title would authorize NIH to establish \n     a program to enhance clinical research relating to the \n     treatment of individuals with Alzheimer's disease. The \n     provisions would also provide support to clinicians for \n     research, study, and practice at centers of excellence in \n     Alzheimer's disease research and treatment.\n\n\n TITLE IX--Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinical Research and Training\n\n       In an effort to develop treatment for sexually transmitted \n     diseases, the provisions under this Title would authorize NIH \n     to establish a program to enhance clinical research relating \n     to the treatment and care of individuals with sexually \n     transmitted diseases. The provisions would also provide \n     support to promising clinicians for research, study, and \n     practice at centers of excellence in sexually transmitted \n     disease research and treatment.\n\n\n                   TITLE X--Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n       Technical amendment to the Children's Health Act of 2000 \n     which corrects an inaccurate citation to a provision in the \n     Code of Federal Regulations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 21, 2000.\n\n     Re The Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Senators Bill Frist and Ted Kennedy have \n     joined in introducing a bipartisan bill that addresses a \n     pressing issue in public health. The organizations below join \n     in urging you to cosponsor S. 2731, ``The Public Health \n     Threats and Emergencies Act,'' and to support its prompt \n     passage.\n       Our nation faces grave new health threats in the 21st \n     century. New or resurgent infectious diseases, such as West \n     Nile virus, hantavirus, and Lyme disease, are on the upswing, \n     and the globalization of our economy makes the importation of \n     threatening new microorganisms highly likely. An increasing \n     number of microbes that cause serious disease have developed \n     resistance to existing antibiotics, so that formerly \n     treatable infections, such as staphylococcus and \n     tuberculosis, may rapidly become incurable. In addition, our \n     national security is directly threatened by biological \n     weapons, such as smallpox and anthrax, which could devastate \n     large populations if used for terrorism and mass destruction.\n       Our public health system, a collaboration among federal, \n     state and local governments, who must work closely with \n     private medical providers, bears the awesome responsibility \n     for protecting the population from these serious threats. \n     However, the public health system is not uniformly well \n     prepared to detect disease outbreaks rapidly or respond to \n     them effectively. Preparing our nation to address these \n     threats requires revitalizing public health agencies with \n     trained personnel, up-to-date equipment and technology, and \n     development of new systems to monitor and respond to disease.\n       The Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act authorizes \n     steps that are widely agreed to be essential to preparing for \n     new public health threats. It enjoys bipartisan support in \n     both the Senate and the House and the endorsement of leading \n     experts in public health and bioterrorism. Please co-sponsor \n     S. 2731 and enable the public health system to respond \n     effectively to deadly public health threats before they \n     strike on a widespread basis.\n            Sincerely,\n         American College of Preventive Medicine, American Lung \n           Association, American Public Health Association, \n           American Society for Microbiology, American Thoracic \n           Society, Association of American Medical Colleges, \n           Association for Professionals in Infection Control and \n           Epidemiology, Association of Public Health \n           Laboratories, Association of Schools of Public Health, \n           Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, \n           Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, Food \n           and Environment Program, Union of Concerned Scientists, \n           Infectious Disease Society of America, National \n           Association of Counties, National Association of County \n           and City Health Officials, National Association of \n           Local Boards of Health, National Association for Public \n           Health Statistics and Information Systems, National \n           Environmental Health Association, Partnership for \n           Prevention, Physicians for Social Responsibility, \n           Research! America.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Association of\n\n\n                                    American Medical Colleges,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 19, 2000.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: The Association of American Medical \n     Colleges strongly supports the Public Health Threats and \n     Emergencies Act of 2000, S. 2731. The AAMC represents the \n     nation's 125 allopathic medical schools, nearly 400 major \n     teaching hospitals and health care systems, more than 87,000 \n     faculty in 91 professional and scientific societies, and the \n     nation's 67,000 medical students and 102,000 residents.\n       This legislation is needed to strengthen the nation's \n     public health infrastructure and improve our preparedness at \n     a time when we are confronted by significant threats to the \n     health of the American people: new and reemerging infectious \n     diseases; increasing antimicrobial resistance, and the \n     growing menace of bioterrorism. We must take steps now to \n     restore and strengthen the capacity of our public health \n     system, which has been eroded by inadequate funding. This \n     legislation will provide the resources to revitalize our \n     ability to respond to these public health emergencies with \n     trained personnel, state-of-the-art equipment and technology, \n     and the development of new systems to monitor and combat \n     these deadly diseases. The bill also authorizes needed \n     funding to rebuild and remodel the facilities of the Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, this bill \n     will coordinate federal research and education efforts, and \n     provide grants to improve the capacity of institutions to \n     detect and respond to antimicrobial resistance and \n     bioterrorism.\n       We commend you and Senator Kennedy for your leadership in \n     sponsoring this legislation\n\n[[Page S11311]]\n\n     that addresses a critical set of issues affecting the health \n     and safety of the American people, and urge the Senate to \n     pass S. 2731 before the end of the current session.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jordan J.

William H. Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Kennedy: The Association of Public \n     Health Laboratories (APHL) supports S. 2731 introduced June \n     14, 2000 to amend Title III of the Public Health Services Act \n     for enhancing the Nation's capacity to address public health \n     threats and emergencies. APHL is a professional association \n     organized to promote the role and contributions of public \n     health laboratories in support of the public health \n     objectives of disease prevention and health promotion.\n       Public health laboratories represent a first line of \n     defense in the rapid recognition and prevention of the spread \n     of communicable diseases. These public health laboratories \n     provide essential services for disease surveillance and \n     prevention as well as identification of new and re-emerging \n     infectious disease agents that threaten the public's health \n     and welfare. Besides the 56 State and Territorial Public \n     Health Laboratories, and the Federal (CDC) laboratories, \n     nearly 1,000 local health departments also provide some level \n     of direct public health laboratory services.\n       All sectors of the public health infrastructure (disease \n     control and prevention, maternal and child health, \n     environmental health, epidemiology, emergency preparedness \n     and response) are critically linked to the local, state and \n     federal public health laboratory ``system''. These public \n     health laboratories provide early warning signals of health \n     risks, compile data to solve outbreak investigations, and \n     identify causes of disease to aid in treatment and \n     prevention. This leadership, through science and through \n     service, promotes health and quality of life by preventing \n     and controlling disease, birth defects, disability and death \n     resulting from interactions between people and their \n     environment. Clearly, the nation's public health laboratories \n     play a vital role in disease prevention programs and are \n     central to the national public health infrastructure. The \n     loss of these laboratories, or the diminishment of their \n     abilities, will surely create a serious public health \n     crisis.\n       As new public health challenges arise, the effectiveness of \n     the national public health system's response will depend on \n     the efficacy of public health laboratories. It is evident \n     that the advent of new or re-emerging diseases and outbreaks \n     (including West Nile Fever Virus, Hantavirus infection, HIV/\n     AIDS, Legionellosis, Lyme Disease, antimicrobial-resistant \n     communicable disease agents, genetic disorders, E. coli \n     O157:H7 infections, environmental exposures and potential \n     bioterrorism activities) presents a tremendous challenge to \n     the public health system, and particularly to public health \n     laboratories. Facing these challenges will require critical \n     development or enhancement of the functions, \n     responsibilities, staffing and capability of these \n     laboratories.\n       The public health laboratory must maintain expertise and \n     flexibility to investigate disease outbreaks; conduct special \n     disease surveillance activities; determine immunity levels \n     for a variety of vaccine preventable diseases; and to provide \n     laboratory support as part of the state's disaster \n     preparedness plan for response to emergencies. This includes \n     ensuring that a well trained and equipped cadre of personnel \n     are available to quickly respond to public health emergencies \n     and on-going laboratory surveillance activities at the local, \n     state and federal levels.\n       APHL also supports the revitalization of laboratories \n     within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \n     as an important component of this bill as these laboratories \n     have been, and will remain, a critical partner with state and \n     local laboratories in disease prevention and diagnosis.\n       We applaud the proactive stance taken through this bill to \n     evaluate and enhance the public health laboratories \n     infrastructure to protect the health and welfare of our \n     nation's population and look forward to working with you on \n     this effort. Please fell free to contact APHL's executive \n     director, Scott J. Becker, at 202-822-5227 as needed.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Ronald L. Cada, DrPH,\n     President, APHL.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Foundation for\n\n\n                                          Infectious Diseases,\n\n                                     Bethesda, MD, August 2, 2000.\n     Hon. William Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: The National Foundation for Infectious \n     Diseases (NFID) is a national, not-for-profit organization \n     whose mission is professional and public education about, and \n     support of research into the causes, treatments, and \n     prevention of infectious diseases. I am writing on behalf of \n     the NFID Board of Directors and Board of Trustees to endorse \n     S. 2731, the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of \n     2000. This bill, introduced by you and Senator Kennedy, seeks \n     to strengthen the public health infrastructure in the United \n     States by improving surveillance, recognition, treatment, \n     control, and prevention of infectious diseases. The bill \n     specifically, and importantly, singles out antimicrobial \n     resistance and bioterrorist threats, and outlines programs to \n     address these growing public health concerns.\n       As you are aware, infectious diseases now are the third \n     most common cause of death in the United States. National and \n     global infectious diseases threats continually emerge, \n     highlighted most recently by the epidemic of West Nile Virus \n     in New York City last summer. However, one need look no \n     farther than the devastating human immunodeficiency virus \n     pandemic to recognize the vulnerability of human populations \n     to emergent microbial pathogens. The alarming rise in \n     antimicrobial resistance and the possibility of bioterrorist \n     attacks upon the civilian population have increasingly \n     captured the attention of public health officials, \n     clinicians, legislative officials, and the general public.\n       It is within the context of these concerns that the NFID \n     wholeheartedly supports the efforts taken by you and Senator \n     Kennedy. Building the capacity to respond to natural and \n     intentional infectious diseases threats will require \n     substantial funding and your commitment to increase the \n     needed support is to be lauded.\n       The NFID is pleased to work with you to accomplish your \n     goals and would be happy to continue to be involved as S. \n     2731 moves forward. If I can be of assistance in the future, \n     please do not hesitate to call me at (301) 656-0003 X 13 or \n     fax at (301) 907-0878.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                         William J. Martone, M.D.,\n     Senior Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            American Society for Microbiology,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 5, 2000.\n     Hon. William Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: The American Society for Microbiology \n     (ASM), which represents over 42,000 microbiologists and \n     infectious disease experts, is writing to endorse S. 2731, \n     the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000.\n       The ASM applauds the initiative which you and Senator \n     Kennedy have taken to respond to emerging public health \n     threats, particularly the alarming trend toward antimicrobial \n     resistance among pathogenic microorganisms. Your commitment \n     to significantly strengthening the public health system to \n     respond to the potential threat of bioterrorism is very \n     reassuring for the country and the microbiological community. \n     The Society especially commends your efforts in drafting \n     legislation to increase needed support for the public health \n     needs of the nation. Public Health Agency plans to address \n     antimicrobial resistance and improve the public health \n     infrastructure urgently require additional funding to be \n     successful.\n       The ASM is pleased to work with you towards achieving this \n     goal. The ASM would like to continue to be involved in the \n     process as S. 2731 moves forward. Please do not hesitate to \n     call on the ASM at anytime. We stand ready to be of \n     assistance to you and your staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Gail H.

William Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: The American Society of Tropical \n     Medicine and Hygiene commends you and your colleague Senator \n     Edward Kennedy for introducing S. 2731, ``The Public Health \n     Threats and Emergencies Act\n\n[[Page S11312]]\n\n     of 2000,'' legislation that will bolster the public health \n     infrastructure and the national response to new and re-\n     emerging health threats.\n       The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene is a \n     professional society of 3,500 researchers and practitioners \n     dedicated to the prevention and treatment of infectious and \n     tropical infectious diseases. The collective expertise of the \n     Society is in the areas of basic molecular science, medicine, \n     vector control, epidemiology, and public health.\n       The Society believes a strong federal commitment to \n     domestic and international research, prevention and treatment \n     activities targeted towards infectious and tropical \n     infectious disease, whether naturally occurring or resulting \n     from a deliberate terrorist act, is absolutely critical to \n     protecting our nation's health and national security \n     interests. S. 2731 represents an important step in protecting \n     the public from the most serious health and security threats \n     of the 21st Century--infectious disease, antimicrobial \n     resistance, and bioterrorism--by providing resources and the \n     leadership mechanism across federal agencies to launch a \n     comprehensive, coordinated attack against these killers.\n       The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene \n     strongly supports S. 2731 and looks forward to working with \n     you to advance this initiative and pursue additional \n     prevention strategies to control these health threats from \n     exacting a greater burden on domestic and global health.\n       Thank you for your ongoing efforts to address these \n     critical public health issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Dyann F. Wirth, Ph.D.,\n     Past President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           SmithKline Beecham,\n\n                                  Philadelphia, PA, June 20, 2000.\n     Hon. William Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Frist and Kennedy: I am writing on behalf of \n     SmithKline Beecham to commend you upon introduction of your \n     legislation, ``The Public Health Threats and Emergencies \n     Act'', designed to address the threat of antibiotic \n     resistance, public health emergencies and bioterrorist \n     attacks. As emphasized this week in a new report by the World \n     Health Organization, resistance to antibiotics is increasing \n     rapidly, threatening to recreate the preantibiotic era when \n     bacterial infections killed and maimed routinely.\n       While antibiotics are a crucial tool to fighting disease, \n     it is important that they be prescribed judiciously. To this \n     end, SmithKline Beecham has worked in partnership with \n     medical and public health organizations, such as the U.S. \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in an effort to \n     ensure that antibiotics are prescribed appropriately, and \n     that attention is paid to prescribing antibiotics that are \n     most effective against the most prevalent disease-causing \n     bacteria. We note that your bill furthers this type of \n     activity by encouraging federal agencies and professional \n     organizations and societies to develop and implement \n     educational programs fostering public awareness of the threat \n     of resistance and the prudent use of antibiotics.\n       America must do its part to help preserve the effectiveness \n     of our current pharmaceutical arsenal against infection and \n     our country must quickly develop an effective strategy \n     against this growing public health threat. The Public Health \n     Threats and Emergencies Act is a major step toward \n     accomplishing this important goal. For our part, SmithKline \n     Beecham is committed to investing heavily in state of the art \n     approaches to new antibiotic discovery in order to have the \n     best possible chance of combating antibiotic resistance. We \n     feel that more needs to be done to foster research and \n     development of new lines of defense against resistance \n     microbes.\n       We look forward to working with you on this important \n     issue. I thank you for the opportunity to comment on your \n     bill, and applaud you for your initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Jean-Pierre Garnier, Ph.D.\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Public Health Improvement Act of 2000 \nwill bring far-reaching benefits to the health of millions of \nAmericans. I commend my colleagues, Senator Jim Jeffords and Senator \nBill Frist, for their leadership in bringing this important measure to \nthe Senate floor today. The leadership of our colleagues in the House \nwas also essential in developing this groundbreaking bill, and I thank \nRepresentatives Tom Bliley, John Dingell, Michael Bilirakis, and \nSherrod Brown for their dedication and skillful work in bringing this \nlegislation forward.\n  The Act will help the nation meet many of the health challenges we \nface at the beginning of the 21st century. Few of these are more grave \nthan the ominous threat of attack with a biological weapon. Like the \nlethal mushroom cloud of a nuclear bomb, a haze of anthrax spores \nreleased by a terrorist over one of our major cities could bring death \nand disease to millions of Americans. Chilling revelations from the \nformer Soviet Union and other nations have revealed extensive and \nsophisticated programs to use deadly microbes as weapons of mass \ndestruction. Just this week, we heard alarming news from Uganda about \nthe deadly outbreak of Ebola fever. Yet viruses like Ebola were a \nsubject of research in bioweapons programs whose aim was to make these \nviruses even deadlier and more contagious.\n  Senator Frist and I have held numerous hearings in the Public Health \nSubcommittee on these public health threats. Witness after witness \ntestified that the best way to defend the nation against these deadly \nbiological weapons threats is to strengthen the ability of public \nhealth agencies to respond at the local, state and national levels. \nGiven the importance of these agencies in safeguarding the health of \nthe nation, we were appalled to hear that many public health agencies \nare underfunded, ill-equipped and poorly prepared to respond to these \nmodern disease threats. In this electronic era, when we can send an e-\nmail message from Cape Town to Cape Cod in the blink of an eye, our \nnation's public health agencies often lack equipment as basic as a fax \nmachine. At a time when scientists have deciphered the entire DNA \nsequence of the human genetic code, many of the nation's public health \nlaboratories cannot conduct simple genetic tests to identify deadly \nmicrobes rapidly and accurately. Yet, in a disease emergency, swift \naction can keep a local outbreak from becoming a national epidemic. A \nfew lost hours can mean thousands more lost lives.\n  To counter the threat of infectious disease outbreaks--whether \nnaturally occurring or resulting from bioterrorist attacks--we must \nstrengthen our public health defenses. Expert testimony provided to our \ncommittee showed how much work needs to be done. We must begin by \ndefining and assessing the capacities that public health agencies need \nto fight infectious diseases. Our bill authorizes grants to these \nagencies to enable them to assess their ability to respond effectively \nto infectious disease threats.\n  Once assessments have been completed, state and local public health \nagencies will become eligible to receive grants to strengthen their \ncapacity to fight infectious disease threats. While only a few states \nthat have already completed capacity assessments will be eligible for \nthese grants in the first year of this program, more and more states \nwill become eligible in the years to come.\n  Strengthening the nation's public health agencies will also assist in \ncountering the threats posed by microbes that have become resistant to \nantibiotics. Not long ago, doctors were confident that most microbes \ncould be easily treated with antibiotics. In recent years, however, \nthis confidence has been shaken by the rise of deadly infections that \ncannot be cured by antibiotics. The World Health Organization estimates \nthat 14,000 Americans die every year from drug-resistant infections, \nand that fighting these infections costs the United States $10 billion \nper year. These figures are distressing, and they are sure to become \neven more alarming in the future, as the number of resistant infections \nincreases.\n  We must clearly do more to halt that upward spiral. If we act now to \ncontain the spread of antibiotic resistance, we can buy enough time for \nnew antibiotics to be developed that provide additional defenses \nagainst microbes that are becoming increasingly resistant to the \ncurrent generation of drugs. This legislation supports efforts to use \nexisting drugs more carefully, monitor drug-resistant infections more \ndiligently, and conduct research to find the next generation of \nantimicrobial treatments.\n  The existing interagency task force on antimicrobial resistance has \nmade a good start in tackling these problems. This group has carefully \nbrought together federal agencies with special responsibilities in \nareas related to antimicrobial resistance, and has sought the advice of \nexperts in formulating its Action Plan. Our legislation provides \nstatutory authorization for this task force to continue its essential \nwork. The activities already underway or planned by the task force will \ndo much\n\n[[Page S11313]]\n\nto invigorate federal efforts to fight antimicrobial resistance, and \nour committee will watch carefully to make sure that these promising \nplans are translated into effective action.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has a special responsibility to \nprotect the public from the growing threat of drug-resistant microbes \nin our nation's food supply. Numerous scientific studies have provided \ncompelling evidence that there is a link between the overuse of \nantibiotics in food animals and the alarming increase in drug-resistant \nmicrobes found in meat and poultry. The FDA deserves credit for \ncarefully gathering information about the risk of using antibiotics in \nfood animals. The agency now has an opportunity to act decisively on \nthis information, by setting regulatory thresholds for the presence of \ndrug-resistant microbes in food at levels which will protect the public \nhealth. Both consumers and producers will benefit if the nation can be \nassured that its food supply is safe and uncontaminated. I am sure that \nmany members of our committee and our colleagues in Congress will pay \nclose attention to the decisions that the FDA makes on this important \nissue in the months to come.\n  Countering emerging public health threats is only one part of this \nimportant legislation. The Act also includes important provisions to \nstrengthen clinical research. These provisions, which the Senate \napproved last November as the Clinical Research Enhancement Act, will \nbegin to reverse the alarming decline in the number of health \nprofessionals who conduct research directly related to the needs of \npatients. These provisions will also provide clinical researchers with \nthe facilities they need to conduct their important work.\n\n  Numerous expert reports and analyses have proven that support for \npatient-oriented research is inadequate in the United States. Too \noften, talented health professionals are deterred from careers in \nclinical research because of inadequate grant funding or the extreme \nfinancial pressure of high educational debt. In addition, there are too \nfew clinical research centers which conduct high quality patient-\noriented research. The Act addresses these deficiencies by authorizing \ngrants for clinical researchers throughout their careers, by providing \nrelief from the education debt burden that keeps many health \nprofessionals from pursuing careers in clinical research, and by \nauthorizing grants to establish general clinical research centers.\n  This legislation is not intended to single out any individual area of \nmedical research for special study or emphasis. Instead, it provides \nbroad support for clinical research so that clinical researchers can \npursue whichever avenues of medical research have the greatest medical \nneed or offer the most promising opportunities. In introducing and \npassing this legislation, it is our strong view that awards under the \nAct should be granted to investigators who show the greatest promise \nand who are conducting research of the greatest scientific or health \nvalue, regardless of the specific diseases or conditions they may be \nstudying.\n  The Clinical Research Enhancement Act will bear fruit now and in the \ncoming years as new medical advances move more rapidly from the \nlaboratory of the researcher to the bedside of the patient. The skill \nand dedication of the nation's clinical researchers deserve this \nsupport, and it is long overdue.\n  The Act will also revitalize the nation's biomedical research \nfacilities. Continued progress in medicine depends on modern and well-\nmaintained research facilities--yet the nation's basic biomedical \nresearch facilities are in an alarming state of disrepair. To restore \nand rebuild the nation's biomedical research infrastructure, the Act \nincorporates the provisions originally passed in the Senate last year \nas the Twenty-First Century Research Laboratories Act. I commend \nSenator Harkin for his leadership on these needed provisions. I also \ncommend our colleague, Representative Michael Bilirakis, for \nintroducing and championing this legislation in the House.\n  Earlier this year, the National Science Foundation conducted a \ncomprehensive study of the nation's research facilities. The shocking \nfacts uncovered by the analysis demonstrate the need for this important \nlegislation. Over 60 percent of the universities and research \ninstitutions studied by the NSF had inadequate laboratory space in the \nbiomedical sciences. The NSF found that 5 percent of the laboratory \nspace at the nation's research institutions is in such poor condition \nthat it needs immediate replacement. An additional 18 percent--or 4.6 \nmillion square feet of lab space--needs major repairs and renovations. \nFunding for such construction has not kept pace with the significant \nbudget increases provided to the NIH in recent years. As a result, 54 \npercent of all research institutions have had to defer needed \nconstruction for research and development due to insufficient funding, \nresulting in a backlog of more than $2.1 billion in deferred \nconstruction.\n\n  Funding from state, local and institutional sources can meet a \nsignificant proportion of this shortfall. But federal resources are \nneeded too, to revitalize the nation's biomedical research \nlaboratories. Under this legislation, NIH will be authorized to provide \nmerit-based grants for construction or revitalization of essential \nlaboratory facilities.\n  The Act also authorizes grants to institutions to purchase the \nsophisticated scientific instruments that are increasingly required to \nconduct top quality biomedical research. As scientists learn more and \nmore about the fundamental processes of life, advances in research rely \nincreasingly on complex and expensive scientific instruments. In a \nmatter of moments, an advanced DNA sequencer can find out vital \ninformation about the genes that affect health and disease. New \nmicroscopes and imaging devices can provide snapshots inside the body \nor within a single cell.\n  The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology \nrecently released a detailed survey about the needs of the nation's \nbiomedical research institutions for scientific equipment. Over 80 \npercent of NIH grant recipients believed that shared scientific \nequipment and core facilities are essential to their research--but more \nthan half felt that NIH's grant support is inadequate for purchases of \nthis needed equipment. Future progress in medicine will increasingly \ndepend on sophisticated and expensive equipment. Congress has a \nresponsibility to accelerate this progress by providing adequate \nfederal support for equipment.\n  The Act also includes the House-passed Lupus Research and Care \nAmendments of 2000. These provisions authorize new resources for lupus \nresearch and new programs for treating this cruel disease. Lupus \ndisproportionately affects women, and it affects African-American women \nin particular. Patients with lupus suffer a debilitating variety of \nsymptoms that include inflammation of the joints, kidney failure, \npainful skin rashes, neurological impairments and many other painful \nconditions. While lupus is rarely fatal, it can often result in a \nlifetime of pain or disability for persons with the disease. There is \nno known cure for lupus, but the Act will advance our understanding of \nthis disease, and provide assistance to persons who suffer from its \nconsequences.\n  The Act will also improve the treatment and detection of prostate \ncancer, by incorporating the provisions of the Prostate Cancer Research \nand Prevention Act that was passed by the Senate last November. Too \noften, men with prostate cancer go untreated because they fail to take \nadvantage of screening procedures that detect the early symptoms of \nthis deadly disease. Early detection is the key to surviving prostate \ncancer, and these provisions will assist the efforts of the Department \nof Health and Human Services to promote widespread screening for \nthis disease.\n\n  The Act also reflects the nation's commitment to improving the \ntreatment and understanding of Alzheimer's disease and sexually \ntransmitted diseases, by authorizing fellowships for clinical \nscientists conducting research in these areas. Large numbers of \nAmericans today have friends or relatives who suffer from the \nterrifying loss of mental abilities brought on by Alzheimer's disease. \nWe have made a significant investment in basic research, and we must \nensure that the new treatments produced by research are brought rapidly \nto patients suffering from this disease. I commend my colleague from \nMassachusetts, Representative Ed Markey, for introducing the \nAlzheimer's Clinical Research and\n\n[[Page S11314]]\n\nTraining Awards Act of 2000, which has been incorporated into this Act. \nThis measure authorizes clinical research awards to health \nprofessionals for research, study and practice at centers of excellence \nfor Alzheimer's disease research and treatment. The Act includes a \nsimilar provision to increase support for health professionals engaged \nin clinical research on sexually transmitted diseases, which will \nimprove the understanding and treatment of these disorders.\n  Taken together, the provisions of the Public Health Improvement Act \nof 2000 will improve the lives of millions of Americans and help \nsafeguard the nation's health in the years ahead. This significant \nlegislation will help revitalize the capacity of the nation's public \nhealth agencies to respond effectively to public health emergencies, \nsuch as infectious disease outbreaks or bioterrorist attacks. It will \nhelp bridge the gap between discoveries made in the laboratory and \nimprovements in patient care by providing new support for talented \nhealth professional to pursue careers in patient-oriented clinical \nresearch. This legislation will help rebuild the nation's laboratory \ninfrastructure, which is in an alarming state of decay and disrepair. \nThe Act also gives new emphasis to research into the causes and \ntreatment of lupus, prostate cancer, Alzheimer's disease and sexually \ntransmitted diseases. The Public Health Improvement Act of 2000 can \nhelp lay a firm foundation for more effective public health in a wide \nvariety of areas, and I urge my colleagues to approve this much needed \nlegislation.\n\n\n                          amending section 319\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Public Health Improvement Act of 2000 \nincorporates provisions that I originally introduced with my colleague, \nSenator Kennedy, as the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act. The \nAct reauthorizes and amends Section 319 of the Public Health Service \nAct. This Section reauthorizes the ``Public Health Emergency Fund,'' \nfrom which the Secretary of Health and Human Services may expend funds \nin the event of a public health emergency. The Public Health Emergency \nFund is a separate and distinct fund from the existing Public Health \nand Social Services Emergency Fund, which is now used to fund other \nprograms within the Department of Health and Human Services. It is our \nintent that the provisions of Section 319 of the Public Health Service \nAct apply to the Public Health Emergency Fund, and not to the Public \nHealth and Social Services Emergency Fund.\n  Since public health emergencies may present unanticipated costs, the \nsponsors of the Act did not specify a dollar amount in authorizing \nappropriations for the Public Health Emergency Fund. However, we \nbelieve that a fund should exist from which expenditures can be made in \nthe event of a public health emergency and appropriations made \naccordingly, so that monies need not be diverted from existing programs \nwhen emergencies arise, as is often now the case.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my colleague, Senator Frist, for his thoughtful \nremarks regarding the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act, and I \nagree with them strongly.\n\n\n                      weapons of mass destruction\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee in a brief colloquy to clarify \nlanguage in the Public Health Improvement Act of 2000 as it pertains to \npublic health countermeasures to a bio-terrorist attack.\n  I commend my colleague for bringing such an important measure to the \nSenate floor. His legislation addresses several weaknesses that persist \ntoday in the pre-crisis and consequence management phases of an attack \nby a terrorist using a weapon of mass destruction, WMD. Since the end \nof the cold war, our nation has strived to address how we might cope \nwith an event the likes of which we have never seen on our soil; an \nevent that could easily produce thousands of civilian casualties. To \nthis end the government has taken some steps to train responders, \nprovide them needed equipment, and in rare cases created exercises to \ntest systems and response capabilities. The nation is making strides, \nand government is spending billions on all sorts of related programs. \nYet, I think we remain adrift and ill-prepared to address both the \ncause and effect of a WMD event, particularly one involving a \nbiological weapon.\n  American's Public Health system is second to none. It has the \ninherent capacity to thoroughly plan, properly train, and expertly \nexecute tasks associated with a crisis. My colleague's experience in \nthe field of medicine takes the need for planning and training for a \nbio-terrorist event to the next level by requiring the establishment of \ntwo interagency working groups. Each is designed to bring the expertise \nresident in the government today forward in a constructive manner which \nwill allow agencies to set in motion processes that will result in \nincreased planning, preparedness and most importantly response.\n  One of the failures of WMD programs found elsewhere in the nation and \nelsewhere in the government is the unnecessary proliferation of new \nbureaucracies created to manage new programs, grants, and training \nprograms at the expense of producing qualified graduates. Therefore, I \nbelieve in this instance that it is extremely important to use existing \nPublic Health Service training facilities, particularly those with WMD \ntraining programs in place whenever practical to respond to the \ntraining needs of medical professionals outlined in this legislation. \nDoes the Senator from Tennessee agree that these PHS facilities, which \nalready have the infrastructure in place to implement weapons of mass \ndestruction training and related activities, should be considered as an \neligible applicant of any grants or new training initiatives initiated \nby the Secretary?\n  Mr. FRIST. The Senator from Alabama is correct. Using current \nfacilities and training programs would provide our health care \nprofessionals the most efficient way of training as many medical \npersonnel as possible in the shortest amount of time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleague for \nhis hard work on this issue. I, too, look forward to working with my \nfriend from Tennessee and other colleagues on this important \nissues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/28/senate-section/article/S11314-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11314-S11315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UPCOMING ELECTION AND THE FEDERAL COURTS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is not often that the President of the \nUnited States, the editorial board of the Washington Times, People for \nthe American Way and Gary Bauer all agree. They all do about the \nimportance of the upcoming election to the rights of Americans in the \ndecades ahead because of its impact on the third branch of the Federal \nGovernment, our federal judiciary.\n  This first national election of this new century will give the \nAmerican people a choice--a clear choice for President and for \nCongress. Also at stake is the third branch of our Federal Government, \nthe judiciary. It is this branch of government, headed by the Supreme \nCourt, that is the guardian of our rights under the Constitution.\n  The next President is likely to nominate not only the next Justice on \nthe United States Supreme Court, but possibly as many as four of the \nnine members of the Supreme Court over the course of his term. The next \nSenate will be called upon to vote to confirm or reject the President's \nnominations to the Supreme Court and the federal courts throughout the \ncountry.\n  These are the judges who can give meaning to the Bill of Rights in \ncases they decide every day or who can take away our rights and the \nauthority of our elected representatives and impose their own narrow \nview of our Constitution. The rights of free speech, to practice any \nreligion or no religion as we choose, the right to be treated equally \nby the government, the right to privacy and a woman's right to choose \nare fundamental rights that require constant vigilance and protection. \nThis new century will pose challenges to our fundamental rights. Will \nwe have a President and a Senate who will combine to provide judges to \nprotect those rights, or ideologues who will erode them?\n  Nothing is more sharply at stake this November than the future of our \nconstitutional rights.\n  Five-to-four--five-to-four is how closely the Supreme Court is now \ndividing on fundamental issues. One or two votes on the Supreme Court \ncan, for the next half century, tip the balance away from the right to \nchoose,\n\n[[Page S11315]]\n\naway from rights of privacy, away from equal rights and toward \ngovernment establishment of religion and government orthodoxy over free \nexpression. One or two votes could make it much harder to protect the \nenvironment or pass meaningful campaign finance reform.\n  This last year by a five-to-four majority the Supreme Court held that \na rape victim can bring no claim in federal court and that Congress was \nwrong to provide that remedy in the Violence Against Women Act. By \nfive-to-four majorities the Supreme Court held that state employees \nhave no rights to be paid for overtime work and have no protection from \nage discrimination, in spite of the laws passed by Congress. What will \nthis mean for other laws prohibiting discrimination in the workplace, \nregulating wages and hours and health and providing safety standards \nfor working Americans? And by a mere five-to-four vote, the Supreme \nCourt decided that a Nebraska law imposed an undue burden on a woman's \nright to choose when it sought to prohibit medical procedures by vague \nlanguage and without regard to the health of the woman.\n  I am confident that Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will nominate women and \nmen who understand the proper role of judges as protectors of our \nrights and the proper limits on judicial power. On Tuesday evening the \nPresident of the United States spoke about the importance of the \nelection to the Supreme Court, to the federal courts generally, to our \nrights and to the distribution of power in our country. The President \nnoted that ``the American people will make a decision in this election \nwhich will shape the Supreme Court and the other federal courts, and \nthe range of liberty and privacy, and the range of acceptable national \naction for years to come'' and that ``whether we have a new form of \nultra-conservative judicial activism that rejects the government's \nauthority to protect the rights of our citizens and interests of our \ncitizens'' is at stake in the November election. As the President \nexplained:\n\n       Now we're just a vote or two away from reversing Roe v. \n     Wade in the United States Supreme Court, and I think it's \n     inevitable that the next President will have two appointments \n     to the Supreme Court, could be more. Beyond that, as I \n     intimated in my opening remarks, there has already been a \n     majority in this Court for restricting the ability of \n     Congress, even a bipartisan majority in Congress, to get the \n     states to help implement public interest legislation that \n     protects people.\n\n  There is much at state in the next election and in the appointment of \nour Supreme Court Justices and other federal judges. In June, the \nPeople for the American Way Foundation published an extensive report \ncalled ``Courting Disaster: How a Scalia-Thomas Supreme Court Would \nEndanger Our Rights and Freedoms'' that considered the future makeup of \nthe Supreme Court and its likely effects on our fundamental rights. In \nhis message accompanying that report, Ralph Neas observed:\n\n       The United States Supreme Court is just one or two new \n     Justices away from curtailing or abolishing fundamental \n     rights that millions of Americans take for granted.\n\n  The Washington Times lead editorial on Thursday noted pointedly:\n\n       Before the Supreme Court could overturn Roe vs. Wade, it \n     would take the appointment of two pro-life justices to \n     replace two pro-choice jurists--and their successful \n     confirmation in what would undoubtedly be among the most \n     explosive battles in U.S. Senate history.\n\n  Mr. Bauer made much the same point in a recent appearance on NBC's \nToday Show, in which he said: ``I think if Governor Bush gets to put a \ncouple of justices on the court, we will be more likely to protect our \nunborn children under the Constitution.''\n  The Republican party platform talks of ideological litmus tests for \njudges and the end of a woman's right to choose. The Republican \ncandidate for President says that his models for judicial nominees are \nthe most conservative current Justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence \nThomas. If they formed the majority in the years ahead, our rights \nwould be greatly diminished, protections approved by Congress would be \nroutinely invalidated and our Constitution would be harshly \nreinterpreted.\n  While the other party's platform is filled with calls for rewriting \nthe Constitution, we Democrats seek to preserve the Constitution and \nprotect our fundamental rights as the guaranties of our freedoms. While \nthe Republican Senate has delayed and dissembled over judicial \nnominations during the last six years--to the point that the Chief \nJustice of the United States chastised them for refusing to vote up or \ndown--Vice President Gore, Senator Daschle and I have pressed for \naction on outstanding judicial nominees, including historic levels of \nwomen and minorities.\n  While Republican Senators all voted lockstep against the confirmation \nof the first African-American Justice on the Missouri Supreme Court to \nbecome a federal judge, Democrats voted for Ronnie White of Missouri, \nfor Richard Paez and Marsha Berzon of California, for Sonia Sotomayor \nof New York, for Julio Fuentes of New Jersey, and for Barbara Lynn and \nHilda Tagle of Texas.\n  While the Republican leadership of the Congress sought to intimidate \nfederal judges, Vice President Gore and Democrats have been working for \nfair up or down votes on the nominations of qualified women and \nminorities such as Enrique Moreno of Texas, Judge James Wynn of North \nCarolina, Roger Gregory of Virginia, Judge Helene White and Kathleen \nMcCree Lewis of Michigan, Judge Legrome Davis of Philadelphia, Dolly \nGee of California, and Rhonda Fields of the District of Columbia.\n  While the Republican candidate for President made a fine statement in \nwhich he called for votes on judicial nominations within 60 days, he \nhas not prevailed upon the Senate Republican majority to treat nominees \nfairly now. Instead of 60 days, we see Judge Helene White's nomination \nto the Sixth Circuit pending more than 1400 days; Elena Kagan, U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia, pending 500 days; Judge \nJames Wynn, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, pending more \nthan 440 days; Kathleen McCree Lewis, U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSixth Circuit, pending more than 400 days; Enrique Moreno, U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, pending more than 400 days; Bonnie \nCampbell, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, pending more \nthan 240 days; Roger Gregory, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit, pending more than 115 days; Lynette Norton, U.S. District \nCourt for the Western District of Pennsylvania, pending more than 1300 \ndays; Judge Legrome Davis, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District \nof Pennsylvania, pending more than 800 days; Patricia Coan, U.S. \nDistrict Court for the District of Colorado, pending more than 500 \ndays; Dolly Gee, U.S. District Court for the Central District of \nCalifornia, pending more than 500 days; Rhonda Fields, U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Columbia, pending more than 350 days; Linda \nRiegle, U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, pending more \nthan 180 days; Ricardo Morado, U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of Texas, pending more than 165 days. The Senate is adjourning \nleaving 33 judicial nominees whose nominations have been pending \nwithout Senate action for more than 60 days.\n  And while the Republican majority in the Senate refused for over \nthree years to vote up or down on the confirmation of Bill Lann Lee to \nhead the Civil Rights Division, this outstanding American continued to \ndo his job on behalf of all Americans. With Vice President Gore's \nsupport, this Senate slight has finally been made right by the recess \nappointment of the first Asian-Pacific American to lead the Civil \nRights Division.\n  The election next month presents a clear choice. The choice the \nAmerican people make will determine what kind of judges sit on the \nSupreme Court and on federal courts all across the country. Those \nelected by the American people in November will select the judicial \nguardians of our liberties and the enforcers of our constitutional \nprotections next year and in the decades to come. The future for our \nchildren and grandchildren hangs in the balance. I am proud that to \nsupport Al Gore and Joe Lieberman. They will nominate judges who \nunderstand the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/28/senate-section/article/S11315-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11315-S11316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Kelaher, one of its reading clerks,\n\n[[Page S11316]]\n\nannounced that the House has passed the following joint resolution, in \nwhich it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.
