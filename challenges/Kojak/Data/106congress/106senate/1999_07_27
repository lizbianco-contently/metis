Mr. President, during the course of this week, we will \ndebate in this Chamber one of the most important issues in terms of the \nfuture of our economy.\n  Most of us can remember it was not that many years ago that the \nFederal budget was swimming in red ink. My Republican colleagues came \nto the floor of this Senate 2 years ago begging for the passage of a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. They were so distraught \nand despondent over deficits that they said the only way to bring this \nHouse into order was for us to have the Federal courts impose their \nwill on Congress: The Federal courts must stop Congress from \nspending. The so-called balanced budget amendment failed by one vote. \nThere were great tears shed on the floor of the Senate by Republican \nMembers and even a few on the Democratic side that we had missed the \nopportunity to end the era of deficits.\n\n  Barely 24 months later and how this world has changed. We are now in \nthe world of surpluses, or at least anticipated surpluses. President \nClinton's deficit reduction plan of 1993 accounts for about 80 percent \nof this deficit reduction and surplus creation, and the other part came \nfrom bipartisan agreements since that time.\n  My Republican colleagues have shifted from this debate about amending \nthe Constitution, saying we are so awash with money in Washington that \nwe have surpluses to be given back to\n\n[[Page S9316]]\n\npeople in the form of tax breaks, primarily for the wealthiest of \nAmericans.\n  Many on the Democratic side take a more conservative view. It is \nhard, I am sure, for our Republican friends to stomach this, but we are \nthe conservative party when it comes to fiscal issues because we \nbelieve if there is to be a surplus, it should be dedicated first to \nmaking certain Social Security is strong for decades to come; second, \nto make certain Medicare receives an infusion of capital so we don't \nsee an increase in premiums or a reduction in services; and third and \nmost important, buy down the national debt.\n  We can speculate for hours on end on the floor of the Senate about \nthe state of America and its economy. However, certain things are \nobvious. We have more than $5 trillion in national debt that costs $1 \nbillion a day in interest. We have a Social Security system that needs \nmoney. We have a Medicare system that does, as well. We should take \ncare of those three items before we go off on some lark of spending $1 \ntrillion in tax breaks for wealthy people.\n  One might expect to hear that from a Democratic Senator and expect to \nhear the opposite from a Republican Senator because that is the nature \nof this debate. I appeal to the American people to step back for a \nsecond and look for a credible, objective arbiter. Let me make a \nsuggestion: Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, who \nis credited as much as the Clinton administration with bringing about \nthe economic prosperity that has brought down inflation, increased \nemployment, increased the number of new businesses, increased housing. \nWhat does Alan Greenspan say about the $1 trillion tax cut? He says it \nis not wise, not good policy. He said there may be a time in a \nrecession when a tax cut makes sense but to put this tax break for \nwealthy people on the books now is to fuel an economy too much, to \ncreate inflationary pressure.\n  What would be the response of the Federal Reserve Board? Obviously, \nraise interest rates. What happens when interest rates are raised? The \ncost of a mortgage payment goes up for people who have an adjustable \nrate mortgage. People who have equities in mutual funds for retirement \nfind those equity values falling as interest rates go up. Chairman Alan \nGreenspan, the objective arbiter, says to the Republicans: Please, \nstop; don't do this. You are overreacting to what we hope is the good \nnews of a surplus.\n  That is the critical difference.\n  We know the Republican tax breaks are primarily geared for wealthy \npeople. We know after 5 years, the Republicans have to dip into the \nSocial Security trust fund to pay for their tax breaks. We know they \nprovide no money whatsoever for Medicare. We know that if we follow \ntheir scenario we will be forced on the floor of the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives to make dramatic cuts in education, in \nenvironmental protection, in the basics that Americans expect from our \nFederal Government.\n\n  It is a recipe for economic disaster and a recipe for fiscal \nirresponsibility.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  One of our great historians said those who don't learn the lessons of \nhistory are condemned to repeat it. We are about to repeat the same \nkind of mistake that was made 20 years ago. We have an economy that is \nmoving along smartly and well. We have inflation in check. We have job \ngrowth. Americans are prosperous and happy.\n  All of a sudden, almost with happy recklessness, the other side wants \nto blow all this up.\n  In 1981, we passed a huge dramatic tax cut. What happened? Interest \nrates went through the roof. Unemployment rates went from 4 or 5 \npercent to 7, 8, or 9 percent. Americans were out looking for work. It \ntook an entire decade to rectify that.\n  Adding insult to injury, not only is this idea reckless in terms of \nthe soundness of our economy as my colleague from Illinois has brought \nup and as Alan Greenspan stated, now we have CBO, which has always been \nknown as a bipartisan, careful agency, saying this huge tax cut is very \nwrong, as every major economist that I have read about has also stated. \nIt should be done when we move into recession if, God forbid, we do but \nnot now.\n  CBO says this balances the budget better than saving the money and \nputting it aside for debt reduction and for Medicare. The world is \nalmost being turned upside down. I plead with the CBO Director to get \nhis bearings. I have never seen CBO act in such a wild and almost \nirresponsible way.\n  We know the budget caps are going to be lifted. What did the \nRepublican leadership do in the House yesterday? They passed another \nemergency bill. Last week, the census was an emergency, not contained \nin the budget caps. This week, it was something new. Just yesterday \nthere was an emergency, another $5 billion. They are going over the \nbudget caps. CBO says they won't; it will go to debt reduction. It is \nabsolutely awful.\n  CBO is one of the few compasses we have as we sail through these new \neconomic waters. For them to get so partisan and so off base by making \nan assumption that is virtually laughable, I plead with the head of CBO \nto reexamine his statements. To say a $1 billion tax cut will reduce \nthe deficit more, or a $700 billion tax cut will reduce the deficit \nmore than a $300 billion tax cut, with most of the remainder going to \nbe put aside for debt reduction to help the Medicare system is absurd.\n  I ask the Senator from Illinois his view of what CBO is doing. When \nwe lose our moorings, when we lose our lodestars, when the whole debate \nbecomes entirely political, we are in trouble.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with my colleague from New York. We have not run \ninto such economic doubletalk and gobbledygook since the days of the \nappropriately named Laffer curve.\n  I yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator for yielding for a question. I want \nto join in on the CBO question. I have gotten to the point where I \ndon't listen to any bureaucrats. I listen to the Nobel Prize-winning \neconomists. They are saying the Republican plan is risky and dangerous. \nMany signed a letter. I am going with them.\n\n  We cannot trust the CBO anymore.\n  I want to ask my friend about the tax break and the question: Is this \nfair? The Senator has an important chart. I found out yesterday under \nthe Republican Senate plan anyone earning $1 million a year gets back \n$30,000 each and every year in a tax break, while those at the bottom \nhardly get anything.\n  I want to pose a question to my friend from Illinois. A millionaire \ngets back $30,000. That equals the average income of an average \ncitizen. In other words, a millionaire gets back as much in a tax cut \nas the average American, who gets up every day and goes to work for 8 \nhours a day, earns in a year.\n  I pose the question to my friend: Is this fair?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from California has once again \nidentified the Achilles' heel of Republican tax policy. They just \ncannot help themselves. Whenever it comes time for a tax break, they \nalways want to give it to Donald Trump. I think Mr. Trump is doing \nwell. I think Mr. Gates is doing very well. I don't think they need a \ntax break to be inspired to go to work tomorrow. The Republicans insist \nthat is the case.\n  Look what it does: For the top 1 percent of wage earners in America, \nthe Republican plan, the Republican tax breaks give an average of \nalmost $23,000 a year. Of course, for those bottom 60 percent, people \nwith incomes below $38,000 a year, they receive $139 a year.\n  The Republicans say: Wait a minute, the rich are paying all the \ntaxes; they should get the tax break; it should come back to them.\n  Yet when you look at it, they are taking them at the expense of \nworking families who are concerned about the future of Social Security, \nconcerned about the future of Medicare, and want to make certain we \nkeep up with our basic commitments to education and environmental \nprotection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the time \nextended to 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S9317]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9317-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9317-S9318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SNAKE RIVER DAMS\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Senators from the Northwest are sometimes \nfrustrated in trying to get our message across, to deliver or reflect \nthe views of our constituencies almost 3,000 miles away, and to let our \nSenate colleagues from around this country understand what it's like to \nlive in the Northwest.\n  The Northwest is known for clean air and water, a high quality of \nlife, picturesque landscapes, the beauty and majesty of the Cascade and \nOlympic Mountains, the rolling hills of the Palouse, lush wooded \nforests, sparkling lakes, a playground for backpackers, hikers and \nrecreational enthusiasts, home of America's success story--Microsoft, \nthe apple capital of the world, breadbasket to the nation, a vibrant \nsalmon fishery and home of the most wonderful people who possess a zest \nfor life and fierce instinct to preserve and protect these truly unique \nqualities of my great state of Washington and of Oregon, Idaho, and \nMontana as well.\n  Mr. President, I share the passion of my constituents. I consider it \nan honor to represent a state as great and diverse as mine. But what is \noften overlooked is the fact that our hydroelectric power system plays \na central role in keeping Pacific Northwest a clean, healthy, and \naffordable place to live, work, play, and raise a family.\n  I have come to this floor many times to explain what makes the \nNorthwest tick to my colleagues and to others unfamiliar with the \nregion. And I have been frustrated or puzzled by the reaction I get \nwhen I reflect the views of my state, and in particular, my eastern \nWashington communities.\n  We have been waging a battle with this administration, radical \nenvironmental organizations, and other dam removal advocates over the \nissue of removing Columbia-Snake River dams.\n  Advocates of dismantling our Columbia River hydro system place the \nchoice in stark terms of dams or salmon. That choice, presented in such \nterms, is false. The truth is that by applying adaptive management to \nour hydro system, we can and will preserve endangered salmon runs and \nour valuable hydro system.\n  I reject the false choice of salmon versus the Columbia hydro system. \nI believe passionately that we can and will restore a vibrant salmon \nfishery to the Columbia and that we can do so within the confines of \nthe hydro system.\n  To an outsider, one would think the administration has the momentum. \nInterior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has been a roll--tearing down dams \nfrom the California coast to Maine in the Northwest.\n  Incidentally, however, we may be a new ally in Vice President Albert \nGore. While he has been known as a removal advocate, last week, in \norder to get a photo opportunity on the Connecticut River, he had a dam \nrelease some 4 billion gallons of water in order that he could go \ncancoeing. Perhaps now we have found a new use for dams and a new ally \nin the Vice President, as long as we can offer him canoeing activities \nby releasing water.\n  Most of us in the region believe we have the facts and support on our \nside to defeat those who wish to remove the Snake River dams and \nthereby destroy a central piece of the Northwest economy and a way of \nlife for millions of Northwesterners.\n  I have asked myself--What do we have to do?\n  We can have thousands rally to ``Save Our Dams''--as we did in \neastern Washington and Oregon communities earlier this year.\n  We can have our local, State, and Federal officials unite in their \nopposition to dam removal, and we have added Governor Gary Locke and \nSenator Murray to the ranks of those opposed to removing our eastern \nWashington dams.\n  And we can have scientists, federal agencies, and even environmental \ngroups point to global warming as a major cause for salmon decline.\n  We can have the National Marine Fisheries Service scientists tell us, \nin a report released April 14, that the chance of recovery for a few \ndistinct salmon runs is only 64 percent if all four lower Snake River \ndams are removed, as against 53 percent by continuing to transport \nsmolts around the dams--a difference that is barely statistically \nsignificant.\n  And we can have recent media reports tell us that the ``Outlook is \nbright for salmon runs this year.'' In this July 12 Seattle Times \narticle, scientists and biologists are predicting a potential rebound \nin salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest. And the reasons they cite \nare: improved ocean conditions, better freshwater conditions, and \ncutbacks in fishing.\n  But still we hear the dam removal clamor from national environmental \ngroups and bureaucrats in the Clinton-Gore administration. And we have \nan energized Interior Secretary who in his words has been ``out on the \nlandscape over the past few months carrying around a sledgehammer'' \ngiving speeches saying ``dams do, in fact, outlive their function'' and \n``despite the history and the current differences over dams, Babbitt \nsaid he believes change is inevitable.'' (Trout Unlimited Speech, CQ, \nJuly 17, 1999)\n  Here I am again, to share some compelling statistics recently \nreleased by the Army Corps of Engineers that further prove that \nremoving dams in eastern Washington would be an unmitigated disaster \nand an economic nightmare.\n  Ten days ago, the Corps released three preliminary economic studies \nthat will be included in an overall Lower Snake River Juvenile Fish \nMigration Feasibility Study set for completion later this year.\n  The Corps studies quantified the economic impact of the removal of \nthe four Snake River dams as removal relates to the region's water \nsupply, navigation, and power production.\n  I simply cannot overstate the importance of these studies and what \nthey mean for the future of the Pacific Northwest, its economy and the \nlivelihood of our families and communities.\n  That is why I was surprised when there was little attention paid to \nthe release of these three studies. I can remember that as recently as \nMarch of this year when the Corps was preparing to release a study on \nrecreation benefits involving the four lower Snake River dams, \nenvironmental groups including the Sierra Club, NW Sportfishing \nIndustry Association, Trout Unlimited, and Save Our Wild Salmon were \ntremendously successful in getting the media's attention and \nsubstantial coverage of their claims that removing the four Snake River \ndams would bring a $300 million annual recreational windfall to the \nregion.\n  The environmental groups leaked the $300 million number knowing that \nthe study was incomplete, but the false information made big news. \nThen, the report was completed and the truth was told. In fact, the \nreal number, according to the Corps report is: ``Under the natural \nriver drawdown alternative, the value of recreation and tourism then \nincreased to $129 million annually, which represents an increase of \nabout $67 million per year.''\n  Why did this report, with complete analysis, receive so little \nattention:\n  I am again surprised at the lack of attention given to the results of \nthe latest three studies, which standing alone, send such a clear \nsignal to this administration, radical environmental groups, and dam \nremoval advocates everywhere that they should abandon their cause.\n  Let me share these numbers with you:\n  First, starting with power production:\n  The economic effect of breaching on the region's power supply would \nbe $251 million to $291 million a year.\n  Residential bills for Northwest families and senior citizens would \nincrease $1.50 to $5.30 per month.\n  But the region's industrial power users, which rely on cheap power to \nprovide thousands of jobs can see a monthly increase ranging from $387 \nto $1,326. Our aluminum companies would see an increase in their \nmonthly bills ranging from $222,000 to $758,000.\n  If the Snake River dams are breached, how would we replace the 1,231 \nmegawatts the dams produce annually? Keep in mind it takes 1,000 \nmegawatts to serve Seattle. The answer is, there is no cheap \nalternative. We can increase power production at thermal power plants \nor build new gas-fired combined-combustion turbine plants.\n\n[[Page S9318]]\n\n  Finally, these power estimates wouldn't be complete without reminding \nmy colleagues that last month the Administration sought to collect at \nleast $1 billion beyond normal power costs to create a `slush fund' to \nfund the removal of the four Snake river dams. I was delighted to pass \nany amendment prohibiting the Bonneville Power Administration from \nraising rates on Northwest power customers for a project they don't \neven want.\n  Second, lets look at irrigation.\n  The Corps report assumes that there is no economically feasible way \nto continue to provide irrigation to the 37,000 acres of farmland \nserved by the four Snake River dams. The report assumes 37,000 acres of \nfarmland will be taken out of production as a result of breaching those \ndams.\n  What does this loss of water supply mean for eastern Washington?\n  The loss of irrigated farmland would cost $9.2 million annually.\n  The cost to retrofit municipal and industrial pump stations would be \n$.8 to 43.8 million a year.\n  The cost to retrofit privately-owned wells would be 43.9 million \nannually.\n  In light of these sobering statistics, what options would be left for \nirrigators? The Corps estimated the economic effect on dam breaching on \nfarmland value would amount to more than $134 million. The Corps also \nconsidered ways to alter the irrigation system in order to continue to \nirrigate the 37,000 acres--to accomplish this alternative, we would \nhave to spend more than $291 million--more than the value of the land. \nOur farmers and agricultural communities are struggling enough as it \nis, and removing their ability to even water their crops puts them \nbeyond despair. Therefore, the Corps assumes this irrigated farmland \nwill disappear.\n  Lastely, let's look at transportation:\n  The Corps studied transportation impacts of breaching the four Snake \nriver dams.\n  The transportation costs resulting from breaching the four Snake \nRiver dams would rise to $1.23 per bushel from .98 cents per bushel--a \n24 percent increase.\n  The annual increase in transportation costs to the region would be \n$40 million for all commodities.\n  Breaching the four dams would remove 3.8 million tons of grain from \nthe Snake River navigation system. Of this 3.8 million, 1.1 million \nwould move to rail transportation and 2.7 million tons would move to \ntruck transportation.\n  According to the report, barge transportation of commodities on the \nSnake river limits the cost of rail transportation and truck \ntransportation. Removing competition among these types of \ntransportation could drive up costs. According to the report, barge \ntransportation has saved, on average, $5.95 in per ton when compared \nwith other transportation alternatives. ``Disturbing this competition \nwould be one of the most important regional consequences of permanent \ndrawdown.''\n  According to the Washington State Legislative Transportation \nCommittee, additional costs resulting from road and highway damage \nrange from $56 million to $100.7 million.\n  Further, it is important to note that the navigation system of the \nColumbia allows enough barge transportation that if it were destroyed, \nmore than 700,000 18-wheelers a year would be added to our already \ncongested state roads and highways to replace the lost hauling \ncapacity. (Source: Pacific Northwest Waterways Association)\n  I want to put all this together and construct a picture for you and \nwhat this scenario would mean in eastern Washington.\n  In exchange for breaching or removing the four Snake river dams, \nhere's what the citizens of the Pacific Northwest could get:\n  We would lose four dams that produce hydro-power, which emit no \npollutants into the air, for a thermal based power source that would \njeopardize the clean air unique to the Northwest and enjoyed by \ncountless residents and visitors to our state.\n  The 37,000 acres of irrigated farmland in Franklin and Walla Walla \ncounties and the hundreds of employees that help supply food to more \nthan a million people would disappear.\n  There is a likelihood that there would be a temporary loss of water \nfor well users after dam breaching due to the inability to alter well \ndepths until the actual removal of dams.\n  The increased truck traffic on our roads to haul wheat and barley to \ncoastal ports will have an adverse effect on air quality and impose an \nadditional financial burden on the family farm, which for many would be \ntoo much to bear and force them to give up their land.\n  So what do we get by removing the four Snake River dams? Shattered \nlives, displaced families and communities who will have seen their \nlivelihoods destroyed, generations of family farmers penniless, \nindustries forced to drive up consumer costs, air pollution, a desert \nthat once bloomed with agriculture products goes dry, a far less \ncompetitive Northwest economy and a Northwest scrambling to repay a BPA \ntreasury debt with less revenue, and scrambling to buy or build higher \ncost polluting sources of power.\n  So according to these three latest studies, the bottom line is that \nif we breach the four dams to increase our chances of bringing a select \nnumber of salmon runs back by only 11%, the Northwest will suffer \neconomic impacts of $299 to $342 million a year in perpetuity. This \nstaggering figure doesn't even include the estimated $1 billion it \nwould take to actually remove the dams.\n  If we remove the Snake river dams, over the next 24 years we only \nimprove our chances of recovering spring and summer chinook to the \nsurvival goals set by NMFS by 11 to 30 percent over the current system \nof barging. Over 24 years, NMFS would like to reach the survival \nstandard of returning 150 to 300 spring and summer chinook to the Snake \nRiver tributaries each year.\n  But there is something else that these numbers, studies and data \ncan't quantify:\n  What many outside the region don't understand is that the four dams \non the Lower Snake river are part of our life, heritage, and culture.\n  I repeat the call I issued last month to the administration and dam \nremoval advocates: abandon your cause and work with the region on cost-\neffective salmon recovery measures that can restore salmon runs and \npreserve our Northwest way of life.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9318-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9318-S9321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I wish to continue the line of discussion we were in \nbefore about these two alternative tax cut plans. Again, my greatest \nworry is not in how the pie is divided, although I certainly very much \ndisagree with the Republican way that is done but, rather, in the \noverall strength of our economy.\n  To put a huge tax cut in place now, at a time when inflation is low, \nunemployment is low, and jobs are being created, has the potential of \nthrowing a monkey wrench into our economy. Targeted tax cuts, things \naimed at helping middle-class people with their big financial nuts, \nwhether they be health care or college tuition or retirement--those \nmake some sense. But a huge across-the-board tax cut, in my judgment, \ncould throw the economy dramatically off kilter. Will it? No one can \npredict. But there is an old expression: If it ain't broke, don't fix \nit.\n  Our economy has been moving along well, and now, I think mainly \nbecause of some ideologues, we are being pushed to do something that \nrisks the great recovery we are now having. That is issue No. 1.\n  Issue No. 2 is saving Social Security and Medicare. Again, you cannot \nhave the money go for everything. Despite CBO's awful statements in the \nlast few days--and I will talk about those in a minute--when you have a \ndollar, you can use it for something. You can return it to the \ntaxpayers, you can spend it on a program, or you can put it away for \nsome kind of obligation that might occur later.\n  The two great obligations we have to the American people, fiscally \nspeaking, are Social Security and Medicare. If you look at this chart, \nthe Republican plan takes that Social Security surplus and makes it a \ndeficit from 2005 on.\n  How many Americans, for a quick tax cut--most of which they will not\n\n[[Page S9319]]\n\nsee because it will go, just by definition, to the highest income \nsector--would risk their Social Security for that tax cut? My argument \nis: Very few.\n  How many Americans would risk their Medicare--and, God forbid, they \nor a loved one became ill--for what have proven to be in the past \nchimerical tax cuts, things that people do not see? Very few.\n  So what we are talking about here is very simple--targeted tax cuts \nthat will help the middle class and preserve Social Security, which is \nthe plan the Democrats have put forward, or a huge tax cut, mainly \ngoing to people who are doing remarkably well at the highest end of the \nspectrum and risking Social Security and Medicare.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from New York yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to my friend from Illinois for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Over the course of the last several months we have had a \nlot of debate on the floor about a lockbox, a Republican lockbox that \nis going to protect Social Security and Medicare--lockbox, lockbox, \nlockbox. I think what we are dealing with when we look at the \nRepublican tax break bill is the Republican ``loxbox''--it smells \nfishy--because in the year 2005 they start dipping right into Social \nSecurity. They are taking money out of the Social Security surplus to \ngive tax breaks to wealthy people.\n  I ask the Senator from New York--I am sure I can speak for people \nfrom Illinois as well--as you go around the State of New York and ask \npeople what our priorities should be, if we are going to have a \nsurplus, how many of them have said to you: Well, let's give tax breaks \nto Donald Trump and let's take money out of the Social Security \nsurplus?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I say to the Senator from Illinois that, first of all, \nmy constituents say: Preserve Social Security and Medicare, No. 1; and, \nsecond, if you are going to do certain tax breaks, make them targeted \nto help the middle class, not these big across-the-board tax cuts.\n  I also say to the Senator, in certain parts of my State they would \nwant a ``loxbox,'' but in many others they would refuse that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to the Senator from California for a \nquestion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  I say to the Senator from New York, I really appreciate his \ncontribution to this debate. I always go back, in my mind, to who is \ngetting these tax cuts--the Donald Trumps, the Bill Gateses, et cetera. \nThe other chart that was used before by my friend from Illinois showed \nvery clearly that if you earn about $800,000 a year, you get back \n$22,000 a year; if you earn about $25,000 a year, you get back about \n$129.\n  I want to talk about that for a moment and ask my friend a question.\n  Mr. President, $129 is nice to have. No one would turn it away. But \nif at the same time you suddenly get a bill for $250 a month more for \nyour Medicare, because the Republican plan doesn't put a penny in for \nMedicare solvency, now you are behind the eight ball, are you not? That \n$129 you get back is gone, plus you may even have to take care of your \nparents because Medicare is not going to survive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, could he comment on the cruel irony \nof this?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I think the Senator from California \nbrings up an extremely valid point. The American people are most \nworried, not about their present tax situation, although everyone would \nlike lower taxes, no question--particularly in my State, property \ntaxes, which we have nothing to do with, are through the roof. What \nthey care about are the big financial nuts that might bother them.\n  As the Senator from California said, God forbid a parent becomes ill, \nGod forbid a spouse becomes ill, and Medicare is not there or it is so \nreduced that they have to shell out tremendous amounts of dollars from \ntheir own pocket before Medicare bites in. That is what worries people. \nThat is why, I say to the Senator, I am pushing a tuition deductibility \nproposal because the average middle-class family is doing fine, but \nwhen they get hit with these huge tuition bills, it is tough for them \nto pay.\n  One other point, which relates to what the Senator said, going back \nto what CBO has done in raiding these two plans. I want to come back to \nthis because it is so worrisome. What they have done is, they have said \na plan that cuts taxes by $700 billion reduces the deficit more than a \nplan that cuts taxes by $300 billion--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator.\n  CBO has said putting $300 billion aside for deficit reduction reduces \nthe deficit less than putting nothing aside for deficit reduction.\n  I have, in my 18 years in the House and now my 1 year in the Senate, \nalways relied on CBO as a lodestone, as a morning star--fixed, correct, \ndealing with the excesses politicians have on both sides of the aisle. \nThat has seemed to be true whether they were appointed by Democrats or \nRepublicans. For the first time, I think we are going to start doubting \nthe veracity of CBO in a significant way because they have so twisted \ntheir economic logic that economists across America are scratching \ntheir heads.\n  We need a CBO to be fair and nonpartisan. CBO is vitally important to \nus being honest in reducing the deficit; when either party does fiscal \nhi-jinks, they are called to the carpet.\n  Again, I make a plea to the CBO Director: Reconsider what you have \nsaid or, at the very least, give it a better explanation because right \nnow people who follow economics across America are scratching their \nheads and saying: What has happened? How the heck can CBO score things \nthe way they have? The only answer that seems to be available is \npolitics. That would be a shame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 20 \nminutes as in morning business or until the managers of the legislation \ncome forward and decide they want to begin the next piece of \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, before I get to the subject I wish to speak \nto, which is the nuclear test ban treaty, I will address a comment to \nmy colleague from New York, Senator Schumer.\n  I, as all Democrats and some Republicans, think a tax cut should be \nprogressive and equitable. To tell you the truth, I would like to be in \na position to give the wealthy a tax cut if that were the case. That \nwould be fine as long as we first gave the tax cut to the poor and the \nmiddle class.\n  I was speaking to the Senator from Illinois a moment ago. In my \nState, which has, as all of our States, very wealthy individuals, I \nfound an interesting phenomenon. Given a choice, if you go back to my \nState and ask anybody who made $1 million last year or is likely to \nmake one next year, and said: We can continue the economy to grow the \nway it has the last 7 years, or give you a $30,000 tax cut a year, \nthere isn't any question what they choose. They say: Whoa, leave well \nenough alone. I am making a lot more than $30,000 a year in the market. \nI am making a lot more than $30,000 a year in my investments. I am \nmaking a lot more than the $30,000 a year I would get in the tax cut \nfrom the lower interest rates. I am making a lot more.\n  How many times have we heard the only thing that has remained \nconstant in this changing economic environment over the last decade is \ntax cuts are a stimulus? We have one guy sitting at the helm. His name \nis Greenspan. He has been doing everything but taking an ad in the New \nYork Times to say: Whatever you all do, if this economy heats up, if \nyou stimulate this economy, I am telling you what I am\n\n[[Page S9320]]\n\ngoing to do; I am going to raise interest rates.\n  He hasn't used those exact words, but the market responds to every \nword he says.\n  I don't know anybody who thinks that if there were almost an $800 \nbillion tax cut, we are not going to have interest rates raised.\n  I don't understand the math. To be more crude about it, I don't even \nunderstand the politics. It used to be good politics for our Republican \nfriends to try to paint us into a corner and say: We are for tax cuts; \nDemocrats are not for tax cuts ever. Therefore, Democrats are big \nspenders; therefore, we are good guys. Therefore, vote for us.\n  I understand that. We do the same thing with them on Social Security. \nWe assume no Republican can be devoted to Social Security, and they \nassume no Democrat could ever want a tax cut. That is politics. I \nunderstand that.\n  The part I don't understand is to whom they are talking. Even their \nvery wealthy constituency--not all wealthy people are Republicans, but \nit tends to be that way--is saying: Hey, go slow here.\n  I hear the name of Bill Gates thrown around and others such as Gates. \nThey are an aberration even among the wealthy. But the wealthy in my \nState, if they could pick any one thing out of the Roth tax proposal, I \nknow what it would be. It would be the elimination of the inheritance \ntax. There are only about 820,000 people in all of America who would be \naffected by it, but that is something--I happen to disagree with them--\nthat is a big deal. That is a big-ticket item. That is worth a lot more \nthan 30,000 bucks, but that is not the thing that would fuel a heated \nup economy. I am not proposing that. I am trying to figure out the \npolitics.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to yield.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I think the Senator makes a very good point. Our No. 1 \nargument is the one the Senator made. It is not middle class versus \nwealthy. It is not redistribution. That is an argument.\n  The No. 1 argument is a very simple one: The economy is doing \nremarkably well. The people at the highest end of the economic spectrum \nhave benefited the most. That is how it usually is in America. And here \nwe are, everything is going along nicely, interest rates are low, \nfueling economic growth, allowing people to buy homes, allowing people \nto take second mortgages so they can buy other things. We are going to \nchange conditions so that Alan Greenspan would be more likely to have \nto raise interest rates. And he, a Republican conservative, fiscal \nwatchdog, says: Don't do it. And we are proceeding headlong into a wall \nto do it.\n  The Senator from Delaware has asked an excellent question: What is \nmotivating this? I think it is leftover politics from the early 1980s.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I think that is right.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. There is a view, first, that Democrats haven't learned \nour lesson, which we have since 1994, which is we can't spend on \neverything we want to, even though we would want to. What we have \nproposed doing with this money is not spending most of it on new \nprograms but putting the vast proportion away into Social Security and \nMedicare and reducing the deficit.\n  Second, it is based on the theory that the tax system is out of \nwhack. When you look at it, the percentage of tax paid is going down; \nthe economy is moving. It is almost ``Alice in Wonderland.'' So I think \nthe Senator from Delaware makes an excellent point. Whether you believe \nin the politics of redistribution or not--and there is a division in \nthis country, in this body, and in our party, as a matter of fact--even \nif you don't, this tax cut, so massive, so much risking the monkey \nwrench being thrown in the economic engine that is purring smoothly, is \na real risk.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I would like to make an \nobservation or a comment. I heard some of our Republican friends use \nthe old phrase ``if it's not broken, don't fix it.'' They can't stand \nstatus quo. I think they can't stand the fact that it is happening on \nDemocrats' watch. I think part of the problem is they have to say \nsomething. It is similar to cops, the very thing they said would not \nwork. It was terrible what Charlton Heston--or ``Moses'' Heston--said. \nThey are going to have 100,000 social workers.\n  Regarding the deficit reduction package in 1994, every Republican \nleader stood up and said this will mean chaos, recession, loss of world \nstature, et cetera, et cetera. They turned out to be wrong; these \nthings are working. Cops are making the crime rate go down. The deficit \nreduction package worked. We are now in a position where we are doing \nbetter than ever. It is as if they have to have something. We \npoliticians, I know, sit there and say if the other party does \nsomething, or my opponent does something, and it works, instead of \nsaying it is working, we have to think of something better.\n  I think the public is prepared to give everybody credit. Everybody \ndeserves credit. The people who deserve the most credit are the people \nin the business community because of their productivity and the way \nthey trimmed down. I can't figure it out. For the first time in my 27 \nyears as a Senator, this seems to fly in the face of the orthodoxy of \nthe Republican Party. I mean, if you had said to me 15 years ago--first \nof all, I would not have believed what I am about to say. But if you \nsaid to me 15 years ago: Joe, in 1999, you are going to be standing on \nthe floor of the Senate, and one of the choices you are going to \nparticipate in making is not whether or not we balance the budget but \nwhether we take money and reduce the accumulated national debt or give \na tax cut, first of all, I would not have believed that option would be \navailable. I would not have believed we would be in that position. \nForget, for a moment, the two pillars: Social Security and Medicare. \nLeave them aside for a moment. I would have said: First of all, it \nwon't happen. But if it does, on the idea of reducing the national \ndebt, in every basic economics course you took when you were a freshman \nin college, they said if you can ever reduce the national debt, the \nimpact upon interest rates, the impact upon home rates, the impact upon \nthe economy would be incredible.\n\n  And then, if you asked me: OK, what do you think the Republican Party \nwould do? I would say that is easy. They would reduce the debt. These \nare the pay-as-you-go guys, the guys who say pay off your debts. These \nare the guys who had a clock ticking in your city, in Time Square, or \ndown by the railroad station, Penn Station, a big clock, saying the \nnational debt is going up. It was paid for, I suspect, by some wealthy \nRepublican. So the clock was ticking. And not only have we stopped the \ngrowth of the debt, but it is ticking in a way that we can have those \nnumbers go in reverse.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I am sure the \nSenator from Delaware remembers 2 years ago on the floor of the Senate \nour despondency over the deficits, which led some Members on the \nRepublican side to call for a constitutional amendment to balance the \nbudget, where the Federal courts would force Congress to stop spending. \nWe were so despondent that we were going to really change the \nconstitutional framework. That failed by one vote.\n  Two years later--the Senator from Delaware is right--somehow or \nanother, the Republican Party is searching for its roots and searching \nfor its identity. It has now gone beyond the era of Gingrich and Dole, \nand it is trying to find out what it stands for anymore. As the Senator \nfrom Delaware said, they used to stand for fiscal conservatism. We have \na trillion-dollar tax cut, primarily for the wealthiest people, that \nwill divert funds that could be spent to retire the national debt, a \ndebt of over $5 trillion, which costs us a billion dollars a day in \ninterest. We collect taxes from American families--payroll taxes--for a \nbillion dollars a day in interest.\n  Would the Republicans join the Democrats and say our first priority \nis to eliminate this debt? No. Instead, they are saying our first \npriority is tax breaks for the higher income individuals, which could \nendanger the economy.\n  I think this Republican Party is searching for identity. I think the \nDemocrats have a situation that I would like to test in an election. If \nthis were a referendum, as in parliamentary forms of government, I \nwould like to take this question to the American people: Do you want a \ntrillion-dollar\n\n[[Page S9321]]\n\ntax break for the wealthiest people over the Democratic approach to \ntake whatever surplus we have and put it into Social Security, put it \ninto Medicare, and bring down the national debt?\n\n  I think ours is a sounder approach. I ask the Senator from Delaware, \nin his experience in history and in American politics, has he ever seen \nthe world turn so upside down that we Democrats are now the fiscal \nconservatives?\n  Mr. BIDEN. No. I must say to my friend from Illinois that I haven't. \nI really think a legitimate debate--a debate that is a close call, in \nmy view, would be whether or not, for example, we should be spending \nthe surplus to reduce the debt, or spend the surplus--we can do both--\nor spend more of the surplus to reinforce Social Security and Medicare. \nThat is a traditional debate that we have. Republicans used to argue we \nare spending too much money on Medicare--not just that it is broken, \nbut we are spending too much; and Social Security is inflated and we \nshould be cutting it back.\n  If you told me 15 years ago that the debate would be Democrats saying \nlet's not put as much away to reduce the debt, put more in Social \nSecurity and Medicare, and with what is left reduce the debt, and the \nRepublicans would have been saying let's reduce the debt, and once that \nis done, let's try to fix Medicare and Social Security--well, I don't \nknow. The third rail of politics has become Social Security and \nMedicare. Obviously, they have to be for that; everybody is for that. \nSo nobody really talks about it.\n  Some courageous guys and women talk about it on the floor, about what \nwe should be doing. But it is just a shame because there is a \nlegitimate debate here. The truth is, for example, if you said to me \nreduce the debt or spend more money on cops, I would be for spending \nmore money on cops. So it is true that there are some of us in this \nparty who would want to spend more of the surplus for worthwhile \nthings, such as education, law enforcement, et cetera. And it is a \nlegitimate debate. They would say: Look, Biden wants to spend more \nmoney instead of putting it onto the debt. But that is not even a \ndebate. That is not even a debate.\n  The debate now is to give a tax cut that no one seems to want. I \nwould love a tax cut. My total salary is what I make here, and the \nAmerican people pay me a lot of money. I would love a tax cut. I would \nlove even more--since I have a third child going off to college for the \nfirst year, and room, board, and tuition in any private school in this \ncountry is about $30,000 a year, I selfishly would love a tax break \nthere. But what I would not love is my adjustable rate mortgage to \nchange. I would not want that to change. Give me a tax cut and one \nlittle bump in my adjustable rate mortgage, and I am up more than I can \nsave by the tax cut. So I don't know.\n  Both of our parties are going through a little bit of establishing, \ngoing into the 21st century, what the pillars and cornerstones of our \nphilosophies are. Ironically, I think for the change we are sort of a \nlittle ahead of the Republicans on where we are. It doesn't mean the \nAmerican people agree with us. The debate over there seems to be that \nthe jury is still out on where they will go. I hope, for everyone's \nsake, we get our bearings a little bit because it would truly be a \nshame if, as a consequence of a political judgment, we imperil what is \nthe most remarkable recovery in the history of the world, essentially.\n  The economy in America has never been stronger within our borders or \ncomparatively internationally. I hope reason takes hold because even I \nthink Republicans and Democrats know more about what the polling data \nsays than I do. But my instinct tells me this is yesterday's fight. \nThis is yesterday's fight, but it could be tomorrow's tragedy if it \nprevails.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9321-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9321-S9323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RATIFYING THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, speaking of polls, which are what I stood \nup to speak about this morning, I would like to turn to the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the comprehensive test ban \ntreaty that was signed nearly three years ago and submitted to the \nSenate nearly two years ago. The American people overwhelmingly support \nthis treaty, yet it has not even seen the light of day here in the \nSenate.\n  The Senate, as we all know, is uniquely mandated under the United \nStates Constitution to give its ``advice and consent'' to the \nratification of treaties that the United States enters into. In a \ndereliction of that duty, the Senate is not dealing with the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty.\n  Why is this occurring? In the view of my colleagues--including some \nDemocrats who support the treaty--this treaty is not high on the agenda \nof the American people. There is very little political attraction in \nthe issue. It is easy to keep this treaty from being brought up and \ndiscussed, because people who care about nuclear testing tend to assume \nthat we already have a nuclear test-ban treaty in force.\n  President Bush did the right thing in accepting a moratorium on any \nnuclear tests, but that is not a permanent test-ban. It does not bind \nanybody other than ourselves. It merely implements our own conclusion \nthat we don't have to test nuclear weapons anymore in order to maintain \nour nuclear arsenal.\n  Faced with this perception on the part of many of our colleagues, \nseveral of us encouraged supporters of the Test-Ban Treaty to go out \nand actually poll the American people. Frankly, we wanted real evidence \nto show to our colleagues--mostly our Republican colleagues--that the \nAmerican public actually cares a lot about this issue.\n  I am not going to keep my colleagues in suspense. A comprehensive \npoll was done. The bottom line is that the American people support this \ntreaty by a margin of 82 percent to 14 percent. That is nearly 6 to 1.\n  For nearly 2 years, we Democrats--and a few courageous Republicans \nlike Senator Specter and Senator Jeffords--have tried to convince the \nRepublican leadership that this body should move to debate and decide \non this treaty. Let the Senate vote for ratification or vote against \nratification. The latest poll results are a welcome reminder that the \nAmerican people are with us on this important issue or, I might add, \nare way ahead of us.\n  I know some of my colleagues have principled objections to this \ntreaty. I respect their convictions even though I strongly believe they \nare wrong on this issue. What I cannot respect, however--and what my \ncolleagues should not tolerate--is the refusal of the Republican \nleadership of this body to permit the Senate to perform its \nconstitutional responsibility to debate and vote on ratification of \nthis vital treaty. It is simply irresponsible, in my view, for the \nRepublican leadership to hold this treaty hostage to other issues as if \nwe were fighting over whether or not we were going to appoint someone \nAssistant Secretary of State in return for getting someone to become \nthe deputy something-or-other in another Department. This treaty isn't \npetty politics; this issue affects the whole world.\n  Some of my colleagues believe nuclear weapons tests are essential to \npreserve our nuclear deterrent. Both I and the directors of our three \nnuclear weapons laboratories disagree. The $45 billion--yes, I said \nbillion dollars--Stockpile Stewardship Program--that is the name of the \nprogram--enables us to maintain the safety and reliability of our \nnuclear weapons without weapons tests.\n  The fact is, the United States is in the best position of all the \nnuclear-weapons states to do without testing. We have already conducted \nover 1,000 nuclear tests. The Stockpile Stewardship Program harnesses \nthe data from these 1,000 tests along with new high-energy physics \nexperiments and the world's most advanced supercomputers to improve our \nunderstanding of how a nuclear explosion--and each part in a weapon--\nworks.\n\n  In addition, each year our laboratories take apart and examine some \nnuclear weapons to see how well those parts work. The old data and new \nexperiments enable our scientists to diagnose and fix problems on our \nexisting nuclear weapons systems without full-scale weapons testing. \nThis is already being done. By this means, our nuclear weapons \nlaboratories are already maintaining the reliability of our nuclear \nstockpile without testing.\n  Still, if nuclear weapons tests should be required in the future to \nmaintain the U.S. nuclear deterrent, then we\n\n[[Page S9322]]\n\nwill test. The administration has proposed, in fact, that we enact such \nsafeguards as yearly review and certification of the nuclear deterrent \nand maintenance of the Nevada Test Site.\n  The administration has also made clear that if, in the future, the \nnational interest requires what the treaty binds us not to do, then the \nPresident of the United States will remain able to say: ``No. We are \nout of this treaty. It is no longer in our national interest. We are \ngiving advanced notice. We are going to withdraw.''\n  Thanks in part to those safeguards I mentioned earlier, officials \nwith the practical responsibility of defending our national security \nsupport ratification of the test ban treaty. In addition to the nuclear \nlab directors, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has spoken in \nfavor of ratification.\n  Support for ratification is not limited, moreover, to the current \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The four previous Chairmen of \nthe Joint Chiefs--also four-star generals--support ratification as \nwell. Think of that. This treaty is supported by Gen. John \nShalikashvili, Gen. Colin Powell, Adm. William Crowe, and Gen. David \nJones, all former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs. Those gentleman have \nguided our military since the Reagan administration.\n  Why would those with practical national security responsibilities \nsupport such a treaty? The answer is simple: For practical reasons.\n  Since 1992, pursuant to U.S. law, the United States has not engaged \nin a nuclear weapons test. As I have explained, we have been able, \nthrough ``stockpile stewardship,'' to maintain our nuclear deterrent \nusing improved science, state-of-the-art computations, and our library \nof past nuclear test results. Other countries were free to test until \nthey signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Now they are bound, as \nwe are, not to test. But that obligation will wither on the vine if we \nfail to ratify this test ban treaty.\n  One traditional issue on arms control treaties is verification. We \nalways ask whether someone can sign this treaty and then cheat and do \nthese tests without us knowing about it. The Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty will improve U.S. monitoring capabilities, with the rest of the \nworld picking up three-quarters of the cost. The treaty even provides \nfor on-site inspection of suspected test sites, which we have never \nbeen able to obtain in the past.\n  Some of my colleagues believe that our imperfect verification \ncapabilities make ratification of the test ban treaty unwise. New or \nprospective nuclear weapons states can gain little, however, from any \nlow-yield test we might be unable to detect. Even Russia could not use \nsuch tests to produce new classes of nuclear weapons.\n  To put it another way, even with the enhanced regimen of monitoring \nand on-site inspection, it is possible that there could be a low-level \nnuclear test that would go undetected. But what all of the scientists \nand nuclear experts tell us is that even if that occurred, it would \nhave to be at such a low level that it would not enable our principal \nnuclear adversaries and powers to do anything new in terms of their \nsystems and it would not provide any new weapon state the ability to \nput together a sophisticated nuclear arsenal.\n  For example, the case of China is particularly important. We have \nheard time and again on the floor of this Senate about the loss, \nbeginning during the Reagan and Bush years, of nuclear secrets and the \ninability, or the unwillingness, or the laxity of the Clinton \nadministration to quickly close down what appeared to be a leak of \nsensitive information to the Chinese. We lost it under Reagan and Bush, \nand the hole wasn't closed under the present administration, so the \nargument goes.\n  We hear these doomsday scenarios of what that now means--that China \nhas all of this technology available to do these new, terrible things. \nBut guess what? If China can't test this new technology that they \nallegedly stole, then it is of much less value to them. They have \nsigned the Test-Ban Treaty, and they are prepared to ratify it and \nrenounce nuclear testing forever if we ratify that very same test-ban \ntreaty.\n  Here we have the preposterous notion--for all those, like Chicken \nLittle, who are crying that the sky is falling--that the sky is falling \nand China is about to dominate us, but, by the way, we are not going to \nratify the Test-Ban Treaty. What a foolish thing.\n  The Cox committee--named for the conservative Republican Congressman \nfrom California who headed up the commission that investigated the \nespionage that allegedly took place regarding China stealing nuclear \nsecrets from us--the Cox committee warned that China may have stolen \nnuclear codes. Congressman Cox explained, however, that a China bound \nby the Test-Ban Treaty is much less likely to be able to translate its \nespionage successes into usable weapons.\n  As I noted, however, the Test-Ban Treaty will wither on the vine if \nwe don't ratify it. Then China would be free to resume testing. If we \nfail to take the opportunity to bind China on this Test-Ban Treaty, \nthat mistake will haunt us for generations and my granddaughters will \npay a price for it.\n  The need for speedy ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty \nis greater than ever before. In India and Pakistan, the world has \nwatched with mounting concern over the past 2 months as those two self-\nproclaimed nuclear-weapons states engaged in a conventional conflict \nthat threatened to spiral out of control.\n  Were nuclear weapons to be used in this densely populated area of the \nworld, the result would be a horror unmatched in the annals of \nwar. This breaches the postwar firebreak against nuclear war--which has \nstood for over 50 years--with incalculable consequences for the United \nStates and the rest of the world.\n\n  The India-Pakistan conflict may be back under control for now. \nPresident Clinton took an active interest in it, and that seems to have \nbeen important to the process in cooling it down. The threat of nuclear \nholocaust remains real, however, and it remains particularly real in \nthat region of the world. We can help prevent such a calamity. India \nand Pakistan have promised not to forestall the Test-Ban Treaty's entry \ninto force. They could even sign the treaty by this fall. The Test-Ban \nTreaty could freeze their nuclear weapons capabilities and make it \nharder for them to field nuclear warheads on their ballistic missiles.\n  This will not happen unless we, the United States, accept the same \nlegally binding obligation to refrain from nuclear weapons tests. Thus, \nwe in the Senate have the power to influence India and Pakistan for \ngood or for ill. God help us if we should make the wrong choice and \nlose the opportunity to bring India and Pakistan back from the brink.\n  This body's action or lack of action may also have a critical impact \nupon worldwide nuclear nonproliferation. Next spring, the signatories \nof the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty will hold a review conference. \n(The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is a different treaty; the treaty \nthat we still must ratify bans nuclear weapons testing, while the \nNuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was ratified decades ago, bans \nthe development of nuclear weapons by countries that do not already \nhave them.) If the United States has not ratified the Test-Ban Treaty \nby the time of the review conference, nonnuclear-weapons states will \nnote that we promised a test-ban treaty 5 years ago in return for the \nindefinite extension of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. What we will do \nif we don't ratify is risk undermining the nonproliferation resolve of \nthe nonnuclear weapon states.\n  Ask any Member in this Chamber--Democrat or Republican; conservative, \nliberal, or moderate--get them alone and ask them what is their single \ngreatest fear for their children and their grandchildren. I defy any \nMember to find more than a handful who answer anything other than the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons in the hands of rogue states and \nterrorists. Everybody agrees with that.\n  We have a nonproliferation treaty out there, and we have got \ncountries who don't have nuclear weapons to sign, refraining from ever \nbecoming a nuclear weapons state. But in return, we said we will \nrefrain from testing nuclear weapons and increasing our nuclear \narsenals.\n  Now what are we going to do? If we don't sign that treaty, what do \nyou think will happen when the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty \nsignatories get together in the fall and say: ``OK, do we want to keep \nthis commitment\n\n[[Page S9323]]\n\nor not?'' If the United States says it is not going to promise not to \ntest anymore, then China will say it will not promise not to test \neither. India and Pakistan will say they are not going to promise to \nrefrain from testing. What do you think will happen in every country, \nfrom rogue countries such as Syria, all the way to countries in Africa \nand Latin America that have the capability to develop nuclear weapons? \nDo you think they will say: ``It is a good idea that we don't attempt \never to gain a nuclear capability, the other big countries are going to \ndo it, but not us?'' I think this is crazy.\n  Let me be clear. The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty must not \nbe treated as a political football. It is a matter of urgent necessity \nto our national security. If the Senate should fail to exercise its \nconstitutional responsibility, the very future of nuclear \nnonproliferation could be at stake.\n  Two months ago I spoke on the Senate floor about the need for \nbipartisanship, the need to reach out across the chasm, reach across \nthat aisle. Today I reach out to the Republican leadership that denies \nthe Senate--and the American people--a vote on the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty.\n  I was joined on Sunday by the Washington Post, which spoke out in an \neditorial against what it termed ``hijacking the test ban.'' I will not \nrepeat the editorial comments regarding my friend from North Carolina \nwho chairs the committee. I do call to the attention of my colleagues, \nhowever, one salient question from that editorial:\n\n       One wonders why his colleagues, of whatever party or test \n     ban persuasion, let him go on.\n\n  I have great respect for my friend from North Carolina. He has a \ndeep-seated philosophical disagreement with the Test-Ban Treaty, and I \nrespect that. I respect the majority leader, Mr. Lott, who has an \nequally compelling rationale to be against the Test-Ban Treaty. I do \nnot respect their unwillingness to let the whole Senate debate and vote \non this in the cold light of day before the American people and all the \nworld.\n  A poll that was conducted last month will not surprise anybody who \nfollows this issue. But it should serve as a reminder to my colleagues \nthat the American people are not indifferent to what we do here.\n  The results go beyond party lines. Fully 80 percent of Republicans--\nand even 79 percent of conservative Republicans--say that they support \nthe Test-Ban Treaty.\n  And this is considered opinion. In May of last year, the people said \nthat they knew some countries might try to cheat on the test-ban. But \nthey still supported U.S. ratification, by a 73-16 margin. As already \nannounced, today's poll results show even greater support than we had a \nyear ago.\n  Last year's polls also show a clear view on the public's part of how \nto deal with the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. When asked how to \nrespond to those tests, over 80 percent favored getting India and \nPakistan into the Test-Ban Treaty and over 70 percent saw U.S. \nratification as a useful response.\n  By contrast, fewer than 40 percent wanted more spending on U.S. \nmissile defense; and fewer than 25 percent wanted us to resume nuclear \ntesting.\n  The American people understood something that had escaped the \nattention of the Republican leadership: that the best response to India \nand Pakistan's nuclear tests is to rope them in to a test-ban, which \nrequires doing the same for ourselves.\n  The American people reach similar conclusions today regarding China's \npossible stealing of U.S. nuclear weapons secrets. When asked about its \nimplications for the Test-Ban Treaty, 17 percent see this as rendering \nthe Treaty irrelevant; but nearly three times as many--48 percent--see \nit as confirming the importance of the Treaty. Once again, the American \npeople are ahead of the Republican leadership.\n  The American people see the Test-Ban Treaty as a sensible response to \nworld-wide nuclear threats. In a choice between the Treaty and a return \nto U.S. nuclear testing, 84 percent chose the Treaty. Only 11 percent \nwould go back to U.S. testing.\n  Last month's bipartisan poll--conducted jointly by the Melman Group \nand Wirthlin Worldwide--asked a thousand people ``which Senate \ncandidate would you vote for: one who favored CTBT ratification, or one \nwho opposed it?'' So as to be completely fair, they even told their \nrespondents the arguments that are advanced against ratification.\n  By a 2-to-1 margin, the American people said they would vote for the \ncandidate who favors ratifying the Treaty. Even Republicans would vote \nfor that candidate, by a 52-42 margin.\n  Now, as a Democrat, I like those numbers. The fact remains, however, \nthat both the national interest and the reputation of the United States \nSenate are on the line in this matter.\n  The national security implications of the Comprehensive Test-Ban \nTreaty must be addressed in a responsible manner. There must be debate. \nThere must be a vote.\n  In sum, the Senate must do its duty--and do it soon--so that America \ncan remain the world's leader on nuclear non-proliferation; so that we \ncan help bring India and Pakistan away from the brink of nuclear \ndisaster; and so that the United States Senate can perform its \nConstitutional duty in the manner that the Founders intended.\n  Let me close with some words from a most esteemed former colleague, \nSenator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, from a statement dated July 20. I ask \nunanimous consent that his statement be printed in the Record after my \nown statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BIDEN. He began:\n\n       The time has come for Senate action on the CTBT \n     ratification.\n\n  Senator Hatfield adduces some excellent arguments in favor of \nratification, which I commend to my colleagues. But I especially want \nrecommend his conclusion, which summarizes our situation with elegant \nprecision:\n\n       It is clear to me that ratifying this Treaty would be in \n     the national interest. And it is equally clear that Senators \n     have a responsibility to the world, the nation and their \n     constituents to put partisan politics aside and allow the \n     Senate to consider this Treaty.\n\n  Senators, that says it all.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n       Statement By Senator mark O. Hatfield on CTBT Ratification\n\n       The time has come for Senate action on CTBT ratification. \n     Political leaders the world over have recognized that the \n     proliferation of nuclear weapons poses the gravest threat to \n     global peace and stability, a threat that is likely to \n     continue well into the next century. Ratification of the 1996 \n     Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by the United States \n     and its early entry into force would significantly reduce the \n     chances of new states developing advanced nuclear weapons and \n     would strengthen the global nuclear non-proliferation regime \n     for the twenty-first century. Just as the United States led \n     the international community nearly three years ago by being \n     the first to sign the CTB Treaty, which has now been signed \n     by 152 nations, the Senate now has a similar opportunity and \n     responsibility to demonstrate U.S. leadership by ratifying \n     it.\n       The Treaty enhances U.S. national security and is popular \n     among the American people. Recent bipartisan polling data \n     indicates that support for the Treaty within the United \n     States is strong, consistent, and across the board. It is \n     currently viewed favorably by 82% of the public, nearly the \n     highest level of support in four decades of polling. Only six \n     percentage points separate Democratic and Republican voters, \n     and there is no discernible gender gap on this issue. This \n     confirms the traditional bipartisan nature of support for the \n     CTBT, which dates back four decades to President's \n     Eisenhower's initiation of test ban negotiations and was \n     reaffirmed by passage in 1992 of the Exon-Hatifield-Mitchell \n     legislation on a testing moratorium.\n       It is clear to me that ratifying this Treaty would be in \n     the national interest. And it is equally clear that Senators \n     have a responsibility to the world, the nation and their \n     constituents to put partisan politics aside and allow the \n     Senate to consider this Treaty.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to visit a little bit a topic that \nwill be coming before the Senate very soon, probably tomorrow, and that \nis tax relief and the reconciliation bill we will be considering.\n\n[[Page S9324]]\n\n  To me that is one of the most important things before us, not only as \nthe Senate but before us as American people. We ought to spend our time \nfocusing on that issue.\n  I have been a little amazed at the comments that have been made this \nmorning. I only heard part of them, but they said this tax relief will \ncertainly damage the economy. I have never heard of anything like that \nin my entire life. More money in the hands of Americans will probably \nstrengthen the economy. We heard about Alan Greenspan's comments. The \nfact is, his complete comments were that he would much rather see tax \nrelief than expending those dollars in larger government, which \nbasically is the alternative.\n  We ought to review again for ourselves and for listeners where we are \nwith respect to the surplus, where we are with respect to the public \ndebt, and with the President's proposal versus tax relief.\n  We all know we worked a very long time to have a balanced budget. For \nthe first time in 25 years, we have a balanced budget, and we want to \nbe sure the majority of the surplus is Social Security money. This is \nthe first time we have done this in a very long time. It is largely the \nresult, of course, of a strong economy and some efforts on the part of \nthis Congress to have a balanced budget amendment, to have some \nspending caps to hold down spending.\n  What can we expect? According to the Congressional Budget Office \nwhich released their midsession review on July 21, the estimates are \nthat the total budget surplus will measure $1.1 trillion to the year \n2004, and to the year 2009 nearly $3 trillion in surplus will be coming \nin. The non-Social Security portion of that surplus will measure almost \n$300 billion to the year 2004 and nearly $1 trillion to the year 2009. \nThis is the non-Social Security surplus that comes in to our budget.\n\n  The congressional budget resolution which talks about tax relief will \nleave the publicly held debt level at $1.6 trillion. The President's, \non the other hand, will leave it at $1.8 trillion. With some tax \nrelief, the reduction in publicly held debt under the tax relief \nprogram, the reconciliation program we will be talking about the next \nseveral days, will reduce the debt more than the President's plan which \nplans to spend the money.\n  These are the facts. It is interesting; the budget chairman was on \nthe floor yesterday indicating that out of the total amount of money \nthat will be in the surplus, less than 25 percent will be used for tax \nrelief and it will still be $1 trillion.\n  These are the facts, and it seems to me we ought to give them some \nconsideration.\n  Another fact that I believe is important in this time of prosperity, \nin this time of having a balanced budget and having a surplus, is the \nAmerican people are paying the highest percentage of gross national \nproduct in taxes ever, higher than they did in World War II. Certainly, \nthere is a case to be made for some sort of tax relief. If there are \nsurplus dollars, these dollars ought to go back to the people who paid \nthem. They ought to go back to the American people to spend as they \nchoose.\n  There will be great debates about this, and there have been great \ndebates about this. There are threats by the White House to veto any \nsubstaintial tax reductions. Sometimes one begins to wonder, as we \naddress these issues, whether or not it should be what we think is \nright or whether we have to adjust it to avoid a veto. That is a tough \ndecision. Sometimes we ought to say: All right, if we believe in \nsomething, we ought to do what we think is right. If the President \nchooses to veto it, let him veto it. Otherwise, we compromise less than \nwe think we should. Those are the choices that have to be made.\n  We will enter into this discussion again, as we have in the past, \nwith different philosophies among the Members of this body. Of course, \nit is perfectly legitimate. The basic philosophy of our friends on the \nother side is more government and more spending. The basic philosophy \nof Republicans has been to hold down the size of government and have \nless government spending.\n  There is more to tax reduction than simply tax relief. It has to do \nwith controlling the size of the Federal Government. If we have surplus \nmoney in the budget, you can bet your bottom dollar we are going to \nhave more government and more spending, and to me there is a \nrelationship.\n  Of course, we need to utilize those funds to fulfill what are the \nlegitimate functions of the Federal Government. It is also true that \nthere is a different view of what are the legitimate functions of the \nFederal Government. I personally believe the Federal Government ought \nto be as lean as we can keep it. Constitutionally, it says the Federal \nGovernment does certain things and all the rest of the things not \noutlined in the Constitution are left to the States and to the people. \nI think that is right. I believe the State, the government closest to \nthe people, is the one that can, in fact, provide the kinds of services \nthat are most needed and that fit the needs of the people who live \nthere.\n\n  I come from a small State. I come from a State of low population. The \ndelivery of almost all the services--whether it be health care, whether \nit be education, whether it be highways--is different in Wyoming than \nit is in New York and, indeed, it should be. Therefore, the one-size-\nfits-all things we tend to do at the Federal Government are not \napplicable, are not appropriate, and we ought to move as many of those \ndecisions as we can to the States so they can be made closest to the \npeople.\n  We will see that difference of philosophy. There are legitimate \narguments. That is exactly why we are here, to talk about which \napproach best fits the needs of the American people: whether we want \nmore Federal Government, whether we want more spending, whether we want \nto enable more growth in the Federal Government, having the Government \ninvolved in more regulatory functions or, indeed, whether we want to \nlimit the Government to what we believe are the essential elements with \nwhich the Federal Government ought to concern itself, or whether we \nought to move to encourage and strengthen the States to do that.\n  We have on this side of the aisle, of course, our goals, our agenda. \nThey include preserving Social Security. I am one of the sponsors of \nour Social Security bill which we believe will provide, over time, the \nsame kinds of benefits for young people who are just beginning to pay \nand will maintain the benefits for those who are now drawing them. We \ncan do that.\n  We have tried now I think five times to bring to this floor a lockbox \namendment to make sure Social Security money is kept aside and is used \nfor that purpose. We hope it will end up with individual accounts where \npeople will have some of their Social Security money put into their own \naccount where they can choose to have it in equities, or they can \nchoose to have it in bonds, or they can choose to have it in a \ncombination of the two. Increased earnings will accrue to their \nbenefit, and, indeed, they will own it. If they are unfortunate enough \nto pass away before they use it, it becomes part of their estate.\n  Those are the things that are priorities for us. We want to do \nsomething with education. We sought to do that this year, to provide \nFederal funding of education to the States in the forms of grants so \nthose decisions can be made to fit Cody, WY, as well as they do Long \nIsland, NY, but quite differently.\n  We have done some military strengthening. We have done that this \nyear. We want to continue to do that. We have not been able to increase \nthe capacity of the military for a number of years. We need to do that. \nThis is not a peaceful world, as my friends talked about.\n  Those are the choices. We will hear: If you are going to have tax \nrelief, you cannot do these things. That is not true. We will have a \nconsiderable amount left over after we do a Social Security set-aside, \nafter we do tax relief, and there will be adequate dollars to do \nMedicare reform and to do military reform. That is the plan, that is \nthe program, and that is, I believe, what we should be orienting \nourselves toward.\n\n  I hope that over the next several days we will have the opportunity \nto fully debate this. I think there will be great differences in how \nyou do tax relief. There are a million ways to do it. Frankly, I hope \nwe not only have tax relief but also that we help simplify\n\n[[Page S9325]]\n\nthe tax system rather than make it even more complicated than it is. \nTherefore, I think those will be the issues we should really address.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, this morning we devoted most of the \nmorning business to a discussion of an item which will come before us \nsoon, and that is the whole question of how our economy is to look for \nthe next few years. There are two very different visions of that future \nwhich will be articulated on the floor--one on the Republican side and \nanother on the Democratic side.\n  The Senator from Wyoming was kind enough to speak and to tell us \nearlier about his concerns over taxes. Certainly, his concern is shared \nby many on both sides of the aisle. He made a point which I think is \nworth noting and explaining. Yes, it is true that Federal tax receipts \nare higher than they have ever been from individuals and families, but \nit is also true the tax rates on individuals and families, in every \nincome category, are at some of the lowest levels they have been in \nmodern memory.\n  The reason why taxes and tax receipts are higher reflects the fact \nthat the economy is strong, people are working, they are earning money \nin their workplace, as well as in their investments, and they are \npaying some tax on it.\n  If you look at the dynamic growth in taxation on American families, \nyou will find it is not from Washington but, rather, from State \ncapitals and local sources, local units of government. That, to me, is \nan important point to make as we get into a question of whether we \nshould cut Federal taxes.\n  I, for one, believe we can cut Federal taxes and do it particularly \nfor the lower and middle-income families and really enhance our \neconomy--if they are targeted; if they are contained. Because people \nwho get up and go to work every day, and sweat out the payroll tax, \nwhich is usually higher than their Federal income tax liability, are \nthe folks who need a helping hand.\n\n  Sadly, the Republican proposal before us, which will be about a $1 \ntrillion tax cut over the next 10 years, does not focus on the lower \nand middle-income families. It reverts to the favorite group of the \nRepublican Party time and again in tax policy--those at the higher \nincome levels. So we see dramatic tax cuts for the wealthiest American \nfamilies and ``chump change,'' if you will, for working families.\n  That in and of itself is an injustice. The Republican Senator who \nspoke before me made the statement that he could not see why giving \nmore money back to people to spend could possibly hurt the economy. In \nfact, it is a source of concern.\n  You notice that about once a month, or once every other month, we \nwait expectantly for news from the Federal Reserve Board as to whether \nthey are going to raise interest rates. It is an important issue and \ntopic for many Americans. If you have a mortgage with an adjustable \nrate on it, the decision by Chairman Greenspan of the Federal Reserve \nto raise interest rates will hit you right in the pocketbook. Your \nmortgage rate will go up. The payment on your home will go up.\n  Most people think this is a decision to be made looking at the \noverall economy. I suggest most American families look at interest rate \ndecisions based on their own family. What will it do to my mortgage \nrate? What will it do, if I am a small businessperson, to the cost of \ncapital for me to continue doing business? These are real-life \ndecisions.\n  If the Republicans have their way this week and pass a tax break, \nprimarily for wealthy people, injecting money into the economy, it will \nincrease economic activity. It is expected, then, that some people will \nbuy more. It may mean Donald Trump will buy another yacht or Bill Gates \nwill buy something else.\n  That money spent in the economy creates the kind of economic movement \nwhich the Federal Reserve watches carefully. If that movement seems to \nbe going too quickly, they step in and slow it down. How do they slow \nit down? They raise interest rates.\n  So the Republican plan, the tax break for wealthy people, the $1 \ntrillion approach, is one which runs the risk of heating up an economy, \nwhich is already running at a very high rate of speed, to the point \nwhere the Federal Reserve has to step in. And once stepping in and \nraising interest rates, the losers turn out to be the same working \nfamilies who really do deserve a break.\n  It has been suggested that if we, instead, take our surplus and pay \ndown the national debt, it not only is a good thing intuitively that we \nwould be retiring this debt, but it has very positive consequences for \nthis economy.\n  Consider for a moment that in the entire history of the United \nStates, from President George Washington through President Jimmy \nCarter, we had accumulated $1 trillion in debt. That means every \nCongress, every President, each year, who overspent, spent more Federal \nmoney than they brought in in taxes, accumulated a debt which over the \ncourse of 200 years of history, came to $1 trillion, a huge sum of \nmoney, no doubt.\n  But after the Carter administration, as we went into the Reagan \nyears, the Bush years, and the early Clinton years, that debt just \nskyrocketed. It is now over $5 trillion. That is America's mortgage. We \nhave to pay interest on our mortgage as every American family pays \ninterest on their home mortgage. What does it cost us? It costs us $1 \nbillion a day in interest to borrow the money, to pay off our national \ndebt--$1 billion a day collected from workers through payroll taxes, \nfrom businesses and others just to service the debt.\n\n  So the question before us is whether or not a high priority should be \nreducing that debt. Frankly, I think it should be one of the highest \npriorities. You know who ends up paying that interest forever? The \nyoung children in our gallery here watching this Senate debate: Thank \nyou, mom. Thank you, dad. Thanks for everything. Thanks for the \nnational debt, and thanks for the fact that we are going to have to pay \nfor it.\n  We have some alternative news for them that may be welcome. We have a \nchance now to help you out. We have a chance to take whatever surplus \ncomes into the Federal Government because of our strong economy and use \nit to retire the national debt, to bring it down.\n  That is the proposal from the Democratic side, from President \nClinton, and most of my fellow Senators who share the floor with me on \nthis side of the aisle. It is a conservative approach but a sensible \none.\n  The alternative, if we do not do it, I am afraid, is to continue to \npay this $1 billion a day in interest on the debt and not bring it \ndown.\n  If we stick to a disciplined, conservative approach, we can bring \ndown this debt.\n  Chairman Alan Greenspan said last week: Yes, that is the highest \npriority. You want this economy to keep moving? You want to keep \ncreating jobs and businesses, people building homes, starting new small \nbusinesses, and keeping inflation under control? He said the worst \nthing you can do is create new programs and spend it, going back to the \ndeficit days. The second worst thing you can do, as the Republican \nproposal suggests, is give tax breaks to wealthy people. The best thing \nhe said to do is to retire the national debt.\n  It is eminently sensible on its face. We step forward and say \nbringing down that debt is good for the economy, will not overheat it, \nwill not raise interest rates. You see, if we can have interest rates \ncontinuing to come down, it helps families. How does that happen?\n\n[[Page S9326]]\n\n  The Federal Government is a big borrower. Because of our $5 trillion-\nplus debt, we have to borrow money from all over the United States and \naround the world to service that debt. If we start getting out of the \nborrowing business, there is less demand for capital, and the cost of \ncapital--interest rates--starts going down. What would a 1 percent \nreduction in the interest rate mean to families across America over the \nnext 10 years when it comes to their mortgage payments? Savings of over \n$250 billion. Frankly, taking the conservative approach, paying down \nthe national debt is not only good to keep the economy moving forward \nbut, over the long term, the lower interest rates are good for \neveryone: good for families who want to buy homes; good for businesses \nthat want to expand and hire more employees, and good all around.\n\n  That is the bottom line of this debate. The Republican approach is to \nspend it on tax cuts, give it to wealthy people. The Democratic \napproach is pay down the national debt, invest the money in Social \nSecurity and in Medicare. That, I think, is the more responsible course \nof action. What the Republicans would do in the second 5 years of their \ntax cut is actually mind-boggling, because they would be reaching into \nthe Social Security trust fund to pay for these tax breaks for wealthy \npeople. So folks today who are paying a high payroll tax, putting money \nin the Social Security trust fund so it is there for the baby boomers \nand others in the future, would actually be funding a tax cut for some \nof the wealthiest people in America instead of leaving that money in \nthe Social Security trust fund where it belongs to meet the obligations \nof that system that is so important to millions of families.\n  I yield to the Senator from California for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Illinois. We are having this \nconversation while we await the arrival of the interior appropriations \nbill, which I know we are both looking forward to working on with the \nrest of the Senate.\n  Nothing could be more important right now than the business that will \ncome before this body tomorrow, a huge Republican reconciliation bill \nwhich includes these massive tax cuts to the wealthiest and, as a \nresult of that, really crimps the functioning of the rest of the \nFederal Government.\n  Again, because my friend is so clear thinking, I underscore what he \nsaid in this colloquy.\n  The Democratic plan makes four very important decisions. First, the \nDemocratic plan takes care of Social Security for the extended future. \nIt says every single dollar of the surplus that belongs to Social \nSecurity will be locked up for Social Security, while the debt is paid \ndown at the same time. The difference with the Republicans is, they dip \ninto the Social Security trust fund 6 years from now.\n  Secondly, the Democratic plan says: What else is important? What else \nis the safety net for our people? Medicare. So it treats Medicare, in \nessence, the same way we treat Social Security. We treat it as the twin \npillar of the safety net. We say we will take care of Medicare to the \ntune of over $200 billion. We lock that up. And while it is sitting \nthere, it is used to pay down the external debt of the country.\n  The third thing we do--I have alluded to that--is debt reduction. \nDebt reduction is the external debt, the debt that is owed to private \npeople, Americans and those around the world who pick up our bonds. We \nowe them debt. I see my friend from South Carolina who has pointed this \nout. Because of that debt, we are paying over $300 billion a year in \ninterest payments which, as my friend said, is bad for the economy. It \nis wasteful. It does no good to anyone.\n  Then there is a fourth piece. That is, we take care of the business \nof Government. We leave enough over to take care of education, to take \ncare of health research, to take care of airport safety, safety in the \nstreets, highways, transit, the things that our people want us to do; \nwe take care of the basic business of Government, no frills but the \nbasic business of Government. Educating our kids is basic. If we don't \ndo that, we are nowhere as a country.\n\n  My question to my friend is this: Unless we are not hearing the \npeople, they want us to take care of Social Security and lock it up for \nthe future. They want us to take care of Medicare and lock that money \nup for the future. They want us to reduce that external debt so the \ninterest payments on the debt disappear. And they want us to take care \nof the basic business of Government: taking care of our kids, health \nresearch, the things we stand on this floor day in and day out talking \nabout, how important it is to improve the quality of life for our \npeople. That is what we do.\n  The Republicans, the only thing they do is take care of the wealthy. \nYes, they take care of some of Social Security, but in the second 5 \nyears, they are dipping into that pot, too.\n  Does my friend agree with the sort of wrap-up I have given of his \nremarks? Are we on the same page? And, in conclusion, does he think our \nplan meets the needs of our people and their plan is risky, it is \nfrightening, it pays off the wealthy and does nothing for our other \nneeds?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator from California. I will say this \nonly one more time on the floor. She may have missed it earlier, when I \ncharacterized this whole discussion about the lockbox. There is this \nproposal that comes forward that we create a lockbox for Social \nSecurity and for Medicare. In other words, you can't get your hands on \nit if you want to create a new program or whatever it might be. It is \ngoing to be separate, locked away from the grasping hands of any \npolitical leaders. So those who follow the debate will hear this: \nlockbox, lockbox, lockbox. But as we look carefully at the Republican \ntax break proposals, they reach into that Social Security lockbox in \nthe year 2005 and start taking money out for tax breaks for wealthy \npeople.\n  I said on the floor earlier, at that point it is no longer a lockbox, \nit is a ``loxbox,'' because it smells a little fishy. This is no \nlockbox, if you can reach in and take from it. That is, frankly, what \nwe are going to face with the Republican tax break proposal.\n  I also say to the Senator from California and the Senator from South \nCarolina, who is the acclaimed expert when it comes to budget--and we \nare anxious to hear his comments and contribution--the other thing that \nis interesting is the Republican tax break plan is based on the theory \nthat we are going to stick with spending caps forever. We are going to \nkeep limitations on spending and appropriations forever. And with those \nlimitations, the surplus grows, and they give it away in tax breaks \nprimarily to wealthy people.\n  Look what is happening around here. The so-called caps are being \nbreached and broken even as we speak. They came up last week and said--\nwhat a surprise--it turns out we have to take a census in America every \n10 years. That is an emergency, an unanticipated event.\n  A census an unanticipated event? We have been taking the decennial \ncensus for centuries--not quite that long but at least for a long time. \nNow they are calling it an emergency to pay for the census so they can \ngo around the caps, so they can spend the money.\n\n  It is my understanding that within the last few hours, the House of \nRepresentatives has also decided that spending for veterans hospitals \nis an emergency, and, therefore, we will go around the caps. Frankly, \nfunding the census and funding veterans hospitals would be high on \neveryone's list here, but to call this an unanticipated emergency--most \nof the men and women who are being served by those hospitals served us \nand our country in World War II and Korea. We know who they are, and we \nknow the general state of their health. It is predictable that they \nwould need help at veterans hospitals. It is not an unanticipated \nemergency.\n  We are dealing in fictions; we are dealing in doubletalk, in an \neffort to get around the spending caps, which is the premise of the \nRepublican tax break, that we are going to have spending caps forever. \nThey are violating their premise even as they offer this tax break \nproposal.\n  I will make this last point to the Senator from California. She \nreally addresses, I think, one of the basics. There are many on the \nRepublican side who believe that, frankly, Government just gets in the \nway of a good life for Americans. I disagree. I think in many respects \nGovernment is important to a good life for many Americans and their \nfamilies.\n  The Senator from California and the Senator from Illinois can \ncertainly\n\n[[Page S9327]]\n\nagree on the issue of transportation. In Chicago, which I am honored to \nrepresent, virtually any radio station will tell you every 10 minutes \nthe state of traffic on the major expressways around Chicago. I am sure \nthe Senator from California can tell the same story. It is getting \nworse, more congestion, more delays, and more compromise in the quality \nof life.\n  We don't want to step away from a Federal contribution to \ntransportation, not only highways but mass transit. Frankly, if we move \ndown the road suggested by Republicans, it would jeopardize it. The \nsame thing is true about crime. It ranks in the top three issues that \npeople worry about. The COPS Program, which Democrats supported along \nwith President Clinton, has created almost 100,000 new police. That \nbrought down the crime rate in America. We want to continue that \ncommitment to making our neighborhoods, streets, and schools safer \nacross America.\n  Finally, education. I am glad the Senator from California noted this. \nThe Federal contribution to education is relatively small compared to \nState and local spending, but it is very important. We have shown \nleadership in the past and we can in the future. It really troubles me \nto think we are now at a point in our history where, if no law is \nchanged and everything continues as anticipated, we will need to build, \non a weekly basis, for the next 10 years--once every week for the next \n10 years--a new 1,000-bed prison, every single week for the next 10 \nyears because of the anticipated increase in incarceration.\n  I think dangerous people should be taken off the street and out of my \nneighborhood and yours. But I don't believe Americans are genetically \ninclined to be violent criminals. I think there are things we can do to \nintervene in lives, particularly at an early stage, to make kids better \nstudents and ultimately better citizens. That means investing in \neducation. The Republican plan steps back from that commitment to \neducation, as it does from the commitments to transportation and \nfighting crime. That is very shortsighted. We will pay for it for many \ndecades to come.\n  So this debate, some people say, is about a tax break. It is about a \nlot more. Will the economy keep moving forward? Will we make important \ndecisions so the next generation of Americans is not burdened with \npaying interest on our old debt, and will we make good on our \ncommitment to American families when it comes to important questions \ninvolving transportation, crime, education, and the quality of life?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield to me for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator from California for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to ask him a question about an \nissue he and I have worked on together for so many years. It takes us \nback to when we were in the House together. We served together there \nfor 10 years. That is the issue of health research.\n  Right now, only one out of every three approved grants is actually \nbeing funded. So that means cures for cancer, Parkinson's, AIDS, heart \ndisease, stroke, you name it--the biggest killers--are not being found. \nIn other words--let me repeat--we have one out of every three grants \napproved by the National Institutes of Health because they are very \npromising. If some scientist has a theory about how to cure prostate or \nbreast cancer, he may not be able to get it done.\n  This will be my final question. As he goes through the Republican \nplan, which leaves virtually zero room, as I read it, for increases in \nthis kind of basic spending, does the Senator not think we are \nshortchanging American families? When I talk to them, that is what they \nare scared of most.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California for her observation. \nYes, many years ago when we were on the Budget Committee in the House, \nwe worked together on medical research and dramatically increased the \namount of money for it. It was one of the prouder moments serving on \nCapitol Hill. I have found, as I have gone across Illinois and around \nthe country, that virtually every American family agrees this is an \nappropriate thing for the Federal Government to do--initiate and \nsponsor medical research.\n\n  A family never feels more helpless than when a disease or illness \nstrikes somebody they love. They pray to God that the person will \nsurvive, and that they can find the best doctors. In the back of their \nminds they are hoping and praying that somewhere somebody is developing \na drug or some treatment that can make a difference. And that \n``somewhere,'' many times, is the National Institutes of Health in \nWashington, DC, in the Maryland suburbs nearby.\n  If we take the Republican approach of cutting dramatically the \nFederal budget in years to come for a tax break for wealthy people, we \njeopardize the possibility that the NIH will have money for this \nmedical research. That is so shortsighted.\n  It is not only expensive to continue to provide medical care to \ndiseased or ill people, but, frankly, it is inhumane to turn our backs \non the fact that so many families need a helping hand. I sincerely hope \nbefore this debate ends, we are able to bring Republicans around to the \npoint of view that when we talk about spending on the Democratic side, \nit is for the basics--transportation, fighting crime, helping \neducation, and medical research. I would take that out for a referendum \nacross this land. I think that is the sensible way to go.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9327-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9327-S9330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REALITIES OF THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I certainly appreciate it. I really appreciate the \nsignificance of and the emphasis the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois and the distinguished Senator from California are exchanging \non the floor about the realities of the budget.\n  Mr. President, some years ago, there was this debate between Walter \nLippmann and the famous educator, John Dewey, with relation to how to \nbuild a strong democracy. Mr. Lippmann contended the way to have and \nmaintain a strong democracy was to get the best of minds in the various \ndisciplines countrywide--whether in education, housing, foreign \nrelations, financial and fiscal policy, or otherwise--and let them meet \naround the table and determine the needs of the Nation and the policy \nthereof; take care of those needs, give it to the politicians, give it \nto the Congress, and let them enact it. It was John Dewey's \ncontention--no, he said, what we need is the free press to tell the \nAmerican people the truth. These truths would be reflected through \ntheir Representatives on the floor of the national Congress, and the \ndemocracy would continue strong.\n  For 200-some years now, we have had that free press reporting those \ntruths. But, unfortunately, until this morning--until this morning, Mr. \nPresident--they have been coconspirators, so to speak, in that they \nhave joined in calling spending increases spending cuts, and calling \ndeficits surpluses. Eureka. I picked up the Washington Post this \nmorning, and on the front page, the right-hand headline, they talk \nabout the shenanigans of emergency spending and calling up the CBO with \ndifferent economic assumptions--finding $10 billion. Just go to the \nphone if you are Chairman of the Budget Committee, call up Mr. Crippen \nover at CBO and say: Wait a minute. Those economic assumptions we used \nin the budget resolution--I have different ones. Therefore, give me $10 \nbillion more. It is similar to calling up a rich uncle.\n  That is now being exposed in the Wall Street Journal. Of all things, \nthey are talking in the front middle section about national and \ninternational news headlines and talking about double accounting and \nhow they give them credit for saving the money and spending it at the \nsame time. There is a whole column by our friend David Rogers on page \n24. So, eureka, I found it. We are now breaking through and beginning \nto speak the truth.\n  I know the distinguished Chair is very much interested in actual and \naccurate accounting, and the actual fact is we are running a deficit, \nthe Congressional Budget Office says, of $103 billion this year, which \nends with August and September--just 2 more months after this July, and \nwe will have spent $103 billion more than we take in; namely, on the \ndeficit.\n  So, Mr. President, when you hear all of this jargon and plans about \nsurpluses and how they find them and\n\n[[Page S9328]]\n\nwhatever else, you go to the books and you turn to their reports and \nyou say: Wait a minute now. The President came out in his document \nhere, the CBO report--and I hold in my hand the midsession review, \nwhich came out 10 days ago and I said: Wait a minute. Let me find out \nwhere they find this surplus.\n  On the contrary, on page 42, under the heading ``Total Gross Federal \nDebt''--Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this page be \nprinted in

Agency debt is almost entirely\n  measured at face value. Treasury securities in the Government account series are measured at face value less\n  unrealized discount (if any).\n\\2\\ A decrease in the Treasury operating cash balance (which is an asset) is a means of financing the deficit\n  and therefore has a positive sign. An increase in checks outstanding or deposit fund balances (which are\n  liabilities) would also be a means of financing the deficit and therefore would also have a positive sign.\n\\3\\ Besides checks outstanding, includes accrued interest payable on Treasury debt, miscellaneous liability\n  accounts, allocations of special drawing rights, and as an offset, cash and monetary assets other than the\n  Treasury operating cash balance, miscellaneous asset accounts, and profit on sale of gold.\n\\4\\ Debt held by the Federal Reserve Banks is not estimated for future years.\n\\5\\ Consists primarily of Federal Financing Bank debt.\n\\6\\ Consists of unamortized discount (less premium) on public issues of Treasury notes and bonds and unrealized\n  discount on Government account series securities, except, in both cases, for zero-coupon bonds.\n\\7\\ The statutory debt limits is $5,950 billion.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Then you see the total gross Federal debt, and you see \nfor the 5-year projection--from the years 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, \n2004--it goes from a debt of $5.7036 trillion to $6.298 trillion.

S9329]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you see the debt held by government \naccounts, end of period, $7.543 trillion, plus up there at the end of \nthe period, the little 44, making an increase of debt to $7.587 \ntrillion. There is the debt going up from $5.6 trillion to $7.6 \ntrillion, an increase of $2 trillion in the debt.\n  Everybody is talking ``surplus.'' I wonder where in the world do they \nget the surplus. We are beginning to see it in the double accounting in \nthe Wall Street Journal and otherwise.\n  Let's go to the Congressional Budget Office because my good friend, \nthe distinguished Senator from Nebraska, talked about a $2.9 trillion \nsurplus. He is right. In the rhetoric at the very beginning, they talk \nabout a surplus here on page 2--cumulative onbudget surpluses of \nprojected and total, nearly $1 trillion between 1999 and 2009. During \nthat same period, cumulative off-budget surpluses will total slightly \nmore than $2 trillion. That is where he finds, I take it, the $2.9 \ntrillion.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record from the \nCongressional Budget Office report of July 1, page 19.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         TABLE 10.--CBO BASELINE PROJECTIONS OF INTEREST COSTS AND FEDERAL DEBT\n                                                                    [By fiscal year]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               Actual\n                                                1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007     2008     2009\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n                                                       NET INTEREST OUTLAYS (BILLIONS OF DOLLARS)\n \nInterest on Public Debt (Gross interest)\\1\\.      364      356      358      358      350      345      342      338      333      328      323      316\nInterest Received by Trust Funds:\n    Social Security.........................      -47      -53      -59      -67      -74      -82      -91     -100     -110     -121     -132     -144\n    Other trust funds \\2\\...................      -67      -68      -70      -73      -74      -76      -79      -81      -84      -87      -89      -92\n                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Subtotal............................     -114     -120     -129     -140     -148     -159     -170     -182     -194     -208     -222     -236\nOther Interest \\3\\..........................       -7       -7       -6       -7       -7       -7       -8       -8       -8       -8       -8       -9\n            Total...........................      243      229      222      212      194      179      164      148      131      112       92       71\n \n                                                FEDERAL DEBT AT THE END OF THE YEAR (BILLIONS OF DOLLARS)\n \nGross Federal Debt..........................    5,479    5,582    5,664    5,721    5,737    5,760    5,770    5,770    5,732    5,675    5,600    5,500\nDebt Held by Government Accounts:\n    Social Security.........................      730      856    1,003    1,157    1,321    1,493    1,675    1,869    2,075    2,292    2,520    2,755\n    Other accounts \\2\\......................    1,029    1,107    1,188    1,267    1,350    1,431    1,510    1,589    1,666    1,743    1,813    1,880\n                                             -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n        Subtotal............................    1,759    1,963    2,190    2,425    2,670    2,925    3,185    3,458    3,741    4,035    4,333    4,635\nDebt Held by the Public.....................    3,720    3,618    3,473    3,297    3,066    2,835    2,584    2,312    1,992    1,640    1,267      865\nDebt Subject to Limit \\4\\...................    5,439    5,543    5,626    5,684    5,700    5,724    5,734    5,736    5,699    5,643    5,568    5,469\n \n                                                 FEDERAL DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCTS\n \nDebt Held by the Public.....................     44.3     40.9     37.5     34.2     30.5     27.1     23.7     20.3     16.8     13.2      9.8      6.4\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Excludes interest costs of debt issued by agencies other than the Treasury (primarily the Tennessee Valley Authority).\n\\2\\ Mainly Civil Service retirement, Military Retirement, Medicare, unemployment insurance, and the Airport and Airway Trust Fund.\n\\3\\ Mainly interest on loans to the public.\n\\4\\ Differs from the gross federal debt primarily because most debt issued by agencies other than the Treasury is excluded from the debt limit.

Mr. President, I have given the American people, as \nJohn Dewey said, ``the truth,'' because you look from 2000 right on \nthrough where they talk about the gross Federal debt, and the gross \nFederal debt starts up from the year 2000 and increases to the year \n2004 from $5.664 trillion to $6.029 trillion. It is the same for 2004 \nand 2005.\n  Yes. I will agree that the Congressional Budget Office shows a \ndiminution, a reduction, in the deficit from the year 2005 to 2009 over \nthe 4-year period. There is a saving or reduction in 2006 of $38 \nbillion; a reduction in the year 2007 of $57 billion; a reduction in \nthe year 2008 of $75 billion; and a reduction in the year 2009 of $100 \nbillion. So it is a cumulative reduction of $270 billion.\n  They talk about a $2.9 trillion surplus? At best they could talk, \nunder the Congressional Budget Office, about $270 billion.\n  The reason they even can find the $270 billion is the most favorable \nof circumstances. The most favorable of circumstances is, one, current \npolicy, as they say on one of the pages here. It says that it assumes \ndiscretionary spending will equal the statutory caps on such spending \nthrough 2002, and will grow at the rate of inflation thereafter.\n  That is the most favorable circumstance--no increases; just cap the \nspending, and adjust inflation thereafter for the first 5 years and \ninflation thereafter for the next 5 years. It assumes no emergency \nspending.\n  We have already seen that they are calling, as the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois was pointing out, the census an emergency. They \nhave veterans' benefits as an emergency and they have everything else \nas an emergency. It assumes also that there is no tax cut and that the \ninterest rate stays the same. You have all of these favorable \nassumptions, and at best, under the Congressional Budget Office, a \nsaving of $270 billion rather than $2.9 trillion.\n  I have been trying my best to get a time to get on this floor. I \nthank everybody for the simple reason that the best of circumstances \nhere are that, yes, inflation is low; interest rates are down; \nunemployment is down; employment figures are up. We have the best of \ncircumstances, to President Clinton's credit. Yes, the deficits have \nbeen coming down.\n  Having said that, as Alan Greenspan said earlier in the year, let's \nstay the course. Let's stay the course and make sure we continue this, \nif there is ever a time to pay down the bill--I am glad the Senator \nfrom Illinois touched on this--the interest costs.\n  I was a member of the Grace Commission against waste, fraud, and \nabuse. We created during the 1980s the biggest waste in the world by \nvoting a 25-percent across-the-board tax cut. Here we are about to \nrepeat the crime. That is a crime against common sense. It is a crime \nagainst future generations. There isn't any question about it.\n  But everybody is talking about a tax cut. Republicans are talking one \ntax cut. The Democrats are talking, the White House is talking, and \neverybody is talking tax cut when in reality we don't have any taxes to \ncut. We don't have any revenues to lose. Everybody knows that. We \ncreated the biggest waste in that year. The interest costs are \npractically $1 billion a day on the national debt.\n  On the same page as we have included in the Record, page 19, you will \nsee in the 10-year period, from 2000 through 2009, we spend on interest \ncosts--total waste--$3.4441 trillion for nothing over the 10-year \nperiod.\n  They are talking about fanciful surpluses out of the atmosphere that \ndo not exist, and otherwise not talking about the tremendous waste for \nthe crass hypocrisy of this monkeyshine of politics that we have to \nsomehow neutralize the Republican tax cut with our tax cut. Come on. \nCan't we neutralize ourselves with the truth for a change? We are \nspending $3.4 trillion.\n  I see my distinguished colleague, the Senator from North Dakota, \nlooking. I must have already used up my time.\n\n[[Page S9330]]\n\n  I yield to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday on NPR's ``Morning Edition,'' \nKevin Phillips, a Republican author and commentator, had some \ninteresting comments, and I wonder if the Senator from South Carolina \nhad an opportunity to hear this Republican commentator discussing the \nHouse of Representatives tax cut.\n\n       Tax bills often deal with Pie in the Sky. The mind boggling \n     ten-year cuts passed late last week by the House of \n     Representatives however deserve a new term: Pie in \n     Stratosphere.\n\n  He points out that the top 1 percent would get 33 percent of the tax \ncuts; the bottom 60 percent get only 7 percent of the tax cuts.\n  I thought the last paragraph of this Republican commentator was \ninteresting:\n\n       We can fairly call the House legislation the most \n     outrageous tax package in 50 years. It's worse than the 1981 \n     excesses, you have to go back to 1948, when the Republican \n     80th Congress sent a kindred bill to President Harry Truman. \n     Truman vetoed it, calling the Republicans bloodsuckers, with \n     offices in Wall Street. Not only did he win reelection, but \n     the Democrats recaptured Congress. We'll see if Bill Clinton \n     and Albert Gore have anything resembling Truman's guts.\n\n  This is from a Republican commentator. He points out the amount of \nthese tax cuts extending 10 years into the future, by economists who \npredict these surpluses; economists who can't remember their phone \nnumbers and their home addresses are telling Americans that in 3, 5, 10 \nyears in the future we will have big surpluses. What do we do? The \nHouse of Representatives says: Give most of the surpluses back to 1 \npercent of the people.\n  A Republican columnist, Kevin Phillips, says it is the most \noutrageous tax package in the last 50 years.\n  Can the Senator from South Carolina comment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will comment, too, on what the Senator from Illinois \ndiscussed about the lockbox and why we can't talk. We couldn't talk \nabout lockbox, and we couldn't get cloture for the simple reason they \nwould not allow my amendments. I gave them notice. I sent a ``Dear \nColleague'' letter to all Senators. I said, No. 1, I will put in a true \nlockbox. It was worked out with the Social Security Administration. Ken \nApfel, who used to work with me when I was chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, is now the Social Security Administrator. The only way to \nget a true lockbox is to not double the counting and say, I saved it, \nbut then spend it. On the contrary, actually require the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to deposit those amounts each month, place the Treasury \nbills you have to issue for the debt of Social Security back into the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  Somebody says: Wait; what are you going to do with that money? Do \nexactly what all pension reserves and insurance companies do: Keep it \nthere--what we did for 35 years, from 1935 to 1968, until this changed \nin 1969. I was going to put a cap on the debt. They think it is a \nsurplus. Say whatever the debt is as of September 30th, in 2 months' \ntime, cap it off. Say that can't be exceeded. Put that limit there and \nfind out who is telling the truth.\n  They are talking surpluses. I am saying it is deficits. It is debt \nincreases.\n  Also, cut out the monkeyshine. The distinguished Senator from New \nMexico and I had challenged the late Senator Chiles when he was \nchairman of the Budget Committee and he started using different \neconomic assumptions. We lost on appeal of the ruling of the Chair, but \nwe came around with 301(g) and wrote in the Budget Act that you \ncouldn't have the new economic assumptions different from those in each \nparticular budget resolution. These are the things we wanted to put in \nwith respect to getting truth in budgeting when we passed Gramm-Rudman-\nHollings back in 1985.\n  We have gone totally astray--the White House, Republican and \nDemocrat, the news media--until this morning. That is my point. I thank \nthe Wall Street Journal, I thank the Washington Post for finally \nreporting some of the truths out here. If we can't level with the \nAmerican people, no wonder they are talking about ``what kind'' of tax \ncut. They all want to pay down the debt. When they use the expression, \n``pay down the debt'' or the ``public debt,'' it doesn't pay any debt \nat all.\n\n  Those T bills come due during the next 10 years and are not renewed. \nIn the meantime, while they are not being renewed, the debt is \ntransferred over to Social Security and other trust funds, so we owe \nSocial Security this very minute $857 billion; by the year 2009, we \nwill owe Social Security $2.7 trillion. Then they talk not only of \nsurpluses but saving Social Security, how we have extended the life of \nSocial Security, when we have actually bankrupted the blooming program.\n  Mr. President, $2.7 trillion by 2009; we get to 2013, when they \nreally need the money, and it will be over $3 trillion. What Congress \nwill find $3 trillion to start paying the benefits? This is serious \nbusiness.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have one question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, our side hasn't had 1 minute \nof debate on this; the other side has used up 45 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 2 additional minutes so that the senior Senator \nmay answer a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Has the Senator heard from his people that they are \nclamoring for the tax cuts? Has he heard from his people who are \nearning in the high dollar amounts, and who will benefit from this, \nthat they want the tax cuts?\n  Someone earning $800,000 a year is going to get back $22,000 a year, \nand someone earning $30,000 gets back $100 bucks. Are the phones in his \noffice ringing off the hook with people asking for these tax cuts and \nto forget about Social Security and Medicare?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Senator and will limit my \ntime so the Senator from Wyoming can take the floor.\n  The answer is, no, the phone is not ringing off the hook. I had this \nin the campaign for reelection last year. I put in a value-added tax in \norder to retire the deficit and the debt. Of course, I was called \n``High Tax Hollings.'' I said, rather than tax cuts, we ought to get \nrid of the national debt and the waste of interest costs of $1 billion \na day. I was reelected.\n  We have the most Republican of all States. South Carolina is the most \nconservative of all States.\n  Somehow the truth is coming around to the American people, or at \nleast to the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal as of this \nmorning. I thank them for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9330-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9330-S9334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from South Carolina for \nhis comments. As the accountant in the Senate, I appreciate when others \njoin in the debate about the accounting issue, that if there is a \nsurplus, why is the national debt going up? It is a very simple test. \nIt is printed in the Record.\n  It is our duty to be sure there is good accounting around here; that \nwe aren't keeping two sets of books; that we aren't borrowing the best \nof each world. The articles mentioned, I point out, said everybody is \ninvolved in this. The President is even accepting the best of both \nworlds so that things can be done this year rather than future years \nwhen a more accurate surplus shows up.\n  The best anybody is estimating now is $3 trillion in surplus. This is \nsupposed to be a true surplus after Social Security. We are almost $6 \ntrillion in debt. Even if all the surplus went to debt, we would still \nbe $3 trillion in debt. That is a lot of money.\n  However, what we are talking about today isn't whether it is true \nsurplus or not. We are not talking about spending down the national \ndebt. We are talking about spending versus tax relief. Taking away from \ntax relief by the Democrats isn't with the intent of paying down the \nnational debt. It is to put the money into new programs. We already \nhave programs not adequately funded\n\n[[Page S9331]]\n\nin this country. We have programs we have dedicated ourselves to in the \npast that are not adequately funded.\n  We keep hearing ideas from the other side. We all have ideas about \nhow to spend our money. We hear the ideas for new spending programs, \nwhich we will also inadequately fund. However, it is spending versus \ntax relief.\n  If Members are confused, it is confusion in the rhetoric just heard: \nspending versus tax relief. We are saying there will have been a true \noverpayment of $3 trillion. That is an overpayment of your tax money.\n  Do you want that spent on new programs, or do you want to get some of \nit back? That is the issue.\n  If we are truly talking about paying down the national debt--Senator \nAllard and I have a bill that calls for paying off that national debt. \nIt does not call for just paying down the national debt, but it calls \nfor paying off the national debt over a 30-year period just as you pay \na house mortgage. We are all familiar with that. It has been talked \nabout on this floor this morning. It would pay it down like a house \nmortgage with 30 years of payments.\n  How do we do that? We take $30 billion of that a year, plus the \ninterest we save by paying down the debt, and we pay it off over a 30-\nyear period. It does not have all the pain everybody talks about, but \nit is something we owe to future generations. It was not the future \ngenerations who spent the money; it was us. We have an obligation to \nstart the payments. We are buying a house for future generations, and, \nyes, they will have to make some of the payments on it because it \nextends over 30 years. But we can pay off the national debt, and we can \ndo it and still have money to do some of the other things.\n  There is a bill that will put that on 30-year payments. I hope the \npeople will pay a little bit more attention to it while we are touting \npaying off the national debt. That should be an important factor for \nus. That is not what the debate is about. The debate is about spending \nversus paying back overpayment of taxes.\n  I listened to these 45 minutes of speeches that preceded me, and it \nappears to me the Democrat definition of wealthy is anyone who pays \ntaxes: If you pay taxes, you ought not get any back; we just have to \nworry about the poor.\n  Everybody in this country gets something from the Government--\neverybody. As we look at the other people, sometimes it appears as if \nthey are getting more, but everybody gets something from the \nGovernment. We are in a situation in this country where almost half the \npeople do not pay taxes. When that slips over half in a democracy, in a \nrepublic where we vote for our elected officials, what will be the sole \nsource, the sole reason, for that vote? Whether we pay taxes or not. \nThere will always be some paying taxes, and those who pay the taxes \nwhen there is an overpayment ought to receive some of their money back.\n  The President has been saying he wants to save Social Security first, \nthat he wants to extend the life of Medicare second, and let me--it is \na little confusing what comes third; I think it is spending and then \ntax relief.\n  I have listened to two State of the Union speeches where the message \nwas: Save Social Security first. I am still waiting for the plan, a \ntrue plan. I have seen the plan where money is taken from Social \nSecurity and put into the trust fund and then a check is written for \nspending, and all the trust fund winds up with is IOUs. That is the way \nit has been, it is the way it is, and it is the way the President wants \nit to be.\n  You can take that money and, instead of putting it back into regular \nspending, you can put it back into Social Security. This is the \ngreatest pyramid scheme that has ever happened. You can show where you \nget that trust fund up a couple trillions of dollars, and it is just by \nspending the money in the trust fund and putting it back in again. It \nis the same money being counted time after time. We cannot put up with \nthat. That is not true accounting. That is what we have been talking \nabout this morning. That does not save Social Security.\n\n  We do have a crisis coming up in Social Security. There are at least \nfive plans on Social Security. The best of each of those plans can be \ncombined into one, and we can save Social Security first.\n  Medicare is extremely important. There are a lot of people relying on \nit. Do my colleagues know what the biggest debate in Medicare is these \ndays? How we can spend more money, how we can include more people, \ninclude more benefits. And we are still leaving those people who are \nreally counting on Medicare dangling. We have a trust fund that we are \nspending. It is revolving, too. We have to quit doing the IOUs.\n  There is something else that is a little misleading on this tax \npolicy. This is not a Republican plan; this is a bipartisan plan which \npassed out of the Finance Committee. If my colleagues will check the \nWashington Post that everybody seems so intent on quoting this morning, \nthey will find a guest editorial by Bob Kerrey who explains why the tax \nrelief package is important and why he voted for the tax relief \npackage. It is a bit more complicated than anything I am interested in, \nbut every Senator does not get his own way on a tax package, and I am \nwilling to recognize that.\n  Again, we need to save Social Security, we need to strengthen \nMedicare, we need to take care of debt reduction, and I have already \nsuggested a way that might be done. There is a bill that will do that \nrelatively painlessly over a 30-year period. I do hope that, instead of \ngoing into a whole bunch of new spending programs, some of which are \nvery new and not well thought out, we will look at tax relief for every \nAmerican taxpayer as the money is available, and that is giving a tax \nbreak to those who are paying the tax.\n  I also want to talk about small business and individual death relief. \nIt is a big issue in my part of the country. Most of Wyoming is small \nbusinesses. Those small businesses are sometimes retailers, sometimes \nmanufacturing, quite often they are ranches and farms.\n  Let me tell you what happens when the head of household dies. The IRS \nestimates the value of his property--estimates it. I have not heard \nanybody saying that those estimates are low. They estimate the value of \nthe property, and that family sells off part of the land or all of it \nto pay that tax debt. If one sells off a part of a ranch or a farm, \nquite often what they are left with is not economically viable. In \nfact, in the current economic situation there is a lot of question \nabout the economic viability of the future of our family farms and \nranches. There is tremendous concern for that.\n  We also have this death tax we impose by IRS estimates at the time of \ndeath. If I were involved in the Finance Committee final decisions on \nthese things, the way I would work that is not to have an estimate at \nthe time of death. Instead, I would have the real value at the time \nthere is any sale. If that stays in the family, it keeps the same basis \nit always had and they do not have to estimate it. When the property is \nsold, when the business is sold, you are not eliminating an \neconomically viable business at that point in time. At that point in \ntime, you are just collecting the revenues for a true value on a sale. \nThere are other ways that can be enhanced, and I hope in an incremental \nway they will be.\n  I see the Senator from Texas is here. I have joined her in working on \nmarriage tax penalty relief, a grossly unfair situation in the United \nStates. We are not putting our tax policy where our mouth is. We are \nsaying we want stronger families in this country, and then we are \npenalizing marriage. We cannot have that.\n  There are a number of changes that need to be made in our tax policy. \nWhen I came here, I was very naive. I anticipated that Senators sat \ndown in little groups and talked about policy like this and then \ncrossed outlines and added words and came up with bills on which people \nagreed. I am a little disappointed in how much cross-communication \nthere is here.\n  I congratulate the Finance Committee for the work they did on this \ntax package. It is a bipartisan tax package. I hope people will work to \nimprove it, that they will work not only on the Senate side but they \nwill work on the other side of this building. Often it looks to me as \nif we have more conflicts between the House and Senate than we have \nbetween Democrats and Republicans.\n  When one is listening to the rhetoric on whether we are going to \nspend,\n\n[[Page S9332]]\n\nwhich is the reason for not doing tax relief, or do tax relief, pay \nattention to the debate, and, yes, my colleagues will hear some \ndissension among the Republicans, probably because we understand taxes \nand want to come up with the best possible plan, the best possible way \nto deal with any overpayment that comes up.\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \ntalking about the tax cuts and why we need them because we heard a lot \nof debate this morning about that very issue.\n  I think we are getting down to the core issue between how the \nDemocrats on their side of the aisle would spend taxpayer money and how \nthe Republicans would spend taxpayer money.\n  I think you can tell right off the bat what people are going to think \nabout tax cuts by how they describe them. When they talk in terms of: \nHow much is it going to cost us to give tax cuts to the American \npeople, right away you know they believe the money you earn belongs to \nthem.\n  We believe the money you earn belongs to you. We do not think we have \na choice to take that money and go spend it on some program that you \nmay or may not like. But if you had the choice of whether to spend $500 \nto take your children on a vacation or to make a car payment or to save \nfor a downpayment on a home, or a program that may or may not affect \nyou, most people would rather make the decisions themselves.\n  So let's talk about some of the issues that have been raised this \nmorning.\n  First of all, if I heard ``reckless'' one time, I heard it 100 times \nthis past weekend. Let's talk about ``reckless.'' We have $3 trillion \nestimated as our surplus. Let's talk about how we are going to spend \nthat, and let's see if it seems reckless.\n  We are going to set aside 75 cents of every dollar of the surplus for \npaying down debt, for strengthening Social Security, for spending on \nMedicare, education, and other sources. That will be 75 cents on the \ndollar to pay down debt, strengthening Social Security, strengthening \nMedicare, and other spending items.\n  And 25 cents of every dollar is going to be given back to the people \nwho earned it. So 75 percent to pay down debt; 25 percent given back to \nthe people who earned it.\n  We are not a corporation. We do not have a choice of what to do with \nprofits. We take just as much money as we are going to need to fund \nlegitimate Government programs and services. That is what governments \ndo. Anything left over goes right back to the people who earned it.\n  Right now, the people of our country are paying more in peacetime \ntaxes than ever in our history. They deserve to have some of that money \nback. Many families have two income earners just to cover the taxes so \nthey can keep their quality of life for themselves and their children. \nWe want them to have the quality of life they choose, not by taking \ntaxes from them but by letting them decide how they spend the money \nthey earn.\n  I am reading a headline in the Washington Post that says: ``Clintons \nPlan Appeal to Women on Tax Cut.'' They make the argument that we are \nnot going to do anything for Medicare, and if we do not strengthen \nMedicare it is going to hurt women the most because they live longer.\n  I agree with the premise that women live longer, and cutting Medicare \nso that it is not there for them would hurt women the most, but that is \nnot what the Republican plan does. The Republican plan does set aside \nthe money for Medicare.\n\n  I would ask the President, when he is talking about strengthening \nMedicare, why he chose to disregard his own Medicare trustees and the \nbipartisan plan they supported that would have strengthened Medicare on \na bipartisan basis and would have given prescription drug help to those \nwho need it that was agreed to by both sides of the aisle in Congress; \nand yet the President walked away from that Medicare reform. Today he \nis saying our plan does not help Medicare, when he had a chance to help \nMedicare and he walked away from it--a bipartisan effort of Congress to \nsave Medicare.\n  I do not think the President can have it both ways.\n  Let me tell you what our tax plan does for the women of our country.\n  No. 1, we eliminate the marriage penalty tax. If a policeman marries \na schoolteacher, they owe $1,000 more in taxes to the Federal \nGovernment because they got married. The highest priority the tax cut \nplan has is to eliminate that penalty. I would say that is very good \nfor the women of our country because they are often the ones who are \ndiscriminated against with the marriage penalty tax. We are going to \ncorrect that with our tax cut plan. I think that is good for the women \nof our country.\n  No. 2, I have introduced a bill for the last 3 years that would allow \nwomen who leave the workplace and have children and decide to raise \ntheir children, either 6 years before they start school or even 18 \nyears if they decide to, when they come back into the workforce they \nwould be able to buy back into their pension plans as if they had not \nleft.\n  You see, women are discriminated against in our country, in the \npension system especially, because they are the ones who live the \nlongest and they have the lowest pensions. They have the lowest \npensions because women are the ones who have children and who stay home \nto raise them for at least part of the early years, and they never get \nto catch up under the present system.\n  I commend Senator Roth for making that a priority in the Senate tax \ncut bill, that we would stop discrimination in the pension plans of \nwomen in the workforce by allowing them to catch up.\n  So I think we have done a lot for women. We are setting aside the \nmoney to strengthen Medicare; $500 billion over 10 years for added \nspending on Medicare, education, defense. We need to have that \ncushion--$500 billion.\n  In addition to that, we set aside all of the Social Security \nsurplus--every single penny. We fence it off for Social Security \nbecause that is the No. 1 concern, and it is the No. 1 stabilizing \nforce for the elderly in our country. That is the first priority in our \nwhole plan. Also, $2 trillion goes directly to Social Security reform \nand stabilization. That will be fenced off.\n  The other $1 trillion we want to divide among spending increases and \ntax cuts. We believe it is a balanced plan. We believe the American \npeople deserve to have back in their pocketbooks the money they earn in \norder to make the decisions for their families. Also, we have been \nespecially attentive to trying to bring equality for women back into \nthe system.\n  It is the Republican Congress that gave women the right to contribute \nequally to IRAs. Before we had our tax cut plan 2 years ago, women who \ndidn't work outside the home could only set aside $250 a year for their \nretirement security; whereas, if you worked outside the home, you could \nset aside $2,000 a year. That has gone away. We have equalized women \nwho work outside the home and women who work inside the home with our \nIRA spousal opportunities.\n  Now we have to go back and help them on pensions, too. That is where \nthe lion's share of the stability is for our retired people. It is in \ntheir retirement systems. That is where women have been hit the hardest \nbecause it is women, by and large, who have the children and who will \nstay home and raise them. I applaud the men who do this, and I \nappreciate them, but by and large, it is the women who do it. When they \ncome back into the workforce, they are penalized by not being able to \nhave the opportunity to buy back into their pension system so they will \nhave stability when they retire.\n  Our bill does target women. It is a balanced bill. It saves Social \nSecurity. It contributes to more Medicare. It allows for added \nspending, and it gives tax cuts to the working people who earn this \nmoney. We don't own this money. The people who earn it own it. That is \nthe difference I ask the people of our country to look at as we go \nthrough this debate.\n  Listen to how people talk about tax cuts. If they talk about what it \ncosts the Federal Government, then they don't think your money belongs \nto you. If they talk about it in terms of how do\n\n[[Page S9333]]\n\nwe best give it back to the people who own it, then you know we are \nlooking out for the hard-working American who owns the money and wants \nto do his or her fair share to contribute to government but isn't \nlooking to finance a landslide.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question on the amount of \nmoney that a person who earns $800,000 a year gets in a tax break \ncompared to the person who earns $30,000? Will she answer that \nquestion?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, I will answer that question because the Senator \nfrom California raises a good point. You have to look, in an across-\nthe-board tax cut, at what people are paying in taxes. A family of four \nwho makes $30,000 doesn't pay taxes. I am glad they don't.\n  Mrs. BOXER. They certainly do pay taxes. Under your plan, they get \nback $121 of their hard-earned income. Under your plan, the $800,000 \nperson gets back $22,000. If you earn a million, you get back $30,000. \nI think when the Senator says hard-working Americans, she is talking \nabout, in their plan, hard-working, very wealthy Americans, \nunfortunately, leaving out the bulk of the people.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Actually, I think the Senator from California is \noverlooking the fact that everyone gets an across-the-board tax cut. In \nfact, in the Senate plan, it is weighted toward the lower levels \nbecause you only have the 1-percent decrease in the 15-percent tax \nrate.\n  The average person who pays hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes \nis going to receive about $400 in tax relief in the Senate plan. The \nHouse plan is different. The House plan gives 10 percent across the \nboard based on how much you pay, which I think is fair. I think \neveryone should get the benefit according to what they have paid.\n  The Senate plan is very heavily weighted. I am surprised the Senator \nfrom California would oppose something that does help people at the \nlower end of the scale.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, read the CBO estimate. If you earn \n$30,000, you get back $121. That is it. If you earn $800,000, according \nto CBO, you get back an average of $22,000.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much does the person pay at $30,000, and how much \ndoes the person pay at $800,000?\n  Mrs. BOXER. They pay sales taxes. They pay income taxes. I say to my \nfriend, this bill is so unfair to the average working person that the \nwealthy people get back twice as much as someone working full time on \nthe minimum wage. I look forward to this debate.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I look forward to the debate as well. I think it is \nvery important that we give across-the-board tax cuts, and I think \neverything that we can give back to the people who earn it is something \nI am going to support.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Texas for her \nremarks, and I also thank the two Senators from Wyoming for their \nremarks this morning regarding tax cuts.\n  Our economy has been doing well. It is an unprecedented time of \neconomic growth. Whenever our economy does well, everybody does well. \nPeople who are poor do well. You can break it out to any type of \neconomic group you want, but everybody does well because the total tide \ncomes up.\n  I happen to believe our economy is doing well because we have worked \nhard in the last decade, decade and a half, to hold down taxes, to \nreduce the regulatory burden, and to promote good economic growth.\n  The last effort by the Republicans in the Congress to make sure we \ncontinue to have good, strong economic growth in this country was when \nwe dropped the capital gains rate. Nobody is talking about the profound \nimpact that reducing the capital gains rate has had on this country's \neconomic growth. Historically, every time we have dropped capital \ngains, whether it was during the Kennedy administration or whether it \nwas during the Reagan administration--in some cases, I have seen that \nhappen in my own State of Colorado--revenues to the Federal Government \nincrease.\n  Today tax revenues to the Federal Government are at a historic high. \nThere is a windfall. There is more money coming into the Federal \nGovernment than any of us would have imagined. I think we need to give \nback some change to the American people. It is their money. They worked \nhard to earn the money. Consequently, I think they should be the \nprimary recipient of a windfall.\n  The people of Colorado were blessed because a Republican legislature, \nwith a Republican Governor, returned dollars that came in unexpectedly \nas revenues to the State of Colorado. They returned it to the taxpayers \nof Colorado, the people who earn the money, who pay taxes. I happen to \nthink my State of Colorado, under their leadership, has set a great \nexample for the country. I certainly hope this Congress will move \nforward with a meaningful tax break that will make a difference in \npeople's lives.\n  We hear a lot of figures thrown around here on the floor. We just \nheard an example of some of the numbers that had been thrown around \nthis morning and then this afternoon about what is happening to our \nbudget.\n  We have figures that have come out of OMB. We have figures that have \ncome out of CBO. Let's just take one agency so we are comparing apples \nwith apples and oranges with oranges. I don't think it is fair to pick \nsome of the figures out of OMB and then some of the figures out of CBO \nand make comparisons. We need to go with one agency.\n  Let's make a comparison between what the President has done with his \nplan and the Democrat Party, and what the Republican leadership is \npushing for. Let's take the figures from the Congressional Budget \nOffice and see what they look like, comparing the President's budget \nwith what the Republicans are putting together and what they would like \nto see happen for the future of America.\n  The President's budget, as reported in the latest report issued by \nCBO, on July 21, 1999, would leave a public debt of $1.80 trillion in \n2009. When you compare that to the Republican proposal, it is over $200 \nbillion higher than the amount left under the congressional budget \nresolution and the tax cut.\n  Let's look at the President's budget in terms of the total surplus \nunder CBO's scoring. CBO says the President's budget saves just 67 \npercent of the total surplus. Now, that compares to a 75-percent saving \nof the total surplus by the congressional budget resolution and tax cut \non the Republican side. President Clinton's budget contains $1 trillion \nin new spending. I think this issue is really more about spending than \nabout taxes. The President wants to have the money so he can continue \nto spend more and more. We have heard from the big spenders. They would \nmuch rather increase spending than cut taxes. I think we ought to cut \ntaxes instead of increasing spending.\n  President Clinton's budget, again, contains $1 trillion in new \nspending. That is 25 percent larger than the Republicans' $792 billion \nreconciliation tax cut. President Clinton's budget increases taxes by \n$100 billion over the next 10 years, according to the CBO report, in \ncontrast to the largest middle-class tax cut since Ronald Reagan that \nis being offered by the Republicans. President Clinton's budget spends \nthe Social Security surplus, the off-budget surplus, for fiscal years \n2000, 2004, and 2005 by a total of $29 billion. Now, that is in \ncontrast to the congressional budget resolution and tax cut where the \nSocial Security trust fund is not raided at all in any year.\n  Even Democrats don't agree necessarily with their own President on \nhis obsessive stand against tax cuts. I can think of one problem to \nwhich a Democrat, a friend of mine with whom I serve on the \nIntelligence Committee, who also happens to be on the Finance \nCommittee, refers. He says: ``To me, cutting taxes when we have $3 \ntrillion more coming in than we forecast in the neighborhood''--he is \ntalking about his $800 billion tax proposal--``is hardly what I call an \noutrageous, irresponsible move.''\n  Some of the Members of the Senate on the other side who have been \ntalking this morning are talking about more spending as opposed to \nwanting to cut taxes. They say they are willing to run on that agenda. \nI am willing to take our agenda as Republicans and put it up against \nwhat the President is proposing in his plan for the American people. \nThis Republican Congress, I\n\n[[Page S9334]]\n\nthink, has the right message and has the right approach for protecting \nthe future of America.\n  I think this is great. I am willing to brag about the fact that we \nprotect every cent of Social Security's $1.9 trillion surplus in every \nyear, which adheres to the spending agreement reached with the \nPresident in 1997. It also leaves $277 billion to finance emergencies \nand other priorities, like Medicare and prescription drugs, or simply \nadditional debt reduction, yet still proposes returning $792 billion of \nthe $1 trillion personal income tax overpayment to the taxpayers--I \nwill run on that. I would be glad to run against any Democrat who would \ncome up and say that he supports the President's plan which proposes to \nincrease taxes by $100 billion over the next 10 years, a plan that, \ndespite the largest Federal budget surplus in history, wants to \nincrease taxes, wants $1.1 trillion more spending than a Congress which \nis adhering to the 1997 budget agreement, which raids Social Security \nfor $30 billion over the next 10 years, which retires over $200 billion \nless in public debt than the Congress, and which would still not \nprovide a single cent in net tax relief, despite a $1 trillion personal \nincome tax overpayment.\n  I would be glad to run on that. It amazes me that as we get closer to \nthe election, more and more of the debate gets to be toward cutting \ntaxes. But when we are out from the election, then people criticize \nRepublicans. Other Members in this body, on the other side, criticize \nRepublicans for trying to do the responsible thing and recognize that \nthe windfall that is coming into the Federal Government, the windfall \nthat is coming into the States, actually belongs to the people. They \nare the ones who worked hard and the ones who earned it.\n  I want to come down on the side of many of my colleagues on the \nRepublican side who have argued for a tax cut. I think we can do that \nand pay down the debt. As Senator Enzi mentioned in his comments \nearlier this morning, we can do both. We can pay down the debt. We can \nprovide for a tax cut, and that is the responsible thing to do. To say \nthat the responsible thing to do is more spending, I believe, is \nirresponsible.\n\n  I want to let it be known that I am strongly in favor of a tax cut, \nand I am strongly in favor of paying down the debt. I believe we can do \nboth.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9334-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when the tax reconciliation budget comes \nbefore the Senate tomorrow, I plan to offer an amendment which will \nprovide for a lockbox on the Social Security surplus; that is, all the \npayroll tax surplus that would otherwise go to the Social Security \ntrust fund would be locked into that trust fund. The amendment also \nprovides that one-third of the onbudget surplus be set aside for \nMedicare.\n  Why am I doing that? Very simply, Mr. President, because I believe \nthat as we leave this century and this millennium and as we move into \nthe next century and the next millennium, we are faced with a historic \nopportunity to make decisions that are going to either correctly or \nincorrectly affect lots of Americans.\n  What do I mean? Very simply this. A little history first:\n  About 18 or 19 years ago, after the 1980 elections, this Congress \npassed a very large tax reduction bill--very large--proposed by the \nPresident and passed by this Congress.\n  What happened as a consequence of that very large tax cut in 1981? I \nthink all commentators will agree--at least a vast majority of \ncommentators will agree--that it caused the deficits in this country to \nshoot up and the national debt to rise. That tax cut was accompanied by \na big increase in defense spending. I am not going to quarrel how much \nthat increase was correct or incorrect. But the agreement is--and by \nfar most people agree--that as a consequence of that action deficits \nrose dramatically.\n  If we add up the annual deficits beginning with President George \nWashington and continuing every year through all the Presidents in \nAmerican history, up through and including Jimmy Carter, they total \nabout $1 trillion.\n  In 1988, when Congress passed a tax cut, what happened? The national \ndebt shot up. Why? Because deficits shot up. The national debt in 1980 \nwas about $1 trillion. Twelve years later, the national debt was about \n$5-, $6- or $7 trillion. It increased $4- or $5 trillion, from $1 \ntrillion to $6- or $7 trillion in that 12-year period--a huge national \ndebt--and we are paying interest on that national debt in the \nneighborhood of $267- to $280 billion a year. That is what happened.\n  What did Congress do? It passed two tax increases. The Republican \nPresident, Republican Congress, passed two tax increases. There was a \nsignificant tax increase in 1982 because the deficits were going out of \nsight and, in 1984, another tax increase with the Republican President, \nRepublican Congress because the deficits were still going out of sight. \nThat is what happened in the 1980s when Congress was tempted and \nsuccumbed to the get-rich-quick siren song with huge tax reductions. \nThat is what happened: instant gratification. However, the future kids \nand grandkids paid for it in the national debt increase. We passed on \nthe burden and gave it to ourselves, saddling the future with the \nburden. That is what we did in 1981, pure and simple.\n  In 1999, what happened? Through a lot of factors, including the \nDemocratic President and the Democratic Congress in 1993, we enacted a \nlarge deficit reduction, half tax increases and half spending cuts. \nEconomists agree, as a consequence of that, the national deficit \nstarted coming down. The debt starting coming down.\n  That is not the only reason the debt started coming down. The economy \nwas doing pretty well. Interest rates were down, probably because the \nmarket saw the President was going to get a handle on spending and \nhandle on the deficit because the deficits were so high. With \nincreasing technology and globalization, American firms became much \nmore competitive in competing in world markets. The American economy \ndid very well in the last several years as a consequence of all those \nfactors. Incomes have gone up, payroll tax revenues have gone up, and \nincome tax receipts have gone up.\n  What does that mean today? In 1999, we are projecting a $3 trillion \nsurplus over the next 10 years. Mr. President, $2 trillion of that is \npayroll tax revenue increases, which we all agree will go to the Social \nSecurity trust fund; $2 billion of the $3 billion comes from payroll \ntaxes, and we all agree it will go to the Social Security trust fund. \nThat leaves $1 trillion in the surplus. That $1 trillion is generated \nby income tax receipts.\n  The question before the Congress is: What are we going to do with \nthat $1 trillion? That is the question. As we are poised to move into \nthe next millennium, I say we ought to make careful decisions about \nthat. We better not\n\n[[Page S9335]]\n\nblow it. We better be careful, be prudent with the taxpayers' money, \nand do what is right.\n  What is right? I have two charts. The first chart shows the proposal \nthat will come to the floor tomorrow, passed by the majority party, \nthat will provide for a huge tax cut of $792 billion over 10 years. You \nhave to add back $179 billion in interest over 10 years on the national \ndebt because of the tax cut. That means the debt will go up, with more \ninterest payments to make. What does that leave? That leaves $7 billion \nless after 10 years. That is all.\n\n  Man, oh, man, I could stand here for days and days and talk about the \nproblems with that proposal. Let me mention a few. No. 1, this is only \na projection. We have no idea what the surplus will be over the next 10 \nyears. It is just a guess. Most commentators think the economy is \noverheated now. Maybe there is a bubble economy, and maybe the economy \nwill not do so well over a good part of the next 10 years compared to \nthe last 5 or 6 years.\n  This is a projection. What do we do with the projection? We are \nlocking in tax cuts for the future, offset by a hope that we will have \nthe revenues to pay for it. That is what we are doing. That is one \nthing that is wrong with this: A tax cut in place by law, offset by a \nhope that the money will be there--and it probably won't be there.\n  Second, I point out that the tax cuts are, in fancy parlance, \nbackloaded. Most go into effect near the end of the 10-year period, \nmeaning in the next 10 years, boy, we will really pay. That is when the \ndeficit will start to increase. I said ``deficit'' increase, not \n``surplus.''\n  The next chart shows that the baby boomers will start to retire about \nthe year 2010, and in 2020 and 2030 most baby boomers will be hitting \nretirement age. That is when the tax cuts go into effect an even \ngreater amount, meaning we have less money to take care of the baby \nboomers.\n  I say the size of this tax cut is much too much. Alan Greenspan does \nnot agree with it. He says now is not the time for a tax cut because he \nknows it will tend to put upward pressure on interest rates. We all \ndon't want to see an increase in interest rates.\n  In addition, there is nothing left over for Medicare. Medicare is an \nextremely important program for Americans. Ask Americans which national \nprograms they think make the most sense, and most, I daresay, think \nSocial Security is one and Medicare probably is another. Before \nMedicare went into effect, 50 percent of seniors had no health care; 50 \npercent had no health care benefits or programs when Medicare went into \neffect. Now virtually every senior has some kind of health care \nprogram.\n  What are the current problems with Medicare? There are several. Let \nme name three. No. 1, it does not provide for prescription drugs. \nSenior citizens get drugs when they are in the hospital, but Medicare \nwill not pay for prescription drugs when they are out of the hospital. \nThere is zero payment under Medicare for prescription drugs.\n  We all know that health care is changing in America. It is changing a \nlittle bit more from procedures and a little more toward drugs, DNA \nbenefits, and things of that nature. Drugs have become much more \nimportant. That is one problem with Medicare. We have to provide for \nprescription drugs. Medicare does not now provide for outpatient \nprescription drugs.\n  No. 2, this Congress cut back on Medicare payments too much in 1997 \nwith the so-called Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Medicare payments to \nhospitals increased significantly, I think on average about 10 percent \nover the 1990s. Now it is negative, it is cut back, because of \nprovisions this Congress enacted a couple of years ago, which were too \ngreat, too much. We all hear it from our hospitals back home, whether \nthey are teaching or rural hospitals, that it has been too much. That \nhas to be dealt with. The majority budget does not deal with it, which \nis another reason for my amendment.\n  No. 3, Medicare is in trouble, folks. We all talk about Social \nSecurity. The Social Security trust fund will not reach zero deficit \nfor 20 or 30 years. The Medicare trust fund will come down to zero, \ndepending upon who is making the estimates, perhaps 12 or 15 years from \nnow, much sooner than the Social Security trust fund.\n  I say, therefore, we should pay attention to Medicare. The amendment \nI will offer will provide that one-third of the on-budget surplus, one-\nthird of the $1 trillion, will be dedicated to Medicare.\n  I know the arguments. We have to have structural reform of Medicare \nfirst before we can put more money into Medicare. I think most agree we \nneed both structural reform and additional money for Medicare. When we \nin the Congress begin to address structural reform in Medicare, my \nguess is we will probably not have money anyway so it is good to set \naside one-third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare.\n  If we do not need that one-third at the time, we can send it back to \nthe people in tax cuts or we can use it for veterans' care or for \neducation or for whatnot.\n  In summation--and I thank the Chair for his patience--at the \nappropriate time, I will be offering an amendment along with Senator \nConrad to provide that one-third of the on-budget surplus be dedicated \nto Medicare along with the off-budget surplus dedicated to Social \nSecurity. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Mr. President, there is an old saying most of us \nlearned as children that goes: If it sounds too good to be true, then \nit is. The news we have been hearing about bigger than expected budget \nsurpluses for the next 10 to 15 years is precisely that--too good to be \ntrue.\n  Why is that? After all, our economy is strong and is still growing, \nunemployment is at record lows, and the strength of our economy means \nour Government is able to take in more revenues from taxpayers and \nbusinesses alike. Most people would say things are wonderful. Indeed, \njust ask anyone. Ask the President. Ask Congress. They will tell you \nthere is money for increased spending, there is money there for tax \ncuts, and we will be able to meet all our needs. After all, we have \nthese enormous surpluses for as far as the eye can see.\n  The truth of the matter is, there is no budget surplus. Let me say it \nagain: There is no budget surplus. The truth is, we are actually \nrunning a budget deficit this year. According to both CBO and OMB, as \nthis chart from CBO shows, we currently have an on-budget deficit of $4 \nbillion, and the only way the President, or anyone else, can claim a \nbudget surplus today is by taking that surplus and accumulating the \nSocial Security trust funds and using it to mask the deficit, just as \nwe used Social Security to mask the deficit in 1988.\n  I recall, as Governor of Ohio, everyone celebrating the great budget \nsurplus. The fact of the matter is, in 1988, we were $30 billion in the \nhole, and what we did with that $30 billion in the hole was mask it \nwith Social Security. For over three decades, Presidents and the \nCongresses have been using this gimmick: unifying the budget in order \nto make budget deficits smaller than they really are.\n\n  It is disingenuous. It continues to jeopardize the stability of the \nSocial Security trust fund, and it is about time we had our lockbox. \nThe American people are smarter than Washington politicians give them \ncredit. They know their Social Security pension funds are being raided \nfor other Government spending programs. They are mad about it, and they \nwant us to stop doing it.\n  We need to get honest budget surplus numbers, and in order to do \nthat, we need to leave Social Security alone and pay attention to \ncreating an on-budget surplus.\n  But here is the President's 15 years of projected surpluses. The \nwhole bar is the unified surplus. The green part is the off-budget \nSocial Security trust fund, and the red part is the true on-\n\n[[Page S9336]]\n\nbudget surplus. As the President says, there is going to be $6 trillion \nby the end of fiscal year 2014. But under his projections, he will have \nan on-budget surplus of $2.868 trillion. The rest of his projection is \nSocial Security.\n  Look at the line on this chart. It is not until fiscal year 2011--\nfiscal year 2011--before we even see 50 percent of the projected on-\nbudget surplus. In other words, in order to get this great surplus we \nare supposed to have during the next 15 years, it is not going to be \nuntil 2011 that we are actually going to have 50 percent of the on-\nbudget surplus available to us.\n  We will have to go into the 12th year of the President's 15-year \nprojections to get a majority of those surplus dollars. How can we in \ngood conscience talk about spending increases or tax cuts today when we \ndo not even start to get the majority of the money until 12 years from \nnow? It is inconceivable. That is the next President--8 years if he \ngets reelected--and then we are into a new President.\n  The most frightening aspect of all this is numbers are just \npredictions. They are not real. But both the Congress and the President \nare treating their projections as if they are gospel truth, and each is \ncontemplating major fiscal decisions based on their particular beliefs \nand projections. That is not sound public policy.\n  In fact, last week, CBO Director Dan Crippen said in testimony before \nthe Senate Budget Committee that ``10-year budget projections are \nhighly uncertain'' and that ``economic forecasting is an art that no \none has truly mastered.'' That is from the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, the man in charge of making Congress' \nsurplus projections.\n  Indeed, as most economists will tell you, the only thing predictable \nabout projections is their unpredictability. So how can we be sure that \n5, 10, 15 years from now we will actually have these budget surpluses? \nThe truth is that we cannot.\n  In testimony before the House Banking Committee, Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan said:\n\n       . . . it's very difficult to project with any degree of \n     conviction when you get out beyond 12, 18 months.\n\n  Twelve to 18 months--not 5 years, 10 years, 15 years. He said 12 to \n18 months.\n  In addition, he stated that\n\n       . . . projecting five or ten years out is very precarious \n     activity, as I think we have demonstrated time and time \n     again.\n\n  When the Nation's premier economist warns Congress not to invest in \nlong-range projections, it makes sense for us to listen.\n  If we think back, we will remember it was only 2 years ago that CBO \nwas projecting huge increased budget deficits as far as the eye could \nsee. In fact, in 1997, CBO projected a $267 billion budget deficit for \nfiscal year 2000. Think of it. But today, CBO is projecting a $14 \nbillion surplus for fiscal year 2000--a $281 billion swing in just 2 \nyears.\n  If you think a 2-year swing of that magnitude is incredible, in just \nthe last 6 months, President Clinton's budget projections put together \nby OMB have swung by a mind-boggling $1 trillion--a trillion dollars. \nThat is more than 10 percent of our national gross domestic product.\n  The important thing to remember is that a $1 trillion paper surplus \ncan vanish just as easily as it appeared, and if we commit to spending \nhundreds of billions of dollars we do not even have yet, we are placing \nour Nation's economic future in serious jeopardy.\n  As former Senators Sam Nunn and Warren Rudman wrote in the Washington \nPost:\n\n       The surplus is only a projection that cannot be spent. If \n     spending is increased or taxes are cut based on the \n     expectation of huge surpluses and the projection turns out to \n     be wrong, deficits easily could reappear where surpluses are \n     now forecast.\n\n  Given all that uncertainty about whether or not we will have a budget \nsurplus next year, it makes the most sense for us to remain cautious. \nWe should wait and see if the budget surplus we are currently \nprojecting for fiscal year 2000 even materializes before we embark on \nnew spending programs, as the President and the Democrats in Congress \nwant to do, or cut taxes as Republicans are proposing.\n  As Chairman Greenspan said:\n\n       I see no reason why we have to make decisions crucially at \n     this point until we are sure that we really have got the \n     surplus in tow.\n\n  That is Alan Greenspan who has been keeping things in pretty good \nshape for us the last several years.\n  Why does the President feel the need to quickly spend the surplus we \nmay achieve over the next 15 years? Why are we talking about cutting \ntaxes by $800 billion over 10 years when we do not have the surplus in \nhand yet? I think eliminating the death tax, relieving the marriage \npenalty, and lowering income-tax rates are great ideas, but how are we \ngoing to pay for them?\n  Personally, I do not think we have any business talking about new \nspending increases or tax cuts so long as we have this gigantic \nnational debt. Right now, our Nation faces a whopping $5.6 trillion \nnational debt, a debt that has risen 600 percent over the last 20 \nyears.\n  I remind my colleagues, with each passing day, we are spending $600 \nmillion a day just on interest on the national debt--$600 million a \nday.\n  Most Americans do not realize that 14 percent of their tax dollar \ngoes to pay off the interest on the debt, 15 percent goes for national \ndefense, 17 percent goes for nondefense discretionary spending, and 54 \npercent goes for entitlement spending.\n  Look at this pie chart: entitlements, 54 percent; interest on the \ndebt, 14 percent out of every dollar. We are only spending 15 percent \non national defense--and the President knows we need to do better in \nthat regard--and nondefense discretionary spending, 17 percent.\n  We are spending more on interest payments today than we spend on \nMedicare. We are spending five times as much on interest than we spend \non education; 15 times as much as we spend on research at the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  Even if the on-budget surpluses do happen to come true, then what \nbetter way to keep our economy humming and secure for the future of our \nchildren and our grandchildren than by paying down the national debt.\n  Indeed, as Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan testified before the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee:\n\n       [T]he advantages that I perceive that would accrue to this \n     economy from a significant decline in the outstanding debt to \n     the public and its virtuous cycle on the total budget process \n     is a value which I think far exceeds anything else we could \n     do with the money.\n\n  I think we have a problem. Do you really think that Congress would \nmake the tough choices we are going to need to make to get rid of $27 \nbillion this year in order to maintain the budget caps? I do not think \nit is going to happen. I think many people today are saying that for \ndefense spending, to deal with Medicare, we are probably going to have \nto break the caps.\n  If we break the caps, the $14 billion surplus of next year is gone; \nit is gone. We need to recognize there is no surplus. And if the \neconomic circumstances provide an on-budget surplus--and, boy, we would \nlove to have that--we need to use that money to pay down the debt: no \nspending hikes, no tax cuts, just pay down the debt.\n  If the President and Congress need an example, all we have to do is \nemulate what most American families do when times are good and they \nhave extra money. They do not go out and start spending wildly. They \nlook to pay off their debts--credit cards, loans, and mortgages. It is \nthe responsible thing to do, and it is something that Government must \ndo.\n  It was interesting. I was at a meeting the other day and asked the \npeople at the table: What do you think about reducing taxes, with this \nprojected surplus? And they came back to me--conservative businessmen--\nand said: You know, usually you reduce taxes when the economy is in \ntrouble.\n  One of the gentlemen said: You know, today what people are concerned \nabout is Social Security, and they are concerned about Medicare.\n  It doesn't make any difference whether they are old or young. If they \nare young, they are worrying about their parents in the future.\n  At this stage in the game, it seems to me the best thing we can do is \ncool it. I urge my colleagues to stop and look at the projected numbers \nbecause they are not real. And if we continue to treat them as if they \nreally are, the consequences of spending money we do not have will be \nvery real and, I think, very bad for the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S9337]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, do I have any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and one-half minutes remain.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I would prefer not to yield because I promised the \nSenator from Louisiana that she would have time. So I would rather not \nyield at this time.\n  I yield to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding that the Senator from Louisiana is \ngoing to be recognized for 10 minutes. I would like to ask, how much \ntime remains on the Democratic side under this morning business \nsegment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is not allocated to the parties. It \nwas allocated to the individual Senators who requested the time. The \nSenator from Ohio has been using some of the time from the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Ohio for recognizing that I \nwant to speak for 10 minutes. I would be happy to yield several minutes \nto the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me say at the outset to my friend, the Senator from \nOhio, what a breath of fresh air he is. I commend him. I believe his \nstatement is as forthright as any given on the floor concerning the \nstate of the economy, whether we have a real surplus or we do not, and \nwhat is the prudent thing to do. Because what the Senator from Ohio \nlearns when he goes home is the same thing I have learned as a \nDemocratic Senator going home to Illinois: People do not have this \npassion for tax cuts or brand new spending programs.\n  The first thing they say to me is: What are you going to do to get \nrid of this national debt, this debt that started off at $1 trillion at \nthe end of President Carter's administration and is now over $5 \ntrillion? I say to the Senator from Ohio, it is my understanding that \nthat debt costs us, as taxpayers, $1 billion a day. They net it out, \nbecause we earn interest as taxpayers, and state it is only $600 \nmillion. But the debt itself costs us about $350 billion a year.\n  The businesspeople and families I speak to in Illinois have the same \nresponse that the Senator from Ohio has spoken to on the floor: What \nare you going to do to get rid of this debt so our children are not \nburdened with these interest payments? We are really trying to square \naway the books from the last 20 years.\n  What the Senator from Ohio said on the floor, I think, is a very wise \ncourse of action. That should be our highest priority: reducing the \ndebt and keeping our obligations to Social Security and Medicare.\n  I do not want to put words in the mouth of the Senator from Ohio, but \nmy fear is those who anticipate surpluses that may not materialize \ncould put us on a bad track. We could be headed back toward deficits, \ntoward red ink, and toward an economy we do not want to see.\n  The same business people I speak to say, there may come a time, if we \nhave a recession, when a tax cut is the right medicine because it would \ngive the American families more money to spend and bring us out of a \nrecession. But certainly we are not in those days now.\n  We have a strong economy, a vibrant economy; and, if anything, the \nfear is it may overheat with too much demand. If that happens, the \nFederal Reserve Board steps in and raises interest rates, which \npenalizes every family with an adjustable mortgage and business people \nwho are trying to keep and expand their business.\n  The Senator from Ohio has really laid the basis for a sensible \nbipartisan approach. I hope we can work together, as we have in the \npast. I have admired his independence and the fact that he has been \nvery forthright in his views. I listened carefully to what he said \nduring the course of his statement. I think it really provides a common \nground for a bipartisan approach that really is good for the economy \nand good for future generations.\n  As I see the Senator from Louisiana is prepared to speak, I yield \nback the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I commend the Senator from Ohio for his remarks about \nthe importance of our Social Security surplus and preserving it so we \ncan invest and strengthen something the American people and the \nAmerican families have come to rely on and to appreciate. It is \nactually something that sets us apart from many nations in the world, \nthat we actually have a safety net that works for older Americans--to \nhonor the fact that they have worked hard through their lives, \nsometimes at minimum wage jobs, for 30 and 40 and 50 years.\n  We say, as Americans, if you are president of a corporation or if you \nare an owner of a small business, or even if you are a minimum wage \nlaborer, we want to have a retirement system that keeps you out of \npoverty when you are simply at an age where you cannot work and \nincrease your income.\n  So it is important to us. It is a value. It is something more than \njust a program. It is something more than just a Government program or \nan initiative. It is a value of America. I think both sides of the \naisle recognize that.\n  Although there are some differences in the way we would approach the \nspecific lockbox notion, we have made great strides in recognizing that \n$2 trillion of this $3 trillion surplus needs to be set aside for \nSocial Security. It is important for our Nation. Most certainly, it is \nimportant to people from Louisiana. I commend him and also commend the \nSenator from Illinois for underlining some of those points.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9337-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9337-S9338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TAX CUTS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I come to the floor today to talk about another \nparticular aspect of fiscal responsibility that is so important. We are \nin the middle of one of the most important debates of this Congress \nthat may have repercussions for the next generation or two, an \nopportunity that we haven't really had since 1981 when there was a huge \ntax cut, and, many of us think, an irresponsible tax cut given at that \ntime that drove our deficits tremendously upward and raised the debt of \nthis Nation.\n\n  We are now in the process of debating what to do with our great \nfortune, a real surplus in non-Social Security revenues. We know what \nwe want to do with the Social Security surplus, and that is to set it \naside to strengthen this program because it is a value that Americans \nshare. What do we do with the non-Social Security surplus?\n  I am one of the Members on this side who hope we can find some \nmeasure of tax relief for hard-working, middle-income, low-income \nAmericans, to do it in a way that helps to close the gap in this \ncountry between the haves and the have-nots, that helps our children in \nthe next generation to become part of this new economy. I hope we can \nfashion some smaller, responsible, well-thought-through, and careful \ntax relief for low-income and middle-income families that will help \nthem, their children, and their grandchildren to participate in perhaps \nthe greatest economic boom to ever happen in the history of the world, \nnot just in this Nation, not just in this democracy, not just in this \ncentury, but an economic prosperity that is unprecedented in the \nhistory of many nations.\n  What we want to do if we are going to have a tax cut--and I certainly \nsupport one that is responsible and along responsible fiscal lines--is \nto craft it in such a way that it helps to give our children and our \ngrandchildren the opportunity to participate by improving their skills, \nby improving their opportunity to create their own businesses, by \ncreating perhaps opportunities for them to participate in this new \neconomy.\n  One of the things that is very important to our generation and to the \ngenerations to come is reflected in a new poll that was just released \nthis week by Frank Luntz, commissioned by the Nature Conservancy, about \nfiscal responsibility. It is also about the Department of Interior, the \nappropriations bill we are going to be discussing for that Department \nalso this week.\n  One of the important issues is how we might reallocate surpluses in \nour continued quest for fiscal responsibility in this Nation, how to \ndirect\n\n[[Page S9338]]\n\nsome of the revenues coming into the Federal Treasury. A great source \nof revenue that has been coming into the Federal Treasury over the last \n50 years at about $4 billion a year--sometimes more, sometimes less--\nfor a total of $120 billion since 1955 has been money from offshore oil \nand gas revenues. That money, from the Outer Continental Shelf of the \nUnited States, primarily off the shores of Louisiana, contributed to a \ngreat deal by Mississippi, Texas, and Alaska, the producing States, has \ngone in the Federal Treasury and has been used basically for general \noperating funds.\n  I and many of my colleagues on this and the other side of the aisle, \na bipartisan coalition, think now is the time, as we debate what to do \nwith these surpluses, as we debate how to reallocate some of these \nrevenues, as we debate what are the proper investments to make in the \nnext century regarding tax reductions and investments in education, to \ntalk about making a strong, permanent commitment to our environment.\n  As the poll results I am going to submit for the Record this \nafternoon indicate, by a wide majority, Republicans and Democrats, \nyoung and old, people who live on the east coast and the west coast, \npeople who live in the flat plains and in the mountains overwhelmingly \nsupport a real trust fund and a real commitment to preserve parks, \nrecreation areas, open spaces, and wildlife in this Nation.\n\n  That is what one of the bills, S. 25, which has been moving through \nthis process both in the House and the Senate, will do. It would make \npermanent a source of funding from Outer Continental Shelf revenues \nwithin the framework of a balanced budget, in a very fiscally \nconservative way, by using these revenues that are coming from a \nnonrenewable resource.\n  One day these oil and gas wells are going to dry up. I spent my time \nand energy trying to take some of these tax dollars that are already \nbeing paid to invest in something that will last for generations to \ncome, something the American people want to pay for, something the \nAmerican people believe in; that is, creating open spaces for parks and \nrecreation.\n  I will submit this polling information for the Record. I rise to \nspeak for a few minutes about the importance of fiscal responsibility, \nabout a tax cut that could be meaningful, if it is done correctly, and \nabout the potential of using some of these dollars--not raise dollars \nbut redirect some of our dollars into a program that is so important to \nthe American people--full funding for land and water conservation, \nfunding for needs of coastal cities and coastal communities, and also \nwildlife conservation programs throughout the Nation.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI.

Mr. President, by any measure, this is an \nextraordinary time in the life of our country. It appears that as the \nAmerican century comes to a conclusion, the chances are good that what \nthe world is going to witness is simply another American century, where \nour dominance may be exercised by different technologies, our power may \nbe measured by different means, but our dominance is just as certain.\n  The quality of life in America is rising to new heights. Our economic \nstrength could be measured by many means, but it is considerable. Home \nownership is now at the highest rate in the Nation's history. In 6 \nyears the United States has created 18 million new jobs, more than all \nof Western Europe and Japan combined. Unemployment is near record lows \nin the postwar period--genuinely an extraordinary time. Nothing \nsurprises Americans more than that we are witnessing not simply the \ngrowth of an economy, employment and economic opportunities, but the \nFederal Government itself is participating in this extraordinary \ntransformation.\n  The United States is about to accumulate in our Government budget not \nonly the largest surplus in American history but the largest surplus in \nthe history of any nation in any government budget. Indeed, it is now \nprojected to be $1 trillion larger than was anticipated only several \nyears ago. By the year 2009, the total accumulated surplus of the U.S. \nGovernment could be an astonishing $2.9 trillion.\n  The fundamental question now before this Government as we begin to \nplan for the next decade, the beginning of a new century, is how to \nallocate these resources.\n  The U.S. Government is in a new experience. For more than 50 years we \nhave been in the business of allocating pain. The dominating issues \nbefore the U.S. Government were winning the cold war and overcoming the \nbudget deficit. All decisions were seen through these twin prisms. Many \nof our hopes and ambitions for our country and our people needed to be \npostponed.\n  In 1993, the Deficit Reduction Act was a defining moment in that \nstruggle. This Congress, with the Clinton administration's leadership, \nwas facing deficits as high as $300 or $400 billion per year. It was \nartificially raising interest rates, causing problems with private \ninvestment, and difficulties in economic growth.\n  The extraordinary vote of that year, passing each institution of the \nCongress by a single vote, did as much to change American economic \nhistory as any single act of the 20th century.\n  (Mr. CRAPO assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. For all of us who participated in the 1993 Deficit \nReduction Act, it is probably the singular achievement and the greatest \nsource of pride in our careers. For the American people, it is more \nthan a source of pride; it is a source of new freedom. These surpluses \nallow us to dream again about rebuilding schools, providing child care, \nimproving the quality of instruction, repairing American \ninfrastructure, funding higher education. Things that were postponed by \nall these years of debt, struggle, and sacrifice have been made \npossible again.\n  But it is important to remember in this transformation, in these last \n6 years, there are other heroes, too, more important than the Members \nof Congress who cast these votes--the people who gave up more and did \nmore to create this new American prosperity. They are simple American \nfamilies who did without Government programs, Government employees who \nsaw Federal employment decline, people who suffered at declines in \nGovernment spending in all measures, and American taxpayers who paid \nmore in Federal taxes to reduce the debt.\n  It is important to remember because, as we think about the \nopportunities for education and health care and other Government \nprograms this Federal surplus provides, so, too, is the American \ntaxpayer to be remembered. I do not quarrel with the administration--\nindeed, I support their notion--that the first obligation in committing \nthese new surplus funds is to protect Medicare and Social Security. It \nis our first obligation. It is not our only obligation.\n  Of the approximately $3 trillion of Federal surpluses to be allocated \nin the next 10 years, $2 billion of it will be required to ensure that \nSocial Security and Medicare are protected. But certainly, with the \nremaining $1 trillion in accumulated surpluses over the next decade, \nthere is the ability in this Congress to provide some tax relief for \nworking American families. The tax burden of the United States is now \nthe highest since the Second World War.\n  Middle-class families, who were once in low-income brackets, through \nprosperity and inflation, have seen themselves, while still facing the \nenormous costs of education and housing and the requirements of an \nordinary American life, facing tax brackets of 28 and 33 percent. \nToday, a family of four, living on a combined income of $72,000, which \ncan be the simple income of a schoolteacher or a police officer or a \npublic servant, is taxed at 28 percent, instead of the 15 percent which \nshould, and once did, represent the Federal tax rate of middle-class \nAmericans.\n  It is wrong--it is even unconscionable--to ask a young mother and \nfather trying to raise children, with the high\n\n[[Page S9339]]\n\ncost of living in the United States, to postpone educational decisions \nor housing decisions, the requirements of building a family, to pay a \n28-percent tax on a combined family income of $50,000, $60,000 or \n$70,000. It is not right. But mostly, with a Federal surplus of $1 \ntrillion in the next decade, after protecting Social Security and \nMedicare, it is not necessary.\n  I believe the first obligation of a Federal tax relief is to expand \nthe 15-percent bracket to genuinely include Americans who are in the \nmiddle class, to place them in the tax bracket where they belong. The \nRoth plan participates in this strategy by expanding the bracket and by \nlowering the 15-percent bracket to 14 percent. It is a good beginning, \nbut it is not a complete plan.\n  The other twin tax crisis in America is not high rates but \ndisincentives for savings which are causing a crisis in savings in \nAmerica. The national savings rate in the United States is now the \nlowest since the Second World War. In May, our national savings rate \nwas a minus 1.2 percent--a negative rate of savings not seen since the \nGreat Depression. It has no corollary in the Western World, and it is a \nlong-term, economic, Governmental and social problem.\n  Sixty percent of all Americans who retire rely solely on Social \nSecurity. More than 50 percent of Americans effectively have no net \nworth of any appreciable value, other than their home. It is a rational \neconomic response to a tax system that provides discouragement for \nsavings and encouragement for consumption.\n  I believe this tax reduction legislation about to be considered by \nthe Congress can provide a new beginning, first, by expanding the \ntraditional IRA from $2,000 to $3,000. It is notable that when the IRAs \nwere first instituted at $2,000, had they merely kept pace with \ninflation all these years, it would now allow for a $5,000 deduction \nrather than the continuing $2,000 level.\n  Second, people who accumulate $10,000 in a savings account in America \nto provide themselves some security from the crisis of life, or for \ntheir retirements or to prepare for their children's futures, should \nnot be taxed. The Federal Government has no business--indeed, it should \nhave a disincentive--to ever tax an American family who wants to save a \nmodest $5,000 or $10,000. We have an interest in them doing so and \nshould not be providing a disincentive by taxing them on the modest \ninterest they would accumulate. This simple provision of $10,000 in \ntax-free savings, exempting the first $500 in dividends and interest, \nwould make the savings of 30 million Americans tax-free.\n  Third, every American should be encouraged to participate in the new \nprosperity, burgeoning industries, new technologies, and growing \nmarket. The Federal Government should not be taxing the modest capital \ngains of people who earn $1,000, $2,000, or a few thousand dollars in \nthe stock market, or from the sale of real estate. We should be \nencouraging every American to participate by investing, to gather some \nwealth for their own security, so that in retirement they don't rely \nsolely on the Government, or continue to live paycheck-to-paycheck. \nEven if this accumulates only modest amounts of money in savings or \ninvestment, it is a beginning for a new economic freedom for American \nfamilies.\n  Many of these ideas were included in the tax reduction legislation I \noffered with Senator Coverdell. I am enormously proud that in Senator \nRoth's proposal, and indeed now in a bipartisan tax bill being \ndiscussed by Senator Breaux and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska, many of \nthese same elements are included. I am glad Senator Coverdell and I \nhave made that contribution.\n  But now the question becomes not simply which elements of Federal \ntaxes are to be reduced but by how much. Therein lies the argument. I \nbelieve, as many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have come \nto believe, that this Congress can responsibly afford, while protecting \nSocial Security and Medicare, to enact a $500 billion tax reduction \nprogram over the course of the next decade. That would allow an \nadditional $500 billion for discretionary spending, a prescription drug \nbenefit, or other national needs beyond protecting Social Security and \nMedicare. It is modest. But it would have an appreciable impact on the \nquality of life of American families, and genuinely give tax relief to \nmiddle-income Americans.\n\n  Finally, every Senator must come to the judgment about not only the \nsize of this tax relief program, which I believe should be $500 billion \nbut, indeed, where it should be targeted. It is middle-income families \nwho have seen the rates of their taxes rise through the years as they \nwere pushed into higher brackets by the cost of living and our national \nprosperity. They should be our first priority.\n  Our principal national economic problem, even in extraordinarily good \ntimes, is the collapse of national savings. Reduction in taxes on \nsavings should be a high priority.\n  But I believe, as many Democrats and Republicans have come to \nconclude, that most of this tax reduction program should be for people \nwho are paying most of the taxes in America.\n  In the 1993 bill, this Congress can be very proud that with the \nearned-income tax credit we reduced the burden and, indeed, gave \nassistance to lower income Americans. They deserved and needed the \nhelp. This tax program should be for people who are paying taxes, \nbearing the burden, and need the help.\n  This is an important moment for this Congress. This vote on a tax \nreduction program will say a lot about our priorities. We will chart a \ncourse for another decade.\n  I believe we can reach across this aisle and find a reasonable \ncompromise that gives genuine tax relief.\n  I want the people of the State of New Jersey to know that I have \ncommitted myself to be part of that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I was for 8 years before Governor of \nWest Virginia where we faced things such as 21-percent unemployment, \nand things which are almost Third World in their statistical \nsignificance compared to what most of my colleagues had to deal with.\n  Being able to look at a tax surplus or a projected surplus of a lot \nof money over the next number of years is a wonderful opportunity for \nthe people of my State and for the people of my country.\n  I have to say, though, the approach of the Finance Committee, on \nwhich I serve, voting a $792 billion tax cut is antithetical, to my \nthoughts, as to what is good for the country and good for the economy.\n  I will start off by simply saying the obvious; that is, as one of the \nsenior Members of the majority side of the Finance Committee said, 5 \npercent of Americans pay 95 percent of personal income taxes, and \ntherefore the money ought to go back to them. That is an odd way of \nthinking. That is certainly one way of thinking. It is obviously that \nSenator's way of thinking. It doesn't square with sort of the sense of \nfairness, equity, and distribution of equal opportunity in an economic \nsense as in other senses that I was brought up to believe in.\n  We have projected--and I underscore the word ``projected''--a surplus \nof $1 trillion over the next 10 years. The central question is: How do \nwe most responsibly spend this? I think it is a central question of \nhistoric importance.\n  For me there is really only one answer; that is, to pay down the \nnational debt.\n\n[[Page S9340]]\n\n  It is very hard for me to put into words the feeling of how far we \nhave come since the mid-1980s when we used to have those talks with the \nJapanese, the structural impediment talks in which they would tell us \nwhat they thought we should do and we would tell them what we thought \nthey should do and we never listened to each other. We, in fact, \nlistened to them in 1993, and on our own, in a historic vote, made an \nenormous beginning, later fueled by the private sector, to balance the \nbudget deficit. I didn't think that would happen when I was in the \nSenate. But we proceeded to take the action.\n  I myself was assigned the responsibility of cutting $60 billion out \nof Medicare, which at that time was a great deal of money, and we \nproceeded to do that. But never in my wildest dreams did I ever even \nbegin to think of the possibility that we might, in fact, be able to \npay down the national debt--the national debt which under the Reagan-\nBush administration rose to over $4 trillion. I can't contemplate \namounts of that sort. So I couldn't possibly contemplate the results of \neliminating amounts of that sort.\n  But we have a chance to do that. We have the chance to do it by the \nyear 2014 and 2015.\n  People talk a lot about taxes around here. To me, the greatest tax \nwill come if we pass the Republican tax package, if we ``give'' the so-\ncalled ``middle-income worker'' that kind of tax advantage because I \nthink it is false. In my State, where the average income is around \n$30,500, I think the average mainstream worker would end up losing $500 \nor $600 a year because interest rates would go up on car payments, on \nhome loans, on education loans, on credit cards, and all of those \nthings. Interest rates would go up because we know from what Greenspan \nsaid they would. They would probably go up by about 1 percent.\n\n  I think the average people in the State whom I represent would end up \npaying much more under the Republican tax cut plan than they would if \nwe opted to retire the debt because in that case, I think interest \npayments would go down, and those same people--having watched in \nwonderment what is or is not going on in Washington--would benefit from \nthe results of two things: Not only lower interest rates, which would \naffect them up to where they are fixed, but they would also benefit \nfrom an economy.\n  I try to contemplate this in my mind. Come the year 2010 or 2011 when \nthe world really begins to understand that America is dead tracked on \nthe idea of elimination of the national debt, what would happen to the \nnational economy?\n  My mind can't even bring that into consideration, except it is filled \nwith scenes of incredible entrepreneurial activities by people who are \nwilling to take risks, people who emerge from the hollows of West \nVirginia, from the deserts of Nevada, from all kinds of high plains of \nthe Northwest, or the northern middle west, and start doing all kinds \nof things which they have never dared do before base interest rates \nwere there to do it, where money is available, capital is available, \nand there is a sense of optimism in America, and what I have seen in \nthe last 8 years becomes almost a memory in terms of the optimism and \nthe incredible success and energy of that kind of new economy.\n  To me, paying off the national debt does two things:\n  One, it guarantees the economic future of the people whom I \nrepresent, who elect me to represent them; and it guarantees the \neconomic future of the entire country for perhaps a generation or two \nto come because we will have done something impossible--eliminate the \nbudget deficit, and then eliminate the national debt.\n  How would the markets respond to that? How would human nature respond \nto that? I only glory to contemplate what that might mean.\n  Second, I want to pay down the national debt because I don't want to \nspend money. I don't want to spend money on a whole lot of new things. \nI want to make sure that something called Social Security--the money \nfor that--and something called Medicare --the money for that--is there \nin the meantime, until those programs run out of money in a number of \nyears, as all of that money will be going into those trust funds, \nbuilding up and guaranteeing the future of Medicare and Social \nSecurity. That is a matter not of the energy of the American economy \nbut the depth of the American commitment, the social contract that we \nmade both with respect to Social Security and Medicare, both of which \nare going to need our attention and which need more funds. They would \nhave the funds under a system wherein one concentrated on paying down \nthe national debt.\n\n  In the Finance Committee, I originally was for a tax cut of only $250 \nbillion. I am for that today. That was a different tax cut from \nanything we are considering. I worry very much about Americans not \nsaving. I like the idea of Government matching any American who put a \ncertain amount of money into a savings account; in other words, to \nencourage something which we do worse than any other people in the \nworld, and that is to save money, putting money in the bank--not only \nfor one's own future but for the capital markets.\n  I want to see that. I want to see the marriage penalty tax eliminated \nso it does not become more expensive to get married, it becomes less \nexpensive to get married. If we put up a bill that had no tax cut at \nall, I would be tempted. I don't know, in the final analysis, if I \nwould vote for it, but I would be tempted.\n  I believe in paying off the national debt. I think the consequences \nof that are enormously exciting. Not contemplating the numerical \n``joust'' we play with each other over millions and trillions of \ndollars, the simple fact is that by the year 2014 or 2015 there would \nbe virtually no national debt remaining--less than 1 percent. That is \nthe single most exciting public policy event I can contemplate since I \nhave served in the Senate. My fear is that Congress is going to figure \nthis out but that Congress is going to figure it out too late, after it \nhas already done the damage.\n  I regret our failure so far to seize this once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity to pay off the national debt. I regret it for my State. My \nState is the oldest State, so to speak, in terms of population. It has \nactually surpassed Florida. That would naturally bias me in terms of \nSocial Security and Medicare. If I were from another State, I would \nfeel the same way, I believe.\n  Social Security has lifted two-thirds of Americans out of poverty. \nDoes one turn one's back on this? People voted for the $792 billion tax \ncut. But $2 trillion of the surplus already belongs to Social Security. \nThat is not on the table. Of the $1 trillion remaining, that can only \nhappen if we do draconian domestic cuts. I don't mean adding new \nprograms. I mean taking tremendous numbers of billions of dollars in \nevery single area for years and years and taking away from what we are \nalready doing.\n  I care passionately about veterans' health care as I have watched the \nveterans' health care system deteriorate in a variety of ways across \nthis country. We are not talking about increasing veterans' health care \ncosts. We are talking about tremendous cuts in those we already have.\n  Many Members have discussed the fact that a young mind is formed by \nthe time it is 3 years old, the importance of Head Start, the \nimportance of the Older Americans Act, the importance of low-income-\nhousing heating, housing, enterprise zones, law enforcement, the \nmilitary. All of these receive enormous budget reductions that would \nsustain themselves over a number of years. Over half a trillion cut \nfrom present spending in fiscal year 1999; the same on through fiscal \nyear 2002 and beyond that. CBO doesn't even choose to figure what \nhappens after 5 years. They say they have never done it before so why \nshould they do it now. I think that is an amazing way of thinking. That \nis what they say.\n\n  If we spend $792 billion on a bunch of tax breaks now before we even \nknow that the money is for real and that it will absolutely be there, I \ncannot in conscience, for the people I represent, believe that Medicare \nand Social Security will be anything under the great strain of reducing \nbenefits. I cannot bear to have that happen. I don't think anybody \nshould tell you otherwise.\n  I understand it is very easy to talk about a $792 billion tax cut. It \nis wonderful to sit in the Finance Committee and have people say we \nought to do\n\n[[Page S9341]]\n\nthis or that about ethanol and this or that regarding helping different \npeople, different groups. Sometimes people voting for the bill got all \nkinds of things implanted in the bill. That was nice. I am sure they \nwere good things.\n  How does that compare to the real possibility of setting America \nvirtually free economically, establishing our economic dominance for \nall time by retiring the national debt? Think how the markets would \nrespond to that. Think how capital overseas would flow into our \nmarkets, further enabling us to go out and build an even stronger \nAmerica, close the digital divide, to give everybody an equal \nopportunity--not guaranteeing that everybody succeeds but guaranteeing \neverybody has at least a chance to succeed.\n  I cannot allow NIH, Head Start, or education programs to take the \ntremendous reductions from their current level of funding by the \nFederal Government that would be required under the Republican tax cut. \nIt is phenomenal to me that people have not focused on this consequence \nof that $792 billion tax cut, a tax cut basically for the rich who \nalready have it, who have already gained by the system, who have \nalready gained through the last 8 years by the stock market increase.\n  What about the people who are working hard and who would receive a \n$188 tax increase compared to a $700 or $800 tax increase for people \nwho are very wealthy? I ask my colleagues to think about fairness. I \nask my colleagues to think about the consequences of a $792 billion tax \ncut, and I ask my colleagues above all and finally to think about the \nabsolutely extraordinary power of what would happen in this country if \nwe actually reduced the national deficit to virtually zero--deficit and \nthen debt. We can do both. Therefore, we shouldn't do the Republican \ntax cut.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9341-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9341-S9343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TAXES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from West Virginia. \nHis has been a lonely struggle on the Senate Finance Committee in the \nminority. I know what he has said today on the Senate floor is an \nexpression of his personal commitment and philosophy in the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  It is such an alluring possibility for politicians to vote for tax \ncuts. Can you think of two more exciting words for politicians to say \nother than: I'm going to cut your taxes--tax cuts? Yet we know it may \nnot be the most responsible thing to do on behalf of families across \nAmerica and the state of our economy.\n  What the Senator from West Virginia has said during the course of his \nremarks bears repeating. Look to the question of fairness. We have \nheard statements on the floor from Members of the Senate who have \nsuggested that taxes have gone up on American families.\n  It is interesting that when looking at facts we find something \ndifferent. A median-income family of four currently pays less Federal \ntaxes as a percentage of its income than at any time in the last 20 \nyears.\n  This data comes from the Treasury Department and the Congressional \nBudget Office. Lower-income families at one-half the median income \nlevel face a Federal tax burden which is the lowest in 31 years, \naccording to the Treasury Department. A family of four can make up to \nas much as $28,000 a year without paying Federal income taxes. For a \nfamily of four at twice median income, that would put them in the \nmiddle-income category. The average Federal tax rate will be its lowest \nin over a decade.\n  That is not to suggest families do not face a tax burden. They do. \nMany still pay the payroll taxes, some Federal income taxes, and State \nand local taxes.\n  The general increase in revenue to the Federal Treasury really is \nevidence of a strong economy where people are working, making more \nmoney, and perhaps doing better in the stock market than they had in \nprevious years.\n  When we talk about tax fairness, many of us believe if there is to be \nany tax cut, it should be directed to the people in the lower- and \nmiddle-income groups. Those are the first who should be served.\n  This chart illustrates what I mentioned earlier.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I have one quick point. People say we ought to have \na tax cut and we ought to give it back to the people who earned it. In \nother words, it is not the Government's money; it is their money.\n  I think one thing is interesting: How much is it their money as \nopposed to their children's money and their children's children's \nmoney. In other words, when we talk about protecting money for future \nprograms, such as Social Security and Medicare, we are not just talking \nabout those who pay taxes, whether they be rich or poor, but whether or \nnot their children and their children's children are going to have a \nreasonable shot at life. It is not just that we do not have money \nbecause we are living now and others are not, but we have to keep \nlooking toward the future and our responsibility to that future; is \nthat not right?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from West Virginia hits the nail on the head. \nIf we were to abandon our commitment to education, for example, in the \ncountry, it would be the most shortsighted thing in the world. It may \nreduce Government spending; yes, it may reduce taxation; but does \nanyone believe America would be a better country for it? I certainly do \nnot.\n  When we say to families we can give them a tax break this year, a tax \ncut this year or we can take the money and reduce the national debt, \nand by reducing that debt say to their children and their \ngrandchildren, you are going to have less to pay in taxes for interest \non the debt we accumulated in our lifetime, that to me is the most \npopular thing I have found as I have gone around the State of Illinois.\n  People are saying: Senator, before you start talking about new \nprograms or massive tax breaks primarily for wealthy people, shouldn't \nyou accept your responsibility to bring down this national debt that is \nover $5 trillion, a national debt that costs us $1 billion a day in \ninterest payments that are paid primarily to foreigners who hold the \nnational debt of the United States in Treasury securities and the like?\n  That to me is eminently sensible because when that debt comes down, \nwe reduce the need for $1 billion a day in taxes being collected across \nAmerica for interest and we reduce the Federal demand for money. When \nthe Federal demand for money goes down, the cost of money--that is, the \ninterest rate--comes down. Families benefit twofold: There is less of a \nburden when it comes to taxes for interest and paying off the national \ndebt and lower interest rates, which means homes are more affordable \nand small businesses and farmers can at a lower cost borrow money \nnecessary for their businesses. That to me is a sensible approach. In \nfact, let me go out on a limb and say it is a conservative approach.\n\n  The Democratic plan we are putting forward is the fiscally \nconservative approach to deal with the national debt. I am heartened by \nthe earlier statement of the Republican Senator from Ohio when he \nagreed with us. He believes, as I do and as Chairman Alan Greenspan of \nthe Federal Reserve Board has said, that our first priority should be \nthe elimination of that debt and keeping our commitment to Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  Do not be misled as you hear some of my colleagues say we have $3 \ntrillion in surplus and we ought to be able to at least give a third of \nit back to the American people. They do not tell you the whole story. \nAlmost $2 trillion, $1.9 trillion of the $3 trillion, is really money \nthat we virtually all agree should be dedicated to Social Security. We \ndo not want to raid the Social Security trust fund. People have that \nmoney taken out of their payroll for the purpose of making certain \nSocial Security is there in the future. Those who are counting that as \nsome sort of surplus really are not dealing fairly with the most \nimportant social program in America. So take off the table of this $3 \ntrillion surplus $1.9 trillion, leaving you a little over a trillion \ndollars.\n  Of that amount, how much are we going to dedicate for some very \nimportant things--paying down the debt or\n\n[[Page S9342]]\n\nMedicare? The Medicare system, if we do not touch it, by the year 2015, \nis going to be out of money. We have to decide whether or not we will \ndedicate a portion of our surplus to Medicare. Do we need to do more \nfor Medicare? Of course, we do. Beyond giving money to retire the debt \nand Medicare, we have to make some structural changes that may be \npainful, but they will be ever so much more painful if we do not \ndedicate a portion of our surplus to Medicare.\n  Also, we have to look to the basic needs of Government. The Senator \nfrom West Virginia has made this point. Every American expects the \nFederal Government to meet certain responsibilities:\n  National defense, of course; transportation.\n  We know what the Interstate Highway System has brought to America and \nthe demands for a more modern transportation system in every State--\nbetter highways, mass transit.\n  Fighting crime: The Federal Government played an important role with \n100,000 new cops, and we will continue that.\n  The whole question of what we are going to do in the area of medical \nresearch.\n  I commend my colleague, the Senator from West Virginia. It is an area \nnear and dear to the hearts of everyone with whom I have spoken that \nthe Federal Government press forward looking for cures for asthma, \ndiabetes, cancer, heart disease, AIDS, and the many things that \nchallenge us and our families.\n  We expect that Federal commitment and other regulatory \nresponsibilities. When we open that medicine cabinet, we hope, the Food \nand Drug Administration has done its job, that every prescription drug \nthere is safe and effective and that they have money to do it. The food \nwe eat is still the safest in the world and will continue to be.\n\n  If we go down the track that is proposed by the Republicans in their \ntrillion-dollar tax cut, we literally will imperil these programs. It \nis a fact of life. It will be Pollyanna-ish to suggest we can make a \ncut of $180 billion a year, as the Republicans have proposed, without \nhaving some impact on veterans programs, on Head Start, on \ntransportation, and medical research. That becomes a major part of this \ndiscussion.\n  Let's take a look for a moment, if you will, at what some of the \neconomists have said about the Republican tax bill. Fifty economists, \nincluding six Nobel laureates, have said:\n\n       An ever-growing tax cut would drain Government resources \n     just when the aging of the population starts to put \n     substantial stress on Social Security and Medicare.\n\n  That, of course, means as we have more and more people reaching \nretirement age and wanting to live their lives comfortably and \nindependently, Social Security and Medicare absolutely have to be \nthere.\n  The Republican approach to this, sad to report, not only does not \nprotect the Social Security trust fund; if you will look at this chart, \nwhen it gets into the red ink, it means the Republican tax break plan \nhas finally broken through and started using money from the Social \nSecurity trust fund. At the year 2005, the Republican tax breaks would \nraid the Social Security surplus. After all of the speeches they have \ngiven about lockboxes and protecting Social Security, they in fact turn \nto that money and pull it out in 2005, for what? To give tax breaks to \nthe wealthiest among us.\n  There is a commentator named Kevin Phillips who for years was \nidentified as a Republican. I do not know what his partisan \nidentification is, honestly, but I can tell you what he had to say \nyesterday on National Public Radio. It is something that every American \nshould hear. He was introduced by Bob Edwards, a familiar voice on \nNational Public Radio, who said:\n\n       The Republican Party last week had its tax reduction \n     proposal passed by the House of Representatives. Commentator \n     Kevin Phillips says it's the most unsound fiscal legislation \n     of the last half century.\n\n  I go on to read quotes from Mr. Phillips.\n\n       . . . that's because the cuts are predicated on federal \n     budget surpluses so far out, six, eight or ten years, that it \n     would take an astrologer, not an economist, to predict \n     federal revenues.\n\n  He goes on to talk about the fairness of the tax cuts. Kevin \nPhillips:\n\n       . . . Democrats are certainly correct about the imbalance \n     of benefits by income group. Treasury figures show that the \n     top 1 percent of families, just 1 percent, would get 33 \n     percent of the dollar cuts, the bottom 60 percent of families \n     get a mere 7 percent.\n\n  So if you are in the category of a Donald Trump or a Bill Gates, or \nsomeone else, this is worth a lot of money. The Republican tax break \nplan literally could mean $10-, $20-, or $30,000 a year. But if you are \na working family, struggling to make ends meet, putting some money \ntogether for your kid's college education or your own retirement, it \nturns out to be in the neighborhood of $20 or $30 a year. That, \nunfortunately, says a lot about what the Republican proposal would mean \nto the average family. To endanger our economic expansion, to possibly \nraise interest rates on home mortgages, business loans and farmers' \nloans, and to provide tax breaks which are amusing, at best, for \naverage working families, that does not sound like a very sound deal.\n  The Senator from West Virginia made the point, and effectively. We \nshould be dedicating these funds to retiring this national debt. It is \nstill hard to believe that only 2 years ago we were talking about \namending the Constitution for a balanced budget amendment because we \nwere so hopelessly ensnared by deficits--it was the only way out. Now \nwe are talking about giving money away at such a fast pace that we can \nendanger the economic recovery we have seen in the United States.\n  Let me read Kevin Phillips' conclusion in his remarks on National \nPublic Radio's ``Morning Edition'' on Monday, July 26:\n\n       We can fairly call the House legislation the most \n     outrageous tax package in the last 50 years. It's worse than \n     the 1981 excesses, you have to go back to 1948, when the \n     Republican 80th Congress sent a kindred bill to President \n     Harry Truman. Truman vetoed it, calling the Republicans \n     bloodsuckers, with offices on Wall Street.\n\n  Not my words--Kevin Phillips'.\n\n       Not only did [Truman] win reelection, but the Democrats \n     recaptured Congress.\n\n  I think that puts it in a perspective that we should all be willing \nto acknowledge. If we are going to deal responsibly with tax cuts for \nworking families, we have to do it in a way that does not tip the \nscales too heavily on the side of the wealthiest in America.\n  This is a good illustration: For the top 1 percent of wage earners in \nAmerica, under the Republican tax break plan, a $22,964 average \npayment; for the bottom 60 percent, families making less than $38,200 a \nyear--hold on to your hats, America--the Republican tax break plan \ngives you $139. That is a little over $10 a month. But look what Bill \nGates and other folks are coming out with. It is the same old story.\n  Take a look at when the Republican tax break plan starts to bite. If \nyou are in the baby boom generation, thinking about an idyllic \nretirement someday, right about the time you start to retire, the \nRepublican tax breaks explode.\n  What does it mean? It means that, frankly, there will be less money \naround for the basics of life that we expect from the Federal \nGovernment. It is hard to imagine that we are in a position, as we are \ntoday with this economic expansion, of jeopardizing it with this kind \nof a tax break plan. I think it is far better for us to take an \napproach which the President and the Democrats support--I am beginning \nto believe some Republicans support--which suggests that our priorities \nshould include Medicare, Social Security, and paying down the national \ndebt.\n  The Republican approach literally provides no money, no money \nwhatsoever, for us to take care of our Medicare obligation. I think it \nis just disingenuous for the Republicans to argue that they are only \nspending 25 percent of the surplus because we know that the unified \nsurplus is, in fact, including the $1.9 trillion in Social Security \ntrust funds. They talk a lot about lockboxes and protecting Social \nSecurity, and yet when it comes right down to it, when you look at the \nmoney available outside of Social Security, the actual surplus that we \nhope to imagine, 97 percent of it goes to the Republican tax cut and \nlittle or no money for Medicare and other national priorities.\n  This debate this week is critically important for all American \nfamilies to\n\n[[Page S9343]]\n\nsustain the economic expansion which we have seen for the last 7 years.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had not expected to talk this \nafternoon. But I am here. The Senator from West Virginia is here. I am \nthe ranking Democrat on the Veterans' Committee. I am overwhelmed with \nthe sense of urgency, and almost despair, about the condition of health \ncare for veterans in our country.\n  Because of caps, the veterans health care budget, which is really the \nmost important part of the veterans operation--benefits are important \nbut what they really care about is, is health care going to be there if \nthey need it?--has been flat-lined for the next 5 years. By flat-lined, \nI mean there is no increase. Even though there are more expenses, there \nis more requirement for their services, there is no more money.\n  The Veterans' Administration is the largest health care system in the \ncountry. The only difference from any other health care system is that \nit is entirely a Government health care system. Therefore, the \nGovernment determines what it can spend and what it cannot spend. \nUnlike the private health care systems, it cannot spend a dime over \nwhat it is appropriated. So the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, which \ncapped all discretionary programs--which said they could not increase--\nobviously, therefore, included the veterans health care budget.\n  I cannot tell you the damage that is being done to our veterans \nacross this country. We talk about veterans, and we talk about them in \nvery florid terms because they deserve that. Those who use the veterans \nhospitals, who have been in combat, who have sacrificed for their \ncountry--America kind of entered into a compact and said that these \npeople will be treated with a special respect, special honor, and \nspecial care, and that they will get the health care they need under \nall conditions and at any time.\n  The Republican tax cut, along with any other that might be suggested, \nincluding the one that is being talked about at $500 billion, would \nmake a mockery of that commitment to the American veteran. I want \npeople to understand that very clearly.\n  I will talk specifically about some particular types of needs, such \nas spinal cord injuries, injuries resulting in blindness or \namputations, posttraumatic stress disorder. Beginning in October of \nlast year, I asked my committee staff to undertake an oversight project \nto determine if the Veterans' Administration is, in fact, maintaining \ntheir ability to care for veterans with these kinds of special needs.\n\n  PTSD, posttraumatic stress disorder, we always associated with the \nVietnam war. We have discovered it is not just that war; it is the gulf \nwar, it is the Korean war, it is the Second World War, and it even goes \nback to the First World War. It is an enormous problem and a special \nneed.\n  This oversight project, which I asked my staff to do, reviewed 57 \nspecialized programs housed in 22 places around the country.\n  I say at the outset that the VA specialized services are staffed with \nincredibly dedicated workers, people who could be working for higher \npay in private situations, private hospitals. They are trying to do \nmore, and they are trying to do it with increasingly less. They are \noften frustrated in their desire to provide the high-quality services \nthat they went to the Veterans' Administration to provide in the first \nplace. I salute them.\n  I will mention three of the findings in this oversight effort, and \nthen that is all I will do.\n  First, the Veterans' Administration is not maintaining capacity in a \nnumber of specialized programs and is barely maintaining capacity in a \nnumber of others. Despite resource money shortfalls, field personnel \nhave been able--but just barely--to maintain the level of services in \nVeterans' Administration prosthetics, blind rehabilitation, and spinal \ncord injury programs.\n  Staffing and funding reductions have been replete. The VA's mental \nhealth programs are no longer strong. For example, my staff found that \nveterans are waiting an average of 5 and a half months to enter \nposttraumatic stress disorder programs. This is completely unacceptable \nfor a veteran.\n  Secondly, the VA is not providing the same level of services in all \nof its facilities. There is wide variation. Staff found this variation \nfrom site to site in capacity in how services are provided. The \navailability of services to veterans seems to depend on where they \nreside, not what they have done but where they reside. In my view, all \nveterans are entitled to the same quality of service regardless of \nwhether they live in West Chester County or in Berkeley, WV. It should \nmake no difference. They all have suffered the rigors of combat. They \nhave all earned it. We promised it to them. We are not delivering it to \nthem.\n\n  Third, and finally, competing pressures on Veterans' Administration \nmanagers make it virtually impossible for them to maintain their \nspecialized medical program. Hospital administrators particularly are \nbeing buffeted by competing demands because from central headquarters \ncomes the lack of money, from the veterans comes the demand for \nservices, which used to be there and which now aren't, and they are, \ntherefore, caught in the middle. In many cases, they are suffering \nacross-the-board cuts and have been for a number of years.\n  I can tell Senators that under neither Democratic nor Republican \nadministrations has the veterans' health care program been adequately \nfunded and funded up to the cost-of-living increase and the so-called \ninflationary aspect, which reflects what actually true health care \nrepresents. We are robbing Peter to pay Paul in many of our veterans' \nhospitals and to maintain other services on which a higher priority is \nplaced.\n  Mental health services, I come back to it. Why is it in this country \nthat we will not put down mental health as a disease? Why is it we do \nnot consider it as a medical condition? Why is it that we put it off in \nthe category of human behavior as opposed to something that has a cause \nin something, such as posttraumatic stress disorder. For veterans, to \nblindside mental health, to push mental health to the side is beyond \ncomprehension and beyond humanity.\n  In summary, it is imperative that we all understand what the budget \ncrunch has meant to each VA health service. I say all of this because, \nagain, of the $792 billion tax cut. If that takes place, everything I \nhave talked about not only continues to be true but grows somewhere \nbetween 15 and 30 percent worse, not if we are to increase programs, \nbut taking already that we are funding below where programs ought to \nbe, where we have shortchanged veterans' health care services for \nyears, and now we are going to cut billions and billions of more \ndollars out of that over these next years. That is absolutely \nintolerable.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print a copy of the summary of the \ncommittee minority staff report in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Minority Staff Review of VA Programs for Veterans With Special Needs\n\n\n                               background\n\n       From its inception, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \n     health care system has\n\n[[Page S9344]]\n\n     been challenged to meet the special needs of its veteran-\n     patients with combat wounds, such as spinal cord injuries, \n     blindness, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Over the \n     years, VA has developed widely recognized expertise in \n     providing specialized services to meet these needs.\n       In recent years, VA's specialized programs have come under \n     stress due to budget cuts, reorganizational changes, and the \n     introduction of a new resource allocation system. In \n     addition, passage of Public Law 104-262, the Veterans' Health \n     Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, brought significant \n     changes in the way VA provides health care services.\n       In passing eligibility reform, Congress recognized the need \n     to include protections for the specialized service programs. \n     As a result, Public Law 104-262 carried specific provisions \n     that the Secretary of VA must maintain the ``capacity'' to \n     provide for the specialized treatment needs of disabled \n     veterans in existence at the time the bill was passed \n     (October 1996), including ``reasonable access'' to such \n     services.\n       VA has been required to report annually to Congress on the \n     status of its efforts to maintain capacity, with its most \n     recent report published in May 1998. In that report, VA \n     stated that ``by and large, the capacity of the special \n     programs . . . has been maintained nationally.'' However, \n     others have been more critical, including the General \n     Accounting Office, which found that ``much more information \n     and analyses are needed to support VA's conclusion,'' and the \n     VA Federal Advisory Committee on Prosthetics and Special \n     Disability Programs, who called VA's ``flawed'' and \n     consequently refused to endorse VA's report.\n\n\n                         minority staff project\n\n       Beginning in October 1998, at the direction of Ranking \n     Member John D. Rockefeller IV, Senate Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs minority staff undertook an oversight project to \n     determine how well VA is complying with Public Law 104-262's \n     mandate to maintain capacity in the VA's specialized \n     programs. After first meeting with VA Headquarters officials \n     in charge. of the various specialized projects, as well as \n     representatives of the veterans service organizations, we \n     designed a questionnaire and interview protocol for each \n     of the five service programs we selected to study.\n       Our starting place was defining ``capacity,'' since the law \n     did not do so. After extensive consultation with experts in \n     the field, we chose to focus on the following six factors: \n     (1) number of unique veterans treated; (2) funding; (3) the \n     number of beds (if applicable); (4) the number of staff; (5) \n     access to care, in terms of waiting times and geographical \n     accesssibility; and (6) patient satisfaction. Capacity was \n     rated by comparing data from FY 1997 to FY 1998 to determine \n     whether the program has or has not maintained the same level \n     of effort in each of these areas.\n       In order to maximize efficiency, we primarily visited sites \n     that included more than one specialized program; most were \n     within reasonable geographical distance of Washington, DC. \n     The sites selected are not a random or representative sample. \n     Nevertheless, we believe the information gathered is \n     significant because we believe capacity should be maintained \n     uniformly throughout the system. There should be no gap in \n     services, regardless of where in the country a veteran goes \n     for treatment.\n       We reviewed 22 facilities, with a total of 57 specialized \n     services programs: Prosthetics and Sensory aid Services (16 \n     sites); Blind Rehabilitation (3 sites); Spinal Cord Injury (8 \n     sites); PTSD (14 sites); and Substance Use disorders (16 \n     sites).\n\n\n                      Data collection and Validity\n\n       Data collection and validity is a known area of VA \n     weakness, confirmed by our own observations in this study. \n     Despite the fact that we provided program managers ample time \n     to fulfill our data requests, many lacked the basic, everyday \n     data that should have been easily accessible to them. In many \n     cases, the data provided to us by VA were revised upon our \n     discovery of inherent discrepancies or our questioning of the \n     methodology used. Nevertheless, because it would have been \n     beyond the scope of our resources to conduct a full-scale \n     audit, we relied on the unvalidated data provided to us by VA \n     as the basis for this report.\n\n\n                        Findings and Conclusions\n\n       In general, we found that VA specialized programs are \n     staffed with incredibly dedicated workers, trying hard to do \n     more with less, but often frustrated in their desire to \n     provide high quality services. One of the most consistent \n     complaints we heard about were staffing shortages, which left \n     employees feeling they were working ``close to the edge.'' \n     When staffing is cut to the minimum, programs quickly become \n     vulnerable to disruptions and service delays, and staff \n     suffer from overwork, poor morale, burnout, and/or reduced \n     motivation and quality of performance as a result.\n       In summary, we reached the following conclusions:\n       I. VA is not maintaining capacity in a number of \n     specialized programs, and is barely maintaining capacity in \n     the others. We found that despite resource shortfalls, VA \n     field personnel have been able--just barely--to maintain the \n     level of services in the Prosthetics, Blind Rehabilitation, \n     and SCI specialized service programs, but have not maintained \n     capacity in the PTSD and Substance Use Disorder programs. \n     Because of staff and funding reductions, and the resulting \n     increases in workloads and excessive waiting times, the \n     latter two programs are failing to sustain service levels in \n     accordance with the mandates in law.\n       II. VA is not providing the same level of services in all \n     facilities. In the specialized programs we visited, there was \n     wide variation from site to site in capacity and provision of \n     services. It appears that the relative availability of \n     services to veterans depends on where they reside. However, \n     we believe all veterans are entitled to the same level and \n     quality of service, regardless of where they live in the \n     country.\n       III. A gross lack of data, as well as lack of validation of \n     the available data, prevents VA from making verifiable \n     assessments as to whether capacity in its specialized \n     services programs is being maintained. In almost every \n     program we visited, it was difficult to obtain the \n     information we requested, despite the fact that programs were \n     given ample time to complete the data sheets we provided. \n     Frequently, we were told data had been lost, was \n     irretrievable, or was not compiled in a useful format. There \n     were often inherent discrepancies in the data we were \n     initially presented that took a great deal of discussion to \n     resolve. Without solid, readily available data, VA cannot \n     itself ascertain whether it is meeting its own capacity \n     standards. In fact, this problem with data reconciliation is \n     one reason why VA is late in producing this year's capacity \n     report.\n       IV. VA's shift from inpatient to expanded outpatient \n     treatment has improved access and saved money. At the same \n     time, certain programs, which require a mix of in- and \n     outpatient services, have been weakened. We are concerned \n     that patient outcomes may have suffered in the process. VA is \n     struggling to find the right mix of inpatient and outpatient \n     services. Expanded outpatient services often improve \n     geographical access for veterans and are a good way to \n     stretch limited resources. However, we believe VA may be \n     moving too quickly to close certain inpatient programs, such \n     as PTSD and Substance Use Disorders. This trend is \n     controversial among many clinicians, who are concerned about \n     the appropriateness and effectiveness of outpatient services \n     for many in this patient population. We believe much more \n     research is needed in this area.\n       V. VA's specialized services suffer from a lack of \n     centralized oversight. As with all VA's health care services, \n     decentralization has resulted in a lack of effective \n     oversight. Headquarters issues directives, but for the most \n     part, there is little followup to monitor how well these \n     directives are being carried out. In addition, once money is \n     allocated to the VISNs, there is little or no monitoring of \n     how this money is being spent. As a result, we found that VA \n     is not in a position to say with any certitude whether or not \n     specialized services are being adequately maintained.\n       The lack of centralized oversight is particularly critical \n     in the PTSD and Substance Use Disorder programs. VA \n     Headquarters program consultants, by and large, are not \n     consulted when inpatient programs in the facilities are \n     closed or altered in size or format. We believe their \n     expertise should be sought before any decisions are made to \n     change established programs.\n       VI. Competing pressures on VISN directors make it virtually \n     impossible for them to maintain capacity in their specialized \n     service programs. VISN directors, particularly those most \n     affected by funding reductions resulting from VERA, are being \n     buffeted by competing demands for the declining resources \n     allocated to them. In many cases, they are suffering across-\n     the-board cuts, or may be having to ``rob Peter to pay Paul'' \n     to maintain other programs on which they place a higher \n     priority. With the lack of centralized oversight, VA has \n     little ability to ensure that VISN directors are spending \n     their money for specialized services as directed.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I will come to the floor and comment \ngenerously about this fiscal policy issue of $792 billion of tax cuts \nover the next 10 years. We don't have surpluses yet. We have economists \nwho tell us we will have surpluses and when these surpluses will exist \nover the coming 10 years. We have an appetite for trying to figure out \nwhat we want to do with all these surpluses that have not yet \nmaterialized.\n  Economists at the start of this decade in the early 1990s predicted \nalmost universally that we would have a decade of slow, anemic economic \ngrowth and continued trouble. Going back 8 years, we had a $290 billion \nfiscal policy deficit. The Dow Jones industrial average had not yet \nreached 3,000, or it had barely reached 3,000. We had sluggish growth. \nIn 1999, the budget deficit is largely gone. The Dow is somewhere close \nto 11,000. We have robust economic growth and economists predicting \nwonderful economic news as far as the eye can see. These are \neconomists--who can't remember their telephone numbers or their home \naddresses--predicting what will happen, 3, 5, and 10 years in the \nfuture.\n  The result is people seize on these surpluses and say: Let's give \nthree-quarters of $1 trillion in tax cuts, nearly one-third of which \nwill go to the top 1 percent of the income earners in this country. I \nwill have a lot more to say about that in the debate which will ensue \nduring this week. My colleague, Senator Durbin, just read Kevin \nPhillips' comments that were on NPR yesterday morning. I think they \nwere right on point. I hope we can spend some time discussing those as \nwell.\n  I want to talk about another deficit, one that both parties have been \nlargely ignoring. It is called the trade deficit.\n  I have here a Washington Post article that appeared last Wednesday, \nJuly 21, ``U.S. Trade Deficit Hit Record High in May.'' This was \nwritten by Paul Blustein. Paul is the Washington Post reporter who \nwrites their trade stories. Any time you see a trade story, it will be \nby Paul Blustein. He will talk to the same three or four people. They \nwill comment in each article, and month after month the trade deficit \nworsens.\n  We have a very serious problem. We tackled the budget deficit, and \nwrestled it to the ground. Now, we largely don't have a fiscal policy \nbudget deficit. It is gone. That was tough, hard work. But the trade \ndeficit is growing and at an alarming rate.\n  It is interesting that this story in the Washington Post actually \nsays that we have a trade deficit that is a record deficit, ``thanks to \nAmerica's unflagging appetite for foreign goods.'' The Post, in this \nstory, finds all of this both ``heartening'' and ``worrisome'' for the \nU.S. economy.\n  Heartening because so many Americans are feeling so prosperous that \nthey are buying an ever-rising amount of imports.\n  I am more struck by the ``worrisome'' aspects of this trade deficit. \nOne of those was highlighted by the Post article, with the Japanese \ndeciding that their central bank should intervene with respect to the \nvalue of the yen against the dollar--to manipulate the value of the yen \nin order to influence continued exports to the United States.\n  What is happening to the trade deficit? This chart shows record trade \ndeficits month after month. It means we are buying more from abroad \nthan we are selling abroad. It means we are running a current accounts \ndeficit that will some day be repaid by a lower standard of living in \nthe United States.\n  There is a lot of disagreement among economists but none about \nthat. A trade deficit must at some point be repaid in the future by a \nlower standard of living in the country that experiences the trade \ndeficit.\n\n  Here is a chart that shows the growing U.S. trade gap, exports and \nimports. You will see what is happening to the U.S. exports on this \nsoftening bottom line. And you will see what is happening to the level \nof U.S. imports and the massive red ink that represents indebtedness \nthat burdens this country. Should we worry about this indebtedness? The \nanswer is, yes, of course. Should we do something about it? Absolutely, \nand sooner rather than later. There is now in law a commission called \nthe Trade Deficit Review Commission. This is a piece of legislation \nthat I authored and was cosponsored by Senators Byrd, Stevens, and \nothers. This Commission has been impaneled and is now beginning its \nwork. But we have a responsibility as a country to respond to this \ntrade deficit and to do so aggressively.\n  Another chart shows the deficit with respect to specific countries. \nJapan: We have had a trade deficit with Japan forever, it seems. This \ntrade deficit is robust and growing, and continues to grow to record \nlevels.\n  It used to be that economists would say that we have trade deficits \nbecause we have been running budget deficits. When you run budget \ndeficits, you are going to run trade deficits. The budget deficits are \ngone. Why is the trade deficit worsening? Yes, with Japan, with Canada, \nand it is worsening with Mexico.\n  We used to have a trade surplus with Mexico. We were able to turn \nthat into a deficit very quickly because we negotiated a trade \nagreement with Mexico that was incompetent. We have incompetent \nnegotiations by bad negotiators that resulted in bad trade agreements \nand higher deficits with respect to Mexico. We turned a surplus into a \ndeficit.\n  China: What is happening with China is a very substantial runup of \nthe trade deficit in just a matter of about 8 to 10 years.\n  What do we do about all this? I am concerned, obviously, about not \nonly the general trade deficit, which weakens our manufacturing sector, \nbut also with respect to the economic stars in our country, the family \nfarmers. Agricultural trade balances have worsened. Our agricultural \ntrade balance with Europe declined sharply between 1990 and 1998. In \nAsia and Europe, our agricultural trade balance has changed in a manner \nthat is detrimental to family farming.\n  Going back to the issue I mentioned on the previous chart of our \nindividual bilateral trade relations with China, Mexico, Canada, and \nJapan, you will see that we are continuing to run trade deficits that \nare alarmingly high. Yet no one wants to talk about it, and certainly \nno one wants to do anything about it. The minute someone says let's \ntake some action, someone else will say: You are proposing a trade war. \nWhat on earth can you be thinking about?\n  This country had better think about itself for a few minutes. It \nought to turn inward and ask: What does this red ink mean to the U.S. \nand its future?\n  Even Mr. Greenspan, who is prone to understatement, indicated that \nthis cannot be sustained for any lengthy period of time. This country \nmust worry about its bilateral trade relationships with the countries I \njust described. It also must worry about its general trade strategy, \nwhich results in huge trade deficits and in the kind of trade \nrelationships, which I think will make this country's citizens \nincreasingly angry and anxious.\n  Incidentally, these trade deficits are much higher than the \nWashington Post reports. The trade deficit in the Post represents the \ncombination of goods and services. If you look at trade deficits in \ngoods, it is much higher than this. That relates to the question of \nwhat is happening to the American manufacturers.\n  Let me talk about farmers specifically for a moment. Our family \nfarmers around the country are suffering through a very serious crisis. \nThe bulk of that is because prices have collapsed on the grain market, \neven though the stock market is reaching record highs. The grain market \nhas collapsed, and farmers are told their food has no value.\n\n  Another serious part is that, even though we produce more than we \nneed and we need to find a foreign home for our grain, we discover that \ngrain floods across our borders and livestock floods across our border, \nespecially from Canada and other parts of the world, undercutting our \nfarmers' interests. Why? Because we had incompetent negotiators \nnegotiating incompetent trade agreements. They have resulted in \nincreasing trade deficits in this country.\n\n[[Page S9346]]\n\n  The story behind the headlines is the injury that is caused to family \nfarmers, to the manufacturing sector, to that part of America's economy \nthat has produced the strength of this country today. That strength \nwill not long exist if we don't do something about the trade deficit. \nThose who talk about tax cuts for 10 years, anticipating future \neconomic growth and future economic surpluses, will not see those \ndevelop and will not experience that growth unless we do something \nabout this exploding trade deficit. You cannot sustain long-term \neconomic growth when you run a $21.3 billion deficit in one month. It \nwasn't more than a couple decades ago that we ran a trade deficit of a \ncouple billion dollars in a quarter of the year. Wilbur Mills, who used \nto be chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, called special meetings \nto talk about emergency tariffs to be put on goods to reduce the \ndebilitating trade deficits. Now they are $21 billion a month and \ngrowing in a very significant way.\n  We need the Administration and the Congress to understand that the \nunderlying trade negotiations and trade agreements we have had with a \nnumber of countries, including NAFTA and GATT, have undercut this \ncountry's interests. They do not work. They sell out the interests of \nfamily farmers in this country. They injure our manufacturing sector. I \nam not suggesting putting up walls and retreating. I want our producers \nto be required to respond to competition. But our producers cannot and \nshould not be expected to respond to competition when our producers \nhave one hand tied behind their backs by unfair trade agreements.\n  Finally, I want to talk for a moment about what happened last \nDecember with the U.S. Trade Ambassador announcing a deal with respect \nto the Canadian trade issue. They have all kinds of agreements that, as \nI said, weren't worth much. We just allowed them to put a bunch of \npoints down on a piece of paper. I reviewed that deal, and nothing much \nhas happened. In fact, our trade situation with Canada grows worse. Our \nagricultural economy grows worse. Prices have continued to collapse. \nFamily farmers continue to be injured and, at the same time, we have \ndurum and spring wheat, cattle and hogs flooding across the border, \nmost unfairly traded and most in violation of the basic tenets of \nreciprocal trade. Yet, nothing happens. Nobody lifts a finger to say \nlet us stand up on behalf of your interests and take the actions you \nwould expect the Federal Government to take to insist on fair trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9346-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN MEMORY OF JUDGE FRANK M.

Judge Johnson will be remembered for \nhis courageous stands in some of the most difficult struggles of the \nCivil Rights era. At a time when men of lesser fortitude would have \navoided direct confrontation on the highly unpopular issues of school \ndesegregation and voting rights for African-Americans, Judge Johnson \nstood firm on his convictions and the law.\n  Soon after his appointment to the district court by President \nEisenhower in 1955, Johnson took the courageous step of striking down \nthe Montgomery law that had mandated that Rosa Parks sit in the back of \na city bus. He believed that ``separate, but equal'' was inherently \nunequal. Judge Johnson upheld the constitutionality of federal laws \ngranting African-Americans the right to vote in Alabama elections. He \nbelieved in the concept of ``one man, one vote.''\n  Despite tremendous pressure from Governor George Wallace, Judge \nJohnson allowed the voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery to \nproceed despite threats of continued civil unrest and violence. The \nnational fervor that followed the march resulted in the enactment of \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  Today, around a courthouse that bears Frank Johnson's name in \nMontgomery, there are integrated schools, buses, and lunch counters. \nTruly representative democracy flourishes in Alabama with African-\nAmerican state, county, and municipal officials who won their offices \nin fair elections with the votes of African-American and white \ncitizens. In large part because of Judge Johnson, attitudes that were \nonce intolerant and extreme have dissipated, but the example he set has \nnot.\n  The members of the Judiciary Committee extend our deepest sympathies \nto Judge Johnson's family and the host of friends that he had across \nthe country. We will always remember this federal judge for \nexemplifying unwavering moral courage in the advancement of the wholly \nAmerican ideal that ``all men are created equal'' and deserve ``equal \nprotection of the laws.''\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 165) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 165\n\n       Whereas Frank M. Johnson, Jr. was appointed a United States \n     District Judge in Alabama by President Eisenhower in 1955;\n       Whereas Judge Johnson was elevated to the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit by President Carter \n     in 1979;\n       Whereas in a time when men of lesser fortitude would have \n     avoided direct confrontation on the highly unpopular issues \n     of school desegregation and voting rights for African-\n     Americans, Judge Johnson stood firm in upholding the \n     constitution and the law;\n       Whereas Judge Johnson struck down the Montgomery, Alabama \n     law that had mandated that Rosa Parks sit in the back of a \n     city bus, because he believed that ``separate, but equal'' \n     was inherently unequal;\n       Whereas Judge Johnson upheld the constitutionality of \n     federal laws granting African-Americans the right to vote in \n     Alabama elections, because he believed in the concept of \n     ``one man, one vote'';\n       Whereas despite tremendous pressure from Governor George \n     Wallace, Judge Johnson allowed the voting rights march from \n     Selma to Montgomery to proceed, thus stirring the national \n     conscience to enact the Voting Rights Act of 1965;\n       Whereas today, around a courthouse that bears Frank \n     Johnson's name in Montgomery, Alabama there are integrated \n     schools, buses, and lunch counters, and representative \n     democracy flourishes in Alabama with African-American state, \n     county, and municipal officials who won their offices in fair \n     elections with the votes of African-American and white \n     citizens;\n       Whereas in part because of Judge Johnson's upholding of the \n     law, attitudes that were once intolerant and extreme have \n     dissipated,\n       Whereas the members of the Senate extend our deepest \n     sympathies to Judge Johnson's family and the host of friends \n     that he had across the country;\n       Whereas Judge Johnson passed away at his home in \n     Montgomery, Alabama on July 23, 1999;\n       Whereas the American people will always remember Judge \n     Frank M.

Mr. President, I believe we are about ready to make the \nunanimous consent agreement to proceed with the Interior appropriations \nbill. We had one further modification. I believe it is being cleared on \nboth sides.\n  I expect there will be no problem, and hopefully we can go forward \nwith that.\n\n[[Page S9347]]\n\n  In that connection, I urge Senators to come to the floor if they have \namendments to this Interior appropriations bill so we can make progress \nand not spend too much time on opening statements or in quorum calls. I \nam not encouraging amendments. But if a Senator has an amendment that \nhe or she is very serious about, they should come onto the floor and \noffer it. If that is not done, we will have a vote before too long. So \nMembers should understand that we will have the Interior appropriations \nbill available and that we are serious about going forward with it. We \nhope to make good progress on it tonight. Actually, I would like to see \nus complete the bill in view of the modifications that have already \noccurred concerning some of the provisions within this Interior \nappropriations bill.\n  It is a very important bill for our country. It involves, obviously, \nthe parks and lands all over our country that are very important to \npeople of all persuasions, as well as funding for various commissions.\n  I hope that it can be considered quickly. I commend in advance \nSenator Slade Gorton for the work he has done on this bill, and his \nranking Member, Senator Byrd, and Senator Reid, who I know has been \nvery interested in this bill and supports it.\n  When you have Senator Gorton and Senator Byrd prepared to work on an \nappropriations bill, I suspect that most of its problems have already \nbeen resolved, and the Senate should be able to act very quickly on \nthat legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield to Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I inquire of the majority leader about the schedule. My \nunderstanding is that he is intending to bring the Interior \nappropriations bill to the floor. I wonder if the majority leader might \ntell us about the plans he has with respect to the reconciliation bill. \nWould that be the bill that follows the Interior appropriations bill?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes. The reconciliation bill, which provides for the tax \nrelief package, would be next after the Interior appropriations bill. \nWe would like to go to that tonight and begin opening statements. But \nregardless of what happens with Interior, we will be on the \nreconciliation bill by 10:30 or quarter to 11 tomorrow morning.\n  We have to have some time in the morning for statements with regard \nto the juvenile justice bill, which is going to conference. But that \nshould be completed about 10:30 or 10:45.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Because of the time limitations on the reconciliation \nbill, is it the intention, I am curious, of the majority leader that \nthat would consume all of the time tomorrow and Thursday?\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be our intention. Of course, under the rules \ndealing with reconciliation, you have 20 hours for debate on the tax \nrelief package. Included in that 20 hours would be debate on \namendments, although the vote time on amendments would not count \nagainst the 20 hours. So it would be our intention to go through the \nday and into the night on Wednesday and all day Thursday on this \nsubject and into the night. If we finish the bill Thursday night, then \nit would be our plan at this time for that to be the conclusion for the \nweek.\n  I hope we would have already done the Interior appropriations bill. \nIf we can't get it done because of problems that develop Thursday or, \nas you know, if amendments are still pending when all time has expired, \nwe go through this very unseemly process on voting during what we call \na ``votarama,'' with one vote after another and only a minute or two \nbetween the votes to explain what is in them.\n  I hope we won't have that problem this time. But if we can't get it \ndone Thursday night, of course, we would have to go over into Friday. \nBut under the rules, we should be able to finish it not later than \nFriday and, hopefully, even Thursday night.\n  We had indicated earlier a desire to go to the Agriculture \nappropriations bill early next week and, hopefully, complete the \nAgriculture appropriations bill. We then have the option to go back to \nthe reconciliation conference report.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will just observe, if I might, that one way to avoid a \nlot of recorded votes is to accept a lot of amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the pattern continues on that bill as it has on other \nbills, I think that probably will happen. As I recall, last Thursday \nnight at about 8 o'clock around 43 amendments were accepted en bloc on \nthe State-Justice-Commerce appropriations bill.\n  It is a little tougher when you are talking about tax policy. But I \nam sure that some probably will be accepted to move forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to \nthe House Interior bill, and, immediately following the reporting by \nthe clerk, Senator Gorton be recognized to offer the text of the Senate \nreported bill, as modified, to strike on page 116, lines 3 through 7; \npage 129, line 14, through page 132, line 20, as an amendment to the \nHouse bill.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to, the \nbill, as thus amended, be considered original text for the purpose of \nfurther amendment, and that any legislative provision added thereby be \nsubject nevertheless to a point of order under rule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, we just heard that Senator \nByrd wanted to come to the floor for a couple of seconds. If you would \nwithhold the unanimous consent request until that time, we would \ngreatly appreciate it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is there some other issue that Senator Boxer wished to \naddress?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My issue is taken care of. I am very happy to say that \nthe oil royalties will be stricken from this particular bill. I am very \npleased about that. I don't know about the other Senators, but, for me, \nI have no issue and no problem with the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. I had been notified that the Senator from California wanted \nto be on the floor when this unanimous consent request was made.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I, in fact, read it, and the whole thing is fine with me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I might \ninquire of the majority leader, while we are awaiting the arrival of \nSenator Byrd, perhaps the Senator from Washington, the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, could respond to some questions about the unanimous \nconsent request.\n  First, it is my understanding that the unanimous consent request does \nnot waive any rule XVI objections.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct. It does not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Am I also correct that the four sections being stricken \nby the unanimous consent request are sections 328, relevant to the \nintroduction of Grizzly bears into the States of Idaho and Montana, as \nwell as section 340, relative to hard rock mineral mining in the Mark \nTwain National Forest in Missouri; section 341, another environmental \nrider relative to energy efficiency; and, finally, section 342, the one \nreferred to by the Senator from California, the environmental rider on \ncrude oil and royalty for purposes of the evaluation question?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Illinois is correct on all four.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Out of the 13 objectionable environmental riders, 4 \nobjectionable by the administration, 4 are being stricken by this \nunanimous consent request, and all others are in the bill for \nconsideration and subject to rule XVI, or any other appropriate \nmotions.\n  Mr. GORTON. Or any amendment which may be proposed.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could inquire of the Senator, is the \nSenator saying that the administration supports the introduction of \nGrizzly bears into Idaho and the other State?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the administration's concern is that they allow \nfor the first time Governors of these States to dictate the policy on \nFederal lands.\n  Mr. LOTT. That sounds like a good idea.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It depends on your point of view.\n  At this point, I withdraw any objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, are we waiting on Senator Byrd's arrival?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is my understanding, I say to my leader, that he is, \nin fact,\n\n[[Page S9348]]\n\non his way over, and he needs just a couple of minutes. If the leader \nwill, I ask him to delay the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate \nthe Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year \n2000. The bill totals $13.924 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, an amount that is $1.125 billion below the President's \nbudget request and $19 million below the fiscal year 1999 enacted \nlevel. The bill fully complies with the spending limits established in \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997, and the amount provided is right at \nthe subcommittee's 302(b) allocation.\n  As is always the case, putting this bill together has been a \ntremendous challenge. While I am extremely grateful that Senator \nStevens, in consultation with Senator Byrd, was able to provide the \nsubcommittee with an increase over its original 302(b) allocation, the \namount contained in this bill is still slightly below the fiscal year \n1999 enacted level. I wish to point out to my colleagues, however, that \nthis does not mean that delivery of programs can be continued at the \ncurrent level simply by holding appropriations even with last year.\n  The programs funded in this appropriations bill are highly personnel-\nintensive, supporting tens of thousands of park rangers, foresters, and \nIndian Health Service doctors. As such, mandated pay and benefit \nincreases for Federal personnel and increases in rent charged by the \nGeneral Services Administration--increases over which the subcommittee \nhas no control--place a significant burden on Interior bill agencies. \nThe committee must choose either to provide funds to cover these costs, \nor require agencies to absorb them by reducing services or finding more \nefficient ways of delivering programs. For fiscal year 2000, these \nfixed costs amount to more than $300 million. While the committee has \nprovided increases to cover a majority of this amount by drawing on \ncarryover balances and reducing low priority programs, some agencies \nwill be forced to absorb a portion of their fixed costs.\n  Given the necessity of funding most fixed costs increases within an \nallocation that is slightly below the current year level, there is \nlittle room in this bill for new programs, increases in existing \nprograms, or additional projects of interest to individual Members. But \nby terminating low priority programs and making selective reductions in \nothers, we have been able to provide targeted increases for certain \nhigh priority programs.\n  The committee has provided a $70 million increase for the operation \nof the national park system, including $27 million to increase the base \noperating budgets of 100 park units. This increase is further \nindication of the Senate's commitment to preserving and enhancing our \nnational park system while remaining within the fiscal constraints of \nthe balanced budget agreement. The Senate bill puts funding for the \noperation of our parks at a level fully $277 million higher than the \nfiscal year 1995 level, and 82 percent over the amount provided a \ndecade ago.\n  For the other land management agencies, the bill provides an increase \nof $27 million for the Fish and Wildlife Service, including more than \n$13 million for the operation of the national wildlife refuge system. \nThe bill increases the Forest Service operating account by $17 million, \nincluding significant increases for recreation management, forest \necosystem restoration, and road maintenance. A $22 million increase is \nprovided for management of lands by the Bureau of Land Management, as \nwell as another $5 million increase for payments in lieu of taxes. The \namount provided for PILT reflects a continued effort to steadily \nincrease appropriations for this program without harming the core \noperating programs funded in this bill. Though appropriations for PILT \nwere stagnant throughout the first half of this decade, the amount \nprovided in this bill represents a 28 percent increase over the amount \nprovided in fiscal year 1995.\n  Among the programs in this bill that are specifically for the benefit \nof Native Americans, the committee's top priority has been to provide \nthe Secretary of the Interior with the resources necessary to fix the \nIndian trust fund management system. Indian land and trust fund records \nhave been allowed to deteriorate to a deplorable state, and the \nDepartment of the Interior now finds itself scrambling to reconcile \nthousands upon thousands of trust records that are scattered across the \ncountry. Many of these records are located in cardboard boxes that have \nnot been touched for years, or in ancient computer systems that are \nincompatible with one another. The Department is performing this task \nunder the watchful eye of the court, having been sued by those whose \ntrust accounts it is supposed to be managing.\n  I believe that Secretary Babbitt is making a good faith effort to \naddress this problem, and as such have recommended a funding level for \nthe Office of the Special Trustee that is $39 million over the amount \noriginally provided for fiscal year 1999. This amount will provide for \nboth the manpower and the trust management systems necessary to fix the \nproblem. I will note, however, that the Federal track record in \nmanaging large system procurements is spotty at best. As such, I hope \nto continue to work closely with the Committee on Indian Affairs and \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to ensure that these \nfunds are expended wisely, and that we will not regret our decision to \nprovide such a considerable amount for this purpose. I plead with my \ncolleagues, however, to refrain from offering amendments to this bill \nthat would radically change the course of action for trust management \nthat has been laid out by the administration. Any such changes should \nbe carefully considered and have the benefit of hearings by the \nauthorizing committees.\n\n[[Page S9349]]\n\n  With regard to other Indian programs, I will quickly note that the \nbill provides an $83 million increase for the Indian Health Service, as \nwell as significant increases for both Indian law enforcement and \nIndian school construction and repair. Funding for Indian schools \ncontinues to be among the highest programmatic priorities expressed by \nmembers of the Interior Subcommittee.\n  The Interior bill also funds a myriad of programs that preserve and \nenhance our nation's cultural heritage. Perhaps the most visible of \nthese programs are the National Endowments for the Arts and the \nHumanities. While the subcommittee's allocation did not allow us to \nincrease these accounts by large amounts as would be the desire of many \nSenators, the bill does provide a $1 million increase for each program. \nThese increases will not allow for any dramatic expansion the \nEndowments' ongoing programs, but do indicate the committee's general \nsupport for the Endowments and the efforts they have made to respond to \nthe various criticisms that have been leveled at them. I hope that we \nmay able to do even better next year.\n  The bill also includes the full $19 million required to complete the \nFederal commitment to the construction of the National Museum of the \nAmerican Indian on The Mall, and $20 million to continue phase two of \nthe comprehensive building rehabilitation project at the Kennedy \nCenter.\n  The final grouping of agencies in this bill that I will mention at \nthis time are the energy programs. The bill provides funding for both \nfossil energy R and energy conservation R at roughly the current \nyear level. These programs are vital if we hope to stem our increasing \ndependence on foreign oil, to preserve the country's leadership in the \nmanufacture of energy technologies, and to enable our economy to \nachieve reductions in energy use and emissions in ways that will not \ncripple economic growth. The bill also preserves funding for the \nweatherization and state grant programs at the fiscal year 1999 level. \nMaintaining current funding levels for these programs is made possible \nin part by the absence of any new appropriations for the naval \npetroleum and oil shale reserves, and a deferral of appropriations \npreviously made for the Clean Coal Technology Program.\n  Mr. President, I would like to touch on two more issues that may be \nof particular interest to members. The first is funding for land \nacquisition. Many Senators are aware that the President's budget \nrequest included some $1 billion for a ``lands legacy'' initiative. \nThis initiative is an amalgamation of programs, some of which the \ncommittee has been funding for years, some of which are entirely new. \nMany of the programs included in the initiative lack authorization \nentirely. While the committee may well have chosen to provide many of \nthese increases if it were allowed to distribute a $1.1 billion \nincrease in spending, the lands legacy initiative is absurd in the \ncontext of any overall budget that adheres to the terms of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997--the very act that has helped produce the budget \nsurplus that the President is so anxious to spend.\n  To be clear, this bill does include large amounts of funding for a \nvariety of land protection programs. The bill provides about the same \namount of funding for Federal land acquisition as was included in the \nSenate reported bill last year. It also includes significant increases \nfor other land protection programs such as the Cooperative Endangered \nSpecies Fund and the Forest Legacy program. The bill does not, however, \ninclude funds for the new and unauthorized grant programs requested by \nthe administration, and does not include funds for the Stateside grant \nprogram that is authorized under the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nAct. While I am sympathetic in concept to the Stateside program, the \nsubcommittee's allocation does not provide the room necessary to \nrestart the program.\n  Finally, I would like to take a moment to discuss the issue of \nappropriations ``riders.'' This administration has leveled much \ncriticism at this Congress for including legislative provisions in \nappropriations bills. This criticism is disingenuous in at least two \nways. First, there are without question legislative provisions in this \nvery bill that, if removed, would prompt loud objections from the \nadministration itself. Among these are provisions well known to my \ncolleagues, such as moratoria on offshore oil and gas development and a \nmoratorium on new mining patent applications. There are also some less \nwell-known provisions that have been carried in this bill for years, \nthe subjects of which range from clearcutting on the Shawnee National \nForest to the testing of nuclear explosives for oil and gas \nexploration. Nearly all of these provisions are included in the bill \nbecause Congress at some point felt that the Executive branch was \ntampling on the prerogatives of the legislative branch.\n  This leads to my second point. It should be well apparent to my \ncolleagues that this administration long ago made a conscious decision \nnot to engage Congress in productive discussions on a wide array of \nnatural resource issues. Most of these issues are driven by statutes \nthat most reasonable people admit are in dire need of updating, \nstreamlining or reform. Instead, the administration has chosen to \nimplement its own version of these laws through expansive regulatory \nactions, far-reaching Executive orders and creative legal opinions. \nWhen the administration overreaches in this fashion, concerned Senators \nare compelled to respond. The administration knows this, and has \nclearly made a political calculation that it is in its interest to \ninvite these riders every year. For the administration to criticize the \nvery practice that it deliberately provokes is, as I have said \ndisingenuous at best.\n  If the administration wishes to take issue with the substance of \nthese provisions rather than hide behind a criticism of the process, it \nis welcome to do so. Consideration of this bill is an open process. It \nis not done ``in the dark of night,'' as we so often read. The bill has \nmoved through subcommittee and full committee, and is open for \namendment by the full Senate. I expect that we will discuss some of \nthese provisions during the coming debate, and hope that Senators will \ncarefully consider the arguments made on both sides. What I hope \nSenators will not do, is vote to abdicate the Senate's responsibility \nto oversee the actions of the executive branch, or sacrifice the power \nof the purse that is granted to the Congress by the Constitution.\n  With that admonition, Mr. President, it is probably an appropriate \ntime to turn to Senator Byrd and thank him for his assistance in \ndrafting this bill. He has been an invaluable resource as I have tried \nto be responsive to the priorities of Members on that side of the \naisle, and has been particularly helpful in securing an allocation for \nthe subcommittee that enables us to report a bill that is deserving of \nthe Senate's support. I thank Senator Byrd's staff as well--Kurt Dodd, \nLiz Gelfer, a detailee, and Carole Geagley for all the hard work they \nhave done on this bill. I also want to thank my subcommittee staff for \nthe long hours and hard work they have put in on this bill--Bruce \nEvans, Ginny James, Anne McInerney, Leif Fonnesbeck, Joe Norrell, and \nour detailee Sean Marsan. Kari Vanderstoep of my personal staff and \nChuck Berwick--who has now departed my office for business school--have \nalso done a great job of coordinating the many parts of this bill that \nhave a direct impact on the State of Washington.\n  Once again, I think this is a good bill that balances the competing \nneeds of the agencies it funds against the broader fiscal constraints \nthat we have imposed upon ourselves. I hope my colleagues will support \nthe bill.\n  There is one final point I want to make, Mr. President, and emphasize \nto all the Members and their staffs who are within hearing.\n  This is a bill created by many individual Senators' requests for \nprojects in their home States, and sometimes for projects that are \nregional and national in scope. This year, at least during my tenure, \nwe set another new record. One hundred Senators made more than 2,400 \nrequests for specific provisions in this bill. Obviously, we could not \ngrant all of the requests that are valid. I must say most of them were, \nin the sense they were for projects that would increase the ambience of \nthe park system, the national historic system of the country as a \nwhole.\n\n[[Page S9350]]\n\n  Senator Byrd and I, working together, have done the best job we \npossibly could in setting priorities for those programs, within the \nconstraints of a bill I have already said is very limited in the total \namount of money we have.\n  So Members' requests that are not included in the bill were not \nignored; they were simply omitted either because the given individual \nhad higher priorities within his or her own State or because other \npriorities intervened in their way.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the fiscal year \n2000 Interior and Related Agencies appropriation bill. This is an \nimportant bill which provides for the management of our Nation's \nnatural resources, funds research critical to our energy future, \nsupports the well-being of our Indian populations, and protects the \nhistorical and cultural heritage of our country. I urge the Senate to \nmove swiftly in its consideration of this appropriation bill.\n  It has been my privilege to serve as the ranking member for this bill \nat the side of our very able chairman, the senior Senator from \nWashington. Senator Gorton has done an outstanding job in crafting the \nbill and balancing its many competing interests, a particularly \ndaunting challenge this year in light of the spending caps within which \nthe Appropriations Committee must operate. Even in the best of years, \ncrafting the Interior bill is not an easy task.\n  The Interior bill remains one of the most popular appropriation \nbills, funding a diverse set of very worthy programs and projects. The \nbill is full of thousands of relatively small, yet very meaningful \ndetails. Our chairman is a master of the complexities of the Interior \nbill. It is a pleasure to work on this appropriations bill with Senator \nGorton at the helm. He has treated the Senators fairly and openly. This \nbill was put together in a bipartisan manner, and it reflects \npriorities identified by Senators, by the public, and by the agencies \nwhich are charged with carrying out the programs and projects funded in \nthe bill.\n  The breadth of the activities covered by the Interior bill is vast--\nranging from museums to parks to hospitals to resources to research--\nwith most of the funds being spent far away from the capital. This bill \nfunds hundreds of national parks, wildlife refuges, national forests, \nand other land management units. This bill supports more than 400 \nIndian hospitals and clinics and thousands of Indian students. A wide \nvariety of natural science and energy research and technology \ndevelopment are funded through this bill, providing immediate and far-\nreaching benefits to all parts of our Nation and to our society as a \nwhole.\n  This bill makes its presence known in every State--from the rocky \ncoasts of Maine to the mountains of California, from the coral reefs of \nFlorida to the far flung island territories of the Pacific, from the \nAleutian Islands in Alaska to the Outer Banks of North Carolina. And \nthe number of requests Senator Gorton and I have received from Senators \nfor project funding in the Interior bill--more than 2,400 requests for \nspecific items--reflects its broad impact. While it is impossible to \ninclude every request, Senator Gorton has done an admirable job of \naccommodating high-priority items within the allocation, an allocation \nthat is $1.13 billion below the President's budget request and nearly \n$20 million below last year's enacted level of $13.94 billion in new \ndiscretionary spending authority.\n  Highlights of this bill include:\n  A total of $234 million for federal land acquisition, which is $178 \nmillion below the President's fiscal year 2000 request (with \nreprogrammings) and $94 million below the level of funding included in \nthe fiscal year 1999 act for land acquisition.\n  A continuing emphasis on operating and protecting our national parks. \nPark operation funds are increased by $70 million, including increases \nof $19 million for resource stewardship, $16 million for visitor \nservices, and $20 million for park maintenance.\n  A continuing focus on the operational needs of the other land \nmanagement agencies. The bill contains an increase of $24 million for \nthe operating accounts of the Bureau of Land Management, including a $9 \nmillion increase for range management. The bill also provides an \nincrease of $22 million for the resource management account of the Fish \nand Wildlife Service, including an increase of $13 million for refuge \noperations and maintenance.\n  The bill contains $159 million for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, \nallowing operation of the reserve without selling any of its oil.\n  Fossil energy research and development is funded at $395 million \n(with use of transfers and prior year balances), which is an increase \nabove both the enacted level (by $11 million) and the request level (by \n$27 million). Specific increases also are provided for select energy \nconservation programs in building research and standards, \ntransportation technology and specific industries of the future \nactivities.\n  While this bill provides needed resources for protecting some of our \nnation's most valuable treasures, we still have a long way to go. The \nagencies funded through this bill are starting to make progress towards \naddressing their operational and maintenance issues, thanks to the \nleadership of the Congress. But we are by no means out of the woods. \nMany deplorable conditions remain; many important resource and research \nneeds are unmet. We must continue our vigilance towards unnecessary new \ninitiatives as well as unwise decreases, our support for the basic \nprograms that provide the foundation of the Interior bill, and our \ncareful stewardship of the resources and assets placed in our trust.\n  Lastly, I extend a warm word of appreciation to the staff that have \nassisted the Chairman and myself in our work on this bill. They work as \na team and serve both of us, as well as all Senators, in a very \neffective and dedicated manner. On the majority side, the staff members \nare Bruce Evans, Ginny James, Anne McInerney, Leif Fonnesbeck, Joseph \nNorrell, and Sean Marsan. On my staff, Kurt Dodd, Carole Geagley, and \nLiz Gelfer have worked on the Interior Bill this year. This team works \nunder the tutelage of the staff directors of the full committee--Steve \nCortese for the majority and Jim English for the minority.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill, and I urge the Senate to complete \nits action promptly.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, what is the pending legislative business?\n  Mr. GORTON. I believe I have not abandoned the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is advised by the Parliamentarian \nthat the floor was open.\n  Mr. GORTON. Then I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Point of order, Mr. President. You recognized the Senator \nfrom Washington, Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair for that clarification.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about some legislative \nlanguage that is in the Interior bill, on which I will be offering an \namendment shortly, which is going to give away more of our public lands \nfor the benefit of a few and at a tremendous cost to all the rest of \nus. This is a cost to the American taxpayer and to our environment.\n  I want to begin, as I talk about this, by expressing that I am not \ngoing to be attacking the mining industry, which this amendment will be \nspeaking to. I believe mining is an important industry in our \ncountry. While most of us don't think about it a lot, mining does \nproduce some important minerals that are vital in every one of our \nlives. Mining is not only important in individual routines, but it is \nvital to our industrial base and rural economies. We need an active \nmining industry in our country. Like all of my colleagues, I support a \nresponsible mining act, but we, as citizens of this country, need a \nfair deal.\n\n  Today the mining industry is treated exceptionally well by our very \nold laws. Unfortunately, the American taxpayers are not treated well. \nThey receive next to nothing from this industry, and our public lands \nsuffer as well.\n  A fact that should both amaze and really appall the American public \nis that mining in this country is controlled by a law that was written \nin\n\n[[Page S9351]]\n\n1872. That law was written just a few short years after the Civil War, \nwhen Ulysses S. Grant was still President of the United States. The law \nof 1872 allows mining interests to buy our Federal lands for between \n$2.50 and $5 per acre. Guess what they are paying for that now, 130 \nyears later. They are paying between $2.50 and $5 per acre. That is \nquite a bargain.\n  And what does the hard rock mining industry pay in royalties back to \nus for using our land, for what they pull out of our land? Nothing, \nzero, zilch. The hard rock mining industry is the only extractive \nindustry in this country that pays absolutely no royalties to the \ntaxpayers for minerals that are coming from our public lands.\n  In addition, over the course of these past 130 years since this law \nwas written, the mining industry has caused tremendous environmental \ndamage throughout the West. Mining waste dumps are responsible for \npoisoning streams, lakes, and ground water with toxic minerals such as \nlead, cadmium, and arsenic. Mining in the United States has left a \nlegacy of 12,000 miles of polluted streams and 180,000 acres of \npolluted lakes. There are 500,000-plus abandoned mines in this country. \nGuess who pays for the cleanup. The taxpayers. That bill is estimated \nto be between $32 and $72 billion. We, the taxpayers, pay for the \ncleanup of these mines.\n  The 1872 mining law did make sense when it was written 130 years ago. \nI think everybody here agrees that a lot has changed in 130 years. Our \nNation is very different. The value of our public lands has increased \ndramatically, far more than $2.50 an acre. We no longer need incentives \nto get people to move out west, which is why that mining law was \nwritten. The West, I think, has been settled. Our commitment in this \ncountry to protect the environment is now extremely intense. It was \nnonexistent 130 years ago when this law was written, in part because \nour natural resources seemed unlimited 130 years ago. I think all of us \nknow that is not true anymore.\n  Mining technology has changed radically in 130 years. Today a lot \nmore land is needed for every ounce of mineral that is extracted. When \nthis law was written, an old man with a pony or a mule would ride up \nwith his pickax and do his mining on his claim. Today we extract \nhundreds of pounds of rock that is waste. They use cyanide to leach \nthrough it to get just a tiny amount of gold. Technology has changed \ndramatically.\n  No one can stand up and say we should continue to regulate the mining \nindustry under the law that was written 130 years ago. Everyone knows \nit is time to make changes. The question is how and when. Do we engage \nin a comprehensive overhaul, or do we do as we have done in this bill \nand just fix the section of the 1872 law that offends the mining \nindustry? Do we try to move forward with the 1872 mining law, or do we \nmove backwards?\n\n  There is one provision in the 1872 mining law that provides minimal \nprotection for the environment and for the taxpayers. When someone \nstakes a mining claim, the law provides that that person can obtain up \nto, but no more than, 5 acres of additional nonmineral land for the \npurpose of dumping mining waste. You would think, given the incredible \ndeal that the mining industry is getting on access to public lands, the \nindustry would be more than willing to comply with that provision.\n  Yet when the mining industry was faced with having to comply with the \none and only environmental provision of the 1872 mining law, it went \nrunning to its champions in Congress to change that provision. The \nmining industry says it cannot mine if it is only given 5 acres of \npublic land on which to dump its waste. Indeed, it argues, and Senator \nCraig's amendment in this Interior appropriation bill guarantees, the \nmining industry should get as much public land as it desires to dump \nits waste. The contention of the industry as well as the language in \nthis bill is that the 5-acre limitation in the 1872 mining law is \nwithout meaning. They are wrong. The 5-acre provision provides a small \namount of protection for our public lands, and this Senate should \nretain it.\n  The Senate has already done some work on this issue. Senator Gorton \namended the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that we passed a \nfew months ago to exclude a mine in my home State of Washington from \nthis 5-acre mill site limitation. Of course, other mining industries \nnow want the same good deal. So Senator Craig put a rider on the \nInterior appropriations bill we are now considering, in full committee, \nthat completely voids any limitation on mill sites for all current and \nfuture mining operations.\n  We have to ask: Where is the balance? Where is the fairness in this \nlimited approach? Where is the fix for the public and their lands to \nthis outdated mining law? It is absolutely absent. The sort of reform \nto the 1872 mining law that we are witnessing in this bill is not \ntaking us forward but it is taking us backwards.\n  The environmental provisions in the mining law should be \nstrengthened, not eliminated. Taxpayers should be compensated much more \nby the mining industry rather than being asked to expand the giveaway \nof public lands that we are doing in this bill.\n  Senator Gorton's amendment on the supplemental appropriations bill \nand Senator Craig's amendment on the Interior bill give the mining \nindustry everything it wants and give the American public larger dumps. \nCompanies that paid next to nothing for the public land they are \nmining, $2.50 an acre, are still paying absolutely no royalties and \ndumping more waste rock than ever on our precious public lands.\n  I am not going to stand by and let this industry dump waste rock on \nour public lands without limitation and without true compensation. We \ndo need comprehensive mining law reform, but until then I am going to \nfight this effort to piecemeal reform, especially piecemeal reform that \nbenefits the one side that already enjoys tremendous advantages under \nthe current system.\n  Let me show Senators a photo of Buckhorn Mountain in Washington \nState. This is the area in Washington State. It is a gorgeous piece of \npublic land, our land. This is what it will look like once a mill moves \nforward, from this to this. What does it cost the mining industry to go \nfrom this to this? Mr. President, $2.50 an acre. They won't have to pay \nfor the extra land to dump their rock, the cyanide-leached rock that \nthey put there. They won't pay the taxpayers anything, and this is our \npublic land. We know we need a mining industry, but if the mining \nindustry wants to continue to make profits in this country, then they \nshould at least compensate the public for what they are going to do.\n  Let me show my colleagues what this area will look like in a few \nyears. What will the mining industry pay us for changing it from the \nbeautiful photo I showed to this? Just $2.50 an acre. Under this bill \nand under the bill that passed recently, they are going to get as much \nacreage as they want to dump their rocks onto our public lands.\n  I want to make some points that I think are worth remembering. The \nmining industry has been very slow to embrace any mining law reform. \nNow that it has encountered a part of the law it doesn't like, it is \ntrying to eliminate the one provision that can limit some of the damage \nthat has been caused by the mining.\n  The mining law permits mining companies to extract gold, silver, \ncopper, and other hard rock minerals without paying a cent in royalties \nto the taxpayer. Hard rock mining is the only extractive industry to \nget this benefit. I will show this to my colleagues. Coal pays 8-\npercent royalties for underground mining. Hard rock mining, none; they \npay nothing.\n  As we look at this chart, we see that hard rock mining clearly has \nbeen given a great gift by the taxpayers of this country, and now in \nthis bill, we see them wanting more and more public lands. Have they \nnegotiated a change to the 1872 mining law in exchange for the more \nland on which they want to dump? No. They are not going to be paying \nany more royalties. They are not going to be paying any more for the \nland. We have simply given it away to all current and future mines in \nthis bill.\n  Coal, oil, and gas miners all pay 12.5-percent royalties from what \nthey take from public lands. Since 1872, taxpayers have given away $240 \nbillion worth of minerals to the hard rock mining industry. By \ncontrast, all Western States collect a royalty or production fee for \nminerals removed from State lands. We are talking Federal lands in this \nbill.\n\n[[Page S9352]]\n\n Western States collect a royalty or production fee on State lands, \ncollecting between 2 and 10 percent on the gross income of mineral \nproduction. We collect nothing for Federal lands.\n  The 1872 mining law is in need of environmental and fiscal reform. \nCongress should not overturn the mill site decision and expand it to \nallow more dumping of mining waste on public lands without getting \nsomething back. The mill site decision does not halt hard rock mining \non public lands. I want to make that clear. The mill site decision does \nnot halt hard rock mining. Don't believe the false rhetoric you will \nhear about the Solicitor's opinion enforcing a provision of the 1872 \nmining law, at the expense of millions of dollars and thousands of \njobs. That is simply not true. They can pay for it as everybody else \ndoes if they need more land.\n  The Department of the Interior will not enforce the mill site waste \nlimitation retroactively. For future mine proposals and mine expansion, \nthe limitation will apply. The industry says the mill site decision is \nnot consistent with existing law and instead is policy advocacy by the \nInterior Department. I am sure we will hear that from our colleagues. \nThat is incorrect. The 1872 mining law clearly limits mill site claims \nto 5 acres for each lode or placer claim. If the industry is so sure of \nits legal position, it can fight the Solicitor's opinion in court.\n  For the Record, let me show my colleagues what the law actually says. \nThe mill site statute we referred to throughout this debate is right \nhere. It says:\n\n       Where nonmineral land not contiguous to the vein or lode is \n     used or occupied by the proprietor of such vein or lode for \n     mining or milling purposes, such nonadjacent surface ground \n     may be embraced and included in an application for a patent \n     for such vein or lode, and the same may be patented \n     therewith.\n\n  And it goes on and it says:\n       Such land may be included in application for a patent for \n     such claim, and may be patented therewith subject to the same \n     requirements as to survey and notice as are applicable to \n     placers. No location made of such nonmineral land shall \n     exceed five acres.\n\n  That was the law written back in 1872. It is very clear. Five acres. \nIt says so right here. If the industry doesn't agree with the \nSolicitor's opinion that this law doesn't say exactly what we have just \nread, they can go to court and fight it. But to come and give this huge \ngiveaway to an industry that already receives an awful lot from the \ntaxpayers I believe is wrong.\n  Clearly, we need to reform the mining law of 1872 and maybe, in fact, \nthe mill site limitation needs revision, but not here, not in this way. \nWe need to hold hearings and mark up an authorization bill. We ought to \ngive the American public time to learn of the issue and revise input. \nIf we are going to revise the 1872 law--and we should--we, the \ntaxpayers, ought to give something back.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am glad I can join the Senator in her effort to oppose \nsection 336. This is an environmental rider that is part of the \nInterior appropriations bill. The administration said that it is 1 of \nthe 13 riders--I think there are 9 remaining--which would be the basis \nof a veto of the legislation. I want to make sure the Record is clear \nand ask the Senator from Washington several questions.\n  In every instance when she referred to mining, are we talking about \nmining on public land?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We are absolutely referring to mining on our public \nland.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So this is land that is owned by all of us, all American \ntaxpayers, land that has been purchased or obtained and supervised over \nthe years at the expense of Federal taxpayers?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct. In \norder to have a claim, you stake your claim on our public lands, lands \nowned by the taxpayers, and then you have the right to go ahead and \nmove forward and dig your hard rock, and all you have to pay is $2.50 \nan acre.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So for $2.50 an acre, these companies--even foreign \ncompanies--can go to our federally owned, publicly owned lands and they \ncan start mining for various minerals of value, is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Now, as I understand the Senator from Washington, you can \ntake up to 20 acres for the actual mining of the mineral, and then you \ncan use 5 acres under the law, nonadjacent, not connected, for the so-\ncalled mill site.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct. That is where they dump the rock they \nhave extracted.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator show us the photo of what the mill site \ndumping ground looks like for those who have decided to mine on land \nowned by taxpayers? If you could show us as an example----\n  Mrs. MURRAY. This would be one example, I say to the Senator from \nIllinois, of what a dump site looks like. Here is another one we have. \nI will put this up as well. This shows where we have an open pit mine, \nwhich is what we are talking about, and where the rock is dumped.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me ask the Senator from Washington, if some company--\nand it could be a foreign company--pays $2.50 an acre, they can start \nmining these minerals, and then they can take 5 acres of public land \nand dump all of the rock and waste that is left over after they have \nmined, is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Does that company have an obligation under the law, or \notherwise, to clean up the mess they have left behind?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. No, they do not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is an important point. After they have gotten this \nwonderful deal--$2.50--to go ahead and mine for valuable minerals, they \nthen dump on the mill site all of their waste and rock and leave it for \ngenerations to come--some of those pictures look like a lunar \nlandscape--if I understand what the Senator from Washington is saying.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Well, the Senator from Illinois is correct. Currently, \nthere are 500,000 more abandoned mines in this country today, and the \ncleanup for that is estimated to be between $32 billion and $72 \nbillion. That is our money.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Do they monitor the dump sites, mill sites, for these \nmines to make sure they don't have at least any environmental danger? \nThey are ugly, but are they environmentally dangerous?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. In the permanent thinking of mining, those decisions are \nlooked at. But once this is there, it becomes abandoned. It falls to \nthe taxpayers to have to clean it up.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me ask the Senator from Washington, section 336 of \nthis bill, the so-called environmental rider, called a prohibition on \nmill site limitations, if I read this correctly--I would like to read \nit to the Senator from Washington for her response--says:\n\n       The Department of Interior and the Department of \n     Agriculture, and other departments, shall not limit the \n     number or acreage of mill sites based on the ratio between \n     the number or acreage of mill sites and the number or acreage \n     of associated load or placer claims for any fiscal year.\n\n  I want to ask the Senator from Washington, as I read this, the 1872 \nmining law put a limitation of five acres on those who mine on our \nFederal lands to use as a dump site for their mill tailings. If I \nunderstand this environmental rider, this says there is no limitation \nwhatsoever--that if this is enacted, these mining companies paying \n$2.50 an acre and literally taking millions of dollars of minerals out \nof our land and not paying us for it can then turn around and dump \ntheir waste in every direction with no limitation on the number of \nacres they can cover with this waste.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is exactly correct. If we \nallow the language that is in the Interior bill to move through and to \nbecome law, that is exactly correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Washington the following question. \nIt almost boggles the mind that we would be so insensitive to the \nlegacy of our generation that we would take beautiful land owned by our \ncountry which could be visited and used by future generations and turn \nit into a landscape dump site of these mill tailings with absolutely no \nobligation by the company that has made the mess.\n\n  Is that the outcome of this amendment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The outcome of this amendment is that we will have \nhundreds of acres in this country--maybe thousands of acres--with \ntailings on\n\n[[Page S9353]]\n\nthem and cyanide-leached rock left on them, and it will be our \nresponsibility to clean it up. And the mining industry will not have \ngiven us a dime for that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I understand, if I might ask the Senator from \nWashington, this so-called cyanide leach process--I am not an expert, \nbut as I understand it, those who are able to mine on Federal public \nlands bring up the dirt and the rock and then pour some form of cyanide \nover it hoping they will derive down at the bottom of this heap some \nhandful of gold, for example.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is correct. The technology \nthat is available today allows mining companies to haul out rock, pour \ncyanide through it, and come up with an ounce of gold. The price of \ngold today allows them to do that. It has been profitable for them. \nTherefore, they take tons of rock, and they are claiming of course that \nthey need more acreage for mill sites because it takes so much more \nrock to get a small amount of gold.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Am I correct that the Senator from Washington is saying \nthat after they have poured the cyanide over the rock and the dirt is \ntaken away, they have a handful of gold, and they walk away from the \nmess that is left behind?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct. This is \nwhat it would look like.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me ask the Senator, if we are dealing with a law that \nwas written 127 years ago, the obvious question is, Why would they want \nto amend one section to allow these mining companies to befoul so much \nmore public land and leave the mess behind after they have taken the \nprofits? Why aren't we addressing a wholesale reform or change of this \nmining law so that taxpayers have a fighting chance?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I respond to the Senator from Illinois, I am as baffled \nas he is, that every Senator knows the 1872 mining law needs to be \nreformed. It needs to be reformed in a fair and responsible manner. If, \nindeed, the mining companies need more mill sites, then the taxpayers \nought to get something in return. In fact, the mill site limitation is \ntruly the only part of this law that allows us some control over what \nis left behind because the mining industry did not want to give and \ntake, they just took, and got their rider put into this bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator from Washington to \ncompare--I think this really tells an interesting story, too--the \ndifference in standards that we apply for those who want to use Federal \npublic lands owned by the taxpayers to mine coal and those who want to \nuse them for hard rock mining or for other minerals. I am amazed. I \nwould like to ask the Senator from Washington if she can tell me why. \nIt is my understanding that when it comes to the selection of the \nmining site, there has to be approval by the Bureau of Land Management \nthrough a leasing process for the mining of coal on Federal lands.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. If the Senator will yield, I have a chart that shows \nwhat you do if you are going to mine coal and what you do if you are \ngoing to mine hard rock. On the selection of the coal mining site, you \nhave to get approval through a leasing process under the Mineral \nLeasing Act. In comparison, if you are going to do hard rock mining, \nwhich we are talking about in this bill, it is self-initiation on the \nlocation. In the mining law based in 1872, there is no BLM approval \nthat is required.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator a second point. What a \ngiveaway this is--$2.50 an acre. They can literally mine millions of \ndollars' worth of minerals. The amazing thing is, they do not pay the \ntaxpayers of this country any percentage for what they bring out.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Washington to compare the mining \nof coal on Federal lands when it comes to royalties to mining under the \nhard rock provisions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Illinois is correct. Coal miners have \nto pay 8 percent for underground mining and 12\\1/2\\ percent for surface \nmining where hard rock pays none.\n  I would think the Senators from States who have coal miners who are \npaying 8 percent would be rushing to the floor and saying: Where is the \nfairness here where you can mine hard rock for gold and pay not one \ndime back to the taxpayers for the use of that public land and for what \nyou have extracted from that public land, and yet coal is 12\\1/2\\ \npercent?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator from Washington aware of the fact that in \n1959 a Danish mining company--not an American company--successfully \npatented public lands in Idaho containing over $1 billion worth of \nminerals and paid the Federal taxpayers $275?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would say to the Senator from Illinois that there are \na lot of taxpayers out there who would like to earn $1 million and only \npay $275.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator aware as well that since 1872 there has \nbeen more than $240 billion of taxpayer subsidies to this mining \nindustry?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I was unaware of the figure, but $240 billion in \nsubsidies does not surprise me.\n  We are saying that if we are going to hand you another giveaway, \nwhich this bill does, what are you going to give us back? In this bill, \nthey give nothing back.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is my understanding correct, I ask the Senator from \nWashington, if you are going to mine coal on public lands, you have to \nhave a detailed permitting and reclamation standard filed which says \nyou are going to clean up your own mess, but when it comes to hard-rock \nmining you can literally leave your mess behind, from what appears to \nbe a very weak standard?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The standard criterion is absolutely correct. If you are \ngoing to dig coal, you have to have a detailed permitting and \nreclamation standard. But if you are going to mine hard rock, which we \nare talking about in this bill, this giveaway in this bill, you have to \nshow reasonable measures to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of \nthe public land. It is very minimal.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Washington, I am happy to join \nher in this effort. This debate will continue. I am happy to say that \nwhen she has completed her statement on the subject, I will have some \nother things I would like to add.\n  I see the Senator from California on her feet to ask another \nquestion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes. Thank you very much. I ask the Senator from \nWashington to yield for a few questions.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from \nWashington and Senator Durbin from Illinois on the Appropriations \nCommittee fighting this antienvironmental rider all the way from the \nday they heard about it. I am just pleased to be here in a supportive \nrole.\n  The reason I came to the floor is that the Senator from Washington \nhas spoken in depth about a particular mine in her State. I want to ask \nher a few questions about a mine in my State, not that I expect her to \nbe aware of all of this, but to see if she agrees with some of my \nconclusions on this.\n  First, I want to underscore through some questions what the Senator \nfrom Illinois asked; that is, I say to the Senator from Washington, I \nhave learned by listening to this debate that when one mines for coal, \nthere is in fact a royalty payment due to the Federal taxpayer. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct. If you are \nmining for coal, you have to pay 8 percent for underground mining and \n12\\1/2\\ percent for surface mining. That is royalty that you pay back \nto the taxpayers for the use of that land.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it kind of like a rent payment? You go onto Federal \nland, and for that privilege you pay a percentage of the value of the \ncoal that is mined and extracted from that land. Is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. If the Senator from California \nhad a mine and wanted to go in and dig coal out of our public lands, \nshe would have to pay the public back something for that coal. It is \nours, after all. But if you are going to dig for gold, hard rock \nmining, you do not have to give us anything back.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is the Senator aware--I know she is because she is \nworking with me on this issue, too--that if an oil company finds oil on \nFederal land, they must pay a royalty payment as well? Is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is well aware that when you\n\n[[Page S9354]]\n\nextract oil, you pay a royalty; you pay us, the public, who owns the \nlands, something back.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As a matter of fact, the Senator knows, because she is \nhelping me on this, as is the Senator from Illinois, we have problems \nwith some of the large oil companies. We don't believe they are paying \ntheir fair share of oil royalties, but at least they are paying some \nroyalties.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California is correct. She may not \nagree they are paying enough, but they are paying something. Under the \ncurrent mining laws in this country, hardrock mining pays nothing back \nto the taxpayers.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it not further the case the Senator from Washington is \nnot suggesting that there be any royalty payment?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am only suggesting, I say to my colleague, that if in \nthis bill we are blatantly going to give them use of our public lands \nfar in addition to what they have had before, they give the public \nsomething back. Maybe we should negotiate that in terms of royalties; \nmaybe it should be in a higher percentage that they pay the public; \nmaybe it should be in the requirement that they clean up the land that \nthey have left behind.\n  Certainly we should get something back for our public lands rather \nthan what we have done in this bill, which is to just give them more of \nour land.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right now, what these hardrock miners want to do is \nignore the 1872 mining law. Is it not a fact that in this bill we agree \nwith those mining companies that they can use as much land as they may \nchoose for the waste that comes out of these mines?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I say to my colleague, what has occurred is that the \ntechnology for taking rock out and getting just a little bit of gold \nhas changed dramatically. The mining companies who used to be able to \nget by on five acres can no longer get by on five acres. They want a \nlot more. Instead of negotiating with Congress to pay something back \nfor additional shares, they are saying, no, in this provision in this \nbill, we have given it away to them for nothing else.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask my friend, because she is the expert on this, if \nshe thinks my description is a good description of why they seem to \nneed so much more land for their waste. From the cyanide leach mine \npits, piled hundreds of feet high, over an area of several football \nfields, is a cyanide solution that is sprinkled over the piles. The \ncyanide, which is poison, trickles down through the ore, chemically \ncombines with the gold and ore, and collects and pools at the base of \nthe piles. The gold is stripped from the cyanide solution, but the \ncyanide solution is left on the site.\n  That is what is so contentious. We have poisoned and dumped on \nbeautiful Federal lands. In this bill, we say: Amen; continue to do it. \nMy friend from Washington is trying to say no to that environmental \ndegradation.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from California gives a very accurate \ndescription. Yes, maybe we need gold. We all know there are reasons to \nhave gold. But if the mining companies are going to extract that rock \nand use cyanide leach, and need more acreage for the dumped rock with \ncyanide on it, they should pay something back. We should not give it \naway in the bill. That is what we have done.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a last question, and I don't expect the Senator to \nknow about this particular proposal, but hopefully she can respond to \nthis. In southern Imperial County, CA, a Canadian mining company called \nGlamis Imperial proposes to build a massive, open pit, cyanide heap \nleach mine, the kind I have described in my question to the Senator \nfrom Washington.\n\n  I want the Senator to know how much the people of California treasure \ntheir environment, particularly in these areas where we have Native \nAmericans who have very serious tribal concerns over this area. When \nshe fights for the environment in this way, it is not just for the \nprecious State she represents so well, but it is for many other States, \nincluding California.\n  My question is, is my friend aware at the reach and breadth of the \nfight she is waging?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I appreciate the comments from the Senator from \nCalifornia. There are mines in her State as well as many other States \nwhere this amendment will simply allow acres and acres of mill site \nwaste to be dumped, with nothing back to the taxpayers.\n  I hope my colleagues will support me when I offer the amendment to \nstrike the language in this bill, and I hope, as a Congress, we do what \nwe should have done so long ago, which is to look at the 1872 mining \nlaw. If the mining companies, indeed, do need more dump sites, ask what \nwe get in return. We should have a fair debate on the mining law. It \nshould not just be in this Interior bill which comes to us at 5 \no'clock, when we need to pass a tax bill that we want to start on \ntomorrow and everybody wants to finish tomorrow, forcing a bill to pass \nwith a huge giveaway. Let's give something back, make sure we have \nresponsible mining reform, and make sure we do it right for the \ntaxpayers who deserve a lot better.\n  I appreciate the questions from the Senator from California. I will \nbe offering my amendment in a short while. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment on behalf of the environment, on behalf of the \ntaxpayers, on behalf of what is right and fair for people who pay their \ntaxes every day, for other industries to pay their royalties, to pay a \nfair share. Let's do the mining reform law correctly.\n  I thank my colleagues. I know the Senator from Illinois wants to \ndiscuss this, and I see the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1359\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1359.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 79, line 19 of the bill, strike ``under this Act or \n     previous appropriations Acts.'' and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following: ``under this or any other Act.''\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is merely a technical amendment sent \nup simply so Members proposing amendments should ask to have it set \naside. We will proceed in a more orderly manner in that fashion.\n  I expected the Senator from Washington to make a motion to strike. If \nshe wishes to do so now, there will be an amendment to that, and we can \ncomplete this debate. If she does not wish to do so, the Senator from \nNew Hampshire is prepared to offer an amendment on which there could be \na vote probably in an hour or so.\n  Does the Senator from Washington wish to make a motion to strike or \nsome other motion at the present time?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I do intend to offer this amendment. My \ncolleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, desires to speak first and \nthen I will.\n  Mr. GORTON. There is plenty of time to speak after the amendments are \nbefore the Senate. If the Senator, my colleague from Washington, wishes \nto make a motion to strike now, I will yield the floor for her to do \nso. If she does not, I suggest we go on to an amendment we can deal \nwith right away.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if my colleague from Washington State \nwill yield for a question.\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. We want to make sure that all the Members on the other \nside who wish to speak on this are ready to do so.\n  Mr. GORTON. There will be no limitation on debate until the amendment \nis agreed on both sides.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. With that understanding, I am happy to offer my \namendment at this time.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1360\n\n  (Purpose: To strike the provision relating to millsite limitations)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I send my amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nlaid aside.\n\n[[Page S9355]]\n\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Mr. \n     Durbin, and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 1360.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 122, strike lines 1 through 15.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1361\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself, Mr. Craig, \n     and Mr. Bryan, propose an amendment numbered 1361 to the \n     language proposed to be stricken by amendment No. 1360.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be stricken, insert:\n\n     SEC.   . MILLSITES OPINION.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Millsite Limitations.--Notwithstanding \n     the opinion dated November 7, 1997, by the Solicitor of the \n     Department of the Interior concerning millsites under the \n     general mining law (referred to in this section as the \n     ``opinion''), in accordance with the millsite provisions of \n     the Bureau of Land Management's Manual Sec. 3864.1.B (dated \n     1991), the Bureau of Land Management Handbook for Mineral \n     Examiners H-3890-1, page III-8 (dated 1989), and section \n     2811.33 of the Forest Service Manual (dated 1990), the \n     Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture \n     shall not, for any fiscal year, limit the number or acreage \n     of millsites based on the ratio between the number or acreage \n     of millsites and the number or acreage of associated lode or \n     placer claims with respect to any patent application \n     grandfathered pursuant to Section 312 of this Interior \n     Appropriations Act of __; any operation or property for which \n     a plan of operations has been previously approved; any \n     operation or property for which a plan of operations has been \n     submitted to the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service \n     prior to October 1, 2000; or any subsequent amendment or \n     modification to such approved or submitted plans.\n       (b) No Ratification.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     constructed as an explicit or tacit adoption, ratification, \n     endorsement or approval of the opinion.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I simply want to say I have every \nunderstanding of the consternation and the concern of my friends from \nWashington, California, and Illinois about the state of mining in \nAmerica. They have concerns that should be raised. They have concerns \nthat have been raised. However, this very narrow issue is being talked \naround.\n  The fact of the matter is, the picture that my friend from Washington \nheld up, a beautiful mountain area in Washington, has nothing to do \nwith what we are talking about tonight.\n  The fact is the pictures she showed were pictures from some other \nmining operation that probably took place at least 60 years ago.\n  Let's take, for example, a mine that is right over the Nevada border \nin California. It is called Viceroy Gold. It is in the State of the \nSenator from California, but it is a mine that is very close to the \npeople of the State of Nevada. It is a short distance from the place I \nwas born, Searchlight, NV. It took $80 million to get that operation in \na situation where it could be mined. It started out as an old mine and \nwas originally called Big Chief Mine around the turn of the century. \nAfter spending $80 million, this mine was developed. It is an open-pit \nmine.\n  I invite everyone to look at that mine because part of the \nrequirements of being allowed to mine there is the land has to be \nreclaimed. This is an area where they have Joshua trees and some small \ncedar trees, lots of sagebrush. They have a nursery. When they decide \nto take some ore, some muck, some dirt out of the ground, they take the \ntrees that are where this open-pit mine is going to be, and they save \nthem. When that area is mined out, they have to reclaim the land. They \nfill it up and replant these trees. That is going on right now.\n  That mine only has about a 2-year life left. When the mine is \nfinished, the land will look like it did before. That is one of the \nrequirements. They put up a big bond which makes that necessary. It is \nnot a question of they do it because they like to do it; they do it \nbecause that is a requirement of the State of California that they \nreplace the land the way it used to be.\n  It is good to do all these scary pictures about mining. My father was \na miner, and if my father thought there was gold under my desk, he \nwould dig a hole. That is the way he used to do things. But you cannot \ndo that anymore. There are requirements that say you cannot do that.\n\n  I say to my friends from the State of Illinois, from the State of \nCalifornia, and the State of Washington, I have tried to change the \n1872 mining law. We have been trying to do that for 10 or 12 years. We \noffered legislation to change that. We have been as far as conference \nto change it, but it is never quite good enough. No one is willing to \ngo 50 yards; they want to go 100 yards.\n  I have always said: Let's change it; let's do it incrementally. It is \nsimilar to the Endangered Species Act in which I believe. People want \nto rewrite the Endangered Species Act totally. It will never happen. We \nare going to have to do it piece by piece.\n  Superfund legislation: I believe in the Superfund legislation. We are \nnever going to reauthorize Superfund totally. We need to do it piece by \npiece. That is what we need to do with this mining law.\n  What are we talking about? Secretary Bruce Babbitt is only going to \nbe Secretary of the Interior for another year and a half. He is not \nwilling to go through the legislative process. What he wants to do is \nlegislate at the Department of Interior, down at 16th Street or 14th \nStreet, wherever it is. He is legislating down there, and he has \nadmitted it.\n  Secretary Babbitt has indicated he is proud of his procedure and \nproud of the way he is doing it. This is what he has said:\n\n       . . . We've switched the rules of the game. We're not \n     trying to do anything legislatively.\n\n  Here is what else he says:\n\n       One of the hardest things to divine is the intent of \n     Congress because most of the time . . . legislation is put \n     together usually in a kind of a House/Senate kind of thing \n     where it's [a bunch of] munchkins . . .\n\n  The munchkins, Mr. President, are you and me. He may not like that, \nbut I think rather than taking an appointment from the President, he \nshould do as the First Lady and run for the Senate and see if he can \nget it changed faster.\n  Our country is set up with three separate but equal branches of \nGovernment. The executive branch of Government does not have the right \nto legislate. It is as simple as that. What has been done in this \ninstance is legislating. That is wrong.\n  What we are doing--and that is what this debate is all about--is not \nchanging anything. We are putting it back the way it was before he \nwrote this opinion--he did not write it; some lawyer in his office \nwrote it--overturning a law of more than 100 years.\n  All these pictures are not the issue at point. I do not think any of \nmy colleagues will agree that President Clinton or any of his Cabinet \nofficers or anybody in the executive branch of Government have the \nlegal ability to write laws. That is our responsibility, and that is \nwhat this debate is about today.\n  I recognize the 1872 mining law needs to be changed. Let's do it. I \nam not debating the fact that it needs to be changed. I have offered \nlegislation at the committee level and the conference level to change \nthe amount of money that mining companies pay when they get a patent. \nWe all agree that should be done, but they do not want to do it because \nit takes away a great piece of argument they have: You can get land for \n$5 an acre.\n\n  We have agreed to change it. It has been in conference where we said: \nIf you go through all the procedures to get a patent, then you should \npay fair market value for the land. We agree. Let's do it.\n  They keep berating these mining companies. Mining is in a very \ndifficult time right now. The price of gold is around $250. Yesterday, \nthe press reported that a company from a little town in Nevada called \nBattle Mountain in Lander County laid off 200 more workers. That little \ncommunity has had a little bar and casino for some 60 years. That just \nclosed. Mining is in very difficult shape.\n\n[[Page S9356]]\n\n  I say to my friends who care about working men and women in this \ncountry, the highest paid blue collar workers in America are miners. I \nrepeat: The highest paid blue collar workers in America are miners. \nThey are being laid off because mining companies cannot proceed as they \nhave with these jobs when the gold price has dropped $150 an ounce. It \nwent from almost $400 to $250. They are really struggling. England just \nsold I do not know how many tons of gold. The IMF is threatening to \nsell gold. Switzerland is talking about selling gold.\n  Mining companies are having a difficult time maintaining. One of the \nlargest mining companies in Nevada--the State of Nevada is the third \nlargest producer of gold in the world. South Africa and Australia lead \nNevada. We produce a lot of gold, but the confidence of the mining \nindustry has been shaken tremendously. It is getting more and more \ndifficult to make these mines profitable.\n  One mining company in Nevada, a very large company, has had two \nsuccessive years of tremendous losses. We have one mining company that \nstill has some profits, the reason being that they sold into the \nfuture. They are still being paid on a high price of gold which the \nfree market does not support.\n  I say to my friends, let's change the mining law. All we are trying \nto do, I repeat, is not let Secretary Bruce Babbitt legislate. That is \nwhat he did. All this does is take the law back to the way it existed.\n  I heard my friend from Washington say: Why don't the mining \ncompanies--I may have the wrong word; ``dialog'' is not the word she \nused--have some dealings with Congress? They have tried. We are trying \nto come up with legislation on which we should all agree.\n  I hope my friends, for whom I have the deepest respect, understand \nthis is a very narrow issue. I do not mind all the speeches. My friend \nfrom California, my friend from Washington, and my friend from Illinois \nare some of the most articulate people in the Senate. They have great \nrecords on the environment. My record on the environment is second to \nno one. I acknowledge I have defended the mining industry in this \nChamber for many years, and I will continue to do so. I want everyone \nto understand I have tried to be reasonable on this issue, at least \nthat is according to through whose eyes you look. I have tried to be \nreasonable on this issue before us today.\n  Also, I have tried to be reasonable on the mining issue generally. As \nmy friends will acknowledge, in the subcommittee I offered a very \nminimal amendment. It was broadened in the full committee, which is \nfine. But what I have done, along with Senators Bryan and Craig, is \ntried to change what was done in the full committee.\n  I think what we have done is reasonable. I tell my friends, \nbasically, here is what it says. It says Babbitt's opinion does not \napply to mining operations that are now ongoing and mining operations \nthat are ongoing that need additional mill sites. It does not apply to \nnew applications. I think that is fair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. In a second.\n  I think it is fair. I say to my friends, I think it should not apply \nto anything because I think the opinion is worthless and does not have \nany meat on its bones. I do not think the Solicitor has any right to \noffer the opinion that he did. But I think this amendment is an effort \nto kind of calm things down, to compromise things. I say to my friends, \nif you want the law changed, let's change it. I am happy to work with \nyou.\n  I am happy to yield for a question without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I appreciate the Senator yielding for a question because \nthe Senator has a second-degree to my amendment that strikes the \nlanguage. I understand the Senator from Nevada would like to find a \ncompromise, but the language of the second-degree says that:\n\n       . . .any operation or property for which a plan of \n     operations has been previously approved; any operation or \n     property for which a plan of operations has been submitted to \n     the Bureau of Land Management or Forest Service prior to \n     October 1, 2000; or any subsequent amendment or modification \n     to such approved or submitted plans.\n\n  To me, it says that leaves the door open for any future, not just \ncurrent, mine.\n  Mr. REID. We can even talk about the effective date of this \nlegislation. But the intent of the amendment is to protect those \noperations that are now ongoing. Secretary Babbitt has written a letter \nto me--that is part of the record of the committee--saying that mining \noperations that are now in effect would not be harmed by his \nSolicitor's opinion. What this amendment does is go one step further \nand say, not only the mining operations that are now in effect but \nthose that are ever in effect that have filed a plan of operation to \nexpand would also be protected.\n  So that is really the intent of the amendment.\n  I say to my friends, don't beat up on the mining industry. They \nsupply good jobs. We are willing to change the law. I do not know if \nany of my friends are on the committee of jurisdiction, the Natural \nResources Committee. I am not. I would be happy to work with you in any \nway I can, as I have indicated on at least one other occasion tonight.\n  We have tried. We have had legislation that dramatically changes the \n1872 mining law that has gotten as far as the conference between the \nHouse and Senate, but it was not good enough. We have made absolutely \nno changes in the law since I have been in the Senate, going on 13 \nyears. I want to make changes. There aren't too many people who are not \nwilling to make changes.\n\n  So I would hope we could tone down the bashing of the mining \ncompanies. They supply jobs. They are not trying to rape the \nenvironment. Under the rules that are now in effect, if they wanted to, \nit would be very hard to do.\n  In the place where I was raised, we have hundreds of holes in the \nground, created in the years when mining took place there. There are a \nlot of abandoned mines we need to take care of. There are laws in \neffect.\n  In the State of Nevada you have to have fences around some of the \nholes so people do not ride motorcycles into them or do things of that \nnature. Abandoned mines that create a harm to the environment, we need \nto clean them up. I am willing to work harder to have money to do that. \nBut let's limit what we are talking about to the harm that has already \nbeen done. Certainly we have a right to do anything legislatively we \nneed to do to protect harm from happening in the future. That is what I \nam willing to do.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Mike Haske, a congressional fellow in my \noffice, be granted privileges of the floor during the pendency of S. \n1292.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Chair would indulge me for a second.\n  I apologize to my friend from Illinois who I understand wants the \nfloor.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to make a quick unanimous consent \nrequest.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Sean Marsan and Liz Gelfer, both on \ndetail to the Appropriations Committee staff, and Kari Vander Stoep of \nmy personal staff, be granted floor privileges for the duration of the \ndebate on the fiscal year 2000 Interior and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Clarifications To Senate Committee Report No. 106-99\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I note for the Record technical clarifications to the \ncommittee report:\n  On page 37 of the report, the section of the Alaska National Interest \nLands Conservation Act that is cited should be section 1306(a), not \nsection 1307(a).\n  In the last paragraph on page 13 of the report, the reference to the \n``Las Vegas Water Authority'' is an error. The language should have \nreferred to the ``Las Vegas Valley Water District.''\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I rise in opposition to the motion that has been filed by \nthe Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, on behalf of himself, Senator Craig, \nand Senator Bryan.\n\n[[Page S9357]]\n\n  As I read the amendment that has been proposed by the Senator from \nNevada, there is virtually no change in the original language offered \nby Senator Craig.\n\n  What the Senator from Nevada seeks to do is to say those mining \noperations currently in operation, those which have the plans of \noperations submitted to the Bureau of Land Management prior to October \n1 of the year 2000, will not be subject to limitation on the acreage \nthat can be used for their dumping of their mill site. I would suggest \nto the Senator from Nevada it is a slightly different approach, but the \nnet impact is the same.\n  I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Nevada. I understand \nhis knowledge and familiarity with this subject is certainly far better \nthan my own. But I can tell the Senator, if he drives across my home \narea in down State Illinois, he will see the legacy of mining which we \ncontinue to live with.\n  In years gone by, in the State of Illinois, and many other States, \nmining companies literally took to the land, extracted whatever was \nvaluable, and left the mess behind for future generations. You can see \nit, not only in the areas where we had shaft mining, but you have on \nour prairies small mountains of what was left behind, often toxic in \nnature, that now have to be reclaimed by today's taxpayers. Or you \nmight visit Fulton County or southern Illinois and find areas that were \nstrip mined. What is left behind is horrible. It is scrub trees, \nstanding lakes, but, frankly, uninhabitable and unusable--left behind \nby a mining industry that had one motive: Profit.\n  It is interesting to me this debate really focuses on a law which was \nwritten 127 years ago. Not a single Member of the Senate would suggest \nthat our sensitivity to environmental issues is the same today as it \nwas 127 years ago. We know better. If you want to mine coal in Illinois \ntoday, you are held to high standards. The same is true in virtually \nevery State in the Union. You can no longer come in and plunder the \nland, take out the wealth from it, and leave behind this legacy of \nrubbish and waste, this lunar landscape. That is today. That is the \n20th century. That is 1999.\n  But when it comes to hard rock mining, we are driven and guided by a \nlaw that is 127 years old. It is interesting that the hard rock mining \nindustry has not really worked hard to bring about a real reform of the \nlaw. I think that has a lot to do with the fact they have a pretty \nsweet deal.\n  For $2.50 an acre, they can take taxpayers' land--owned by \nAmericans--and use it for their own profit, leaving their waste and \nmess behind, and move on.\n  For hundreds of dollars, they can extract millions of dollars of \nminerals and not pay the taxpayers a penny.\n  The Senator from Nevada says: Don't beat up on the mining industry. I \nthink that is a fair admonition. I don't believe we should beat up on \nthe environment either. We certainly shouldn't beat up on taxpayers. \nThe 1872 mining law does just that.\n\n  What is this all about? You will undoubtedly hear in a few minutes \nfrom the Senator from Idaho and others that some bureaucrat in the \nDepartment of the Interior in November of 1997 took it upon himself to \ndecide what the law would be and all this amendment is about is to try \nto say to that bureaucrat: It is none of your business. We will decide \nhow many acres you can use to dump your waste after you have mined on \nFederal land.\n  What is it all about? On November 7, 1997, the solicitor of the \nDepartment of Interior, Mr. Leshy, issued an opinion enforcing a \nprovision of the 1872 mining law which restricts the amount of public \nland that can be used to dump waste from hard rock mines.\n  Now, some of those who support this amendment believe that the 1872 \nmining law is open to interpretation. Interestingly enough, the other \nbody, the House of Representatives, by a margin of almost 100 Members, \nsaid that that interpretation is wrong. They go along with the position \nsupported by the Senator from Washington and myself. With respect to \nmill site claims, the law states: ``No location made on and after May \n10, 1872, shall exceed 5 acres.'' The law allows one 5-acre mill site \nclaim per mineral claim. It means that if you buy, at $2.50 an acre or \n$5 an acre, the right to mine for these minerals, you can only use a 5-\nacre plot to dump your waste on the so-called mill site.\n  The effect of the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada and \nthe Senator from Idaho is to say: No, you can dump on as many acres as \nyou want to, unlimited. Go ahead and leave the waste behind. Let the \ntaxpayers in future generations worry about the environmental impact \nand what it does visually to America's landscape.\n  The Leshy opinion in 1997 simply reaffirms the plain language of the \nlaw and prior interpretations by Congress and by the mining industry.\n  I have in my hand citations of the mill site limitations under the \n1872 mining law. I ask unanimous consent to have this printed as part \nof the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Millsite Limits Under the 1872 Mining Law\n\n       1872--Mining Law enacted, stating: ``no location [of a \n     millsite] shall exceed five acres.'' 30 U.S.C. Sec. 42(a).\n       1872--One month later, General Land Office issues \n     regulation stating: ``The law expressly limits mill-site \n     locations made from and after its passage to five acres .  .  \n     .'' Mining Regulations Sec. 91, June 10, 1872, Copp, U.S. \n     Mining Decisions 270, 292 (1874) (emphasis in original).\n       1884--Secretary of the Interior rules in J.B. Hoggin, 2 \n     L.D. 755, that more than one millsite may be patented with a \n     lode claim, provided that the aggregate is not more than five \n     acres.\n       1891--Secretary of the Interior rules in Hecla Consolidated \n     Mining, 12 L.D. 75, that the Mining Law ``expressly limits \n     the amount of land to be taken in connection with a mill to \n     five acres.''\n       1891--Acting Secretary of the Interior rules in Mint Lode \n     and Mill Site, 12 L.D. 624, that the Mining Law ``evidently \n     intends to give to each operator of a lode claim, a tract of \n     land, not exceeding five acres in extent, for the purpose of \n     conducting mining or milling operations thereon, in \n     connection with such lode.''\n       1903--Acting Secretary of the Interior rules in Alaska \n     Copper Co., 32 L.D. 128, that the ``manifest purpose [of the \n     millsite provision of the Mining Law] is to permit the \n     proprietor of a lode mining claim to acquire a small tract of \n     . . . land as directly auxiliary to the prosecution of active \n     mining operations upon his lode claim, or for the erection of \n     a quartz mill. . . . The area of such additional tract is by \n     the terms of the statute restricted to five acres as \n     obviously ample for either purpose.''\n       1914--Curtis H. Lindley writes in the third edition of his \n     oft-cited treatise Lindley on Mines, Sec. 520, that a ``lode \n     proprietor may select more than one tract [for a millsite] if \n     the aggregate does not exceed five acres.''\n       1955--Denver mining attorney John W. Shireman writes in the \n     First Annual Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Institute that ``Each \n     lode claim is entitled to one mill site for use in connection \n     therewith . . .'' Shireman, ``Mining Location Procedures,'' 1 \n     Rocky Mtn. Min. L. Inst. 307, 321 (1955).\n       1960--Congress amends the Mining Law to allow location of \n     millsites in connection with placer claims. In its report on \n     the bill, the Senate Interior Committee explained that it had \n     modified the language of the bill ``so as to impose a limit \n     of one 5-acre millsite in any individual case preventing the \n     location of a series of 5-acre millsites in cases where a \n     single claim is jointly owned by several persons. . . . In \n     essence, [the bill] merely grants to holders of placer claims \n     the same rights to locate a 5-acre millsite as has been the \n     case since 1872 in respect to holders of lode claims . . .'' \n     S. Rep. No. 904, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., at 2.\n       1960--The first edition of American Law of Mining (which is \n     written primarily by attorneys for the mining industry) \n     states: ``A mill site may, if necessary for the claimant's \n     mining or milling purposes, consist of more than one tract of \n     land, provided that it does not exceed five acres in the \n     aggregate.'' 1 Am. L. Mining Sec. 5.35 (1960).\n       1968--The American Mining Congress (the leading trade \n     association for the mining industry) presents the following \n     argument for mining law reform to the Public Land Law Review \n     Commission:\n       ``When the mining laws were enacted in 1872, provision was \n     made for the acquisition of five-acre millsites to be used \n     for plant facilities on mining claims. The typical mine then \n     was a high-grade lode or vein deposit from which ores were \n     removed by underground mining. The surface plant was usually \n     relatively small, and acquisition of five-acre millsites in \n     addition to the surface of mining clams . . . adequately \n     served the needs of the mines. . . .\n       ``Today, the situation is frequently different. . . . A \n     mine having 500 acres of mining claims may, for example, \n     require 5000 acres for surface plant facilities and waste \n     disposal areas. It is obvious that such activities may not be \n     acquired through five-acre millsites.''--American Mining \n     Congress, The Mining Law and Public Lands, at 29 January 11, \n     1968).\n       1970--An analysis of the Mining Law prepared for the Public \n     Land Law Review Commission by Twitty, Sievwright & Mills (a \n     Phoenix, Ariz. law firm that represents the mining industry) \n     closely tracked the argument by the American Mining Congress \n     two years earlier:\n\n[[Page S9358]]\n\n       ``When the mining laws were enacted in 1872, provision was \n     made for the acquisition of five-acre mill sites to be used \n     for mining or milling purposes. The typical mine then was a \n     high-grade lode or vein deposit from which ore was removed by \n     underground mining. The surface plant was usually relatively \n     small, and the surface of the mining claims together with the \n     incident mill sites adequately served the needs of the mines \n     for plant facilities and waste disposal areas.\n       ``Today, the situation is frequently different. The high-\n     grade underground mines have, for the most part, been mined \n     out. Open pit rather than underground mining is, with \n     increasing frequency, the most economical way to mine the \n     low-grade deposits which now comprise a major portion of \n     the reserves of many minerals. The mining industry now \n     relies on mechanization, the handling of large tonnages of \n     overburden and ores and the utilization of large surface \n     plants in order to keep costs down so that these low-grade \n     deposits may be mined and treated at a profit. Such mining \n     operations require not only substantial areas for plant \n     facilities, but much larger ares than formerly for the \n     disposal of overburden and mill tailings. The surface \n     areas of mining claims and mill sites are no longer \n     adequate for such purposes. * * *\n       ``If a mineral deposit is partially or entirely surrounded \n     by the public domain, the acquisition of adjacent nonmineral \n     land from the United States for necessary facilities is now \n     frequently extremely difficult because the laws do not \n     provide a satisfactory way to make these acquisitions. Small \n     areas may be acquired as mill sites, and in certain \n     instances, if the lands meet the statutory requirement as \n     isolated or disconnected tracts, larger acreages may be \n     acquired at public auction. Mining companies planning large \n     mining operations have been obliged to meet their needs for \n     nonmineral lands by obtaining the necessary lands by other \n     means.''\n       Twitty, Sievwright & Mills, ``Nonfuel Mineral Resources of \n     the Public Lands; A Study Prepared for the Public Land Law \n     Review Commission,'' (Dec. 1970), at vol. 3, pp. 1047-48 \n     (emphasis added).\n       The Twitty, Sievwright study also states: ``Under the first \n     clause of subsection (a) of [30 U.S.C. Sec. 42], each lode \n     claimant is allowed, in addition to his lode claim, five \n     acres of land to be used for mining or milling purposes.'' \n     Id. at vol. 2, p. 323.\n       1974--the Interior Board of Land Appeals rules in United \n     States v. Swanson, 14 IBLA 158, 173-74, that:\n  [A millsite] claimant is entitled to receive only that amount of land \nneeded for his mining and milling operations, and this amount can \nembrace a tract of less than five acres. The statute states that the \nlocation shall not ``exceed five acres.'' . . . The reference to five \nacres in the statute is clearly a ceiling measure, not an absolute, \nautomatic grant.''\n       1977--Salt Lake City mining attorneys Clayton J. Parr and \n     Dale A. Kimball write that ``Theoretically, one five-acre \n     millsite can be acquired for each valid mining claim.'' Parr \n     & Kimball, ``Acquisition of Non-Mineral Land for Mine Related \n     Purposes,'' 23 Rocky Mtn. Min. L. Inst. 595, 641-42 (1977).\n       1979--In an analysis of federal mining law, the \n     Congressional Office of Technology Assessment states:\n       ``[I]t is highly doubtful that [millsites] could satisfy \n     all the demands for surface space.There could be at most as \n     many millsites as there are mining claims, and each milliste \n     would be at most one-fourth the size of the typical 20-acre \n     claim, so that the millsites, in the aggregate, would be one-\n     fourth the size of the ore body encompassed by the claims.''\n       Office of Technology Assessment, Management of Fuel and \n     Nonfuel Minerals in Federal Land, at 127 (April 1979).\n       1984--In the second edition of American Law of Mining, \n     Patrick J. Garver of the Salt Lake City law firm Parsons, \n     Behle & Latimer (Mr. Garver is now executive vice-president \n     of Barrick Gold Corp.) writes: ``Uncertainty also surrounds \n     the issue of the amount of land that may be used by millsite \n     claimants.'' 4 Am. L. Mining, Sec. 110.03[4] (2d ed. 1984).\n       1984--Salt Lake City mining attorneys Clayton J. Parr and \n     Robert G. Holt write in the second edition of American Law of \n     Mining: ``Because of the relatively uncertain tenure of mill \n     site claims, few miners choose mill sites as a location for \n     permanent mining support facilities.'' 4 Am L. Mining \n     Sec. 110.03[1].\n       1987--In the revised second edition of American Law of \n     Mining, Phoenix mining attorneys Jerry L. Haggard and Daniel \n     L. Muchow write:\n       ``The acquisition of federal lands or interests therein by \n     means other than the locating of mining claims or mill sites \n     is sometimes necessary to provide the additional ground \n     needed for a planned mining operation. The restraints on the \n     number and sizes of mill site claims can limit their \n     usefulness as a land acquisition method.''--4 Am. L. Mining, \n     Sec. 111.01 (2d ed. rev. 1987).\n       1997--Solicitor of the Department of the Interior John D. \n     Leshy issues opinion titled ``Limitations on Patenting \n     Millsites Under the Mining Law of 1872.''\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I have quoted the specific words from the mining law of 1872. I can \ntell Senators that year after year, the 5-acre limitation was restated. \nThere is nothing new about it. In 1872, again, the General Land Office \nrefers to the law expressly limiting mill site locations made from and \nafter its passage to 5 acres.\n  Twelve years later, in 1884, Secretary of the Interior J.B. Hoggin \nprovided that the aggregate for lode claims is not more than 5 acres. \nIn 1891, similar references; 1903, the same reference is made by the \nActing Secretary of the Interior; the area of such additional tract is, \nby the terms of the statute, restricted to 5 acres. He goes on. In \n1914, a treatise on mining by a gentleman named Curtis Lindley:\n\n       Lode proprietors may select one tract per mill site if the \n     aggregate does not exceed 5 acres.\n\n  In 1955, Denver mining attorney John Shireman writes in the First \nAnnual Rocky Mountain Mineral Law Institute:\n\n       Each lode claim is entitled to 1 mill site for use in \n     connection therewith.\n\n  In 1960, Congress amended the mining law to allow location of mill \nsites in connection with placer claims. In its report on the bill, the \nSenate Interior Committee explained that it modified the language of \nthe bill ``so as to impose a limit of one 5-acre mill site in any \nindividual case, preventing the location of a series of 5-acre mill \nsites.''\n  The references go on and on. The American Mining Congress has \nacknowledged the 5-acre limitation, and of course the branches of \ngovernment have done the same.\n  What is in dispute here is, in the minds of a few Senators and the \nmining industry, the mining process has changed. They want to be able \nto use more acreage to dump what is left over from this mining process.\n  It is interesting that the mining industry is so confident that a \ncourt would hold up the 5-acre limitation that they have not in any way \ntested the solicitor's decision in court. They would rather find their \nfriends here in the Senate. That opinion was issued by the solicitor \nalmost 2 years ago.\n  You will hear a lot of comment--I have heard it in committee--that \nwhat Mr. Leshy did in this situation was unfair, illegal, and we are \ngoing to stop this bureaucrat from overreaching.\n  The obvious question is, If it is so unfair and illegal on its face, \nwhy didn't the mining industry go to court? They didn't go to court. \nThey went to Congress because they know that their interpretation, \ntheir opposition to Mr. Leshy, can't stand up in court.\n  The Craig rider and now the Reid amendment will allow more dumping of \ntoxic mining waste on public lands and undermine efforts to reform the \nlast American dinosaur, the 1872 mining law.\n  What can we find in this mined waste? Lead, arsenic, cadmium, in \naddition to heavy metals. Because of irresponsible mining practices and \npoor regulation, the mining industry has left behind a legacy of \n557,000 abandoned mines in 32 different States. The cost of cleaning up \nthese sites is estimated to be between $32 billion and $72 billion. \nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Mines, mining has contaminated more \nthan 12,000 miles of rivers and streams and 180,000 acres of lakes in \nthe United States.\n  Let me speak for a moment about the environmental damage. For those \nwho say this is an industry which, frankly, may not cause environmental \ndamage, I hope they will listen closely to what I am about to say: \n16,000 abandoned hard rock mine sites have surface and ground water \ncontamination problems that seriously degrade the water around them--\n16,000 of them. Over 60 of these abandoned hard rock mines pose such \nsevere threats to public health and safety that the EPA has listed them \nas Superfund priority sites.\n  There are two or three things that I found incredible that I want to \nshare and make a part of the Record.\n  Each year the mining industry creates nine times more waste than all \nof the municipal solid waste generated and discarded by all of the \ncities in the United States of America. In 1987, mines in the United \nStates dumped 1.7 billion tons of solid waste onto our land while the \ntotal municipal solid waste from all cities in America totaled 180 \nmillion tons.\n  The second point--and this is hard to believe--each year the hard \nrock mining industry generates approximately\n\n[[Page S9359]]\n\nthe same amount of hazardous waste as all other U.S. industries \ncombined --one industry, hard rock mining, generating the same amount \nof hazardous waste as all other U.S. industries combined. You would \nthink when you listen to the arguments from those who would make this \ndumping unlimited that this is somehow a passive thing, that it is no \nthreat to the environment.\n  According to the EPA, the U.S. hard rock mining industry generated \napproximately 61 million tons of hazardous waste in 1985 compared to 61 \nmillion metric tons for all other American industries. And what the \nCraig and Reid amendment says is, for this dangerous waste, we will now \ngive to the mining companies an unlimited landscape of taxpayer-owned \nland to dump it.\n  Although the mining industry claims that modern mines employ state-\nof-the-art technology that prevents contamination, it is not \nconsistently used or managed properly. Some have said our references to \ncontamination are ancient. In 1995, reporting to Congress on mine \nwaste, the EPA stated not only had past mining activities created a \nmajor waste problem, but some of the very waste practices that \ncontributed to these problems were still being used by the mining \nindustry.\n  What kind of mining pollution? Acid mine drainage generated when rock \nwhich contains sulfide minerals reacts with water and oxygen to create \nsulfuric acid. Iron pyrite, fool's gold, is the most common rock type \nthat reacts to form acid mine drainage. Acid leached from the rock \nseverely degrades water quality, killing aquatic life and making water \nvirtually unusable.\n  Second, heavy metal contamination is caused when metals such as \narsenic, cobalt, copper, cadmium, lead, silver, or zinc contained in \nexcavated rock or exposed in an underground mine come in contact with \nwater. Heavy metals, even in trace amounts, can be toxic to humans and \nwildlife. When consumed, the metals can bio-accumulate.\n\n  Processing chemical pollution occurs when chemical agents used by \nmining companies to separate the target mineral from the ore--cyanide, \nsulfuric acid, or liquid metal mercury--spill, leak, or leach from the \nmine site into nearby waters. These chemicals can be highly toxic to \nhumans and wildlife.\n  The purpose of the amendment before us now is to expand the \nopportunity for dumping this kind of waste on public land, creating the \nopportunities for more environmental disasters and hazards to wildlife \nand humans as well.\n  A teaspoon of 2 percent cyanide solution can be lethal to humans; \nover 200 million pounds of cyanide is used in U.S. mining each year.\n  I have a lengthy list of examples here.\n\n       Gilt Edge Gold and Silver Mine, South Dakota: Shortly after \n     opening in 1988, the Gild Edge gold and silver mine cyanide \n     leaked into the groundwater and nearby streams as a result of \n     torn containment liners, poor mine design, and sloppy \n     management practices. Beginning in 1992 the mine began \n     generating acid mine drainage. As a result of acid drainage \n     from Gilt Edge waste piles, pH measurements in nearby steams \n     in 1994 and 1995 were as low as 2.1 (battery acid has a pH of \n     approximately 1; pure water has a pH of approximately 7.0). \n     Due to pollution from the Gilt Edge Mine, area streams are \n     unable to support viable populations of fish and bottom \n     dwelling invertebrates\n       Summitville Gold Mine, Colorado: In 1986 Canadian based \n     Galactic Resources opened the Summitville Gold Mine in \n     Colorado. The company characterized the mine as a ``state-of-\n     the-art'' cyanide heap leach gold mine. Immediately after \n     gold production began, the protective lining under the \n     massive heap of ore being treated with a cyanide solution \n     tore, allowing cyanide to leak into the surface and \n     groundwater. The cyanide, acid, and metal pollution from the \n     mine contaminated 17 miles of the Alamosa River. Galactic \n     declared bankruptcy and abandoned the site in 1992. The State \n     of Colorado which had provide scant regulation of the mine \n     asked the Environmental Protection Agency to take over the \n     site under the Superfund program. As of 1996 taxpayers had \n     spent over $100 million to clean up the site.\n       Iron Mountain, California: Until production was halted in \n     1963, the Iron Mountain mine produced a wealth of iron, \n     silver, gold, copper and zinc. It also left a mountain of \n     chemically-reactive ore and waste rock that continues to \n     leach enormous amounts of acid and heavy metals pollution \n     into nearby streams and the Sacramento River.\n       Despite expensive efforts to reduce pollution--Iron \n     Mountain is now on the Superfund National Priority List--\n     enormous amounts of contaminants continue to wash off the \n     site. Each day Iron Mountain discharges huge quantities of \n     heavy metals including 425 pounds of copper, 1,466 pounds of \n     zinc, and 10 pounds of cadmium. Acid waters draining from the \n     site have decimated streams, where the acidity in the water \n     has been measured as low as minus 3 on the pH scale--10,000 \n     times more acidic than battery acid. Streams downstream from \n     the mine are nearly devoid of life. Experts have estimated \n     that at present pollution rates the Iron Mountain site can be \n     expected to leach acid for at least 3,000 years before the \n     pollution source is exhausted.\n       Oronogo Duenweg Superfund Site, Missouri: Drinking wells \n     near this sprawling complex of lead and zinc mines in \n     Southwestern Missouri have been contaminated by past mining \n     activities.\n       Chino Copper Mine, New Mexico: The mine has been plagued by \n     spills, leaks and discharges of contaminated mine waste \n     material. Much of the pollution has spilled into Whitewater \n     Creek which runs through densely populated communities. In \n     several incidents in 1987, the mine spilled more than 327,000 \n     gallons of mine wastewater off the site. In 1988 another \n     spill discharged more than 180 million gallons of mine \n     wastewater. More than 90,000 gallons of wastewater were \n     spilled in 1990, and another 120,000 gallons were spilled in \n     1992.\n       Brewer Gold Mine, South Carolina: Nearly 11,000 fish were \n     killed in 1990 when heavy rains cause a containment pond to \n     breach, dumping more than 10,000 million gallons of cyanide-\n     laden water into the Lynches River.\n       DeLamar Mine, Idaho: The DeLalmar silver and gold mine in \n     Idaho has repeatedly dumped heavy metal laced wastewater into \n     nearby streams. Migratory waterfowl have been poisoned by \n     cyanide from its ponds.\n       Stibnite Mine, Idaho: The Stibnite gold mine has leaked \n     cyanide into nearby groundwater and the East Fork of the \n     Salmon River, an important salmon spawning run.\n       Ray Mine, Arizona: The Ray Mine was polluted nearby \n     groundwater with toxic levels of copper and Beryllium. In \n     1990, rainwater washed more than 324,000 gallons of copper-\n     sulfite contaminated wastewater from the mine into the Gila \n     River.\n\n  Mr. President, what we are doing today--and I am supporting the \namendment of the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray--is asking the \nmining industry to take responsibility for their actions, to follow the \nlaw as it is clearly written, which limits to 5 acres the mill site, or \ndump site, they can use for their mining activities. Some of the \npictures here--I am sure the Senator from Nevada and others think this \npicture, as graphic as it is, is ancient. I don't know. There is no \ndate on it, and I won't represent that it is a modern scene, but it \nshows what unregulated mining has led to. It is a clear indication of a \nstream that is still in danger because of the pollution from the mining \nactivities.\n  Modern mining techniques are represented in these photographs, and \nalthough they are hard for those following the debate to see, they \nsuggest that when we get into hard-rock mining, we are talking about \nliterally hundreds, if not thousands, of acres that become part of the \ndump site of this activity. A mining operation, after it has derived \nthe valuable minerals from this Federal public land owned by taxpayers, \ngot out of town and left this behind. So for generations to come, if \nthey fly over, they will look down and say: I wonder who made that \nmess.\n  That is as good as it gets under the 1872 mining law. That is a sad \ncommentary. Those who support the Craig-Reid amendment would like us to \nexpand the possibility that these dump sites near the mines would \nbasically be unlimited. They could go on for miles and miles, and we, \nas taxpayers, would inherit this headache in years to come. There is \nclearly a need for comprehensive mining reform.\n  About $4 billion worth of hard-rock minerals--gold, copper, silver, \nand others--are taken annually from public lands by mining companies \nwithout a penny paid to the U.S. taxpayer in royalties--not one cent. \nThat is $4 billion each year out of our land, and not a penny is paid \nback to the taxpayers.\n  What would you think about it if your next-door neighbor knocked on \nthe door and said he would like to cut down the trees in your back \nyard, incidentally, and said he will give you $2.50, and I am sure that \nis no problem. Of course, it is a problem. It is our property. On that \nproperty are treasures of value to us. We are talking about public \nlands that are our property as American citizens. Those who live in \nsome States believe that that land belongs to them, for whatever they \nwant to use it for. Some of us, as part of the United States of \nAmerica--``E. Pluribus Unum,'' as it says above the chair of the \nPresiding Officer, ``of many one''--believe that as one Nation we have \nan interest in this public land,\n\n[[Page S9360]]\n\nan interest that goes beyond giving somebody an opportunity to profit \nand leave a shameful environmental legacy.\n  Since 1872, there has been more than $240 billion of taxpayer \nsubsidies to the mining industry.\n  In 1993, the Stillwater Mining Company paid $5 an acre for 2,000 \nacres of national forest lands containing minerals with an estimated \nvalue of $35 billion. I will repeat that. They gave us, as taxpayers, \n$10,000 for access to $35 billion worth of minerals. Pretty sweet deal \nfor the mining company. Not for the taxpayers.\n  In 1994, American Barrick Corporation gained title to approximately a \nthousand acres of public land in Nevada that contained over $10 billion \nin recoverable gold reserves. Now, for access to $10 billion on Federal \npublic lands, America's lands, how much did they pay? Five thousand \none-hundred and forty dollars. A pretty sweet deal.\n\n  In 1995, a Danish mining company--not an American company--\nsuccessfully patented public lands in Idaho containing over $1 billion \nworth of minerals, and this Danish company paid the American treasury \n$275--for $1 billion in minerals.\n  Due to irresponsible mining practices and poor regulation, the mining \nindustry has left behind a legacy of 557,000 hard-rock abandoned mines \nin 32 States. As the Senator from Washington said earlier, the \nestimated cost of cleanup is $32 billion to $72 billion.\n  If this amendment passes that is being pushed on us today, it means \nthere will be more land to be cleaned up. The estimate of $32 billion \nto $72 billion will grow as the profits are taken out of America's \npublic lands.\n  There is one case I would like to tell you about: the Zortman-\nLanduski Mine. The Pegasus Gold Corporation operated these mines for \nyears using Federal and private lands for mining and waste dumping, \naccumulating numerous citations for water quality violations. In \nJanuary of 1998, Pegasus Gold Corporation filed for bankruptcy. The \nmines are now in the hands of a court-appointed judge. But the story \ngets better. Cost estimates for reclamation of these lands range from \n$9 million to $120 million. In other words, if we want to clean up the \nmess they left behind, it will cost taxpayers $9 million to $120 \nmillion.\n  Keep in mind, the amendment before us wants to expand the opportunity \nto leave that waste behind. More bills for future taxpayers to pay.\n  I know you are going to like this part. There are questions about \nwhether the mine's reclamation bonds will be sufficient to pay for the \ncleanup. Here is where it gets good. In the meantime, Pegasus Gold \nCorporation has petitioned the bankruptcy court to provide $5 million \nin golden parachutes for departing executives. The same executives who \nleft this trail of contamination now want to take out of the bankrupt \ncorporation $5 million in golden parachutes because they have done such \na fine job for the shareholders. They certainly didn't do a fine job \nfor the taxpayers. They didn't do a fine job when it came to the \nenvironment.\n  If this amendment in the Interior Appropriation bill passes, it is an \ninvitation for more greed and more environmental disasters. The mining \nindustry has to accept the responsibility to come to Washington, deal \nacross the table in a fair manner and in good faith to revise this law \nso they can pay royalties to the taxpayers for what they draw from this \nland. Instead, what they have done is try to force-feed through the \nInterior Appropriations bill a change in the law that will say that the \nnumber of acres used for disposal of waste and tailings is unlimited--\nunlimited.\n  So we will see further environmental disasters which undoubtedly will \noccur as a result of it.\n  The Senator from Washington started with the right amendment, an \namendment which recognizes our obligation to future generations. It is \nnot enough to make a fast buck or even to create a job today and leave \nbehind a legacy for which future generations will have to pay. We don't \naccept that in virtually anything. Businesses across America understand \nthat they have an obligation to not only make a profit, to not only \nemploy those who work there, but to also clean up the mess and not \ncontaminate the environment.\n  We have said that in a civilized nation it is too high a price to pay \nfor those who just want to glean profits and to leave behind pollution \nof our air and water and other natural resources. For some reason, many \npeople in the mining industry haven't received that message. They \nbelieve they can take the minerals from public lands and leave the \nenvironmental contamination behind.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I said in my statement that since I have been here, the \n1872 mining law hasn't changed. I meant it had not changed in its \nentirety. The fact is that we in the Senate and in the House changed \nthe 1872 mining law. It was changed in significant ways, such as \npassage of the moratorium on patents and a number of things. I didn't \nwant the Senator to think the law hasn't been changed.\n  I ask my friend from Illinois, what does he think the mining \ncompanies should do? Does he think there should be mining to some \ndegree? Can he tell me? I would be happy to translate the message to \nthem. What more does the Senator think can be done than they have done \nin the past few years?\n  Let me tell the Senator what they have done. They met with us when we \nwere in the majority. They met with us when we were in the minority. \nThey met with the other side of the aisle when they were in the \nminority and in the majority. They have agreed to bills. They have \nagreed to pay royalties.\n  I say to my friend, what more can they do? They want to be good \ncitizens. They help with things. I can only speak for the State of \nNevada. I think around the country they are good corporate citizens. \nThey help with the schools. They pay their taxes. What more should they \ndo?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say in response to the Senator from Nevada that I think \nthere is a good starting point. It is existing law that has been there \nfor a long time. They should look at the current law as it applies to \nthose who would mine coal on Federal public lands. If they would follow \nthe standards that apply to the mining of coal, here is the difference. \nWe would have approval by the BLM through a leasing process for the \nselection of mining sites.\n  Mr. REID. Could I say to my friend that we have that now?\n  Mr. DURBIN. What we have now is self-initiation and location under \nthe mining law of 1872 with no BLM approval required.\n  Mr. REID. That simply isn't true. In fact, I say to my friend from \nIllinois, the cost of patenting a claim is in the multimillions of \ndollars now. It is not easy to get through the process that has been \nset up.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator that I stand by my remarks. We could \ncertainly resolve this later when we look more closely at the law.\n\n  The second thing I would suggest is they pay a royalty. I think it is \nan outrage that they would pay $2.50 or $5 an acre and not pay a \nroyalty to the taxpayers when they take millions, if not billions, of \ndollars worth of recoverable minerals out of our federally owned public \nlands.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend that there is general agreement. The \nmining companies agree. Eight years ago, we went to conference and \nagreed to change the amount they paid when a patent is issued.\n  I also say to my friend that the mining companies signed off on a \nroyalty. That was something initiated here. I have to ask someone here. \nIt passed. I can't tell you that it passed. But it was on the Senate \nfloor that a royalty was agreed to.\n  I say to my friend that I hope this is the beginning of a dialogue \nwhere we can really get something done. There is nobody that I have \nmore respect for than the Senator from Arkansas, who was the \nspokesperson against mining companies for all the years I was here--the \ngreatest respect in the world. But I say to my friend that he wanted \nall or nothing, and we kept getting nothing.\n  I hope my friends will allow us to improve something. We have made \nvery small improvements. I say to my friend that those of us who \nsupport mining and the mining companies want changes. They know it \ndoesn't look good, from a public relations standpoint, for them to pay \n$2.50 or $5 for a\n\n[[Page S9361]]\n\npiece of land. They know that. But there was something that passed the \nSenate which allowed the payment of fair market value. That was turned \ndown in conference.\n  I say to my friend that I know how sincerely he believes in this. I \nwill give him the line and verse. In fact, the Forest Service handbook \ntalks about this very thing. In effect, the solicitor's opinion \noverruled their own handbook. I hope this will lead to improvement of \nthe law. We all recognize it needs changing. I am willing to work with \nthe Senator in that regard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Senator for allowing me to interrupt. I \nappreciate it very much.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada, because I believe the \nstatements he made are in good faith and reflect where we should be. We \nshould be sitting down and rewriting this law that is 127 years old \ninstead of having other environmental riders in an Interior \nappropriations bill. We should be looking to the royalty question, \nwhich is a legitimate question that every taxpayer should be interested \nin instead of saying we are going to take the limitation of the acreage \nused by mining companies that dump their waste.\n  I think that is a legitimate concern. Maybe 5 acres isn't enough. But \nI also think it wouldn't be unreasonable to say to the mining \ncompanies: If we give you additional acres for mill sites, we will also \nrequire you to reclaim the land so that you can't leave the mess \nbehind.\n  That is part of the law when it comes to coal mining on Federal \npublic lands. Why shouldn't it be the case when it comes to hard-rock \nmining?\n  How can they step away from this mess and say: Frankly, future \ngenerations will have to worry about it, and we will not. Mandatory \nbonding, detailed permitting reclamation, mandated inspections--things \nthat are part of the law when it comes to mining coal--should be part \nof the law when it comes to hardrock mining.\n\n  I reject the idea that we will come in with this bill and make \namendments friendly to the mining industry but not hold them to any new \nstandard when it comes to reclamation or royalties. I think the \ntaxpayers deserve better. I think the environment deserves better.\n  That is what is necessary in this debate. We have seen it, first, on \nthe emergency appropriations bill, where a similar provision was put \nforward for one mining operation in the State of Washington. Now, if \nthis amendment goes through, we have literally opened the door for \nmining operations across the United States to literally use as much \nacreage as they want for their mill sites.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask my good friend from Illinois, what environmental \nlaw? What environmental law are we talking about here?\n  Mr. DURBIN. We are talking about the 1872 Mining Act.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is not an environmental law.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would suggest to the Senator that it has an impact on \nthe environment.\n  Mr. BURNS. What environmental law are we talking about here?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have responded to the Senator. If he has another \nquestion, I will be happy to answer it.\n  Mr. BURNS. What environmental law? Is it the Clean Water Act? Is it \nthe Clean Air Act? Is it the National Environmental Policy Act? Is it \nthe National Federal Lands Management Act? What environmental law is \nthe Senator talking about when he refers to environmental law?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am talking about the 1872 Mining Act.\n  Mr. BURNS. I suggest to the Senator that is a land tenure law and \nsubject to all of the environmental laws. The miners are not exempt \nfrom them.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Montana, I think he knows well \nthe environmental laws which we mentioned are not applied seriatim to \nall of these mining claims, and that is why we have the environmental \ncontamination which we have today. That is one of the reasons why it is \nthere. If we are going to have a mining law, I think we need one that \ntalks not only about the profitability of the venture but about the \nenvironmental acceptability of this venture. That is the difficulty we \nrun into.\n  I suspect that the mining industry may want to talk about more \nacreage for mill sites and dumping but may not be as excited about an \nenvironmental response bill. That is part of the discussion, as I see \nit. Sadly enough, this amendment, which has been added to the Interior \nappropriations bill, addresses the profit side of the picture and \nignores the environmental and taxpayer side of the picture. That, to \nme, is shortsighted and something that should be defeated.\n  The fact that this was done in committee and has at least been \nattempted in the past is a suggestion to me that the mining industry, \neven with the Republican majority in the House and the Senate, really \nhasn't gone to the authorizing committees for the changes which have \nbeen suggested on the floor. I think they should. I think it is \ncertainly time, after 127 years, to update this law.\n  In closing, if we are going to change this law and change it in a \ncomprehensive and responsible way, let us do it through the regular \nauthorizing process.\n  It is interesting to me that yesterday we had a fierce debate on the \nfloor about rule XVI, and we said of rule XVI: We will not legislate on \nappropriations bills. Of course, there are always exceptions to every \nrule.\n\n  In this case, because there was a reference to the mining act in the \nbill coming over from the House, they were allowed to offer this \namendment. As Members may glean from the length and breadth of this \ndebate and its complexity, we should not be putting this environmental \nrider on an appropriations bill at the expense of the environment and \nthe taxpayers.\n  I say to the mining industry, a legitimate industry employing many \nhard-working people, certainly the things which are done are important \nto America's economy and its future, but it is not unreasonable for \nAmericans to think that we have a vested interest in our own public \nlands. Companies cannot leave behind this legacy of waste. Unlimited \nacreage being used for dump sites is not being held accountable.\n  This amendment, if it passes, will say to these mining companies: \nThese hard rock mining companies will not be held accountable. Use as \nmuch of America's land that is needed to dump your waste after you have \nmined the minerals. As taxpayers, we will accept it.\n  For this Senator from Illinois, the Senators from Washington and \nCalifornia and many others, that is unacceptable.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me speak directly to the Senator from \nIllinois, the Senator from Massachusetts, and the Senator from \nWashington. I have heard statements from the Senator from Illinois that \nI know he means in good faith but I think are wrong. The record must be \ncorrected in that regard. The law does not allow many of the things he \nhas suggested might happen.\n  For example, tonight he suggested that the Craig-Reid amendment would \nallow unlimited surface land domain. That is simply not true. Let me \nrepeat for the record, that is an inaccurate statement.\n  Here is what the law allows today and what the Reid-Craig amendment \ndoes: It simply reinstates the law as it exists today. The Senator from \nIllinois is absolutely right as to what the 1872 mining law says as to \nthe 5 acres per claim. However, what attorneys have said who were \nbrought before the subcommittee that I chair, while that was the law, \nit was based on the concept of the Comstock Lode, which was the mining \nactivity in the State of Nevada that generated the 1872 mining law. \nFrom that time forward to today, it was viewed in the law as a minimum \nnecessary requirement.\n  What the Senator from Illinois did not say, which refutes the idea \nthat this is some kind of unlimited land surface grab, is the BLM, the \nadministrator of claims on public land, in the\n\n[[Page S9362]]\n\nprocess of working with a mining company that is establishing a mining \noperation establishes the 5 acres and additional acres as is necessary \nto conduct that mining operation.\n  What does that mean? That does not mean unlimited acreages. It means \nexactly what I said it means. It means that the Bureau of Land \nManagement develops a mining plan consistent with the mining operation \nall inclusively consistent with the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water \nAct for a mining company to effectively mine the mineral estate they \nhave established under the mine plan and with their permit. That is not \nunlimited. It is our Federal Government. The BLM under the law \nestablishes the surface domain that a mining company can have for the \npurpose of operations.\n\n  Is that unlimited? I repeat to the Senator from Illinois, no, it is \nnot. It is restricted by the character of the process and by 127 years \nof operation. That is what it is. That is what we are attempting to \nreinstate.\n  The Senator from Illinois went on to say: Why didn't they go to the \ncourts? Why have they come to Congress? The reason they have come to \nCongress is because the act of the Solicitor would be automatic and \nimmediate. The Senator from Nevada earlier spoke to the consequence of \nthis decision.\n  Mining stock in this country dropped by a substantial percentage \npoint on the stock exchange because the Solicitor's opinion was saying \nif it were fully implemented both prospectively and retroactively, it \nwould dramatically halt existing mining operations and cost mining \ncompanies that were operating under good faith, the law, and the \nhistoric practice as prescribed by the Forest Service and the BLM, by \ntheir manual, and by their current handbooks, it would have simply \nstopped them, and they would have waved literally hundreds of millions \nof dollars in the process of developing a mining plan that was \nenvironmentally accurate and environmentally sound.\n  I know the Senator from the State of Washington is upset because the \ncrown jewel mine in her State was, by her own State's environment \ndirector, announced to be the best ever; that they had met all of the \nenvironmental standards; they were complying with all the Clean Air and \nWater Act and somehow the Solicitor stepped in and stopped the process.\n  The senior Senator from the State of Washington and the supplemental \nappropriations bill this year said it is just blatantly unfair for a \ncompany to operate in good faith under the law and under the \nenvironmental laws of our country. For the Solicitor, an appointed \nbureaucrat, to step in and stop them without any public process is \nagainst the very character of the law we create on this floor.\n  So the senior Senator from the State of Washington was right in doing \nwhat he did. At that supplemental appropriations conference, while I \nwas trying to do exactly what the Senator from Nevada and I have just \ndone with this amendment, we said: No, let's not do that.\n  I chair the Public Land Subcommittee, the mining subcommittee. Let's \nhold hearings on this issue. Let's see if the Solicitor is right in \ndoing what he has done. We brought in mining authorities, lawyers who \npractice this law professionally full time before the committee, asking \nif the Solicitor was right in doing what he did. Their answer was \nabsolutely not; 127 years of practice would argue that the Solicitor \nreached out in thin air and grabbed an opinion that he knew would bring \nthe mining industry to its knees.\n  Why would he know it? Surely, he wouldn't do it arbitrarily or \ncapriciously. Surely, he wouldn't do that for political purposes. Want \nto bet? Let me state why he did it. Let me speak to Members in Mr. \nLeshy's own words, words written in his own book, called ``Reforming \nthe Mining Law: Problems and Prospects.'' This Solicitor knew exactly \nwhat he was doing. He did it for political purposes. He did not do it \nfor the kind of benevolent, benign, environmentally sound reasons that \nthe Senator from Illinois suggested.\n  The Solicitor said:\n\n       A hoary maxim of life on Capitol Hill is that Congress acts \n     only when there is either a crisis or a consensus.\n\n  The Solicitor at the Department of Interior attempted to establish a \ncrisis in the mining industry with the mining law.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Currently there is no genuine crisis involving hardrock \n     mining--\n\n  although the Senator from Illinois worked for about an hour to gin \none up--\n\n       but with a little effort crises sufficient to bring about \n     reform might be imagined.\n\n  That is what the Solicitor said when he was a private citizen \nenvironmental advocate against mining.\n  So then he went on to say:\n\n       At the extreme, it might even be appropriate for the \n     Interior Department and the courts to consciously reach \n     results that make the statute unworkable.\n\n  The Solicitor himself in a former life, in 1988, said: You know what \nwe could do? We could create a crisis and make the statute unworkable, \nand we would force the Congress to change the law. And then all of a \nsudden John Leshy was no longer private citizen, environmental \nadvocate; he was public citizen appointed Solicitor of the Department \nof Interior. And what did he do? He followed his own words and his own \nedicts. He attempted to create a crisis. And a crisis it was, and we \nhave spoken to it already, the crisis that tumbled mining stock \ndramatically in the stock markets of this country.\n  A message went out to the mining industry: You are not only unwelcome \non public lands, we are going to try to run you off from them. That is \na hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars industry, with tens of thousands of \nemployees across this country, yet the Solicitor, a nonelected public \nofficial with no public process, did this. The Solicitor's opinion was \nnot subject to public comment or review. The Department of Interior \nfailed to provide a forum for interested parties to express their \nviews. The Solicitor's opinion is a change in the law that the \nadministration made without any kind of review. It just simply said: \nThat's the new law. And I say ``new law'' because for 127 years the \nDepartment of Interior, the BLM, and the Forest Service operated under \nthe law that Senator Reid of Nevada and I are attempting to reinstate \nthis evening. That is what the Solicitor did.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, may I ask my colleague how long he will be \ngoing, just so I can plan accordingly?\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Probably for about another 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Solicitor went on to say:\n\n       Some particularly dramatic episode that highlights the \n     particular anachronisms of the Mining law might also \n     encourage Congress to perform surgery on the Law.\n\n  That is what the Solicitor said, and that is what the Solicitor did.\n  What John Leshy failed to say is that over the years he and I have \nmet around the country, debating, and he has wanted to change the \nmining law in such a dramatic way that the mining industry of this \ncountry simply could not operate.\n  The Senator from Illinois suggested we ought to change the law. You \nknow, he is right. As chairman of the Public Lands Subcommittee and as \nchairman of the mining committee for the last 5 years, I say to the \nSenator from Illinois, we have tried to change the law. We even brought \nit to the floor once, passed it in a supplemental, and guess what \nhappened. President Clinton vetoed a major change in the 1872 mining \nlaw. What did that law have in it? Major reclamation reform. It had \nwithin it a hard rock mining royalty that would have funded that \nreclamation reform so if mine industries went bankrupt, there was a \npublic trust provided by the mining companies to do that kind of \nreclamation reform. But this President and his Solicitor will not allow \nthat kind of reform to happen.\n  I have worked in good faith, and, I must say, the Senator from Nevada \nhas, for the last 5 to 6 years to make significant change in the 1872 \nlaw. We recognize the need for its modernization. That is not denied \nhere. But what you do not do is the very backdoor, unparticipatory, \nnonpublic effort of the kind the Solicitor did.\n  The Senator from Illinois talked about the degradation that happened \nin his State. What the Senator did not say is, it does not happen \nanymore. The reason it does not happen anymore, and the reason he \nshould not use it as an example, is that there is a law that disallows \nit today. There is full mine reclamation on surface mining, especially \nin the coal industry.\n\n[[Page S9363]]\n\n  So let me suggest to the Senator from Illinois, let's talk today and \nnot 50 years ago, when he and I would both agree those kinds of \npractices now are unacceptable. They may have been acceptable then, but \nthey are not acceptable now. In fact, the Senator from Illinois held up \na picture. He did not quite know where it was. I will tell him where it \nwas. It was in the State of Montana. I have been to that site. I have \ntraveled and seen these problems. Three times we tried to get that \nissue in Montana cleaned up. Environmental groups stepped in and sued.\n  You kind of wonder if they do not want the issue instead of a \nresolution to the problem. We have worked progressively with them to \ntry to reform the 1872 mining law, and in all instances they have said \nno. Here is why they said no. They said: We don't want you to have the \nright to go find the mineral if you find it in a place in which we \ndon't want you to mine.\n  That is an interesting thesis because gold is, in fact, where you \nfind it. It is not where you might like to have it for environmental \nreasons. What do we do with a thesis like that? We say OK, gold is \nwhere you find it, silver is where you find it, but because of our \nenvironmental ethics and standards today, you have to do it in an \nenvironmentally sound way.\n\n  That is what you have to do. You have to comply with the Clean Air \nAct. They did in the State of Washington. You have to comply with the \nClean Water Act. They did in the State of Washington. You have to meet \nall the State standards--tough standards in the State of Washington. \nYou have to meet all the Federal standards--tough standards in the \nState of Washington.\n  That is what the Crown Jewel Mine did. And yet, at the last moment, \nin the 12th hour, by pressure from environmental groups, Mr. Leshy came \nout of his closet and said: No, you can't. And the senior Senator from \nthe State of Washington said: Wrong, Mr. Leshy. That is not the way a \ndemocracy works. That is not the way a representative republic works. \nIf they played by the rules and they played by the law, then they must \nhave the right to continue. That is the issue we are talking about. We \nare talking about dealing fairly and appropriately with the law.\n  Let me go ahead and talk about Mr. Leshy some more because he is \nbeing talked about tonight as the savior of the environment. Let me \ntell you what he is really out to do. It is not to save the environment \nbut to destroy the mining industry. He has worked for decades with this \ngoal in mind. What did he say in this book he wrote in 1988? What he \nsaid was:\n\n       Bold administrative actions, like major new withdrawals, \n     creative rulemaking or aggressive environmental enforcement, \n     could force the hand of Congress.\n\n  Mr. Leshy is right. He forced the hand of Congress. The Senator from \nWashington and I discussed this briefly in the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  I do not stand tonight to impugn the integrity or the beliefs of the \nSenator from Illinois or the Senator from Washington or the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. But it is important that when you say unlimited \nwithdrawal of surface, I say it is wrong, because it is not right; that \nis not what the law allows. The Department of Interior does not allow \nthat unless it is within the plan, unless it is bonded, unless it meets \nall the environmental standards, and it is proven to be required by the \nmining operation as appropriate and necessary.\n  Those are the laws as we deal with them today.\n  I suggest the Senator from Montana was absolutely right. I am talking \nabout reforming the 1872 mining law. It is a location and a withdrawal \nlaw. It is not an environmental law. Modern mining companies must \nadhere to the law, and that is the Clean Air Act, and that is the Clean \nWater Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, and all of those that \nare tremendously important. That is what we debate here this evening, \nand that is why it is critically important that we deal with it in an \nupfront and necessary manner.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield in a moment.\n  I would like to reform the 1872 mining law, and I would like the \nSenator from Illinois to help me. The Senator from Nevada has stood \nready with me for now well over 5 years for that purpose, only to be \ndenied it by this administration. They kept walking away from the \ntable. They would very seldom come and sit down with us. I must tell \nyou, I do not know why. I ultimately had to draw the conclusion that \nthey preferred the issue over the solution because it was our effort in \nthe State of Nevada, a very important mining State for our country, and \nmy State of Idaho, a very important mining State, that we resolve this \nissue. That, of course, is why I think it is necessary.\n  A mining claim is a parcel of land containing precious metal in the \nsoil or the rock. That is what a claim is.\n  A mill site is a plot of ground necessary to support the operations \nof a mine. That is what a mill site is.\n  Mill sites are critical to mining because, amongst many uses, they \nhold the rock extract, that which is brought up out of the ground from \nthe diggings of the mine, containing milling facilities that extract \nvaluable minerals from the ore and provide a location to house \nadministration and equipment and repair and storage facilities.\n  Let me suggest a comparative to the Senator from Illinois. If I \nbought a half acre of ground in downtown Chicago for the purpose of \nbuilding a 50-story building, and they said I could go down 50 feet and \nestablish parking, but I could not go up any, and I was not given any \nair rights, then I could not build the building. I could acquire the \nproperty and I could dig down, but I could not go up.\n  That is exactly what the Senator is suggesting tonight, that you can \ngain a mining claim under the law but you cannot build a mill site \nbecause 5 acres, I think as most of us know, is a fairly limited amount \nof ground, and that is exactly what the Federal Government has \nrecognized for 127 years.\n  As a result of that, what the Government has said is, if you meet \nthese standards and you incorporate it in a mining plan, you can have \nadditional acres we will permit you for that purpose. Is that \nunlimited? I say to the Senator from Illinois, it is not. To suggest to \nanybody in the BLM, including this administration's BLM, that they give \ncarte blanche acreages of land to mining companies is, in fact, not \ntrue. That is the reality of working with the BLM. Whether it is a \nRepublican BLM or a Democrat BLM, both administrations, all \nadministrations, have adhered to the law. It is important that the law \nnot be misrepresented.\n  I suggest to the Senator from Illinois that mining is not necessarily \na clean business. Digging in the ground is not necessarily a clean \nbusiness. It is not environmentally pristine. That is the character of \nit. There are few businesses where you disturb or disrupt the ground \nthat are. It is how you handle them after the fact with which I think \nthe Senator from Illinois, the Senator from Washington, the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts, and I would agree. I hope they do not want to run \nthe mining industry out of our country. We already have substantial \nexodus from our country because of costs of mining based on certain \nstandards. They all attempt to comply.\n  The greatest problem today is access to the land. The Senator from \nIllinois does not have any public land in his State, or very limited \namounts. My State is 63 percent federally owned land--your land and my \nland. I am not suggesting that it is Idaho's lands, nor would the \nSenator from Nevada suggest that only Nevadans ought to determine the \nsurface domain of the State of Nevada. We understand it is Federal \nland.\n  Nevadans and Idahoans and Americans all must gain from the value of \nthose resources, but we also understand that they must be gained in an \nenvironmentally sound way. We have worked mightily so to build and \ntransform a mining law for that purpose. I must tell you that the \nSolicitor, both as a private citizen environmental advocate and now as \na public citizen Solicitor, has fought us all the way, because he \nwanted a law that fundamentally denied a mining company the right of \ndiscovery, location, and development unless it was phenomenally \nlimited. Those are the issues that clearly we deal with when we are on \nthe floor.\n  Let me say in closing, Mr. President--and it is very important for \nthe Senators to hear this--we are not\n\n[[Page S9364]]\n\nchanging the law. We are simply saying: Mr. Leshy, you do not have it \nyour way until policymakers--the Senator from Illinois and the Senator \nfrom Idaho--agree on what the law ought to be. That is our job; that is \nnot John Leshy's job. Ours will be done in a public process with public \nhearings and public input and not in the private office of a Solicitor \ndown at the Department of Interior who, in the dark of night, slips out \nand passes a rule and the stock market crashes on mining stock.\n\n  I do not think the Senator from Illinois would like that any more \nthan we would if we did it to major industries in his State, because he \nand I are policymakers and we should come to a meeting of the minds \nwhen it comes to crafting reform of the 1872 mining law. That is what I \nwant to do. I hope that is what he wants to do.\n  Are we legislating on an appropriations bill? No. We are saying: Mr. \nSolicitor, you do not have the right to change the law. We will leave \nthe law as it is, as the current 1999 or 1998 handbook at BLM says it \nis, as the current handbook down at the Forest Service says it is, and \nthat is the handbook a mining company uses to build a mining plan, to \nbuild a mining operation. He said at the last hour: The handbook is no \ngood even though we wrote it, even though we OK'd it, and even though \nthat is the way we operate.\n  I do not think so. We now know why. Because, for goodness sake, we \nread his book, the book he crafted in 1988 saying: Let's create a \ncrisis, let's bring the mining industry to its knees, and just maybe \nthen we will get the Congress to move.\n  I heard John Leshy in 1988 and again in 1990, as did the Senator from \nNevada. We worked mightily to change the law, and we are still working \nto do it. We have not been able to accomplish that. I hope we can, and \nwe will work hard in the future to do that. But I hope my colleagues \nand fellow Senators will support us tonight in leaving the current law \nintact and not allowing this administration, or any other one, through \ntheir attorneys, to arbitrarily change a law without the public process \nand the public input that the Senator from Illinois and I are obligated \nto make, and yet tonight he defends the opposite. I do not think he \nwants that. I do not think any of us want a private process that will \ndeny the right of public input.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. The reason I ask the Senator to yield is, the two leaders, \nI am sure, are curious as to how long we are going to go with this. \nThere are a number of people who wish to speak. I am wondering if there \nis any chance we can work out some kind of time agreement on this on \nthe minority side and majority side.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me say to the Senator from Nevada, I am ready to \nrelinquish the floor. The Senator from Massachusetts has been waiting a \ngood long while. I will work with the Senator from Washington. It is \ncertainly her amendment. We have second-degreed it. If we can arrive at \na time agreement, I would like to do so to accommodate all who have \ncome to speak on this issue. It is important that they have that \nopportunity.\n  At the same time, we want to finish this before the wee hours of the \nmorning, and we want to conclude it either with a vote on the second \ndegree, or, if that is not going to happen, if we cannot arrive at \nsomething, we will want to look at finalizing this by a tabling motion. \nLet me work with the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Before the Senator yields the floor, will he yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have been listening to the debate, and it has \nprimarily been proponents of the amendment. I am willing to have some \ntime. We should have a time certain to vote. I hope there is going to \nbe some accommodation for those who have been waiting for these opening \nspeeches to end. I will be more than willing to set a time, such as 8 \no'clock, to vote, provided we get some time to respond to the \nstatements that have already been made.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I say to the Senator from Alaska, I am going to relinquish \nthe floor and sit down with the Senator from Washington to see if we \ncan work out a time agreement to accommodate the Senator's concern. I \nhope we can shoot for the 8 o'clock hour or somewhere near that, \nrecognizing everyone's right.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Idaho and to the Senator from \nAlaska, there has been a debate on both sides. It has not been \ndominated by the proponents of the underlying amendment. There has been \na good discussion here.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Maybe I was just listening at the wrong time.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield so I can propound a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the privilege \nof the floor be granted to Terry L. Grindstaff, a legislative fellow in \nmy office, during the debate of the Interior appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I have listened with interest to the debate for some \ntime now, and I listened with great interest to the Senator from Idaho. \nAfter listening to the Senator from Idaho, I really believe the \nfundamental confrontation here was not addressed by the Senator in his \ncomments. He made a lot of references to the Solicitor of the \nDepartment of the Interior and to the decision that he alleges was made \nin the dead of night and that we should not rush forward with a sudden \ndecision by a bureaucrat to change the how we regulate mining on public \nlands and the relationship between mining companies and the Bureau of \nLand Management and the Congress.\n  Let's try to deal with facts. Let's try to deal with the reality of \nthe situation rather than obfuscating and avoiding the confrontation \nthat has been going on in the Congress for a long period of time.\n  This is not something that is happening just at the whim of a \nbureaucrat. This is not something that is happening this year, now, \nsuddenly for the first time. There has been a 10-year effort to try to \nchange how we regulate mining in this country, and every time we get \nclose to accomplishing that, some argument or another is used to try to \navoid making the right choice--the choice that is part of the original \nlaw itself on which all of this is based.\n  That law is the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 by \nwhich the BLM published its current regulations in 1980. Those \nregulations are required under the law. It is the law of the land that \nthe Secretary of the Interior must take any action necessary, by \nregulation or otherwise, to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of \npublic lands. That is the law.\n  The Secretary is required to take action to prevent undue or \nunnecessary degradation of the public lands. We have been debating in \nthe Congress, as long as I have been here, the level of degradation \nthat is taking place, and its impacts, as a result of the hard rock \nmining.\n  The BLM published regulations in 1980. They became effective in 1981. \nThat was the first attempt of the BLM to try to provide some kind of \neffective management ever since the mining law of 1872. A review was \nsupposed to take place 3 years later. That review never took place. But \nin 1989 a task force was created, and a rulemaking was begun in the \nBush administration to consider amendments of the 3809 regulations. The \nfact is, there was a failure to enact that. Why? Specifically, to give \nCongress the opportunity to develop its own reform and pass it.\n  Contrary to what the Senator from Idaho said about secret, last-\nminute meetings, the fact is that in the 103rd Congress Senator Bumpers \nintroduced\n\n[[Page S9365]]\n\nlegislation. Representative Nick Rahall of West Virginia introduced \nlegislation, and the House passed his legislation by 316-108. One of \nthe major concerns of those who opposed the measure was that it \nincluded an 8-percent royalty on net smelter returns, which would have, \naccording to the arguments of some, and I suspect that includes Western \nSenators and Representatives, made some mines uneconomic.\n  So we go back to 1993 when legislation was introduced that would have \ninstituted the very royalties that we were just heard the opponents of \nthe Murray amendment tell us they would accept. But they fought the \nroyalties, and they fought the bill, and the bill died.\n  Two less comprehensive and almost identical bills were introduced in \nApril of 1993. In those, patents were to continue to be an option, but \npatent fees were going to reflect the fair market value of the surface \nestates. A 2-percent net value mine mouth royalty was going to be \nimposed. In the Senate that year, there was an industry-backed bill. \nThat was passed by the Senate in May of 1993, but once again it was \nstopped dead because the House and Senate conferees could not bridge \nthe gap between the industry-backed legislation and the \nenvironmentally-backed legislation. It died.\n  In the 104th Congress the Mineral Exploration and Development Act of \n1995 was introduced by, again, Representative Rahall and others to \noverhaul the mining law. That was almost identical to the bill the \nHouse passed in the 103rd Congress.\n  Three mining reform bills were introduced in the Senate. One was \nintroduced by Senator Craig. It was supported by the mining industry. \nAnother was introduced by Senator Bumpers. The one introduced by \nSenator Craig more closely resembled the Rahall bill. The bill Senator \nBumpers introduced was supported by most of the environmental and \nconservation community. And a third bill was introduced by Senators \nJohnston and Campbell that resembled a later version of what then-\nChairman Johnston incorporated into the conference debate.\n\n  But again no further action was taken. Why? Because once again the \nindustry refused to accept some of the provisions that included to \nprotect the land adequately, including clean up, holding sufficient \nbonding, do the things necessary which the Senator from Nevada has \noffered to do on the floor tonight. But there is a long legislative \nhistory of the opponents of the amendment refusing to do that. That is \nwhy the Bureau of Land Management has finally come to the point of \nsaying we have to do something. And what they are doing is justified.\n  Since 1980, the gold mining industry in the United States has \nundergone a 10-fold expansion. I know it is now on facing many \nchallenges as the world market for gold has pushed prices down, but \nnevertheless, it has grown substantially over the past two decades. \nMany of those gold mines are located on the public lands that we are \nsuppose to be protecting. Much of this increased production comes from \nthe fact that, as a result of new discoveries and technologies, you can \nmine ore of a much lower grade. Mine operations are able to move \nmillions of tons of material and move it around the landscape to \nproduce just ounces of gold. The new techniques use cyanide and other \ntoxic chemicals for processing.\n  In short, even though I agree that we are more environmentally \nconcern today than in years past, the fact is that today's mines have \nan even greater capacity to cause environmentally negative impacts. We \ndid not hear the Senator from Idaho talk about how we are going to \nensure that these mine clean up. Of course, there is an economic impact \nin trying to clean up a mine. But, I respectively as my colleagues that \nthey don't come to the floor of the Senate and start complaining that \nsuddenly a bureaucrat is coming in the dead of night to do what we have \nbeen fighting to do for 10 years in the Senate, and what I think most \npeople understand is a huge struggle between those who want to protect \nthe lands adequately and those who want to continue the practices that \nare endangering them.\n  The fact is--and this is a fact--this provision is simply the latest \naddition in a series of riders that have prevented the Clinton \nAdministration from enforcing the 1872 mining law and reforming the \nsale of our Nation's mineral assets.\n  Coal does not get the privileges of hard rock mining. Oil and gas do \nnot get the privileges of hard rock mining. It is absolutely \nextraordinary that at a time when Senators will come to the floor of \nthe Senate and talk about giving money back, in tax cuts, to the \ncitizens of this country, who deserve the money, that they will vote \nagainst giving them the money they deserve from the land that they own. \nThis land belongs to the American citizens, and it is nearly being \ngiven away, without royalties, to mining companies that leave behind \ndevastation. The are not paying their fair share, not just for cleaning \nit up, but also on the gold, silver and other minerals that they profit \nfrom, and that Americans own. I think it is the wrong way to legislate \nthe priorities of our lands and the protection of them.\n  The Bureau of Land Management tried to update environmental \nprotections in 1997. Respectfully, I ask that my colleagues not come to \nthe floor and tell us that this all of this happened in the dead of \nnight or some secret effort. The Clinton Administration tried to enact \nsome reforms in 1997, and they were blocked by a rider on an \nappropriations bill. It was stopped again by a rider in the 1998 \nInterior appropriations bill that prohibited them from issuing proposed \nrules until the Western Governors were consulted and, then, until after \nNovember of 1998.\n  Here we are in July of 1999. The BLM satisfied the requirements of \nthat rider of 1998.\n  They then resumed the rulemaking process. It wasn't in the dead of \nnight. It wasn't a surprise. The Clinton Administration, again, took up \nthe rulemaking after they had been required to consult with the western \nGovernors. The BLM satisfied that. But then they were stopped again by \na rider in the fiscal year 1999 omnibus appropriations bill calling for \na study by the National Academy of Sciences and delaying the rules at \nleast until July, which is where we are right now. However, not even \nthat was enough. In February of this year, the BLM issued proposed \nrules, and it entered a public comment period, not the dead of night, \nnot some surprise effort by the rulemakers. They were proceeding \naccording to how Congress had told them to proceed. And then another \nrider was inserted into the year 2000 supplemental appropriations bill \nso that we could further delay the rulemaking process.\n  Now we are considering a fourth rider, the fourth rider for the \nmining industry since 1997 in the fiscal year 2000 Interior \nappropriations.\n  While these riders are slightly different legislatively, they have \nall protected a flawed system that continues to allow us to sell an \nacre of land for as little as $2.50; $2.50 for an acre of land to go in \nand mine thousands of dollars of worth minerals and possibly cause \nexcessive environmental damage, certainly alter the landscape in a \ndramatic way.\n  I am as strong an admirer of the Senator from Nevada as anybody in \nthe Senate. He is a friend, a good friend. He is representing his State \nand he has to. He has 13,000 miners there. But one has to wonder about \nthe cost of reclaiming the land and who will pay it. At some point we \nmay find cheaper for the United States of America to pay those miners \nnot to mine than to pay for the kind of environmental damage that has \nbeen presented here today by the Senators from Washington and Illinois. \nRivers have been ruined, the toxics spilled into the environment. What \nis it, $32 billion to $72 billion is the estimated cost of cleaning up \nchemicals that have been released in these operations and other \nenvironmental damage to drinking water and water systems. It is cheaper \nto tell them not to do it than to continue to do this.\n  What are we doing? Well, we have a law, the 1872 Mining Law, that \nrestricts each mine claim of up to 20 acres to a mill site of 5 acres \nto dump waste and process material.\n  In his decision, the Solicitor did not amend, he did not reinterpret \nthe law. Even the mining industry has agreed that the 5-acre mill site \nlimit is the law, I point to an article from 1970 when a law firm \nrepresenting the industry openly concede that point. They may argue a \ndifferent case now, but before this opportunity presented itself,\n\n[[Page S9366]]\n\nthe mining industry agreed. All the Solicitor did was recommend that \nthe BLM start enforcing this provision again. That is all. Enforce the \nprovision.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will for the purpose of a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, we have talked, and we would like to \nvote at 7:35 or 7:40. What we are going to do is divide the time \nbetween now and then between the proponents and the opponents of this \nparticular amendment. There will be, near that time, a motion to table \nthat will be initiated. Could the Senator indicate about how much \nlonger he wishes to speak?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I can't. I want to speak my mind on this \nissue. Although I am one of the original cosponsors, I can't speak for \nthe lead sponsor. I don't know if there are other Senators on our side \nwho would like to speak. You have the right to table.\n  Mr. REID. We know the Senator from Washington wishes to. We want to \ntry to be fair.\n  Mr. KERRY. I don't imagine I will go more than 10 minutes or so. I \ndon't know what the Senator from Washington needs.\n  Mr. REID. We could go until 7:40, which leaves 35 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I believe the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas the floor, but if I may clarify, is the Senator asking to divide \nthe time equally between now and 7:40?\n\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I will not object to that.\n  Mr. REID. Divided equally. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Just a minute. I don't understand the division of time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving my right to reclaim the floor.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator has the floor. I say to my friend from Alaska, \nwe would divide the next 35 minutes between the proponents and \nopponents. There would be equal time. I checked with the other Senator \nfrom Alaska and he thinks that is okay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  The BLM is simply seeking to enforce the existing law once again. No \nreinterpretation, no change. This is not a far reach. This is existing \nlaw, which, as I say, very clearly in 1970 and in other times has been \nacknowledged as the law even by the mining industry itself.\n  It was likely under pressure from the mining industry in the 1960s \nand 1970s that the Federal Government started to overlook the provision \nand permitted mining operations to use more than the single 5-acre mill \nsite. What we are saying is that was a mistake of enormous \nenvironmental and fiscal consequences.\n  The BLM ought to enforce the law. It is one of the few protections \nthat we have.\n  Let me try to share with colleagues what the consequences of the \ncurrent law are, why it needs reform and why it should be enforced. \nAccording to an editorial in the USA Today newspaper, in 1994, a \nCanadian company called American Barrick Resources purchased 2,000 \nacres of public land in Nevada that contained $10 billion in gold. How \nmuch do you think they paid for the 2,000 acres and the $10 billion of \ngold? They paid $10,000.\n  Every time in the last few years that we have tried to have a fair \nmeeting of the minds on the subject of what is an appropriate royalty \nor what is an appropriate bonding, it hasn't worked. It is public land. \nThere ought to be requirements, more than we have now, for a mining \ncompany that wants to mine public land, take out billions of dollars of \ngold, and pay the taxpayers only $10,000. They don't say to you: We are \ngoing to degrade the land, damage rivers and leave the place unusable \nfor other purposes.\n  If they said that, do you think anybody in the Senate would stand up \nand vote for it up front? No. But you are voting for it. That is the \neffect of what happens here, unless we turn around and say, no, we are \ngoing to enforce the law.\n  I understand the economics of this, but one of the problems we have \nacross the board nationally and globally is that we don't value the \nenvironmental impact on the cost of goods. Nobody wants to be \nresponsible for doing that, for incorporating in the cost of a product \nthe cost reducing our national resources. So we keep doing things that \nactually cost us an awful lot more, but it is never reflected in the \ncost of the product. But we pay for it; the American taxpayer pays for \nit.\n  The environmental toll is high. Over 12,000 miles of streams have \nbeen destroyed, according to the Mineral Policy Center, which is group \nexpert in the impacts of mining. I don't understand how we can risk, \nespecially in the West where water availability is a problem, polluting \nour watersheds this way. We have one major, enormous reservoir for \nwater for the United States under most of the mid-central section of \nthe nation. We are increasingly depleting that reservoir of water. And \nwe are currently, mainly through agriculture, using that water at a \nrate exceeding its resupply. We can't afford to destroy 12,000 miles of \nstreams.\n  What is the economic value of those streams? Has anybody calculated \nthat?\n  Has anybody calculated the economic value in the cost of lost \ndrinking water because of chemical that contaminated it? This is a \nmatter of common sense, and we are not exhibiting that kind of common \nsense as we approach it. The fact is that there are almost 300,000 \nacres of land owned by the citizens of the United States of America, \npublic land that has been mined and left unreclaimed. Abandoned mines \naccount for 59 Superfund sites. There are over 2,000 abandoned mines in \nour national parks. The Mineral Policy Center estimates the cleanup \ncost for abandoned mines, as we mentioned earlier, is at the high end, \n$72 billion, and at the low end, $32 billion.\n  Will the Senators from the West come forward with that $32 billion? \nWhere is the offer by those who want to continue these practices and \nrun that bill up even higher to pay the bill? Is there an offer to pay \nthe bill?\n  I think the Senate ought to put an end to this process, to protecting \na flawed policy, by supporting the Murray amendment, by opposing rider \nor provision of Senator Craig and Senator Reid. I will, if for no other \nreason so I can simply represent the taxpayers in good conscience. The \ncosts of continuing this program are far greater than the costs of \nenforcing the law and doing what is required. The Senator from Nevada \nasked, a moment ago, of the Senator from Illinois: What would you like \nus to do? He said: What do you think the mining companies ought to do?\n  Let me respectfully share with you what the Bureau of Land Management \nwants them to do, which the mining companies and these constant riders \nare blocking us from doing. Here it is very simply: Protect water \nquality from impacts caused by the use of cyanide leaching, thereby \nsafeguarding human environmental health in the arid West. Second, \nprotect wetlands in riparian areas, which provide essential wildlife \nhabitat in arid regions, as well as promoting long-term environmental \nhealth, and sharply limit or eliminate any loopholes to the requirement \nto get advance approval of mining and reclamation plans.\n  Moreover, there are significant things that could be done. Require \nfinancial guarantees for all hard rock mining operations; base the \nfinancial guarantee amount on the estimated reclamation costs; require \nthe miner to establish a trust fund to pay for long-term water \ntreatment, if necessary. Is that asking too much? If you come in and \nuse the land and you degrade the water, shouldn't you be required to \nprovide water treatment in order to protect the water?\n  Is it asking too much that you should post a bond in order to \nguarantee that once you strip the mine of all of its economic value and \nhave taken out billions of dollars and walked away with your profits, \nthat you should have some requirement for reclamation, and that there \nis a sufficient bonding from those profits. Even if you don't pay \nroyalties, shouldn't you pay to guarantee the land is going to be \ncleaned up?\n  So they ask what should we be able to do. The things they should do \nare clear as a bell, and they have been blocked. Blocked for the 10 \nyears that I have watched this being fought here. I watched Senator \nBumpers from Arkansas pace up and down there with\n\n[[Page S9367]]\n\nthese arguments year in and year out. And year in and year out, \nunfortunately, the industry works its will against the better common \nsense of true conservationists, against the better common sense of \nthose whom I believe care deeply about the land.\n  It is incredible to me that we of good conscience can't find adequate \nlanguage and compromise to protect this land, to be able to do this \nproperly. We require more of coal miners, and we require more of oil \nand gas than we do of hard rock mining, and it is public land.\n  So I say to my colleagues we have an opportunity to do what we have \nbeen trying to do as a matter of common sense, which is enforce the law \nof the land. That is all we are asking--enforce the current law of the \nland as it was before, as it should have been, and as it must be now, \nin order to adequately protect the interest of the citizens.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, may I have 8 minutes?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I find myself in a strange position \nbecause I was Solicitor of the Interior Department. At the time, I \nfollowed the law and I interpreted the law; I did not make law. The BLM \nmanual, in case you are interested, says specifically:\n\n       A mill site cannot exceed 5 acres in size. There is no \n     limit to the number of mill sites that can be held by a \n     single claimant.\n\n  Now, that is a regulation made pursuant to the law that was in \nexistence at the time the Solicitor rendered his opinion. He ignored \nthat. But the main thing is, I am hearing things on the floor that \namaze me. The Senator from Illinois says that, apparently, the \nenvironmental laws don't apply to mining claims. Why is it, then, that \nthere is a requirement for mill sites? The mill sites are there \nprimarily for the purpose of the tailings disposal of the ponds that \nmust be built to provide protection under the Clean Water Act. Many of \nthem are enormous in size and require several mill sites in order to \nhave one disposal site. Those environmental laws are there to \nprotect the public lands. But the Solicitor's opinion says you can only \nhave up to 5 acres, which is the Catch-22. This opinion was not \nintended to validate the mining law. It was made to invalidate the \nmining law of 1872.\n\n  In my State--and, after all, my State has primarily half of the \nFederal lands in the United States--the mining law is working. Our \nState has a small mining law that is compatible in terms of requiring \nclaims to be pursued by production of minerals to take actions to \nprotect the lands. In Alaska, it is our fourth largest industry. The \nGreens Creek Mine has twice as many mill sites as does active claims \nunder a plan filed with and approved by the Federal Government. As a \nmatter of fact, it is mandated by the Federal Government that such \nlands be used for specific environmental purposes to protect the lands \nthat are being mined and protect the waters, in particular. The Clean \nWater Act applies.\n  I am appalled--and I wish my friend from Massachusetts had stayed \nhere--at his comments. I would like to take you to Alaska. Come up to \nAlaska and I will show you mining claims, and I will show you the \nextent to which we require them to comply with the environmental laws. \nAs a matter of fact, we have enormous mining claims. The Kensington, \nDonlin Creek--they would never get off the ground if this amendment \nwere passed.\n  Currently, there are 235 jobs on one mine alone. This is going to put \nthousands of people out of work in my State. The fourth largest \nindustry will go out of existence if this passes, because you cannot \nmine in Alaska with just 5 acres to comply with the mining laws and the \nenvironmental laws.\n  The other thing is, I want to make sure you understand mill sites \ncannot be on mineral land. Under the law, they cannot be on mineral \nland. They are lands that are located somewhere in connection with the \nmining activities, and they have mining operations on them. So most of \nthis entirely misses me. I don't understand what is going on. As a \nmatter of fact, we have had fights over mining claims for years. My \ngood friend from Arkansas is not with us anymore, but we had fights \nover mining claims. This is the first time people have attacked mill \nsites. The amendment of the Senator from Washington attacks mill sites \nunder the Solicitor's opinion--a misguided opinion at that--with regard \nto the number of mill sites. The Forest Service manual states:\n\n       The number of mill sites that may legally be located is \n     based specifically on the need for mining and milling \n     purposes irrespective of the types or number of mining claims \n     involved.\n\n  That has been a regulation issued by the Forest Service pursuant to \nthe mining law, and it has been valid for years. Suddenly, the \nSolicitor's opinion says all that is nonsense; you can only have one \nmill site per mining claim. I am at a loss to understand why all of \nthis rhetoric is coming at us with regard to the sins of the past.\n  Why don't we talk about the tremendous destruction in the East? Why \nis this all about the West? As a matter of fact, as the companies from \nthe East moved into the West, they laid the West to waste, and that is \nwhat led to the environmental laws that we have and live by. We abide \nby them, particularly the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the \nbasic Environmental Protection Act.\n  Every one of these mining claims must have a mining plan approved by \nthe agency that is managing the Federal lands for the Federal \nGovernment. Those agencies approved those plans. To suddenly come in \nand to say there is something wrong about this, I don't understand the \nSenators from the East, nor do I understand the Senator from the West, \nraising this kind of an objection to the lands that are necessary for \nenvironmental purposes. If this mining claims decision is upheld, that \ndecision made by the Solicitor, every mine in my State must close. \nEvery mine must close. That is nonsense.\n  Senator Murray's amendment merely states that the Solicitor is not \ngoing to make law. If you want to bring the law in and change the law \nof 1872, bring in the bill. We will debate it, as we did Senator \nBumpers' bills. But don't come in and try to validate a Solicitor's \nopinion which is erroneous, and it is not good law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 27 seconds on the Senator's \nside, and 10 minutes 5 seconds on the majority side.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher leadership on this important issue.\n  I have listened carefully to this debate. I will gladly acknowledge \nthat many of the Senators, including the Senator from Alaska, have more \npersonal knowledge of the mining industry than I do. But I believe that \nthe environmental issues here are clear-cut issues, whether you live in \nthe East, West, North, or South.\n  What we are talking about here is public land--land owned by every \ntaxpayer. The people in a certain State with public land have no more \nclaim to it than those in every other State. That is why this is a \nnational issue.\n  Allow me, if I may, to put this in a political context. It is my \nunderstanding that this was based on a decision in 1991--I underline \n1991--in a manual that was issued by the Department of the Interior, \nwhich has now become the handbook, or so-called ``manual,'' which has \nnow become the basis of this debate. This so-called manual, or \nhandbook, was neither a regulation nor a law. It was an interpretation \nwhich varied from interpretations which had been in existence since \n1872.\n  For the first time since 1872, in 1991 in the closing days of the \nBush administration, someone working in the Department of the Interior \nraised a question as to whether we would limit these mill sites to 5 \nacres. That limitation had not been questioned seriously at any point \nin the promulgation of the Surface Mining Act or in any other law until \nthat date.\n  The mining industry seized that interpretation in 1991, in the \nclosing hours of the Bush administration, and said: Now the lid is off. \nWe can use as many acres as we want to dump next to our mining sites.\n  When Mr. Leshy came back in 1997 and said there is no basis in law \nfor\n\n[[Page S9368]]\n\nthat handbook decision, that is when the industry went wild, came to \nCapitol Hill, and said what we cannot overturn it in the courts and we \nwant you to overturn it with riders on appropriations bills.\n  Those who talk about the sacred law in this handbook, let me tell \nyou, one person in 1991, and one variation on the 5-acre limitation, \nand that is the basis for all of the argument that is being made by the \nother side.\n  Let me raise a second point. The Senator from Alaska, as well as the \nSenator from Idaho, said that the Clean Water Act applies to those who \nare involved in hard rock mining.\n  For the Record, I would like to make this clear. The Clean Water \nAct--I quote from ``Golden Dreams, Poisoned Streams'' by the Mineral \nPolicy Center, certainly an organization which has an environmental \ninterest in this, and I am proud to quote it as a source. If there are \nthose who can find them wrong, make it a part of the Record. But I \nwould gladly quote them as they say:\n\n       The Clean Water Act, for instance, only partially addresses \n     oversight surface water discharge. While the act sets limits \n     on pollutants which can be discharged from surface waters \n     from fixed point sources, like pipes and other outlets, it \n     fails to directly regulate discharge to ground water, though \n     ground water contamination is a problem at many mine sites. \n     The Clean Water Act does not set any operational or \n     reclamation standard for a mine to assure that sites will not \n     continue to pollute water sources when they are abandoned.\n\n  So for those who are arguing on the side of the mining industry to \ncome to this floor and argue that the Clean Water Act will guarantee no \nenvironmental problems, let me tell you, it does not do it.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds on our time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Great Malinda Mine in southeast Alaska never opened \nbecause of the Clean Water Act. The Senator and his source could not be \nfurther wrong.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Alaska that I have no idea \nabout that particular mine. But it could be that they couldn't meet the \nClean Water Act test, the fixed-point source test, because if it came \nto ground water contamination, there is no regulation under the Clean \nWater Act on mining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington State. \nI thank the Chair.\n  There are a couple of points I would like to make. I know we are \nwinding up this debate.\n  No. 1, I think it is important for the public to understand that this \nindustry faces a very dire financial situation.\n  In Nevada, we have witnessed in the last decade the third renaissance \nof mining activity. It has employed thousands and thousands of people \nin my State with an average salary about $49,000 a year with a full \nrange of benefits. These are good jobs.\n  Because of the declining price of gold on the world market, we have \nlost more than 2,000 jobs in the last 6 months alone, and more are \nscheduled to be laid off. In part, this is because of some proposals by \nthe British Government and the IMF gold sales. It is a separate issue \nfor us. But we are facing a very difficult time.\n  The second point I would like to make is that this has been framed as \nan environmental issue. It is not. The full panoply of all of the \nenvironmental laws enacted since the late 1960s applies to this \nindustry. So they are not exempt from any of these provisions.\n  Finally, the point needs to be made that with respect to the \nreclamation, or lack thereof, we are frequently invited to the specter \nof what happened decades ago. I don't defend that. This is a new era, \nand every mine application for a permit requires a reclamation process \nand the posting of the bond to make sure these kinds of problems do not \ndevelop.\n  Why are we so upset about the Solicitor's opinion? For more than a \ncentury unchallenged, the interpretation given by the Solicitor's \noffice was never viewed as the law. In this current administration, \nwhen the Clinton administration came into office, at no time during the \nearly years was this kind of interpretation attached.\n  All of those in this industry relying upon the law as it is--I agree \nwith my colleagues who point out that the law of 1872 needs to be \nchanged. I support those provisions. I think there should be a fair \nmarket value for the surface that is taken. There should be a royalty \nprovision. There should be a reverter if the land is no longer used for \nmining purposes. I agree that there should be a reclamation process \nthat is required. The devil has been in the details. Unfortunately, we \nhave not been able to reach an agreement on that.\n  But those who have sought and applied for the permits have done so \nbased upon the law as it is today, and the regulations and the manual \npassed along to us by the Bureau of Land Management say nothing about \none mill site for every mining claim--not a word, not a jot, not a \ntitle.\n  This is a new development. It is unfair. I urge my colleagues to \nreject the proposal.\n  Mr. GORTON. How much time is available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 4 minutes 13 seconds and \nthe proponents have 6 minutes 56 seconds.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this is deja vu all over again, with \nthe exception of the former Senator from Arkansas, Mr. Bumpers, who \nobviously led this charge before.\n  I have heard things on the floor of the Senate tonight that are so \ninaccurate that I am surprised. Some have suggested that cyanide is \npoured on the grounds of our mines in this country, that there are \n12,000 streams that have been polluted and damaged from our mining \nindustry--and ruined, I think was the terminology used. These are \ntotally inaccurate, false statements.\n  They are rock. There is no cyanide from the mining industry leaching \nout in the area where mining has occurred. They are all closed systems.\n  These are emotional appeals based not on fact but on fiction. They \nare directed by misleading environmentalists who have decided the \nmining industry and America's can-do spirit and technology can't take \nresources from the ground and do it properly.\n  We are not talking about a mining bill. We are talking about the \nproposal of the Senator from Washington which would limit what the \nSolicitor has proposed--one site, one mill site in a mining claim.\n  The reality is we will shut down the industry. That is all there is \nto it. Companies cannot operate the industry on that kind of a land \navailability.\n  They generalize in their criticism. They talk about Superfund, the \nground water contamination. There are 55,650 sites. These are sites \nwhere mining has occurred. Let's look at their record. Reclaimed or \nbenign, 34 percent, 194,000; landscaped disturbances, the landscape \nretakes its ability for regeneration, 41 percent; safety hazard, \n116,000, 20 percent; surface water contamination, 2.6 percent; ground \nwater contamination, eighty-nine one-hundredths; Superfund, eighty-nine \none-hundredths.\n  My point is this is not a crass dereliction of responsibility. This \nis the mining industry's history as evaluated by the U.S. Abandoned \nMines. Certainly we have exceptions on past practices.\n  To suggest cyanide is leaching out, to suggest we have an \nirresponsible industry, to suggest the States are not doing their \njobs--and the States obviously oversee reclamation; they oversee the \nmining permits--and to try to kill the industry with a proposal that is \nabsolutely inaccurate, impractical, and unrealistic is beyond me. I \ndon't think it deserves the time of the Senate today.\n  Nevertheless, that is where we are. This creates an impossible \nsituation. If we want to run the mining industry offshore, this is the \nway to do it. Canada did it by a gross royalty. Mexico did it by taxing \nthem.\n  What is the matter with this body? There are 58,000 U.S. jobs, good \npaying jobs. We need to be a resource-developed country. Otherwise, we \nwill bring them in from South Africa.\n  What happened in South Africa? It speaks for itself. I hope my \ncolleagues recognize what this does. This kills the\n\n[[Page S9369]]\n\nmining industry and exports the jobs offshore.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes twelve seconds and three minutes \non the other side.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are coming to the end of this debate.\n  Obviously, there will be a tabling motion on my amendment. We have \nheard a lot on both sides. The one thing we all share is the \nunderstanding that the mining industry is an important industry in this \ncountry. We understand it provides jobs in many of our communities. We \nwant to make sure that is retained in a fair way. The mining industry \ndid not like the position of the mining law. Instead of allowing reform \nof a law that was written almost 130 years ago in a give-and-take \nfashion, they have come sweeping into the Interior bill, and in that \nbill the proponents have changed that portion of the law that the \nmining industry does not like.\n  Maybe that portion of the law needs to be changed because of current \ntechnology that is out there. However, they should give something back. \nThey already have an incredible deal. They pay $2.50 to $5 an acre for \nthe land they use. They pay no royalties and now in this Interior bill \nthey are allowed incredible mass use of our public lands.\n  We have heard a lot about the law and the BLM manual. Let me show \nMembers what the statute says. This is the 1872 law. It is very clear. \nIt says:\n\n       Such nonadjacent surface ground may be embraced and \n     included in at application for patent for such vein or lode, \n     and the same may be patented therewith . . . on no location \n     made on or after May 10, 1872, of such nonadjacent land shall \n     exceed five acres.\n\n  And for placer claims:\n\n       Such land may be included in an application for a patent \n     for such claim and may be patented therewith subject to the \n     same requirements as to survey and notice as are applicable \n     to the placers. No location made of such nonmineral land \n     shall exceed five acres.\n\n  The law is clear. The BLM manual from 1976 to 1991 was also very \nclear and talked about 5 acres. This was changed in 1991 at the end of \nthe Bush era. It was changed to read:\n\n       A mill site cannot exceed five acres in size. There is no \n     limit to the number of mill sites that can be held by a \n     single claimant.\n\n  We are not here to debate the BLM manual. We are here to say: Should \nthe law that was written in 1872 be changed to favor one side of this \ndebate in this Interior bill before the Senate right now? We are saying \nif we are going to change a part of the law, this law, then we should \nask the industry what they will give us in return. Will it be royalty \nthat other industries have to pay? Is it more per acre? Should \nenvironmental law apply? Should they clean it up?\n  We should debate it. It should be part of the 1872 Mining Act reform. \nI think this Congress ought to get into this debate. To do it blatantly \nfor one side in this bill, this night, is not the way to do it. That is \nwhy we are debating this issue. I hope many of our colleagues will \nunderstand this is a giveaway to an industry that does not pay \nroyalties, that only pays between $2.50 and $5 an acre, less than any \nMember would pay to go camping on our public lands.\n  I think it needs to be done in a fair way. I urge my colleagues to \nstep back. What are we doing for the taxpayers of this country? Let's \nbe fair to them. Let's be fair to our public lands. Let's be fair to \nthe law and do it right and not do it in a rider on the Interior \nappropriations bill. I urge my colleagues to vote against the motion to \ntable.\n  I thank all of our colleagues who came to the floor to help with this \ndebate.\n  Mr. GORTON. Rarely has a debate on an amendment had less to do with \nthe content of the amendment itself. This debate is not about past \nmining practices or the leftovers from those practices or who will pay \nfor them. The passage of the amendment will not affect that whatever, \nnor will the passage of the motion to table.\n  Royalties for mining on public lands is not a part of this debate. \nPassing the Murray amendment will not change those royalties. Passing a \nmotion to table won't change those royalties. The past simply is not \ninvolved in this matter. The way in which mining claims are patented is \nnot involved in this matter, nor does this debate involve the \nenvironmental laws of the United States. Every plan of operation of a \nmine must meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act, must meet the \nrequirements of the National Environmental Policy Act, must meet the \nrequirements of the Endangered Species Act. You don't get the permit \nunless you have met all of those requirements. The mine in the State of \nWashington that was the subject of the earlier amendment in this body \nmet all those requirements, got all those permits, and won tests \nagainst them in courts of the United States. And every other mining \nclaim that will come up, if this motion to table is agreed to, will \nhave to meet the same environmental laws.\n  What this debate is about is whether or not the laws of the United \nStates are to be amended by the Congress of the United States or by an \nemployee of the Department of the Interior. This 1872 law has been \namended by the Department of the Interior's ruling. No Member of \nCongress, whatever his or her views of the Mining Act of 1872, should \nfavor the proposition that a bureaucrat can amend the laws of the \nUnited States. Of course, we ought to debate the 1872 Mining Act. Of \ncourse, we ought to vote on it. We have in fact debated and voted on it \nhere in the Congress. But the fact that the changes have not taken \nplace to the satisfaction of some does not delegate the authority to \nchange the laws of the United States to the Department of the Interior.\n  The subject here is simply that. If this motion to table is agreed \nto, as the person who will probably chair the conference committee on \nthis subject, I assure you that no final provision will be any stronger \nthan the Craig-Reid amendment because of what the House has done and \nmay well be less sweeping even than that. So at the most, Members, by \nvoting for this motion to table, are voting for the Craig-Reid \namendment and probably for something somewhat less stringent.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid, I move to table the Murray amendment, No. 1360.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

JOHNSON, JR.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments at \nthis time upon the death of Judge Frank M. Johnson, Jr., a native \nAlabamian born in Haleyville, AL, who was appointed to the Federal \nbench in 1953 by President Eisenhower and who was buried today in his \nnative Winston County, aged 80.\n  That Frank M. Johnson, Jr., was a great judge, there can be no doubt. \nIt is appropriate and fitting that this body, which reviews and \nconfirms all members of the judiciary, pause and consider his \noutstanding life. His death has attracted national attention. While I \nknew him and considered him a friend, I am certainly unable to \neffectively articulate in any adequate way what his long tenure has \nmeant to America and to Alabama, but the impact of his life on law in \nAmerica is so important, I am compelled to try. I just hope I shall be \nforgiven for my inadequacies.\n  Many will say that his greatness was to be found in his commitment to \ncivil rights and his profound belief in the ideal of American freedom, \nwhich was deep and abiding. These were, indeed, powerful strengths. \nOthers will say that his greatness is the result of his wise handling \nof a series of pivotal cases that changed the very nature of everyday \nlife throughout America, cases which were at the forefront of the legal \nsystem's action to eliminate inequality before the law. Indeed, it is \nstunning to recall just how many important cases Judge Johnson was \ncalled upon to decide and how many of these are widely recognized today \nas pivotal cases in the history of American law.\n  How did it happen? How did so much of importance fall to him, and how \ndid he, in such a crucial time, handle them with such firm confidence?\n  I tend to believe those cases and his achievements at the root arose \nout of his extraordinary commitment to law, to the sanctity of the \ncourtroom, and to his passionate, ferocious commitment to truth. That \nwas the key to his greatness. Judge Johnson always sought the truth. He \ndemanded it even if it were not popular. He wanted it unvarnished.\n  Once the true facts in a case were ascertained, he applied those \nfacts to the law. That was his definition of justice. Make no mistake, \nhe was very hard working; very demanding of his outstanding clerks; \nand, very smart. He finished first in his class at the University of \nAlabama Law School in 1943. This combination of idealism, courage, \nindustry, and intelligence when applied to his search for truth along \nwith his brilliant legal mind was the source, I think, of his \ngreatness. This explains how when he found himself in the middle of a \nrevolution, he was ready, capable and possessed of the gifts and grades \nnecessary for the challenge.\n  The historic cases he handled are almost too numerous to mention. \nThere was the bus boycott case in which Rosa Parks, the mother of the \ncivil rights movement, was arrested for failing to move to the back of \nthe bus. There, he struck down Alabama's segregation law on public \ntransportation. That was the beginning. Later, there was his order in \nallowing the Selma to Montgomery march in 1964, the order to integrate \nhis alma mater, the University of Alabama, despite the famous and \nintense opposition by Governor George C. Wallace, the desegregation of \nthe Alabama State Troopers, historic prison litigation cases and his \nmental health rulings which were quoted and followed throughout the \nnation. Each of these and many other cases were truly historic in \neffect and very significant legally. Did he go too far on occasion? Was \nhe too much of an activist? On a few occasions, perhaps. Some would \nsay, on occasion, the remedies that he imposed maybe went further than \nthey should have, even though most have agreed that his findings of \nconstitutional violations were sound. But, most of the time and in most \nof the cases he simply followed the law as we had always known it to \nbe, but unfortunately, not as it was being applied.\n\n  When the State tried to stop the Selma to Montgomery march, Judge \nJohnson concluded, in words quoted, in a fine obituary by J. Y. Smith \nin the Washington Post Sunday, that the events at the Pettus Bridge in \nSelma.\n\n       Involved nothing more than a peaceful effort on the part of \n     Negro citizens to exercise Constitutional right: that is, the \n     right to assemble peaceably and to petition one's government \n     for the redress of grievances * * *\n       It seems basic to our Constitutional principles that the \n     extent of the right to assemble, demonstrate, and march \n     peaceably along the highways and streets in an orderly manner \n     should be commensurate with the enormity of the wrongs that \n     are being protested and petitioned against. In this case, the \n     wrongs are enormous. The extent of the right to demonstrate \n     against these wrongs should be determined accordingly.\n\n  These simple, direct and powerful words are typical of the man and \nhis way of thinking. The years in which he presided were tumultuous, \nthe times very tense. I remember the times. Few who were alive in those \ndays do not. Rosa Parks and Frank Johnson-were there. They were present \nand participating in the commencement of a revolution and the creation \nof a new social order in America--a better society in which we \nundertook as a nation to extend equality to all people. True equality \nhas not been fully achieved, but is indisputable that when the hammer \nof Rosa Parks hit the anvil of Frank Johnson, the sound of freedom rang \nout loud and clear and to this day that sound has not been silenced. \nHis actions, the cases he decided have caused the anvil of freedom to \nring again and again, and that sound changed, not just the South and \nAmerica but the entire world.\n\n  Though I never tried a jury case before Judge Johnson, I did have \nappellate cases before him when he was a member of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Eleventh Circuit, to which he was appointed by \nPresident Carter in the late 1970's. I was honored to meet him \noccasionally when I was a United States Attorney and when I was a \nprivate attorney. I considered him a friend. He had himself been a \nUnited States Attorney and he had great respect for the office. In \nseveral ways, and at various times he made comments that affirmed me \nand my service. It made me feel good. Of this I am certain. If the law, \nin a case before Judge Johnson, and facts were on my client's side my \nclient would win, if not, my client would lose. This was his reputation \nthroughout the Bar and it was one of his highest accomplishments. He \nwas respected by all members of the bar.\n  The stories told by lawyers practicing before Judge Johnson were many \nand some are now legendary. None were better told than those by the \nlong time federal prosecutor, Broward Segrest, who practiced in Judge \nJohnson's Courtroom throughout his career. No one knew more of the \ncourtroom events and could tell them better than Broward.\n  There were almost as many Frank Johnson stories as Bear Bryant \nstories. The point is this: yes, he was famous. Yes, he played an \nhistoric role in making this land of equality. And, yes, he was \nbrilliant and fearless. He stood for what he believed in no matter what \nthe consequences at risk to his life. But, it was not just in these \ngreat trials that one could divine the nature of his greatness. It was \nalso in the lesser cases that he demonstrated his fierce determination \nto make justice come alive in his court, for every party in every case.\n  Lawyers who failed to follow the rules of court or to do an effective \njob\n\n[[Page S9371]]\n\nfor their clients were in big trouble. Because they knew what he \nexpected, what he demanded, they came to his court prepared and ready \nto do justice.\n  There is so much more than can be said. He once called himself a \n``conservative hillbilly'' and that statement could be defended. To \nJudge Johnson, no one was above the law or above any person who \nappeared in his court. All were equal. Though a Republican, he was the \nperfect democrat--with a small ``d''. Neither power, nor wealth, nor \nstatus, nor skilled lawyering counted a whit in his court and everyone \nknew it. He loved democracy, fairness and justice. Judge Johnson was \nvigorously indignant at crime and corruption. He fully understood that \nthose who stole or cheated were predators and were acting in violation \nof morality and law. This he would never tolerate. While he was always \ncommitted to providing a fair trial, he was known as a prosecutor's \njudge. He would not tolerate criminality.\n  Judge Johnson loved democracy and fairness and justice. He sought to \nmake that real in his courtroom by finding the truth and skillfully, \nwith intellectual honesty, applying the truth, the facts, to the law. \nAs God gives us the ability to understand it, that is justice, and a \njudge who does not consistently, in great cases and small, at risk of \nhis life, with skill and determination, and with courage and vision, \nover a long lifetime is worthy to be called great. Frank M. Johnson, \nJr. is worthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9371-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NASA AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1654, the NASA \nAuthorization Act for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002. Many of my \ncolleagues and their staff's have worked hard on this legislation. This \nis a good bill. It ensures NASA is authorized at the appropriate level \nto continue its role in Space Flight and Exploration, Earth and Space \nScience, assembly and operations on the International Space Station, \nand Aeronautical Research.\n  Over the last decade, the U.S. commercial space launch industry has \nlost its technological advantage and now holds only 30 percent of the \nworldwide space launch market. As a result, sensitive U.S. technology \nis often launched into space by either Chinese, Russian or French \nrockets, increasing the risk of unwarranted U.S. technology transfer to \nforeign nations. The delayed development of modern, less expensive \nlaunch systems in this country needs to be rectified. This high cost of \nspace transportation has greatly curtailed U.S. efforts in space \nresearch, science and exploration. This bill includes important \nprovisions to address this issue which I would like to highlight.\n  Mr. President, NASA is currently conducting research programs, such \nas the X-33, X-34 and X-37, that could result in important \ntechnological advancements applicable to future reusable launch \nvehicles and reductions in space transportation costs. In addition, \nthere are existing hardware and engine systems, that if evaluated, \ncould make an immediate contribution to reducing the cost of access to \nspace by a factor of 10. The information gained from these evaluations \ncan be incorporated into design plans for the Spaceliner 100 series of \nvehicles and ultimately reduce the cost of access to space by a factor \nof one hundred. In the Commerce Committee, I amended the Senate NASA \nbill to add $150M for Fiscal Year 2000 to accelerate these future space \nlaunch programs by one year. Accelerating the efforts that gain us \ncheaper access to space will help the U.S. recapture the space launch \nbusiness and save on future launch costs. American companies would not \nhave to look overseas for cheaper launches, thereby minimizing our \ntechnology exposure to foreign governments.\n  Also, I am pleased to see the portion of the Earth Science budget \nsupporting NASA's Commercial Remote Sensing effort is sustained. These \nprograms, managed by the NASA Stennis Space Center's Commercial Remote \nSensing Program Office in Mississippi, are contributing to the birth \nand growth of a new international industry. Wall Street has predicted \nthis industry will grow to the $10 billion level by 2010. NASA Stennis \npersonnel working together with the private sector, university \nresearchers and other Federal agencies are already producing viable \ncommercial products. New efforts are underway to coordinate the \npotential impact of these commercial products with the Department of \nTransportation. I have been told by DOT officials that remote sensing \ntechnology infused in the right way to DOT's planning efforts could \nresult in significant savings in highway planning and construction. \nThat is a very good potential payback for a small investment in the \ncommercialization of remote sensing technology.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill. I hope that the Senate's \ndifferences with the House can be resolved quickly so that the bill can \nbe presented to the President for signature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9371-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9371]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ON THE KENNEDY/BESSETTE TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week was one of unimaginable shock \nand sorrow for the families of John Kennedy, Jr., Carolyn Bessette \nKennedy and Lauren Bessette. We prayed as we first heard the news that \ntheir plane had disappeared. We hoped against hope as the Coast Guard, \nthe Navy and the National Transportation Safety Board conducted their \n``search and rescue'' mission, and we anguished when they shifted to \n``search and recovery,'' Now, as John, Carolyn and Lauren are laid to \nrest in the ocean that claimed their lives, we grieve.\n  Much has been said these past weeks--in this Chamber, across the \ncountry, and around the world--about these three exceptional young \npeople. We have heard again and again how John, Carolyn and Lauren \nloved life. We have heard so many stories of their compassion and \ngrace, their generosity and their considerable talents. We've heard, \nmost heartbreakingly, about their potential. They had, each of them, \nthe capacity for greatness. That is part of what makes their loss so \nprofound.\n  The great poet William Wordsworth wrote:\n\n     What though the radiance which was once so bright\n     Be now for ever taken from my sight\n     Though nothing can bring back the hour\n     Of splendor in the grass, of glory in the flower;\n     We will grieve not, rather find\n     Strength in what remains behind.\n\n  Nothing can bring back the splendor of their lives, or their \npotential. We are left now with only our memories of John Kennedy, Jr., \nhis wife Carolyn, and her sister Lauren. With that in mind, Senator \nLott and I are introducing a resolution to authorize the printing of \n``Memorial Tributes to John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Jr.'' These are our own \ntributes and condolences offered on this floor, this week, by members \nof the United States Senate. I ask the Senate to pass a resolution so \nthat we may share our tributes with the families of John Kennedy, \nCarolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette. I can only hope the \nKennedy, Bessette and Freeman families are able to find some small \nstrength in the memories of their loved ones, and in the words and \nsympathy of those who grieve with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9371-3", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9371-S9372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO FIELDING BRADFORD ROBINSON, JR., SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE \n               ASSISTANT AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF PROJECTS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize \nand say farewell to my longtime staff member, Fielding Bradford \nRobinson, Jr., who is departing my personal office staff and returning \nto the State of Mississippi, after more than ten years of outstanding \nservice here in Washington. Throughout his career, Brad Robinson has \nserved with great distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his \nmany accomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has \nprovided to me and to my home state of Mississippi.\n  A native of Jackson, Mississippi, Brad graduated from the University \nof Mississippi in 1982, with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in Public \nAdministration. At Ole Miss, Brad was an officer of the Associated \nStudent Body and a member of the Delta Psi Fraternity, St. Anthony \nHall. He began his association with politics as Page Captain in the \nMississippi House of Representatives. After logging countless miles as \na pollster associated with CBS News, Brad went to work as a staff \nassistant to the\n\n[[Page S9372]]\n\nlegendary United States Senator John C. Stennis of Mississippi. At that \ntime, Senator Stennis was President Pro-Tempore of the Senate and \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee. Following the retirement of \nSenator Stennis, Brad signed on as a staff member for freshman \nCongressman Larkin Smith, my friend and successor in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. Tragically, Congressman Smith died in a plane crash \nonly months after taking office.\n  In 1989, Brad returned to the United States Senate and began work as \na member of my personal staff. On Thursday, August 5th, 1999, Brad will \nconclude over ten years of faithful service in my office. During these \nyears, Brad has proven to be one of my most loyal and dedicated staff \nmembers. As a special legislative assistant and as my deputy director \nof projects, Brad has tirelessly worked for the best interests of our \nNation and the State of Mississippi. Over the years, working on \nMississippi project interests has brought Brad into contact with \nvirtually every city, county, and state agency in Mississippi; every \nfederal agency and department; and every committee of the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives as well.\n  Brad has pursued virtually every type of public infrastructure \nproject conceivable, helping Mississippians build and improve utility \nsystems, industrial parks, highways, bridges, railroads, airports and \nwater ports. Using formal training from Ole Miss as a public planner, \nBrad labored closely with local engineers, and with the Army Corps of \nEngineers, to champion life saving flood control projects in the \nMississippi Delta Region, the Jackson Metropolitan Area of Central \nMississippi, and in the Forrest and Harrison County areas of South \nMississippi. From the Director of the Mississippi Rural Water \nAssociation to water system operators throughout Mississippi, Brad is \nknown as a dependable source of information and positive government \naction. Port directors along the Mississippi River, the Tennessee-\nTombigbee Waterway, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast, have come to rely \non Brad's expertise and network of contacts, on everything from \ndredging projects, to trade and empowerment zone designations.\n  Working behind the scenes to encourage top flight companies such as \nSouthwest Airlines to expand into Mississippi, has also been a talent \nin which Brad has excelled. He is known by airport directors throughout \nour state as a man they know personally, who seemingly always is there \nto help with extending or repairing a runway, or improving navigation \nand weather instrument capability. Railroads, too, came to know Brad as \nan honest broker who stood for economic progress that also safeguarded \nand improved public safety. His multi-modal expertise, made Brad a \nnatural asset to my staff during the legislative process that \nculminated in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \n(ISTEA), as well as later during the legislative development of the \nTransportation Efficiency Act of the Twenty-first Century (TEA-21).\n  Among his many successes, Brad played a key role in encouraging the \nestablishment of an environmentally friendly power generating facility \nin our state, which will efficiently and cleanly make use of vast \nalternative fuel supplies of lignite or low-grade coal. Combining a \nbroad general knowledge with a keen appreciation for business, science, \nand technical development, and a deep respect for conservation and \nhistory, Brad has become a favorite of both business and development \nconcerns, as well as leaders in historic and natural preservation. Brad \nwas instrumental in historic preservation efforts for the Natchez Trace \nand the Natchez National Historic Park, as well as efforts to establish \na Campaign of Vicksburg National Historic Trail, and a new visitors \ncenter for the Corinth, Mississippi Battlefield and Cemetery. Working \nboth with community activists and public officials, Brad helped further \nthese causes as well as many other historic and environmental projects \nsuch as rebuilding the Fort Massachusetts lighthouse on Ship Island, \nand restoring natural levels of water flow along the Lower Pearl River.\n  Like many effective staff members on Capitol Hill, Brad is the kind \nof person who never meets a stranger. A true southern gentleman, his \nChristian values and honest work ethic have endeared Brad to his \ncolleagues and constituents in addition to earning their respect and \ntrust. His flexible yet focused demeanor enables him to handle numerous \nprojects without losing sight of the people with whom he works. For all \nof the many public projects Brad assisted over the years, he always \nmade time to help individual citizens with their problems. On one \noccasion, while assisting a constituent with her tax problem, Brad \nlearned of an unintended result that affected similarly situated \ncitizens across our Nation. Brad got to work, helped form a bipartisan \ncoalition, and succeeded in helping amend the tax code to reflect the \noriginal intent of Congress.\n  Brad also has contributed to the quality of life here on Capitol Hill \nthrough volunteering his time and leadership for such non-profit \norganizations as the Mississippi Society, the Ole Miss Alumni \nAssociation, and the Taste of the South annual charity ball. He even \nmet his lovely wife, Mary Ellen, while she served on the staff of \nSenator Strom Thurmond. Brad and Mary Ellen will make their new home in \nGulfport, Mississippi, and are expecting their first child in October.\n  Upon leaving my staff, Brad will serve as Executive Director of the \nSouthern Rapid Rail Transit Commission where he will play a significant \nrole in helping to establish high speed rail passenger service from \nHouston, Texas, to Jacksonville, Florida, and from the Gulf Coast to \nAtlanta. On behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I wish \nBrad all of the best in his new career. I wish for Brad, and his \ngrowing family, that they experience all of the opportunity, excitement \nand adventure of the American Dream as they enter this new chapter of \ntheir lives and in all of their future endeavors. Brad, my most sincere \ncongratulations on a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9372-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9372-S9373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     EXPRESSING THANKS AND APPRECIATION TO AMBASSADOR JAMES SASSER\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to others in \nthanking Ambassador Jim Sasser for his service to our country as the \nUnited States Ambassador to the People's Republic of China for the last \nthree and one half years.\n  Our friend Jim Sasser has just returned home having distinguished \nhimself as the President's representative in Beijing during a critical \nand often difficult period in United States/Chinese relations. He \nunderstood better than anyone how important it was that he do an \neffective job as United States Ambassador to such a strategically \nimportant country.\n  When President Clinton nominated Jim as his ambassador he had every \nconfidence in Jim's ability to fulfill his diplomatic duties, and that \nconfidence was not misplaced. Even before Jim took on this assignment \nhe understood that the state of U.S./China relations could have \nprofound implications for peace and prosperity not only in the Asia/\nPacific region but globally as well.\n  Once confirmed, Ambassador Sasser became an articulate and effective \nspokesman for the administration's policy of engagement with China. He \nrightfully stressed that the United States does not have the luxury of \nnot dealing with China. He would remind his audiences that China's \nsheer size, its permanent membership on the United Nations Security \nCouncil, its nuclear weapons capability, its economic and military \npotential, all demand that the United States engage the Chinese \nGovernment and the Chinese people.\n  Soon after his arrival, Jim established excellent working \nrelationships with the Chinese leadership. Both formally and informally \nhe encouraged Beijing to view itself as a responsible member of the \ninternational community and act accordingly. I credit Jim's efforts \nalong with others in successfully persuading China to commit itself to \nrespect a number of non-proliferation regimes and to take under serious \nreview the possibility of formally acceding to others.\n  Perhaps Jim's most significant achievement during his tenure was to \noversee preparations for two high level bilateral summits between the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S9373]]\n\nStates and China, President Jiang's 1997 visit to Washington and \nPresident Clinton's return visit to Beijing in 1998--the first such \nmeetings between the United States and China in nearly a decade. I \ncannot imagine even the most seasoned of career diplomats performing \nmore ably as United States Ambassador than Jim Sasser has over the last \nthree and one half years.\n  I kept in touch with Jim during his tenure as ambassador. He was \nalways enthusiastic and fully engaged in working to ensure that United \nStates policies with respect to China served our national security, \nforeign policy and economic interests.\n  I have already mentioned to some of my colleagues, that I was \nactually talking to Jim one evening at the very moment that the U.S. \nEmbassy was under siege by crowds of Chinese students pelting the \nbuilding with rocks in retaliation for the accidental bombing of the \nChinese embassy in Belgrade. It showed great courage for him to remain \nin the embassy with his staff rather than be evacuated as some had \nrecommended. And through it all Jim never lost his sense of humor.\n  Although relations between Washington and Beijing have deteriorated \nin recent months, Jim was able to maintain open lines of communication \nwith the Chinese government at the highest levels. He accomplished this \ndifficult task by the strength of his intellect and personality.\n\n  Having had the pleasure of serving with Jim Sasser in the United \nStates Senate it came as no surprise to me that Jim has been an \noutstanding diplomat. Jim brought to the job of U.S. Ambassador the \nsame vision that he brought to the U.S. Senate while he served in this \nChamber.\n  I remember vividly serving with Jim on the Budget Committee --at the \ntime I was a very junior member of that committee. From 1989 onward, I \nwas able to observe Jim's remarkable, remarkable performance as \nChairman of that committee as he built support for sound budget \nresolutions. Time after time, he marshaled the votes and brought \ntogether people of totally different persuasions and opinions--one of \nthe most difficult jobs that any Member of this body has. And he did it \nsuccessfully, on six different budget resolutions and three \nreconciliation bills. These victories came under the most difficult \ncircumstances--including during the Republican administration of \nPresident George Bush, when he fashioned one of the most difficult \nbudget compromises in modern history.\n  Jim has served our country ably as a United States Senator and an \nAmerican diplomat. In fact, there are very few people in public life \nwho come to mind who have made the kinds of contributions to our \ncountry that Jim Sasser has over the years.\n  And through it all, never once has Jim or his family complained about \nthe personal sacrifices that they have made in their years of public \nservice. It therefore seems only appropriate and fitting that I take \ntime today to publicly thank Jim, his wife Mary, and his children Gray \nand Elizabeth for all that they have done for our country. It is also a \npersonal pleasure to welcome them home to the United States and to \nJim's beloved State of Tennessee. I look forward to seeing Jim and Mary \nvery soon and I know our colleagues do as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9373-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9373]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHANGES TO H.

Mr. President, I have at hand several news reports \nindicating that Nicaragua's Sandinistas have finally confessed that \nthey supplied weapons in the 1980s to communist guerrillas in El \nSalvador and, in fact, were themselves dependent on a flood of weapons \nfrom the Soviet Union during that period.\n  An excellent series of articles, written by Glenn Garvin and \npublished in the Miami Herald earlier this month, at long last makes \nthe record clear on that score. I ask unanimous consent that Glenn \nCarvin's articles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Mr. Garvin conducted a series of interviews \nwith current and former Sandinista officials who are now celebrating \nthe 20th anniversary of their rise to power on July 19, 1979. What they \ncelebrate is a revolution that brought nothing but poverty and \nheartache to millions of people.\n  But in the midst of reciting war stories, they let the truth slip \nout: these Sandinista officials confirmed that they provided weapons to \nthe Marxist Salvadoran guerrillas. They also acknowledged that the \nSoviet Union agreed to supply Nicaragua with high-performance MiG \nfighters, along with other military assistance.\n  This is not news, but what is, indeed, news is that, for once, two \nSandinistas told the truth. back in the 1980s, when President Ronald \nReagan and good many Senators accused the Sandinistas of fomenting \nrevolution in neighboring countries, they and their left-wing media \napologists in the United States questioned our facts. When the Reagan \nAdministration warned the Soviets not to provide MiGs to Nicaragua, the \nother side falsely accused President Reagan of hysteria.\n  Now come Sandinista leaders--co-founder Tomas Borge and former \npresident Daniel Ortega--admitting their role in a plot to escalate the \ncrisis in Central America. Mr. President, neither of the two is famous \nfor telling the truth, but in this case, I think they stumbled upon it, \nletting the cat out of the bag.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                        [From the Miami Herald]\n\n                  We Shipped Weapons, Sandinistas Say\n\n                           (By Glenn Garvin)\n\n       Managua.--When Ronald Reagan and Sandinista leaders slugged \n     it out during the 1980s over events in Nicaragua, Reagan was \n     right more often than they liked to admit, the Sandinistas \n     now say.\n       In a series of interviews with The Herald, several past and \n     present Sandinista officials confirmed that they shipped \n     weapons to Marxist guerrillas in neighboring El Salvador, a \n     statement they once hotly denied.\n       The Sandinistas also said that the Soviet Union agreed to \n     supply them with MiG jet fighters and even arranged for \n     Nicaraguan pilots to be trained on the planes in Bulgaria. \n     but the Soviets reneged on the deal, sending the Sandinistas \n     scurrying to make peace with the contras.\n\n\n                             domino theory\n\n       ``The Sandinista leadership thought they could be Che \n     Guevaras of all Latin America, from Mexico to Antarctica,'' \n     former Sandinista leader Moises Hassan told the Herald. ``the \n     domino theory wasn't so crazy.''\n       During their explosive battles with Congress over U.S. aid \n     to anti-Sandinista rebels\n\n[[Page S9374]]\n\n     in Nicaragua, Reagan administration officials frequently \n     justified helping the rebels on the grounds that the \n     Sandinistas were shipping arms to the Salvadoran guerrillas.\n       Reagan's deputies also accused the Sandinistas of planning \n     to acquire the MiGs, a move that they warned that the United \n     States ``would view with the utmost concern.'' In 1984, when \n     American officials spotted large crates being unloaded from \n     Soviet ships in Nicaraguan ports, there was widespread fear \n     that the two countries would go to war. But the crates turned \n     out to contain helicopters, and tensions eased.\n       Sandinista leaders had denied supplying the Salvadoran \n     guerrillas. ``We are not responsible for what is happening El \n     Salvador,'' said Sandinista party cofounder Tomas Borge said \n     in 1980.\n       Earlier this month, Borge and former president Daniel \n     Ortega both said the denials were false. they said the \n     Sandinistas had shipped arms to Salvadoran guerrillas because \n     the Salvadorans helped them in their successful insurrection \n     against Anastasio Somoza, and also because they thought it \n     would be more difficult for the United States to attack two \n     revolutionary regimes instead of one.\n\n\n                          a matter of ethics'\n\n       ``We wanted to broaden the territory of the revolution, to \n     make it wider, so it would be harder for the Americans to \n     come after us,'' Borge said. Ortega added that it was ``a \n     matter of ethics'' to arm the Salvadorans.\n       Neither man offered details on how many weapons were \n     supplied. But Hassan a former Sandinista official who was a \n     member of the revolutionary junta that governed Nicaragua in \n     the early 1980s, said he believed about 50,000 weapons and a \n     corresponding amount of ammunition were sent to El Salvador \n     just in the first 16 months of the Sandinista government.\n       ``Ortega and Borge didn't tell me about it, because they \n     thought I was unreliable, but other people who just assumed I \n     knew would casually bring it up,'' Hassan said.\n       Hassan resigned from the Sandinista party in June 1985 but \n     continued to work closely with his old colleagues as mayor of \n     Managua until late 1988.\n       He also confirmed that the Sandinistas had a commitment for \n     MiGs from the Soviet Union.\n       He said he learned of the plan for the MiGs during 1982, \n     when he was minister of construction and Sandinistas began \n     building a base for the jet fighters at Punta Huete, a remote \n     site on the east side of Lake Managua.\n       The site included a 10,000-foot concrete runway--the \n     longest in Central America--capable of handling any military \n     aircraft in the Soviet fleet.\n\n\n                          Code name: Panchito\n\n       ``It was top secret--we even had a code name, Panchito, so \n     we could talk about it without the CIA hearing,'' Hassan \n     said. ``But somehow the Americans found out.''\n       Alejandro Bendena, who was secretary general of foreign \n     affairs during the Sandinista government, said Nicaraguan \n     pilots trained to fly the MiGs in Bulgaria. But in 1987, soon \n     after the Punta Huete site was finished, the Soviets backed \n     out, he said.\n       The news that they weren't getting a weapon they had always \n     considered security blanket, coupled with Soviet advice that \n     it was ``time to achieve a regional settlement of security \n     problems,'' made the Sandinistas realize that they could not \n     longer depend on the USSR for help, Bendana said.\n       Quickly, the Sandinistas signed onto a regional peace plan \n     sponsored by Costa Rican President Oscar Arias, which \n     required peace talks with the U.S.-backed contra army, \n     Bendana said. Those talks led eventually to an agreement for \n     internationally supervised elections that resulted in a \n     Sandinista defeat in 1990.\n       ``It wasn't the intellectual brilliance of Oscar Arias that \n     did it,'' Bendana said. ``It was us grabbing frantically onto \n     any framework that was there, trying to cut our losses.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 Hostility to the U.S. a Costly Mistake\n\n\n20 years after the revolution, Nicaraguans wonder how it all could have \n                             gone so wrong\n\n                           (by Glenn Garvin)\n\n       Managua.--It was hard to say which was shining more \n     brightly, Moises Hassan thought, as his makeshift military \n     caravan rolled down the highway: the sun in the sky, or the \n     faces of the people crowded along the road, shrieking \n     ``Viva!'' to his troops.\n       It was the morning of July 19th, 1979, and Nicaragua had \n     just awakened to find itself abruptly, stunningly free of a \n     dictatorship that, for more than 40 years, had passed the \n     country around from generation to generation like a family \n     cow.\n       Hassan, as a senior official in the Sandinista National \n     Liberation Front, the guerrilla movement that had spearheaded \n     the rebellion against the dictatorship, had played a key role \n     in ousting it. But now, as he waived to the crowds lining the \n     highway, he realized that it was what came next that would \n     really count.\n       ``You could see the happiness in the people's faces,'' he \n     recalled. ``And you could see the hope, too. And I told \n     myself, damn, we've taken a lot of responsibility on \n     ourselves . . . . We cannot let these people down.' ''\n       Twenty years later, neither Hassasn nor any other \n     Sandinista leader denies that the revolution they did let \n     Nicaraguans down. It would reel headlong into a decade of \n     confrontation with the United States, a catastrophic economy \n     where peasants literally preferred toilet paper to the \n     national currency, and a civil war that would take 25,000 \n     lives and send perilously close to a million others into \n     exile.\n       It would end 11 years later in an ignominious electoral \n     defeat from which the Sandististas still haven't recovered, \n     and some say, never will. And it is still a source of wonder \n     to them how everything could have gone so disastrously wrong.\n       ``We believed--it was one of our many errors--that we were \n     going to hold power until the end of the centuries,'' mused \n     Tomas Borge, who helped found the Sandinista Front in 1961. \n     ``It didn't work out that way.''\n       Just as the Sandinista victory in 1979 echoed around the \n     world, ushering in a new chapter of the Cold War, its \n     collapse sent a tidal wave washing through the international \n     left.\n       Leftist theoreticians who could no longer defend the \n     bueaucracy in the Soviet Union or Fidel Castro's erratic \n     military adventures abroad pinned their hopes on the Baby \n     Boomer regime in Nicaragua. They were devastated when it \n     fared no better than the graying revolutions in Cuba and the \n     USSR.\n       ``It's like saying we had a project to make the world over \n     the greater justice and greater fairness, and we failed,'' \n     said Margaret Randall, an American academic who lived in \n     Nicaragua during the first four years the Sandinistas \n     governed and wrote four adultatory books about them.\n       ``It's been very, very hard for those of us who gave our \n     best years to Nicaragua, our greatest energies to Nicaragua, \n     who had friends who died there . . . It's one thing to say \n     the people are gone, but the project is still there. But now \n     there's nothing. We're still picking up the pieces.''\n\n\n  all was confusion--chaos left sandinistas a blank slate for country\n\n       On that day 20 years ago, it was a little hard to imagine \n     that any government would emerge from the debris left behind \n     when Anastasio Somoza--the last of three family members to \n     rule Nicaragua--slipped away in the middle of the night.\n       Within hours of Somoza's departure, the entire senior \n     officer corps of the National Guard, the army on which the \n     dictatorship was built, bolted for the border. On the morning \n     of July 19, Managua's streets were littered with cast-off \n     uniforms of panicky junior officers and enlisted men who were \n     making their own getaways in civilian clothes.\n       Chaos was everywhere. Children lurched about the parking \n     lot of the Inter-Continental Hotel, spraying the air with \n     bullets from automatic rifles left behind by the soldiers. \n     Inside the hotel, the last of the foreign mercenaries Somoza \n     employed as bodyguards was going room to room, robbing \n     reporters (including one from The Miami Herald) at gunpoint.\n       At the airport, clogged with government officials and \n     Somoza cronies trying to catch the last plane out, an armed \n     band of teenage Sandinista sympathizers climbed into the \n     tower to try to arrest the air traffic controllers, who were \n     still wearing their National Guard uniforms. Only the \n     intervention of a Red Cross official prevented a complete \n     disaster.\n       Elsewhere in the city, those who couldn't or wouldn't leave \n     were nervously preparing peace offerings to the revolutionary \n     army that was headed for Managua. One elderly couple spray-\n     painted FSLN--the Spanish initials by which the Sandinistas \n     were known--across the sides of their new Mercedes Benz.\n       But as Sandinista forces poured into the city over the next \n     few days, the situation quickly stabilized. And as FSLN \n     leaders admit, the anarchy they found actually offered them a \n     marvelous opportunity to start a country from scratch.\n       ``The state dissolved completely,'' said novelist Giaconda \n     Belli, who delivered the first newscast over Sandinista \n     television. ``No army, no judges, no congress, no nothing. . \n     . . It was like a clean slate for us.''\n       What the Sandinistas had promised--to the Organization of \n     American States and the U.S. Government, as they tried to \n     mediate the war against Somoza--was a pluralist, non-aligned \n     democracy with a mixed economy. Many Sandinistas still say \n     that was what they tried to build.\n       ``We were not trying to put a communist government in \n     Managua,'' Belli insisted. ``We were very critical of the \n     Soviet model and the Cuban model. We never closed our \n     borders, we never prohibited organized religion.''\n       But though there were many members of the FSLN who rejected \n     communist dogma, the nine men who composed the Sandinista \n     directorate--the central committee--were committed Marxist-\n     Leninists.\n       ``All the top leadership was Marxist-Leninist,'' agreed \n     Hassan, who wasn't. ``And I knew that if they had their way, \n     Nicaragua would be a Marxist state. But I wasn't too worried \n     about it. I didn't think they would be able to brush aside \n     the rest of us.''\n       Hassan was part of the five-member junta--which included \n     two non-Sandinista members--that was theoretically governing \n     Nicaragua until free elections could be held. But, he soon \n     realized, all the important decisions were being made by the \n     party leadership. The junta was little more than a rubber \n     stamp.\n       ``I remember when the Russians invaded Afghanistan late in \n     1979, the junta had to\n\n[[Page S9375]]\n\n     meet to decide what position we were going to take at the \n     United Nations,'' Hassen said. ``We decided we would condemn \n     it. But when [Foreign Minister Miguel] D'Escoto went up to \n     New York, he abstained when it was time to vote. The \n     Sandinista directorate told him what to do, and he obeyed \n     them, not us.''\n       In fact, there was an increasing confusion between the \n     identity of the country and the party. The police became the \n     Sandinista National Police, the army the Sandinista People's \n     Army. Schoolchildren pledged allegiance not only to Nicaragua \n     but to the Sandinista party, and promised it their ``love, \n     loyalty and sacrifice.''\n       Meanwhile, the failure to condemn the Soviet invasion was \n     symptomatic of the revolution's leftward march. The \n     government quickly moved to seize anything that was \n     ``mismanaged'' or ``underexploited.'' Farmers were ordered to \n     sell grain only to a state purchasing agency and cattle only \n     to state slaughterhouses.\n       Newsmen who criticized government policies lost their \n     papers or radio programs, and sometimes were jailed. Kids \n     learned math from schoolbooks that taught two grenades plus \n     two grenades plus two grenades equals six grenades, and their \n     alphabet from sentences like this one that illustrated the \n     use of the letter Q: ``Sandino fought the yanquis. The \n     yanquis will always be defeated in our fatherland.''\n       It was the profound Sandinista hostility to the United \n     States--the party anthem even referred to the U.S. as ``the \n     enemy of humanity''--that led to what some party leaders now \n     consider its most ruinous mistake: supporting Marxist \n     guerrillas in nearby El Salvador against the American-backed \n     government.\n       First Jimmy Carter and then Ronald Reagan warned the \n     Sandinistas to stay out of the Salvadoran conflict. When they \n     didn't, the United States first suspended aid to Nicaragua, \n     and later began supporting the counterrevolutionary forces \n     that came to be known as the contras in a civil war that \n     ultimately cost the Sandinistas power.\n       ``It was just political machismo,'' Belli said. ``Everybody \n     was young, wearing uniforms, and they thought they were cut. \n     They wanted to be heroic, and going up against the United \n     States was heroic. . . . But it was the wrong thing to do, \n     and the Nicaraguan people paid a high price.''\n       Several Sandinista leaders say the party missed a golden \n     opportunity when Thomas Enders, an assistant U.S. secretary \n     of state, came to Managua in 1981 with a final carrot-and-\n     stick offer from the Reagan administration: Quit fooling \n     around in El Salvador, and we'll leave you alone, no matter \n     what you do inside Nicaragua. Keep it up, and we'll swat you \n     like a fly.\n       ``It was a great opportunity for a deal,'' said Arturo Cruz \n     Jr., who was a key official in Nicaragua's foreign ministry \n     at the time. ``I think it was a sincere offer. Ronald Reagan \n     considered Nicaragaua a lost cause. Their concern was El \n     Salvador.'' Sergio Ramirez, a member of the junta and later \n     vice president, agreed: ``I thought it was an opportunity, \n     and I said so, but no one agreed with me.''\n       Even with the benefit of hindsight, some Sandinistas say it \n     was unthinkable to back away from the Salvadoran guerrillas.\n       ``That was a matter of ethics on our part,'' said former \n     President Daniel Ortega. ``The Salvadorans had helped us \n     [against Somoza]. And thanks to the armed struggle, El \n     Salvador has changed. It's a much different place than it was \n     then. . . . The war in El Salvador has led to a political \n     advance, and we are part of that achievement.''\n       The United States wouldn't have kept its promise anyway, \n     said Borge. ``Look, I don't think Cuba was ever a threat to \n     the United States, but let's say it was at one time,'' he \n     explained. ``Well, with the fall of the Soviet Union, it \n     obviously isn't a threat anymore. But the U.S. agitation \n     against Cuba and attempts to isolate it continue. The U.S. \n     doesn't like revolutionaries, and we were \n     revolutionaries.''\n       But is some Sandinistas had doubts about the carrot in \n     Enders' offer, they know he was serious about the stick. \n     Three months after the Sandinistas rejected the deal, the \n     Regan administration was funneling money to the contras. Four \n     months after that, in March 1982, the contras blew up two \n     major bridges in northern Nicaragua, and the war was on in \n     earnest.\n       The war led directly to some of the Sandinistas' most \n     unpopular policies, like the military draft, and broadened \n     others, like moving peasants off their land into \n     cooperatives. Censorship expanded until the daily paper La \n     Presena, the last voice of the opposition, was shut down \n     completely.\n       What had been skirmishes between the Sandinistas and the \n     Roman Catholic Church erupted into full-fledged firefights, \n     climaxing when FSLN militants shouted down Pope John Paul II \n     as he tried to say Mass.\n       It accelerated the decline already begun by their economic \n     policies. By 1988, inflation was 33,000 percent annually, and \n     it took a shopping bag full of cordobas just to buy lunch--\n     that is if you could find lunch.\n       Practically everything was in short supply: No hay, there \n     isn't any, because about the only Spanish phrase a visitor of \n     Nicaragua needed. The vast shelves of the supermarkets built \n     in the days of Somoza were empty except for Bulgarian-made \n     dishwasher soap, useless in a country with no dishwashers.\n       When the Sandinistas managed to obtain food from their \n     socialist trading partners, people were suspicious. A bumper \n     crop of Russian potatoes in 1987 led to the widespread \n     certainty that they were contaminated with radiation from the \n     breakdown of the Soviet nuclear reactor at Chernobyl.\n       Some of the problems, Sandinista leaders insist even now, \n     weren't their fault.\n       ``The conflict with the church was strong, and it cost us, \n     but I don't think it was our fault.'' Ortega said. ``There \n     was so many people being wounded every day, so many people \n     dying, and it was hard for us to understand the position of \n     the church hierarchy'' in refusing to condemn the contras.\n       Others, they acknowledge, were in large part their \n     responsibility. ``When we arrived, we had almost total \n     power,'' Borge said. ``And we didn't know how to handle total \n     power. What came hand in hand with total power was the \n     mistaken belief that we were never mistaken. This made us \n     behave in an arbitrary way. And the most grave and arbitrary \n     abuses were made in the countryside, where the peasants began \n     to join the contras.''\n       Sandinista leaders agree that the contras would never have \n     grown into such a huge and destructive force--some 22,000 by \n     the war's end--if the U.S. hadn't been arming and supplying \n     them. But most of them also admit that the revolution made \n     the war possible by alienating hundreds of thousands of \n     peasants.\n       ``During the 1984 election, we had a rally down in the \n     southern part of the country, and they had this peasant--a \n     contra who had surrendered--make a symbolic presentation of a \n     riffle to me,'' Ramirez recalled. ``We always talked about \n     the contras as American mercenaries, but this guy standing \n     across from me was not some big gringo Ranger. He was a \n     simple peasant.\n       ``Before that, my understanding of the counterrevolution \n     had been intellectual. But here, right before me, was the \n     face of the country. This poor man. . . . He thought we were \n     going to take away his children, interfere in his family, \n     butt into his religion, make him work in a collective.\n       ``And this was the man that the revolution was supposed to \n     be for! You know, the revolution was headed by intellectuals. \n     We did it in the name of the workers and peasants, but were \n     all intellectuals. And in the end , most of the peasants were \n     against us.\n\n\n       end of game--sandinistas stunned by scope of election loss\n\n       The war eventually forced the Sandinistas to agree to \n     internationally supervised elections. They lost--to Violeta \n     Chamorro, publisher of La Prensa, one of their most important \n     allies during the war against Somoza--in a landslide that \n     stunned them.\n       ``We had a naive syllogism: If it was a revolution for the \n     poor, then the poor couldn't be against us,'' Ramirez said. \n     ``But we should have known much earlier. We started out with \n     90 percent of the population behind us. By 1985, there were \n     400,000 Nicaraguans who had fled to Miami, several hundred \n     thousand more in Costa Rica and Honduras, and we still only \n     got 60 percent of the vote. The Nicaraguan family was \n     split.''\n       Since the 1990 election, the Sandinistas have lost three \n     more elections (one presidential, two for local offices \n     across the country) by nearly identical margins. The party \n     newspaper is closed, the party television station under the \n     control of Mexican investors. Two major scandals--one over \n     the way Sandinista leaders looted the government on their way \n     out of office in 1990, another over allegations that Daniel \n     Ortega molested his stepdaughter for nine years, beginning \n     when she was 11--have been sandwiched around countless minor \n     ones.\n       Those who govern now say the Sandinistas left nothing \n     behind but wreckage. Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique \n     Bolanos, a lifelong opponent of the FSLN whose farm was \n     confiscated during the revolution, says it will take decades \n     to undo the damage the Sandinistas did to the Nicaraguan \n     economy.\n       ``Per capital income dropped to the levels of 1942 when \n     they were in charge,'' he said. ``The trade deficit, which \n     had always hovered around zero, went up to $400 million to \n     $600 million their first year, and its stayed there ever \n     since. Even if we get the foreign debt they left us under \n     control--it went from $1.3 billion to $12 billion under \n     them--that trade deficit will kill us.''\n       Many of the party's most loyal militants--including \n     Ramirez, Belli, Hassan and Cruz--have deserted it. Some are \n     harshly critical of what the revolution left behind. Hassan, \n     who has left politics and now manages a garment factory, said \n     that what he saw during the revolution has soured him on the \n     political left.\n       ``I think the left equal populism, which equals give-me-\n     give-me-give-me,'' he said. ``What we bred here are people \n     who say, `I'll go to demonstrations and shout, but I won't \n     work. I want a salary, but I won't work. I want food, but I \n     won't work. I want a house, but I won't work.\n       But others believe that the revolution left some things of \n     lasting value, including a sense that even poor people have \n     inalienable rights.\n       ``Nicaraguan peasant will look you straight in the eye,'' \n     said Alejandro Bendana, once Daniel Ortega's top foreign \n     policy adviser, now estranged from the party. ``That wasn't \n     always true. When I was a kid, they walked up to you, bowing, \n     humble and deferential, saying boss this and boss that. That \n     is a legacy of the revolution.''\n       Bendana, like many past and present Sandinistas, believes \n     that the revolution would have been worthwhile even if it \n     never accomplished anything but getting rid of the Somozas.\n\n[[Page S9376]]\n\n       ``Our parents had failed to get rid of the bastard, and we \n     were the ones who did it,'' he said. ``And to get rid of the \n     dictatorship, armed force was required. Banging pots and pans \n     in the streets, like in the Philippines, that wasn't going to \n     do it.''\n       Ortega, somewhat paradoxically, believes that the election \n     that ousted him proves that the Sandinistas moved the country \n     forward.\n       ``When we lost the election, we gave up the government,'' \n     Ortega said. ``That hadn't happened before. What we have here \n     is a typical bourgeois democracy--not a true people's \n     democracy--but I still think it represents an advance for \n     Nicaragua.''\n       But being remembered as a transitional asterisk in \n     Nicaraguan history was not what the Sandinistas dreamed of in \n     1979, when they boasted that they would do nothing less than \n     construct a New Man, free of the chains of ego and \n     selfishness.\n       ``I always thought the revolution would be a transcendental \n     story in human development,'' mused Ramirez earlier this \n     month. ``But it wasn't, was it?''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9376-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                46TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE KOREAN ARMISTICE\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, on July 27, 1953, the armistice was \nsigned, ending the Korean War. On Sunday, July 25, 1999, nearly forty-\nsix years after the fighting stopped, the Veterans of Foreign Wars \ngathered for the dedication of a Korean War Memorial in Fultondale, \nAlabama. I rise today, on the 46th Anniversary of the armistice, to \nhonor the military personnel who faithfully served our nation in this \nconflict.\n  Many have wrongfully called Korea ``the Forgotten War.'' I want \nKorean War veterans to know that we have not forgotten their brave \nservice to our nation. The courage and dedication of American troops \nwho fought on and around the Korean Peninsula should never be \nforgotten. The names of Pusan, Inchon, Chosin Reservoir and countless \nother locations where our forces fought against Communist aggression \ncontinue to bring pride to the hearts and minds of all Americans.\n  We are constantly and correctly reminded of the thousands of \nAmericans who lost so much in the Vietnam War. Vietnam left such a \nlasting impression on our history that there has been a temptation to \noverlook our nation's first stand against the Communist threat in Asia. \nI am committed to insuring that we do not succumb to this temptation. \nWe must not forget either the 37,000 Americans who gave their lives in \nKorea, or the 8,000 MIAs whose fate remains a mystery.\n  Those who served their nation from 1950-53 suffered much, but have \nleft a proud legacy. The 8th Army, Far East Air Force, 1st Marine \nDivision, and 7th Fleet proved their mettle in Korea and remain among \nthe proudest names in American military history. The peace and \nprosperity which the people of South Korea enjoy today is the direct \nresult of the gallantry of our Armed Forces. The 38,000 American \npersonnel who currently serve in South Korea are guardians of the \nliberty which their predecessors fought to establish nearly half a \ncentury ago.\n  Mr. President, I ask you and my fellow United States Senators to join \nme in recognizing the members of the Armed Services who sacrificed so \nmuch in defense of freedom and democracy on the Korean Peninsula.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9376-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to establish the National Law Enforcement Museum on \nFederal land in the District of Columbia; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources\n\n\n                  National Law Enforcement Museum Act\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nNational Law Enforcement Museum Act of 1999. This legislation would \nauthorize the construction of a National Law Enforcement Museum to be \nbuilt here in our Nation's Capital.\n  Just over one year ago, this institution, along with millions of \nother Americans, were reminded about the risks that our officers must \nface on a daily basis. On July 24, 1998, U.S. Capitol Police Officer \nJacob J. Chestnut\n\n[[Page S9379]]\n\nand Detective John Gibson were killed by a deranged man. This \nlegislation I introduce today will ensure that their story of heroism \nand sacrifice is never forgotten, just as we must never forget the \nthousands of other officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice to \nsecure the safety and well-being of our communities.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks peace \nofficers face in enforcing our laws. Throughout our nation's history, \nnearly 15,000 federal, state, and local law enforcement officers have \nlost their lives in the line of duty. Based on FBI statistics, nearly \n63,000 officers are assaulted each year in this country, resulting in \nmore than 21,000 injuries. On average, one police officer is killed \nsomewhere in America every 54 hours.\n  Approximately 740,000 law enforcement professionals are continuing to \nput their lives on the line for the safety and protection of others.\n  We owe all of those officers a huge debt of gratitude, and it is only \nfitting that we properly commemorate this outstanding record of service \nand sacrifice.\n  My legislation seeks to achieve this important goal by authorizing \nthe National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, a nonprofit \norganization, to establish a comprehensive law enforcement museum and \nresearch repository on federal land in the District of Columbia. The \nFund is the same group that so ably carried out the congressional \nmandate of 1984 to establish the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial, which was dedicated in 1991 just a few blocks from the \nCapitol. Clearly, their record of significant achievement speaks \nvolumes about their ability to meet this important challenge.\n  Since 1993, the Fund has efficiently operated a small-scale version \nof the National Law Enforcement Museum at a site located about two \nblocks from the Memorial. The time has come to broaden the scope of \nthis museum and move it in closer proximity to the National Law \nEnforcement Officers Memorial.\n  This museum would serve as a repository of information for \nresearchers, practitioners, and the general public. The museum will \nbecome the premiere source of information on issues related to law \nenforcement history and safety, and obviously a popular tourist \nattraction in Washington, DC, as well.\n  The ideal location for this museum is directly across from the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial on a parcel of federal-owned \nproperty that now functions as a parking lot. The building, as planned, \nwill have underground parking for the judicial officers who currently \nuse this lot.\n  Under my legislation, no federal dollars are being proposed to \nestablish this museum. Rather, the Fund would raise all of the money \nnecessary to construct the museum through private donations. \nRecognizing the national importance of this museum, however, the \nlegislation states that upon completion of the museum facility the \nSecretary of the Interior and the Administrator of the General Services \nAdministration will be responsible for the maintenance of the exterior \ngrounds and interior space, respectively. The legislation places the \nresponsibility of operating the museum in the hands of the Fund.\n  Finally, let me add that this legislation is supported by 15 national \nlaw enforcement organizations: the Concerns of Police Survivors; the \nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association; the Fraternal Order of \nPolice; the Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary; the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police; the International Brotherhood of \nPolice Officers; the International Union of Police Associations/AFL-\nCIO; the National Association of Police Organizations; the National \nBlack Police Association; the National Organization of Black Law \nEnforcement Executives; the National Sheriffs Association; the National \nTroopers Coalition; the Police Executive Research Forum; the Police \nFoundation; the United Federation of Police; and the National Law \nEnforcement Council. Together, these organizations represent virtually \nevery law enforcement officer, family member and police survivor in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, as we remember the sacrifices made by Officer \nChestnut, Detective Gibson and so many other brave officers, I strongly \nurge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in support of this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation and letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1438\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Law Enforcement \n     Museum Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The \n     research component alone, in conjunction with established \n     Federal resources, should serve all of law enforcement as the \n     premier source of information for operational and training \n     purposes.\n       The site being considered is a natural setting for this \n     museum and would no doubt enhance those Federal and District \n     of Columbia facilities located nearby.\n       In closing, I would like to thank you for your leadership \n     in introducing this legislation, as well as your support for \n     State Troopers/Highway Patrolmen and their families.

I wish to express FLEOA's strong support for \n     legislation establishing a National Law Enforcement Museum on \n     Federal land located directly across the street from the \n     National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial (NLEOM). FLEOA \n     thanks you for your support.\n       This legislation creates the largest and most comprehensive \n     law enforcement museum and research facility, at no cost to \n     the taxpayer as all funds necessary to complete the \n     construction will be raised through private donations. We \n     sincerely believe the museum and research facility will \n     enable the public to better understand and appreciate the \n     work of law enforcement, and thus further assist law \n     enforcement in fighting crime. The proposed location, across \n     the street from the Memorial Wall containing the names of \n     nearly 15,000 American law enforcement heroes, is ideal. \n     FLEOA, as a member of the NLEOM Executive Board, fully \n     supports this concept and proposed legislation.\n       If you have any questions or need further information, \n     please feel free to contact me directly at (212) 264-8400, or \n     through feel free to contact me directly at (516) 368-6117. \n     Thank you for your support.\n                                                 Richard J.

The NBPA fosters a bond between \n     the minority officers and their communities. This nonprofit \n     organization has helped to improve relations between the \n     police departments and the community.\n       I am writing on behalf of the National Law Enforcement \n     Memorial Fund to formally request that you introduce \n     legislation authorizing the NLEOMF to establish a National \n     Law Enforcement Museum on Federal land located directly \n     across the street from the National Law Enforcement Officers \n     Memorial.\n       The goal of the NLEOMF is to create the largest and most \n     comprehensive law enforcement museum and research facility \n     found anywhere in the world. The museum will become ``the \n     source'' of information on issues related to law enforcement \n     history and safety. This facility would help to create a much \n     better public understanding of and appreciation for the law \n     enforcement profession and the work that they perform at \n     great personal risk.\n       The museum site that is specified in this draft legislation \n     is federally-owned land that is currently being used by the \n     District of Columbia as a parking lot for the court buildings \n     in the area.

We strongly encourage you and your colleagues in the \n     Congress to support our efforts. The land on which we wish to \n     build our museum is locate on federal land and is located \n     directly across from the Memorial. It requires the approval \n     of Congress.\n       A Joint Resolution for the building of our Memorial (PL 98-\n     534) was approved by the Congress and signed into law in \n     1991. We understand a similar Joint Resolution is required \n     for the transfer of the public land in question, which is the \n     site selected for the museum.\n       We are grateful for your interest and help in the \n     introduction of the necessary legislation which would allow \n     the NLEOMF to build their museum on federal land across from \n     their Museum.\n       Kindest regards.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Donald Baldwin.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              United Federation of\n\n\n                                        Police Officers, Inc.,\n\n                               Briarcliff Manor, NY, July 2, 1999.\n     Hon.

It is my \n     understanding that you have received a draft of the proposed \n     legislation from our Executive Director Craig Floyd.\n       The goal is to create the largest and most comprehensive \n     law enforcement museum and research facility found anywhere \n     in the world.

This museum facility work provide an effective and \n     appropriate complement to the National Law Enforcement \n     Officers Memorial in commemorating the extraordinary level of \n     service and sacrifice provided throughout our history by our \n     nation's law enforcement officers.\n       Therefore, on behalf of our active, retired, and associate \n     members, I urge you to shepherd this legislation through the \n     United States Congress so this dream will become a reality.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ralph M.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: The National Organization of Black \n     Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE), applauds your efforts to \n     honor the law enforcement officers who have protected, and \n     those who protect our communities by introducing legislation \n     to create the National Law Enforcement Museum.\n       NOBLE is an organization of over 3,500 primarily African-\n     American law enforcement CEO's and command level officials \n     who are committed to improving the quality of law enforcement \n     service in this country through training, professional \n     competence, personal example and by forming meaningful \n     partnerships with the community.\n       NOBLE is a member of the board of directors of the National \n     Law Enforcement Memorial Fund, and as such, supports the \n     proposed National Law Enforcement Museum to be located on the \n     isle of a parking lot in Judiciary Square, just south of the \n     National Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C.\n       The nation's memorial to law enforcement officers who have \n     made the supreme sacrifice is unfortunately a perpetual \n     memorial with an average of 150 names inscribed on the \n     memorial walls each year. The memorial serves as a place \n     where the families, friends and coworkers can find peace and \n     solace as they cope with the loss of ``their'' officer.\n       Many of these visitors leave mementos that are catalogued \n     and stored in the memorial offices. Other important items \n     relating to law enforcement are also sent to the memorial \n     offices. The memorial office is not an appropriate location \n     to display these remembrances. We believe that these items \n     should be displayed with the dignity they deserve. The \n     National Law Enforcement Museum would compliment the memorial \n     by not only telling the story of the courage and sacrifice of \n     the individual officers ``on the wall'' but also the \n     evolution of the law enforcement profession.\n       Besides the historical component, the museum would include \n     a research center. This is a logical progression for the \n     NLEOMF as the center would provide the opportunity to focus \n     law enforcement historical and safety information at one \n     location.\n       Fiscally, NOBLE believes that the National Law Enforcement \n     Museum is a good investment for the nation. The NLEOMF is \n     committed to this memorial and we have the capacity to \n     construct the memorial through private donations.\n       The NLEOMF will partner with Secretary of the Interior and \n     the Administrator of the General Services Administration for \n     the maintenance of the building and grounds and the NLEOMF \n     would operate the museum. The D.C. Supreme Court has already \n     given its support for the museum.\n       We trust that Congress will act on this legislation \n     expeditiously and turn this barren parking lot into living \n     facility, that will meld the past, the present and the future \n     of law enforcement with the memories of those whose names are \n     engraved on the walls of the companion memorial.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert L. Stewart,\n                                               Executive Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1439. A bill to terminate production under the D5 submarine-\nlaunched ballistic missile program; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n           trident ii (d-5) missile production limitation act\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a \nbill whose time has come.\n  Mr. President, it is a decade since the Berlin Wall came down, \nheralding the end of the Cold War. Since then, we have reduced our \nnuclear arsenal, as have the Russians. And our Navy is advocating to \ndownsize the Trident nuclear submarine fleet, the cornerstone of our \nnuclear triad strategy. It's just common sense to limit future \nproduction of weapons deployed in those submarines.\n  The bill I introduce today would terminate future production of the \nTrident II missile. In doing so, this common sense bill would save \nAmerican taxpayers $5 billion over the next five years, and more than \n$13 billion over the next ten years.\n  Mr. President, the Trident II, or D-5 missile, is the Navy's \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM). The missile is a Cold War \nrelic that was designed specifically to be a first-strike strategic \nmissile that would attack targets inside the Soviet Union from waters \noff the continental United States.\n  The Trident II is deployed aboard Ohio-class nuclear submarines in \nthe order of 24 per boat. Each missile is loaded with 8 independently \ntargetable, nuclear warheads. In other words, 192 warheads per \nsubmarine. The warheads bear 300- to 475-kilotons of explosive power. \nDoing the math, that equals up to 91,200 kilotons of warheads on each \nand every Trident submarine.\n  Mr. President, the truth of the matter is we all know that one \nsubmarine firing 192 warheads could bring about an apocalypse on this \nplanet. Needless to say, 18, 14, or even 10 submarines with that kind \nof firepower is beyond necessity. This is especially true if one \nconsiders that in addition to, yes, in addition to the SLBMS, the \nUnited States deploys 500 Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles with three warheads each; 50 Peacekeeper ICBMs with 10 \nwarheads each; and 94 B-52 and 21 B-2 bombers capable of carrying \nstrategic nuclear warheads.\n  Mr. President, the United States is building or possesses, right now, \n360 Trident II missiles. Current plans would have us purchase 65 more \nmissiles through 2005. The 360 missiles we already own are more than \nenough to fully arm the ten existing Trident II-armed submarines as \nwell as maintain an adequate test flight program. We simply do not need \n65 more missiles. Nor do we need to backfit four Trident I, or C4, \nmissile carrying submarines to carry Trident IIs, especially when one \nconsiders that the C4 submarines won't even outlast the Trident I \nmissiles they carry.\n  I'd like to briefly inform my colleagues on the difference between \nthe Trident I and Trident II missiles. According to CBO, the C4 has an \naccuracy shortage of about 450 feet compared to the D5, or the distance \nfrom where the presiding officer is sitting right now to where the \nSpeaker of the House is sitting down the hall. Given the fact that \neither missile could utterly destroy the District of Columbia many \ntimes over, spending billions of dollars to backfit the C4 submarines \nseems unnecessary.\n  And this is not an inexpensive program, Mr. President. According to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, which recommends that we discontinue \nproduction of the Trident II and retire all eight C4 submarines, if we \nterminate production of the missile after this year and retire the C4s \nby 2005, we would save more than $5 billion over five years, and more \nthan $13 billion over the next ten years. Even here in the Senate, \nthat's real money.\n  Mr. President, I am not naive enough to believe that Russia's \ndeteriorating infrastructure has eliminated the threat of their \nballistic missile capability. And given the missile technology advances \nin China, North Korea, and Iran, and attempts by rogue states to buy \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, it is imperative that we maintain \na deterrent to ward off this threat. There is still an important role \nfor strategic nuclear weapons in our arsenal. Their role, however, is \ndiminished dramatically from what it was in the past, and our missile \nprocurement decisions should reflect that change.\n  Mr. President, of our known potential adversaries, only Russia and \nChina even possess ballistic missile-capable submarines. China's one \nballistic missile capable submarine is used solely as a test platform. \nRussia is the only potential adversary with a credible SLBM force, and \nits submarine capabilities have deteriorated significantly or remain \nfar behind those of our Navy. Due to Russia's continued economic \nhardships, they continue to cede ground to us in technology and \ntraining. Reports even contend that Russia is having trouble keeping \njust one or two of its strategic nuclear submarines operational. \nAccording to General Eugene E. Habiger, USAF (Ret.) and former \ncommander in chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, Moscow's ``sub fleet \nis belly-up.''\n  Mr. President, Russia's submarine fleet has shrunk from more than 300 \nvessels to about 100. Even Russia's most modern submarines can't be \nused to full capability because Russia can't adequately train its \nsailors. Clearly, the threat is diminishing.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year, Admiral Jay Johnson, the Chief of \nNaval Operations, went before the Senate Armed Services Committee and \nstated unequivocally that the Pentagon believes that 14 Trident \nsubmarines is adequate to anchor the sea-based corner of the nuclear \ntriad. Based on that testimony, the committee put forward a Department \nof Defense authorization bill supporting the Navy's plan. Common sense \nwould dictate that fewer submarines warrant fewer missiles. The threat \nis diminishing; the Navy knows it and the Congress knows it.\n\n[[Page S9382]]\n\n  The Navy's plan, with the Senate's agreement, to downsize our Trident \nsubmarine fleet saves valuable resources and allows us to reach START \nII arms levels for our SLBMs, and moves us toward future arms reduction \ntreaties. By going with ten boats, the Navy could meet essential \nrequirements under START II today and the anticipated requirements \nunder a START III framework tomorrow.\n  And ultimately, Mr. President, the United States' leadership in \nreducing our nuclear stockpile shows our good faith, and will make \nRussia's passage of a START II treaty more likely.\n  This strategy of reducing our nuclear stockpile is supported widely \nby some of our foremost military leaders. General George Lee Butler, \nformer commander in chief of the U.S. Strategic Command, and an ardent \nadvocate of our deterrent force during the Cold War, has said that \n``With the end of the Cold War, these weapons are of sharply reduced \nutility, and there is much to be gained by substantially reducing their \nnumbers.'' I believe we should heed his words.\n  Mr. President, more than anything else, this issue comes down to a \nquestion of priorities. Do we want to spend $13 billion over the next \nten years to purchase unnecessary Trident II missiles, or do we want to \nuse that money to address readiness concerns that we've talked a lot \nabout but haven't addressed adequately?\n  Mr. President, for the past year, we've heard the call to address our \nmilitary's readiness crisis from virtually all quarters. We were told \nthat foremost among the readiness shortfalls were operations and \nmaintenance as well as pay and allowances accounts.\n  A preliminary General Accounting Office report on recruitment and \nretention found that issues like a lack of spare parts; concerns with \nthe health care system; increased deployments; and dissatisfaction with \nmilitary leaders have at least as much effect on retention, if not \nmore, than a pay raise.\n  And the Pentagon concurs. Last September, General Henry Shelton, \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs, stated that ``without relief, we will see \na continuation of the downward trends in readiness . . . and shortfalls \nin critical skills.'' Army Chief of Staff General Dennis Reimer claimed \nthat the military faces a ``hollow force'' without increased readiness \nspending. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jay Johnson asserted that \nthe Navy has a $6 billion readiness deficit.\n  To address the readiness shortfall, Mr. President, the Congress \npassed an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The bill spent \nclose to $9 billion, but just $1 billion of it went to address the \nreadiness shortfall. Priorities, Mr. President.\n  And last month, on the Defense appropriations bill, a couple of \nSenators inserted an amendment, without debate, to take $220 million \nfrom vital Army and Air Force spare parts and repair accounts, and from \nthe National Guard equipment account to buy planes. Planes that the \nPentagon doesn't even want. Sponsors of the amendment admitted readily \nthat this was done for the benefit of a company that had lost a multi-\nbillion dollar contract with a foreign country. Priorities, Mr. \nPresident.\n  This bill makes sense now and for the future by saving vital defense \ndollars now and for years to come, and by stimulating the arms treaty \ndialogue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1439\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to promote economic growth and opportunity by \nincreasing the level of visas available for highly specialized \nscientists and engineers and by eliminating the earnings penalty on \nsenior citizens who continue to work after reaching retirement age; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  new workers for economic growth act\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Lott and \nMcConnell in introducing the New Workers for Economic Growth Act, which \nwill increase the number of H-1B temporary work visas used by U.S. \ncompanies to recruit and hire foreign workers with very specialized \nskills, particularly in high technology fields. In addition, the \nlegislation eliminates the reduction in Social Security benefits now \nimposed on individuals aged 65 through 69 who continue to work and \nwhose earnings exceed $15,500 annually. This bill will ensure that the \nU.S. economic expansion will not be impeded by a lack of skilled \nworkers.\n  With record low unemployment, many U.S. companies have been forced to \nslow their expansion, or cancel projects, and may be forced to move \ntheir operations overseas because of an inability to find qualified \nindividuals to fill job vacancies. We will achieve our full economic \npotential only if we ensure that high-technology companies can find and \nhire the people whose unique qualifications and specialized skills are \ncritical to America's future success.\n  Last year, the Congress increased temporarily the number of annual H-\n1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000 for Fiscal Years 1999 and 2000, and to \n107,500 in 2001. The number of H-1B visas is scheduled to drop back to \n65,000 for Fiscal Year 2002 and subsequent years. The New Workers for \nEconomic Growth Act will increase the H-1B visa cap to 200,000 for \nFiscal Years 2000, 2001 and 2002. By the end of that period, we will \nhave the data we need to make an informed decision on the number of \nsuch visas required beyond 2002. The bill retains the language of \ncurrent law which protects qualified U.S. workers from being displaced \nby H-1B visa holders.\n  According to a recent study by the American Electronics Association \n(AEA), Texas has the fastest growing high technology industry in the \ncountry and is second only to California in the number of high \ntechnology workers. This legislation will ensure that these companies \nhave access to highly skilled, specialized workers, in order that such \nbusinesses can continue to grow and prosper, and in doing so, create \njobs and opportunity for U.S. workers.\n  Additionally, our bill expands work opportunities for America's \nretired senior citizens by removing the financial penalty which is now \nimposed on those who choose to continue to work while receiving Social \nSecurity and whose wages exceed specified levels. The Social Security \nearnings test robs senior citizens of their money, their dignity, and \ntheir right to work, and it robs our Nation of their talent and wisdom. \nI believe that this legislation represents a fair and effective way to \naddress a critical need in our Nation's economy, and I hope my \ncolleagues will quickly approve this important proposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, Mr. Robb, \n        and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1441. A bill to amend chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States \nCode, to modify employee contributions to the Civil Service Retirement \nSystem and the Federal Employees Retirement System to the percentages \nin effect before the statutory temporary increase in calendar year \n1999, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n         federal employee retirement contributions act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Mikulski, Warner, Robb and Akaka, in introducing the Federal \nEmployee Retirement Contributions Act of 1999. This bill would return \nFederal employee retirement contribution rates to their 1998 levels, \neffective January 1st, 2000.\n\n[[Page S9383]]\n\n  Mr. President, in the 1997 Budget Reconciliation bill, as part of the \ndeficit reduction effort, Congress enacted temporary increases in \nFederal employee retirement contribution rates. In order to meet its \nfiscal year 1998 reconciliation instructions, the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee reluctantly agreed to phased-in, temporary increases in \nemployee retirement payments of .5 percent through December 31, 2002.\n  The 1997 provision effectively takes retirement contribution rates \nunder the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) from 7 percent to 7.5 \npercent and under the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) from .8 \npercent to 1.3 percent. Rates are to return to 7 percent and .8 percent \nrespectively in 2003.\n  Mr. President, the sole rationale for this additional tax on Federal \nemployee income in 1997 was to achieve deficit reduction. It is \nimportant to point out that Federal employees received no additional \nbenefits from their increased contributions. Thus, the size of a \nFederal employee's retirement annuity is not greater because of their \nincreased contributions. Instead, these contribution increases were \nmerely one of several measures included in the Balanced Budget Act in \norder to raise revenues and reduce the deficit.\n  The goal of deficit reduction is being realized, and after 30 years \nof spiraling deficits the economy is now strong and the budget has been \nbalanced. With budget surpluses projected for the near future, the \nrationale for increasing Federal employees' retirement contribution is \nno longer valid.\n  During the past weeks as tax cut proposals have begun moving in the \nSenate, I have worked to repeal the increased contributions as part of \nthese proposals. While the Majority's tax cut packages would grant \nbillions of dollars in tax relief over the next ten years, and even \nmore in future years, the bill proposals fail to remove the burden that \nwas placed on Federal employees under the Balanced Budget Act.\n  Mr. President, if we are going to move forward with tax reduction \nproposals, it is my strong view that we should first make certain that \nFederal employees, who were singled out to bear an additional burden in \nthe deficit reduction effort, are relieved of that burden. Federal \nemployees should not be forced to continue to contribute more than \ntheir fair share, at a time when others are having their taxes reduced.\n  As of January 1, 1999, half of the .5 percent increase (.25 percent) \nhas already taken effect. Unless action is taken, an additional .15 \npercent will be deducted from Federal employees' salaries for their \nretirement on January 1, 2000, followed by .10 percent more in 2001. In \nthese times of strong economic growth, Federal workers should no longer \nbe required to carry this additional burden.\n  Federal employees were asked to make numerous sacrifices in order to \ncontribute to our Nation's fiscal health. In addition to the increase \nin retirement contributions, the Federal Government has cut \napproximately 330,000 employees from its rolls and delayed statutory \npay raises over the last several years. Certainly, these were \nsubstantial contributions to our country's economy and have helped us \nturn the corner toward the bright economic future that is now \npredicted. As we consider how to best utilize projected budget \nsurpluses, we should first remove this burden from Federal employees \nwho have already contributed so much. Repealing the increases in \nFederal employee retirement contributions is the fair thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1441\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the professional development of \nelementary and secondary school teachers; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  professional development reform act\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Professional \nDevelopment Reform Act to strengthen and improve professional \ndevelopment for teachers and administrators.\n  I have long worked to improve the quality of teaching in America's \nclassrooms for the simple reason that well-trained and well-prepared \nteachers are central to improving the academic performance and \nachievement of students.\n  Last Congress, I introduced the TEACH Act to reform the way our \nprospective teachers are trained. The TEACH Act sought to foster \npartnerships among teacher colleges, schools of arts and sciences, and \nelementary and secondary schools.\n  Such partnerships were a central recommendation of the National \nCommission on Teaching and America's Future to reform teacher training, \nand I was pleased that my legislation was included in the renewed \nteacher training title of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998.\n  As Congress turns to the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, the focus shifts to new teachers and teachers \nalready in the classroom.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today would reform \nprofessional development, which too often consists of fragmented, one-\nshot workshops, at which teachers passively listen to experts and are \nisolated from the practice of teaching.\n  We don't expect students to learn their ``ABCs'' after one day of \nlessons, and we shouldn't expect a one-day professional development \nworkshop to yield the desired result.\n  Research shows that such professional development fails to improve or \neven impact teaching practice.\n  Moreover, a recent survey of teachers found that professional \ndevelopment is too short term and lacks intensity. In 1998, \nparticipation in professional development programs typically lasted \nfrom 1 to 8 hours--the equivalent of only a day or less.\n  As a consequence, only about 1 in 5 teachers felt very well prepared \nfor addressing the needs of students with\n\n[[Page S9385]]\n\nlimited English proficiency, those from culturally diverse backgrounds, \nand those with disabilities, or integrating educational technology into \nthe curriculum.\n  Instead, research shows that effective professional development \napproaches are sustained, intensive activities that focus on deepening \nteachers knowledge of content; allow teachers to work collaboratively; \nprovide opportunities for teachers to practice and reflect upon their \nteaching; are aligned with standards and embedded in the daily work of \nthe school; and involve parents and other community members.\n  Such high-quality professional development improves student \nachievement. Indeed, a 1998 study in California found that the more \nteachers were engaged in ongoing, curriculum-centered professional \ndevelopment, holding school conditions and student characteristics \nconstant, the higher their students' mathematics achievement on the \nstate's assessment.\n  Community School District 2 in New York City is one district which \nhas seen its investment in sustained, intensive professional \ndevelopment pay off with increases in student achievement. Professional \ndevelopment in District 2 is delivered in schools and classrooms and \nfocused on system-wide instructional improvement, with intensive \nactivities such as observation of exemplary teachers and classrooms \nboth inside and outside the district, supervised practice, peer \nnetworks, and offsite training opportunities.\n  Unfortunately, a recent national evaluation of the Eisenhower \nProfessional Development program found that the majority of \nprofessional development activities in the six districts studied did \nnot follow such a sustained and intensive approach.\n  And, in a recent article in the Providence Journal, some teachers \nnoted that professional development for them has revolved around \nsitting and listening to experts talk about standards, rather than \nworking closely with teachers and students to refine new methods of \nteaching those standards.\n  Unlike the bill passed last week in the other body which would do \nlittle to address these issues or change professional development, my \nlegislation would create a new formula program for professional \ndevelopment that is sustained, collaborative, content-centered, \nembedded in the daily work of the school, and aligned with standards \nand school reform efforts.\n  To achieve this enhanced professional development, the legislation \nfunds the following activities: mentoring; peer observation and \ncoaching; curriculum-based content training; dedicated time for \ncollaborative lesson planning; opportunities for teachers to visit \nother classrooms to model effective teaching practice; training on \nintegrating technology into the curriculum, addressing the specific \nneeds of diverse students, and involving parents; professional \ndevelopment networks to provide a forum for interaction and exchange of \ninformation among teachers and administrators; and release time and \ncompensation for mentors and substitute teachers to make these \nactivities possible.\n  The Professional Development Reform Act also requires partnerships \nbetween elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher \neducation for providing training opportunities, including advanced \ncontent area courses and training to address teacher shortages. In \nfact, preliminary U.S. Department of Education data show that the \nEisenhower Professional Development activities sponsored by \ninstitutions of higher education are most effective.\n  My legislation will also provide funding for skills and leadership \ntraining for principals and superintendents, as well as mentors. \nIndeed, ensuring that our principals have the training and support to \nserve as instructional leaders is critical, as is ensuring that mentors \nhave the skills necessary to help our newest teachers and other \nteachers who need assistance in the classroom.\n  Funding is targeted to Title I schools with the highest percentages \nof students living in poverty, where improvements in professional \ndevelopment are needed most.\n  My legislation does not eliminate the Eisenhower program, but it does \nrequire that Eisenhower and other federal, state, and local \nprofessional development funds be coordinated and used in the manner \ndescribed in our bill--on professional development activities that \nresearch shows works.\n  In addition, the Professional Development Reform Act offers resources \nbut it demands results. Strong accountability provisions require that \nschool districts and schools which receive funding actually improve \nstudent performance and increase participation in sustained \nprofessional development in three years in order to secure additional \nfunding.\n  In sum, my legislation seeks to ensure that new teachers have the \nsupport they need to be successful teachers, that all teachers have \naccess to high quality professional development regardless of the \ncontent areas they teach, and that the professional development does \nnot isolate teachers, but rather is part of a coordinated and \ncomprehensive strategy aligned with standards.\n  Not only does the research bear this out as the way to improve \nteaching practice and student learning, but education leaders in my \nhome state of Rhode Island, as well as witnesses at a recent Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee hearing stressed the \nimportance of this type of professional development.\n  Mr. President, the time for action is now as schools must hire an \nestimated 2.2 million new teachers over the next decade due to \nincreasing enrollments, the retirement of approximately half of our \ncurrent teaching force, and high attrition rates.\n  Ensuring that teachers have the training, assistance, and support to \nincrease student achievement and sustain them throughout their careers \nis a great challenge. But we must meet and overcome this challenge if \nwe are to reform education and prepare our children for the 21st \nCentury.\n  The Professional Development Reform Act, by increasing our \nprofessional development investment and focusing it on the kind of \nactivities and opportunities for teachers and administrators that \nresearch shows is effective, is critical to this effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this essential endeavor by \ncosponsoring this legislation and working for its inclusion in the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1442\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 10102 of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1995 regarding elementary school and \nsecondary school counseling; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n   ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL COUNSELING IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr President, in April, the nation was rocked by an \nunspeakable act of violence at Columbine High School in Littleton, \nColorado. Twelve innocent students, a heroic teacher and the two \nstudent gunmen were killed in the 8th deadly school shooting in 39 \nmonths.\n  Since that tragic incident, there has been a nation wide discussion \non the causes of such violence and a search for solutions to prevent \nsuch occurrences in the future. I would like to take a few moments to \ndiscuss one innovative program that can help us prevent violent acts \nfrom happening in the first place.\n  Mr. President, children today are subjected to unprecedented social \nstresses, including the fragmentation of the family, drug and alcohol \nabuse, violence, child abuse and poverty. In 1988, the Des Moines \nIndependent School District recognized the situation confronting young \nstudents and expanded counseling services in elementary schools.\n  The expanded counseling program-- Smoother Sailing operates on the \nsimple premise that we must get to kids early to prevent problems \nrather than waiting for a crisis. As a result, the district more than \ntripled the number of elementary school counselors to make sure that at \nleast one well-trained professional is available in every single \nelementary school building.\n  Smoother Sailing began as a pilot program in 10 elementary schools. \nThe program increased the number of counselors in the elementary \nschools so there is one counselor for every 250 students--the ratio \nrecommended for an effective program. The participating schools began \nseeing many positive changes.\n  After two years, the schools participating in Smoother Sailing saw a \ndramatic reduction in the number of students referred to the office for \ndisciplinary reasons.\n  During the 1987-88 school year, 157 students were referred to the \noffice for disciplinary action. After two years of Smoother Sailing, \nthe number of office referrals in those schools dropped to 83--a 47% \nreduction in office referrals.\n  During the same period, Des Moines elementary schools with a \ntraditional crisis intervention counseling program had only a 21% \nreduction in office referrals.\n  There were other changes as well. Teachers in Smoother Sailing \nschools reported fewer classroom disturbances and principals noticed \nfewer fights in the cafeteria and on the playground. The schools and \nclassrooms had become more disciplined learning environments. It was \nclear that Smoother Sailing was making a difference so the counseling \nprogram was expanded to all 42 elementary schools in Des Moines in \n1990.\n  Smoother Sailing continues to be a success.\n  Smoother Sailing helps students solve problems in a positive manner. \nAssessments of 4th and 5th grade students show that students can \ngenerate more than one solution to a problem. Further, the types of \nsolutions were positive and proactive. We know that the ability to \neffectively solve problems is essential for helping students make the \nright decisions when confronted with violence or drugs.\n  Smoother Sailing gets high marks in surveys of administrators, \nteachers and parents. They report a high degree of satisfaction with \nthe program.\n  Ninety-five percent of parents surveyed said the counselor is a \nvaluable part of my child's educational development. Ninety-three \npercent said they would seek assistance from the counselor if the child \nwas experiencing difficulties at school.\n  Administrators credit Smoother Sailing with decreasing the number of \nstudent suspensions and referrals to the office for disciplinary \naction. In addition, principals report that the program is responsible \nfor creating an atmosphere that is conducive to learning.\n  Experts tell us that to be effective, there should be at least one \ncounselor for every 250 students. Unfortunately, the current \nstudent:counselor ratio is more than double the recommended level--it \nis 531:1. That means counselors are stretched to the limit and cannot \ndevote the kind of attention to children that is needed.\n  In most schools, the majority of counselors are employed at the \nmiddle and secondary levels. Therefore, the situation is more acute in \nelementary schools where the student to counselor ratio is greater than \n1000:1.\n  Mr. President, Smoother Sailing was the model for the Elementary \nSchool Counseling Demonstration Act, a section of the Elementary and \nSecondary School Act.\n  Today, along with Senators Lincoln and Wellstone, I am introducing \nthe Elementary and Secondary School Counseling Improvement Act of 1999. \nThis legislation does three things.\n  First, it reauthorizes the Elementary School Counseling Demonstration \nAct and expands services to secondary schools.\n  Second, it authorizes $100 million in funding to hire school \ncounselors, school psychologists and school social workers.\n  Finally, since the counselor shortage is particularly acute in \nelementary schools, the amendment requires that the first $60 million \nappropriated would go to provide grants for elementary schools.\n  Mr. President, CNN and USA Today recently conducted a public opinion \npoll of Americans. They asked what would make a difference in \npreventing a future outbreak of violence in our nation's schools.\n  The leading response was to restrict access to firearms. The second \nmost popular response--a response selected by 60% of those polled--was \nto increase the number of counselors in our nation's schools.\n  We should heed the advice of the American people. We have a desperate\n\n[[Page S9388]]\n\nneed to improve counseling services in our nation's schools and this \nlegislation will be an important step in addressing this critical \nissue. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  This legislation is supported by several organizations--the American \nCounseling Association, the American School Counseling Association, the \nAmerican Psychological Association, the National Association of School \nPsychologists, the School of Social Work Association of America and the \nNational Association of Social Workers. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 26, 1999.\n       Dear Senator. We are writing to urge your support of the \n     ``Elementary and Secondary Counseling Improvement Act'' \n     introduced by Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA). The Act would \n     increase and expand access to much needed counseling and \n     mental health services for children in our nation's \n     elementary and secondary schools.\n       According to the National Institute of Mental Health \n     (NIMH), although 7.5 million children under the age of 18 \n     require mental health services, only one in five receive \n     them. As the tragedy of this year's school shootings remind \n     us, students have mental, emotional, and behavioral needs \n     which require the services of qualified counseling \n     professionals. Additionally, counseling and mental health \n     services are essential to help teachers provide quality \n     instruction and enable students to achieve to high academic \n     standards.\n       Unfortunately, in schools across the nation, the supply of \n     qualified school counselors, school psychologists and school \n     social workers is scarce. The U.S. average student-to-\n     counselor ratio is 513:1. In states like California and \n     Minnesota, one counselor serves more than 1,000 students, and \n     in other states, one school psychologist serves as many as \n     2,300 students. Similar caseloads exist for school social \n     workers; in one county in Georgia, one school social worker \n     is responsible for over 4,000 students. These ratios make it \n     nearly impossible for students to get the counseling and \n     mental health services they need. This serious shortage of \n     qualified professionals has undermined efforts to make \n     schools safe, improve academic achievement, and has overly \n     burdened teachers.\n       High caseloads are not the only obstacle facing a student \n     in need of help. School counselors, school psychologists, and \n     school social workers are often charged with miscellaneous \n     administrative or paperwork duties, and may spend almost a \n     quarter of their time on these tasks. Providers need to be \n     able to provide direct services to student, teachers, \n     families, and staff in schools.\n       The Elementary School Counseling Demonstration Act (ESCD) \n     was first enacted with bi-partisan support as part of the \n     Improving America's Schools Act in 1994. The Act provided \n     counseling services through qualified school counselors, \n     school psychologists, and school social workers. Senator \n     Harkin's ``Elementary and Secondary Counseling Improvement \n     Act'' would reauthorize the Elementary School Counseling \n     Demonstration, and expand services to secondary schools.\n       The Elementary and Secondary Counseling Improvement Act \n     would provide funding to schools to expand counseling \n     programs and services provided by only hiring qualified \n     school counselors, school psychologists, and social workers. \n     The Act ensures that programs funded will be comprehensive \n     and accountable by requiring that applicants:\n       Design the program to be developmental and preventative; \n     Provide in-service training for school counselors, school \n     psychologists, and school social workers; Convene an advisory \n     board composed of parents, counseling professionals, \n     teachers, school administrators, and community leaders to \n     oversee the design and implementation of the program; and \n     Require that counseling professionals spend at least 85% of \n     their work time providing direct services to students and no \n     more than 15% on administrative tasks.\n       We urge you to support Senator Harkin's Elementary and \n     Secondary Counseling Improvement Act.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Counseling Association (AA).\n       American Psychological Association (APA).\n       National Association of School Psychologists (NASP).\n       National Association of Social Workers (NASW).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1444. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \neliminate the 60-month limit and increase the income limitation on the \nstudent loan interest deduction; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            Expansion of the Student Loan Interest Deduction\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am joined today by Senator Burns \nintroducing legislation to expand the student loan interest deduction. \nSpecifically, my bill will repeal the sixty-month payment limitation \nand increase the income levels qualifying students for the tax \ndeduction for student loan interest. I previously presented the \nelimination of the sixty-month student loan deductibility restriction \nin a bill in February. As a member of the Finance Committee, I have \nasked that both it and the income limit expansion I now propose be \nincluded in the Reconciliation bill that will be before the Senate this \nweek. I am happy to report that both are in the committee reported \nbill.\n  In a move detrimental to the education of our nation's students, the \nTax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated the tax deduction for student loan \ninterest. Deeply troubled that this important relief was no longer \navailable to young women and men trying to start their careers, since \n1987 my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and I have sought to ease \nthe heavy burden of paying back student loans by reinstating the tax \ndeduction. In 1992, we succeeded in passing legislation to restore the \ndeduction for student loan interest, only to be stymied by a veto as \npart of a larger bill with tax increases. After ten arduous years, our \npersistent work on behalf of America's students finally came to \nfruition when we succeeded in reinstating the deduction under the \nTaxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Our victory demonstrated Congress' sincere \ncommitment to making educational opportunities available to all \nstudents and families across the nation, and confirmed our willingness \nto assist young Americans in acquiring the best education possible by \neasing the financial hardship they face.\n  While our endeavors in 1997 were progressive, we were unable to go as \nfar as we wanted to go due to financial constraints. Because the nation \nwas still in a fiscal crisis at that time, we were compelled to limit \nthe deductibility of student loan interest to sixty payments, and to \nonly those taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of between $40,000 \nand $55,000 filing individually or between $60,000 and $75,000 for \nmarried couples. Additionally, the deduction itself was phased in at \n$1000, and will cap out at $2500 in 2002.\n  In keeping the income limits for the deduction at such low income \nlevels, we are letting a great opportunity to assist more young \nAmericans pass us by. Setting the income cap at the current low mark \ndoes a disservice to some of our nation's most needy collegiate \nborrowers. A great number of students are forced to borrow heavily to \nacquire an education that will allow them to stay competitive in our \nglobal economy. The present income restriction punishes resourceful \nstudents who land jobs which pay salaries slightly above the meager \ncap, even though they may have been forced to borrow heavily to obtain \ntheir education due to limited means.\n  Currently, the deductibility of student loan interest is limited to a \nmere sixty loan payments, equivalent to five years plus time spent in \nforbearance or deferment. This payment limitation, like the income \nrestriction, was put in place during our fiscal difficulties of 1997. \nSince we are now experiencing a great budget surplus with our booming \neconomy, Congress now has the ability to expand on both of these areas \nwhere previously we were forced to scale back. As mentioned, I already \nintroduced a bill, S. 471, that would eliminate the 60-month limit on \nstudent loan interest reductions.\n  Fortunately, our situation today is quite different than when we made \nour original improvements in 1997. Now, with our robust economy and \nbudget surplus, we have a splendid opportunity to do what we were \nunable to do before. As the price of going to college has continued to \nspiral upward, student debt has risen to appalling levels. We must not \nshrink from our responsibility to provide additional relief to our \nstudents. We should repeal the sixty-month payment limitation. We \nshould increase the income levels from $40,000 to $50,000 for single \nstudents, and, eliminating any marriage penalty, increase from $60,000 \nto $100,000 for married couples. The amount of the deduction would then \nbe gradually phased out for taxpayers with incomes between $50,000 and \n$65,000 filing individually and between $100,000 and $115,000 for \nmarried couples. Let our actions clearly demonstrate that the United \nStates Congress stands behind\n\n[[Page S9389]]\n\nall of our nation's students in their efforts to better their lives.\n  By expanding the student loan interest deduction, we will bring vital \nrelief to some of our most deserving borrowers seeking the American \ndream. Rather than penalizing resourceful students who find jobs with \nincomes above the present cap, we will be rewarding the hard work and \ningenuity of our students. We must continue to support young Americans \nwho land jobs with salaries slightly above our current threshold yet \nstill needing financial assistance.\n  Excessive student debt is a major problem for many students. As \npeople in a position to help them, Congress must seek out more ways to \nbe of service to our young people. In this time of economic plenty, it \nis our duty to invest in our students' education, for to do so is an \ninvestment in America's future. A well-deducted workforce is vital to \nmaintain competitiveness in an ever-changing global economy. By \nbroadening the income limits to receive the tax deduction for student \nloan interest, we demonstrate our commitment to education and \nmaintaining the position of the United States at the pinnacle of the \nfree world.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to relieve the \nexcessive burdens on those trying to better themselves and their \nfamilies through education by loosening the income limits to quality \nfor the tax deduction for student loan interest payments and \neliminating the sixty-month payment limitation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mr. REID):\n  S. 1445. A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to prevent abuse of recipients of long-term care services under the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      patient abuse prevention act\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Patient \nAbuse Prevention Act. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by \nSenator Reid, who has worked tirelessly with me on this important \nlegislation.\n  This bill is the product of collaboration and input from the \nadministration, the health care industry, patient and employee \nadvocates--who all have the same goal I do: protecting patients in \nlong-term care from abuse, neglect, and mistreatment.\n  Last fall, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of \nInspector General issued a report describing how easy it is for people \nwith abusive and criminal backgrounds to find work in nursing homes. On \nSeptember 14 of last year, the Senate Aging Committee held hearings on \nthis disturbing problem, where we heard horrifying stories of elderly \npatients being abused by the very people who are charged with their \ncare. While the vast majority of nursing home workers are dedicated and \nprofessional, even one instance of abuse is inexcusable. This should \nnot be happening in a single nursing home in America.\n  Mr. President, it is estimated that more than 43 percent of Americans \nover the age of 65 will likely spend time in a nursing home. The number \nof people needing long-term care services will continue to increase as \nthe Baby Boom generation ages. The vast majority of nursing homes, home \nhealth agencies and hospices do an excellent job in caring for their \npatients. But it only takes a few abusive staff to cast a dark shadow \nover what should be a healing environment.\n  A disturbing number of cases have been reported where workers with \ncriminal backgrounds have been cleared to work in direct patient care, \nand have subsequently abused patients in their care. In 1997, the \nMilwaukee Journal-Sentinel ran a series of articles describing this \nproblem, which led my home State of Wisconsin to pass a criminal \nbackground check law for health care workers. The legislation I \nintroduce today follows their example and builds on their efforts.\n  Why is it necessary to act? Because it is just far too easy for a \nworker with a history of abuse to find employment and prey on the most \nvulnerable patients. The OIG report found that 5 percent of nursing \nhome employees in two States had prior criminal records. The OIG also \nfound that between 15-20 percent of those convicted of patient abuse \nhad prior criminal records. It is just too easy for known abusers to \nfind work in health care and continue to prey on patients.\n  Current state and national safeguards are inadequate to screen out \nabusive workers. All States are required to maintain registries of \nabusive nurse aides. But nurse aids are not the only workers involved \nin abuse, and other workers are not tracked at all. Even worse, there \nis no system to coordinate information about abusive nurse aides \nbetween States. A known abuser in Iowa would have little trouble moving \nto Wisconsin and continuing to work with patients there.\n  In addition, there is no Federal requirement that long-term care \nfacilities conduct criminal background checks on prospective employees. \nPeople with violent criminal backgrounds--people who have already been \nconvicted of murder, rape, and assault--could easily get a job in a \nnursing home or other health care setting without their past ever being \ndiscovered.\n  Our legislative will go a long way toward solving this problem. \nFirst, it will create a National Registry of abusive long-term care \nemployees. States will be required to submit information from their \ncurrent State registries to the National Registry. Facilities will be \nrequired to check the National Registry before hiring a prospective \nworker. Any worker with a substantiated finding of patient abuse will \nbe prohibited from working in long-term care.\n  Second, the bill provides a second line of defense to protect \npatients from violent criminals. If the National Registry does not \ncontain information about a prospective worker, the facility is then \nrequired to initiate an FBI background check. Any conviction for \npatient abuse or a relevant violent crime would bar that applicant from \nworking with patients.\n  I realize that this legislation will not solve all instances of \nabuse. We still need to do more to stop abuse from occurring in the \nfirst place. But this bill will ensure that those who have already \nabused an elderly or disabled patient, and those who have committed \nviolent crimes against people in the past, are kept away from \nvulnerable patients.\n  Mr. President, I want to repeat that I strongly believe that most \nlong-term care providers and their staff work hard to deliver the \nhighest quality care. However, it is imperative that Congress act \nimmediately to get rid of those that don't. When a patient checks into \na nursing home or hospice, or receives home health care, they should \nnot have to give up their right to be free from abuse, neglect, or \nmistreatment.\n  Our nation's seniors made our country what it is today. It is our \nobligation to make sure we treat them with the dignity, care, and \nrespect they deserve. I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues, the administration, and the health care industry in this \neffort to protect patients. Our nation's seniors and disabled deserve \nnothing less than our full attention.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record. I also ask unanimous consent that a letter of support for \nthis legislation from the National Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home \nReform be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1445\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Herbert Kohl,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kohl: The National Citizens' Coalition for \n     Nursing Home Reform (NCCNHR) commends you and your staff for \n     your initiative in seeking to improve care and conditions in \n     long-term care facilities. NCCNHR is a non-profit consumer \n     organization whose mission is to improve the quality of care \n     and life for long term care residents. Our organization \n     represents residents and their advocates. We work closely \n     with the nation's long-term care ombudsmen and house the \n     National Long Term Care Ombudsman Resource Center.\n       We strongly support your proposed legislation cited as the \n     Patient Abuse Prevention Act, which would require criminal \n     background checks for nursing home workers. This legislation \n     would provide residents protection from individuals with a \n     history of committing crimes against residents. It would also \n     create a much needed National Registry for long-term care \n     employees with a history of abuse, to be used by nursing \n     homes hiring employees for their facilities.\n       In particular, NCCNHR applauds your revisions to last \n     year's bill, the ``Long-Term Care Patient Protection Act of \n     1998'' to include (1) a requirement that criminal background \n     checks of employees will be conducted in all facilities \n     (including specifically, nursing homes, home health, and \n     hospices); (2) that applicants may not be charged for the \n     costs of the checks; (3) that applicants who challenge the \n     accuracy of the background check will also be able to appeal \n     the decision and (4) that there is no longer a prohibition on \n     Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for the costs of \n     conducting background checks.\n       We strongly urge, however, that the legislation also expand \n     its language to provide criminal background checks on all \n     long-term care workers and not just employees who have direct \n     access to residents. Considering the vulnerability of long-\n     term care residents, criminal background checks should be \n     conducted on all workers, including contract workers, in all \n     health care settings, including home care, and assisted \n     living.\n       Again, NCCNHR congratulates you, Senator Kohl, on your \n     persistence and foresight. If you need further information, \n     contact me or Ana Rivas-Beck, J.D., Law and Policy \n     Specialist.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Elma Holder,\n                                                          Founder.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nKohl, in introducing the ``Patient Abuse Prevention Act.'' This \nlegislation would help protect our nation's most vulnerable citizens by \nkeeping workers with criminal and abusive backgrounds out of our long-\nterm care facilities.\n  It is simply too easy for workers with criminal or abusive histories \nto gain employment in long-term care facilities. A report released last \nyear by the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health \nand Human Services (HHS) confirmed that current regulations were not \nsufficient to protect the frail and elderly from being placed in the \nhands of known abusers and criminals. If we do not take steps to keep \nworkers with criminal and abusive backgrounds out of our long-term care \nfacilities, the growing number of reports of abuse and theft in these \nfacilities will only continue to increase.\n  The ``Patient Abuse Prevention Act'' would give employers the tools \nthey need to weed out potential employees who are unfit to provide care \nto the elderly because of abusive or criminal backgrounds. Our bill \nwould create a national registry of abusive workers within an existing \ndatabase at HHS. It would also expand existing State nurse aide \nregistries to include substantiated findings of abuse by all facility \nemployees, not just nurse aides. States would submit any existing or \nnewly acquired information contained in the State registries to the \nnational registry. This would ensure that once an employee is added to \nthe national registry, the offender will not be able to simply cross \nstate lines and find employment in another facility where he may \ncontinue to prey on the frail and elderly.\n  Our bill would require all long-term care facilities to initiate a \nsearch of the national registry of abusive workers when considering a \npotential employee. If the prospective employee is not listed on the \nregistry, the facility would then conduct a State and national criminal \nbackground check on the individual through the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigations.\n  The Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services \nreports that 46 percent of facilities believe that incidents of abuse \nare under-reported. Our bill would require long-term care facilities to \nreport all instances of resident neglect, abuse, or theft by an \nemployee to the State. This would ensure that offenders are reported \nand added to the national registry before they have the opportunity to \nstrike again.\n  Over the past few years, Senator Kohl and I have worked to ensure \nthat our frail and elderly are not placed in the hands of criminals. \nDuring the 105th Congress, we introduced similar legislation and \nconducted hearings through the Senate Special Committee on Aging. This \nbill is a culmination of our efforts to institute greater protections \nfor all residents of long-term care facilities.\n  One of the most difficult times for any individual or family is when \nthey must make the decision to rely upon the support and services of a \nlong-term care facility. Families should not have to live with the fear \nthat their loved one is being left in the hands of a criminal. Last \nyear, Richard Meyer testified before the Senate Aging Committee about \nthe sexual assault of his 92-year-old mother by a male certified \nnursing assistant who had previously been charged and convicted for \nsexually assaulting a young girl. This legislation would prevent \ntragedies like this one from occurring in the future.\n  I have visited countless long-term care facilities in my home state \nof Nevada. During these visits, I have always been impressed by the \ncompassion and dedication of the staff. Most nurse aides and health \ncare workers are professional, honest, and dedicated. Unfortunately, it \nonly takes one abusive staff member to terrorize the lives of the \nresidents. That is why we must work to weed out the ``bad apples'' who \ndo not have the best interest of the residents in mind. I urge you to \njoin Senator Kohl and me in our efforts to provide greater protections \nfor all residents of long-term care facilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT:\n  S. 1446. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nan additional advance refunding of bonds originally issued to finance \ngovernmental facilities used for essential governmental functions; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  state and local government essential services financing legislation\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp state and local governments more effectively finance the cost of \nessential services such as schools, streets, and water and sewer \nsystems.\n  By easing tax law restrictions on the refinancing of certain bonds, \nthis proposal would allow local jurisdictions to take advantage of \nfavorable market interest rates. Financing the essential projects of \nour communities is primarily a state and local government \nresponsibility. Federal tax laws should make it easier--not more \ndifficult--for them to lessen the burden of taxes and other \ngovernmental charges on our citizens.\n  The proposal would adjust tax law restrictions on the refinancing of \ncertain bonds issued to provide services such as government-owned \nschools, hospitals, streets and water and sewer systems.\n  Under current tax rules, most state and local governments may \nundertake an advance refunding of bonded indebtedness only one time and \nare thus unable to take full advantage of periods when market interest \nrates are low.\n\n[[Page S9394]]\n\nThis legislation would allow every state and local government an \nadditional opportunity to refinance bonded indebtedness issued to \nfinance essential governmental projects.\n  Furthermore, this legislation would give state and local governments \nflexibility skin to that of a homeowner who refinances a mortgage to \nreduce monthly payments and thereby increase income. The federal \ngovernment should not expect state and local governments to shoulder \nthe burden of financing local infrastructure, and then deny them the \nflexibility to handle their own affairs in the most efficient and cost-\neffective manner. The change will help continue shifting power and \ncontrol to local government where it belongs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1446\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITIONAL ADVANCE REFUNDINGS OF CERTAIN \n                   GOVERNMENTAL BONDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 149(d)(3)(A)(i) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to advance refundings of other \n     bonds) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``or'' at the end of subclause (I),\n       (2) by adding ``or'' at the end of subclause (II), and\n       (3) by inserting after subclause (II) the following:\n\n       ``(III) the 2nd advance refunding of the original bond if \n     the original bond was issued after 1985 or the 3rd advance \n     refunding of the original bond if the original bond was \n     issued before 1986, if, in either case, the original bond was \n     issued as part of an issue 90 percent or more of the net \n     proceeds of which were used to finance governmental \n     facilities used for 1 or more essential governmental \n     functions (within the meaning of section 141(c)(2)),''.\n\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to refunding bonds issued on or after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url":

Res. 164\n\n       Whereas the Black Bears of the University of Maine defeated \n     the Wildcats of the University of New Hampshire by a score of \n     3 to 2 in overtime in Anaheim, California, on April 3, 1999, \n     to win the 1999 NCAA hockey championship;\n       Whereas the Maine Black Bears finished their season with an \n     impressive record of 31-6-4, losing only 1 game at home;\n       Whereas the Maine Black Bears have brought the NCAA hockey \n     championship home to Maine for the 2d time this decade;\n       Whereas the Maine Black Bears coaching staff and players \n     displayed outstanding dedication, teamwork, and sportsmanship \n     throughout the season to achieve collegiate hockey's highest \n     honor; and\n       Whereas the Maine Black Bears have brought pride and honor \n     to the State of Maine: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates the Black Bears of \n     the University of Maine for winning the 1999 NCAA hockey \n     championship.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to the president of the University of \n     Maine.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nUniversity of Maine Black Bear hockey team--winner of the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association Division I hockey championship for the \nsecond time this decade.\n\n[[Page S9396]]\n\n  Mr. President, collegiate athletics have been an important part of \nthe educational experience for generations. As an adjunct to academics, \ncollegiate sports at their best teach the values of teamwork, the \nvirtues of good sportsmanship, the lessons of disappointment, and the \njoys of personal as well as collective achievement.\n  Collegiate sports also bring communities and, often, entire states \ntogether. In Maine, there are few places charged with the level of \nexcitement and comradery you'll find in Orono's Alfond Arena, where the \naction is close, the play intense, and the pride palpable.\n  But you don't need to be at the Alfond to feel the excitement. All \nOver Maine, families gather to watch their team and cheer ``Go Blue''--\nfrom Fort Kent to Calais to Cumberland to Kittery.\n  And this year especially, the Black Bears gave us a lot to cheer \nabout. With a 31, 6 and 4 record, the 1998-1999 Maine Black Bears \nhockey team clearly played to win--and achieved that goal with \nremarkable regularity. And with only one loss coming at home, the Black \nBears at Alfond were almost as sure a thing as snow in January.\n  In the playoffs--which included three New England Teams--the Black \nBears continued to thrill all of Maine, rewarding audiences with \ncollege hockey as it was meant to be played.\n  Maine's players never gave in and they never gave up. Unyielding in \ntheir play, believing in themselves to the very end, Maine clinched the \nchampionship in a hard-fought, well-played overtime game against a \nsuperb University of New Hampshire team. And at that moment, Mainers \nnear and far--even those who didn't attend my alma mater--were reunited \nwith each other in the spirit of fellowship and victory.\n  So it is an honor for me to commend each and every member of the \nBlack Bear team--not only for their tremendous commitment to personal \nexcellence, but also to the success of the entire team.\n  In particular, seniors Steve Kariya, Marcus Gustafsson, Jason \nVitorino, Bobby Stewart, and David Cullen thrilled us with their \noutstanding play and their remarkable leadership. And Maine's goalie, \njunior Aflie Michaud, deserves special mention for stopping an \nastounding 46 shots--a feat that rightfully brought him the honor of \nbeing named the tournament's most valuable player.\n  Finally, I applaud the Black Bear coaching staff for a job well done. \nYou can't win without the fundamentals, and Maine's coaches certainly \nhad this team prepared to take the ice--just ask their opponents. But \nperhaps most importantly, they took young men who were talented in \ntheir own right and made them into something even far more formidable--\na singular, unstoppable force that would not be denied in its quest to \nbecome the very best.\n  Mr. President, there is something about excellence, especially at the \nhighest levels of competition, that elevates all those who come in \ncontact with it. And the magic of a sport like hockey is that, even if \nyou have never strapped on a skate, never taken a slapshot, never iced \na puck, never scored a hat trick, you're amazed by the passion of those \nwho do. You're inspired by the athleticism and artistry. And you come \nto believe that perhaps we all have the potential for greatness, if \nonly we are willing to work hard enough and care deeply enough to \npursue our dreams.\n  The 1999 Maine Black Bears hockey team had the kind of year that \ndreams are made of. Today, by virtue of posting a win in the last game \nof the last NCAA Hockey tournament of the century, Maine is truly the \nfinal word in college hockey.\n  On behalf of the people of Maine, I commend the players, staff, and \nadministration at the University of Maine hockey program for a season \nto remember. All of Maine is very proud, and we look forward to many \nmore seasons of excitement in the new millennium.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Snowe in \noffering a resolution congratulating the University of Maine Men's Ice \nHockey team, who, as many of my colleagues know, won the 1999 NCAA \nDivision I Hockey Championship earlier this year.\n  Like all who watched the thrilling championship game on April 3, I \nwas on the edge of my seat when Marcus Gustafsson scored the game-\nwinning goal to give the Black Bears a heart-stopping 3-2 overtime \nvictory over the University of New Hampshire Wildcats. This incredible \nvictory gave the Black Bears their second national championship in \nseven years--and nearly gave me a heart attack. I must say, had the \ngame not been as close as it was, I would have been able to relax a bit \nmore that night. But as any sports fan knows, a close game--\nparticularly a game that is won in overtime--is all the more rewarding, \nand much more befitting as the crowning achievement of a national \nchampion.\n  In Maine, where we take our sports seriously despite not having any \nmajor league sports teams, the Black Bears are a tremendous source of \npride. As anyone traveling on the Maine Turnpike can tell you, signs \nthat once welcomed you to ``Vacationland'' now welcome you to the home \nof the NCAA Hockey Champions. This year the Black Bears once again \nearned our admiration with an impressive record of 31 wins, 6 losses, \nand 4 ties. Also, they repeatedly wowed the faithful Maine fans by \nwinning all but one game on their home ice--the beloved Alfond Arena.\n  Throughout the season, the players and coaching staff all showed \ntremendous dedication and heart, and their ability to work together as \na team was second to none. They advanced boldly through the NCAA \ntournament, beating Boston College in overtime at the ``Frozen Four,'' \nand ultimately earned the right to play in the championship game \nagainst the University of New Hampshire Wildcats--a team that had \nbeaten the Black Bears twice earlier in the season. Not to be denied, \nthe Black Bears persevered and beat the Wildcats when it mattered the \nmost.\n  True to form for any national championship team, the Black Bears have \na tremendous amount of talent. Four Maine men were selected in this \nyear's National Hockey League draft, and I suspect that several more of \ntheir teammates will eventually join them in playing professional \nhockey. What made this team great, however, was its strong \ndetermination, its ability to work together, and its perseverance. It \nis these qualities that produce championships, and they are qualities \nthat will continue to serve these fine young men very well--both on and \noff the ice.\n  Since winning the championship, the Black Bears have enjoyed a \nsubstantial amount of much-deserved recognition. I was proud to be \namong those fans who were on hand to welcome the victorious team home, \nand I was also pleased to speak at an awards dinner in the team's \nhonor. Soon, Maine's players and coaches will be honored by the \nPresident at the White House. Therefore, I believe it is altogether \nfitting and proper that the Senate add its voice, and recognize the \nBlack Bears' accomplishments, by adopting the resolution that I so \nproudly offer with Senator Snowe. While the Senate chamber may not be \nAlfond Arena, it is most appropriate that I close my remarks with the \nchant, ``M-A-I-N-E \n\nGooooooo Blue!''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9396-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9396-S9397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 165--A RESOLUTION IN MEMORY OF SENIOR JUDGE FRANK M. \n  JOHNSON, JR.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncommending the Georges Bank review panel on the recent extension of the \nmoratorium on oil and gas exploration on Georges Bank and urging our \nCanadian neighbors to adopt a longer-term moratorium that would match \nthat adopted by the United States.\n  Georges Bank is a large shallow bank on the Outer Continental Shelf \nof the eastern North American continent. Georges Bank, which separates \nthe Gulf of Maine from the open Atlantic Ocean, is traditionally known \nas one of the most productive fishing grounds in the world. Fishing \nvessels from New England and Canada catch cod, haddock, yellowtail \nflounder, scallops, lobsters, swordfish, herring, and bluefin tuna in \nits waters. Literally hundreds of communities depend upon fish from \nGeorges Bank for their way of life and livelihood.\n  In 1984, the United States-Canadian boundary dispute involving \nownership of Georges Bank was resolved by the International Court of \nJustice at The Hague. The Court declared the northeastern portion of \nthe bank as under Canadian jurisdiction and the southwestern portion as \nunder the jurisdiction of the United States. Since that decision, both \nthe United States and Canada have maintained a moratorium on oil and \ngas exploration on Georges Bank.\n  In 1998, the United States extended its moratorium until the year \n2012.\n\n[[Page S9398]]\n\n  In 1988, with the adoption of the Canada-Nova Scotia Accord Acts, \nCanada placed a moratorium on petroleum activities on Georges Bank \nuntil January 1, 2000. In preparation for the expiration of that \nmoratorium, a three-person review panel held an extensive public \ncomment period, commissioned studies, and thoroughly explored the pros \nand cons of allowing oil and gas activity on the Canadian portion of \nGeorges Bank. Last month, at the conclusion of its review, the panel \nrecommended that the moratorium on petroleum activities on Georges Bank \nbe continued, but it did not specify a date.\n  I certainly respect the fact that Canada is entitled to make its own \nmineral management decisions. Nevertheless, given the joint \njurisdiction that the United States and Canada have over Georges Bank, \nI believe it is appropriate for this body to convey its concern and \nsupport for the unique ecosystem and fisheries of Georges Bank. An \naccident involving a petroleum spill on either side of the line could \nhave a devastating impact on fisheries well up and down the coast from \nNova Scotia and New Brunswick to the coast of New England.\n  The severe weather in and the vast expanse of Georges Bank far from \nshore would greatly complicate any effort to clean up any spill that \ncould occur. Indeed, even if a spill never occurred, the lubricants \nused in drilling could well have a toxic impact on Georges Bank's \ndelicate fisheries.\n  Fishermen from Canada and the United States are subject to strict \nregulations governing fishing on Georges Bank. These regulations are \ndesigned to allow fish stocks to recover after years of overfishing. \nThey have involved considerable sacrifices for the fishermen who depend \non Georges Bank to make a living. But the sacrifices are paying off, \nand the fish stocks are recovering. It would be a shame to set back or \nto reverse completely those hard-won recovery efforts with even the \nrisk of a major oil spill.\n  The resolution I am submitting today encourages the Government of \nCanada to accept the recommendations of its review panel. It also goes \nfurther by asking our neighbor to the north to extend its drilling \nmoratorium until the year 2012 to match the American moratorium. In \nthat way, both Canadians and Americans may be assured that Georges Bank \nwill remain in its traditional uses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9398-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TAXPAYER REFUND ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                ABRAHAM (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 1354\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. \nSchumer) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to the \nbill (S. 1429) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to section 104 of \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of title XI, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

(a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as \n     the ``Battle of Midway National Memorial Study Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) September 2, 1997, marked the 52nd anniversary of the \n     United States victory over Japan in World War II.\n       (2) The Battle of Midway proved to be the turning point in \n     the war in the Pacific, as United States Navy forces \n     inflicted such severe losses on the Imperial Japanese Navy \n     during the battle that the Imperial Japanese Navy never again \n     took the offensive against the United States or the allied \n     forces.\n       (3) During the Battle of Midway on June 4, 1942, an \n     outnumbered force of the United States Navy, consisting of 29 \n     ships and other units of the Armed Forces under the command \n     of Admiral Nimitz and Admiral Spruance, out-maneuvered and \n     out-fought 350 ships of the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n       (4) It is in the public interest to study whether Midway \n     Atoll should be established as a national memorial to the \n     Battle of Midway to express the enduring gratitude of the \n     American people for victory in the battle and to inspire \n     future generations of Americans with the heroism and \n     sacrifice of the members of the Armed Forces who achieved \n     that victory.\n       (5) The historic structures and facilities on Midway Atoll \n     should be protected and maintained.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require a study \n     of the feasibility and suitability of designating the Midway \n     Atoll as a National Memorial to the Battle of Midway within \n     the boundaries of the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. \n     The study of the Midway Atoll and its environs shall include, \n     but not be limited to, identification of interpretative \n     opportunities for the educational and inspirational benefit \n     of present and future generations, and of the unique and \n     significant circumstances involving the defense of the island \n     by the United States in World War II and the Battle of \n     Midway.\n       (d) Study of the Establishment of Midway Atoll as a \n     National Memorial to the Battle of Midway.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than six months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall, acting through the Director of the National Park \n     Service and in consultation with the Director of the United \n     States Fish and Wildlife Service, the International Midway \n     Memorial Foundation, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the \n     ``Foundation''), and Midway Phoenix Corporation, carry out a \n     study of the suitability and feasibility of establishing \n     Midway Atoll as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway.\n       (2) Considerations.--In studying the establishment of \n     Midway Atoll as a national memorial to the Battle of Midway \n     under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall address the \n     following:\n       (A) The appropriate federal agency to manage such a \n     memorial, and whether and under what conditions, to lease or \n     otherwise allow the Foundation or another appropriate entity \n     to administer, maintain, and fully utilize the lands \n     (including any equipment, facilities, infrastructure, and \n     other improvements) and waters of Midway Atoll if designated \n     as a national memorial.\n       (B) Whether designation as a national memorial would \n     conflict with current management of Midway Atoll as a \n     wildlife refuge and whether, and under what circumstances, \n     the needs and requirements of the wildlife refuge should take \n     precedence over the needs and requirements of a national \n     memorial on Midway Atoll.\n       (C) Whether, and under what conditions, to permit the use \n     of the facilities on Sand Island for purposes other than a \n     wildlife refuge or a national memorial.\n       (D) Whether to impose conditions on public access to Midway \n     Atoll as a national memorial.\n       (3) Report.--Upon completion of the study required under \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit, to the Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate \n     and the Committee on Resources of the House of \n     Representatives, a report on the study, which shall include \n     any recommendations for further legislative action. The \n     report shall also include an inventory of all known past and \n     present facilities and structures of historical significance \n     on Midway Atoll and its environs. The report shall include a \n     description of each historic facility and structure and a \n     discussion of how each will contribute to the designation and \n     interpretation of the proposed national memorial.\n       (e) Continuing Discussions.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to delay or prohibit discussions between the \n     Foundation and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or \n     any other government entity regarding the future role of the \n     Foundation on Midway Atoll.\n       Sec. 124. Where any Federal lands included within the \n     boundary of Lake Roosevelt National Recreation Area as \n     designated by the Secretary of the Interior on April 5, 1990 \n     (Lake Roosevelt Cooperative Management Agreement) were \n     utilized as of March 31, 1997, for grazing purposes pursuant \n     to a permit issued by the National Park Service, the person \n     or persons so utilizing such lands shall be entitled to renew \n     said permit under such terms and conditions as the Secretary \n     may prescribe, for the lifetime of the permittee or 20 years, \n     whichever is less.\n       Sec. 125. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of the Interior is authorized to redistribute any \n     Tribal Priority Allocation funds, including tribal base \n     funds, to alleviate tribal funding inequities by transferring \n     funds on the basis of identified, unmet needs.

(a) The Secretary of Agriculture (hereinafter the \n     ``Secretary'') is hereby and hereafter authorized to conduct \n     technology transfer and development, training, dissemination \n     of information and applied research in the management, \n     processing and utilization of the hardwood forest resource. \n     This authority is in addition to any other authorities which \n     may be available to the Secretary including, but not limited \n     to, the Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of 1978, as \n     amended (16 U.S.C. 2101 et. seq.), and the Forest and \n     Rangeland Renewable Resources Act of 1978, as amended (16 \n     U.S.C. 1600-1614).\n       (b) In carrying out this authority, the Secretary may enter \n     into grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements with \n     public and private agencies, organizations, corporations, \n     institutions and individuals. The Secretary may accept gifts \n     and donations pursuant to the Act of October 10, 1978 (7 \n     U.S.C. 2269) including gifts and donations from a donor that \n     conducts business with any agency of the Department of \n     Agriculture or is regulated by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (c) The Secretary is hereby and hereafter authorized to \n     operate and utilize the assets of the Wood Education and \n     Resource Center (previously named the Robert C. Byrd Hardwood \n     Technology Center in West Virginia) as part of a newly formed \n     ``Institute of Hardwood Technology Transfer and Applied \n     Research'' (hereinafter the ``Institute''). The Institute, in \n     addition to the Wood Education and Resource Center, will \n     consist of a Director, technology transfer specialists from \n     State and Private Forestry, the Forestry Sciences Laboratory \n     in Princeton, West Virginia, and any other organizational \n     unit of the Department of Agriculture as the Secretary deems \n     appropriate. The overall management of the Institute will be \n     the responsibility of the USDA Forest Service, State and \n     Private Forestry.\n       (d) The Secretary is hereby and hereafter authorized to \n     generate revenue using the authorities provided herein. Any \n     revenue received as part of the operation of the Institute \n     shall be deposited into a special fund in the Treasury of the \n     United States, known as the ``Hardwood Technology Transfer \n     and Applied Research Fund'', which shall be available to the \n     Secretary until expended, without further appropriation, in \n     furtherance of the purposes of this section, including \n     upkeep, management, and operation of the Institute and the \n     payment of salaries and expenses.\n       (e) There are hereby and hereafter authorized to be \n     appropriated such sums as necessary to carry out the \n     provisions of this section.\n       Sec. 327. No timber in Region 10 of the Forest Service \n     shall be advertised for sale which, when using domestic \n     Alaska western red cedar selling values and manufacturing \n     costs, fails to provide at least 60 percent of normal profit \n     and risk of the appraised timber, except at the written \n     request by a prospective bidder. Program accomplishments \n     shall be based on volume sold. Should Region 10 sell, in \n     fiscal year 2000, the annual average portion of the decadal \n     allowable sale quantity called for in the current Tongass \n     Land Management Plan which provides greater than 60 percent \n     of normal profit and risk at the time of the sale \n     advertisement, all of the western red cedar timber from those \n     sales which is surplus to the needs of domestic processors in \n     Alaska, shall be made available to domestic processors in the \n     contiguous 48 United States based on values in the Pacific \n     Northwest as determined by the Forest Service and stated in \n     the timber sale contract. Should Region 10 sell, in fiscal \n     year 2000, less than the annual average portion of the \n     decadal allowable sale quantity called for in the current \n     Tongass Land Management Plan meeting the 60 percent of normal \n     profit and risk standard at the time of sale advertisement, \n     the volume of western red cedar timber available to domestic \n     processors at rates specified in the timber sale contract in \n     the contiguous 48 states shall be that volume: (i) which is \n     surplus to the needs of domestic processors in Alaska; and \n     (ii) is that percent of the surplus western red cedar volume \n     determined by calculating the ratio of the total timber \n     volume which has been sold on the Tongass to the annual \n     average portion of the decadal allowable sale quantity called \n     for in the current Tongass Land Management Plan. The \n     percentage shall be calculated by Region 10 on a rolling \n     basis as each sale is sold. (For purposes of this amendment, \n     a ``rolling basis'' shall mean that the determination of how \n     much western red cedar is eligible for sale to various \n     markets shall be made at the time each sale is awarded.) \n     Western red cedar shall be deemed ``surplus to the needs of \n     domestic processors in Alaska'' when the timber sale holder \n     has presented to the Forest Service documentation of the \n     inability to sell western red cedar logs from a given sale to \n     domestic Alaska processors at a price equal to or greater \n     than the log selling value stated in the contract. All \n     additional western red cedar volume not sold to Alaska or \n     contiguous 48 United States domestic processors may be \n     exported to foreign markets at the election of the timber \n     sale holder. All Alaska yellow cedar may be sold at \n     prevailing export prices at the election of the timber sale \n     holder.\n       Sec. 329. For fiscal year 2000, the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, with respect to lands within the National Forest \n     System, and the Secretary of the Interior, with respect to \n     lands under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land \n     Management, shall use the best available scientific and \n     commercial data in amending or revising resource management \n     plans for, and offering sales, issuing leases, or otherwise \n     authorizing or undertaking management activities on, lands \n     under their respective jurisdictions: Provided, That the \n     Secretaries may at their discretion determine whether any \n     additional information concerning wildlife resources shall be \n     collected prior to approving any such plan, sale, lease or \n     other activity, and, if so, the type of, and collection \n     procedures for, such information.\n       Sec. 330. The Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of \n     the Interior shall:\n       (a) prepare the report required of them by section 323(a) \n     of the Fiscal Year 1998 Interior and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act (Public Law 105-83; 111 Stat. 1543, 1596-\n     7);\n       (b) make the report available for public comment for a \n     period of not less than 120 days; and\n       (c) include the information contained in the report and a \n     detailed response or responses to any such public comment in \n     any final environmental impact statement associated with the \n     Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Project.\n       Sec. 331. Section 7 of the Service Contract Act (SCA), 41 \n     U.S.C. section 356 is amended by adding the following \n     paragraph:\n       ``(8) any concession contract with Federal land management \n     agencies, the principal\n\n[[Page S9413]]\n\n     purpose of which is the provision of recreational services to \n     the general public, including lodging, campgrounds, food, \n     stores, guiding, recreational equipment, fuel, \n     transportation, and skiing, provided that this exemption \n     shall not affect the applicability of the Davis-Bacon Act, 40 \n     U.S.C. section 276a et seq., to construction contracts \n     associated with these concession contracts.''.\n       Sec. 332. Timber and Special Forest Products. (a) \n     Definition of Special Forest Product.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``special forest product'' means any \n     vegetation or other life forms, such as mushrooms and fungi \n     that grows on National Forest System lands, excluding trees, \n     animals, insects, or fish except as provided in regulations \n     issued under this section by the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       (b) Fair Market Value for Special Forest Products.--The \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall develop and implement a pilot \n     program to charge and collect not less than the fair market \n     value for special forest products harvested on National \n     Forest System lands. The authority for this pilot program \n     shall be for fiscal years 2000 through 2004. The Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall establish appraisal methods and bidding \n     procedures to ensure that the amounts collected for special \n     forest products are not less than fair market value.\n       (c) Fees.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall charge \n     and collect from persons who harvest special forest products \n     all costs to the Department of Agriculture associated with \n     the granting, modifying, or monitoring the authorization for \n     harvest of the special forest products, including the costs \n     of any environmental or other analysis.\n       (2) Security.--The Secretary of Agriculture may require a \n     person that is assessed a fee under this subsection to \n     provide security to ensure that the Secretary of Agriculture \n     receives fees authorized under this subsection from such \n     person.\n       (d) Waiver.--The Secretary of Agriculture may waive the \n     application of subsection (b) or subsection (c) pursuant to \n     such regulations as the Secretary of Agriculture may \n     prescribe.\n       (e) Collection and Use of Funds.--\n       (1) Funds collected in accordance with subsection (b) and \n     subsection (c) shall be deposited into a special account in \n     the Treasury of the United States.\n       (2) Funds deposited into the special account in the \n     Treasury in accordance with this section in excess of the \n     amounts collected for special forest products during fiscal \n     year 1999 shall be available for expenditure by the Secretary \n     of Agriculture on October 1, 2000 without further \n     appropriation, and shall remain available until expended to \n     pay for--\n       (A) in the case of funds collected pursuant to subsection \n     (b), the costs of conducting inventories of special forest \n     products, monitoring and assessing the impacts of harvest \n     levels and methods, and for restoration activities, including \n     any necessary vegetation; and\n       (B) in the case of fees collected pursuant to subsection \n     (c), the costs for which the fees were collected.\n       (3) Amounts collected in accordance with subsection (b) and \n     subsection (c) shall not be taken into account for the \n     purposes of the sixth paragraph under the heading of ``Forest \n     Service'' of the Act of May 23, 1908 (16 U.S.C.

No federal monies appropriated for the purchase \n     of land by the Forest Service in the Columbia River Gorge \n     National Scenic Area (``CRGNSA'') may be used unless the \n     Forest Service complies with the acquisition protocol set out \n     in this section:\n       (a) Purchase Option Requirement.--Upon the Forest Service \n     making a determination that the agency intends to pursue \n     purchase of land or an interest in land located within the \n     boundaries of the CRGNSA, the Forest Service and the owner of \n     the land or interest in land to be purchased shall enter into \n     a written purchase option agreement in which the landowner \n     agrees to retain ownership of the interest in land to be \n     acquired for a period not to exceed one year. In return, the \n     Forest Service shall agree to abide by the bargaining and \n     arbitration process set out in this section.\n       (b) Opt Out.--After the Forest Service and landowner have \n     entered into the purchase option agreement, the landowner may \n     at any time prior to federal acquisition voluntarily opt out \n     of the purchase option agreement.\n       (c) Selection of Appraisers.--Once the landowner and Forest \n     Service both have executed the required purchase option, the \n     landowner and Forest Service each shall select an appraiser \n     to appraise the land or interest in land described in the \n     purchase option. The landowner and Forest Service both shall \n     instruct their appraiser to estimate the fair market value of \n     the land or interest in land to be acquired. The landowner \n     and Forest Service both shall instruct their appraiser to \n     comply with the Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal Land \n     Acquisitions (Interagency Land Acquisition Conference 1992) \n     and Public Law 91-646 as amended. Both appraisers shall \n     possess qualifications consistent with state regulatory \n     requirements that meet the intent of Title XI, Financial \n     Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989.\n       (d) Period to Complete Appraisals.--The landowner and \n     Forest Service each shall be allowed a period of 180 days to \n     provide to the other an appraisal of the land or interest in \n     land described in the purchase option. This 180-day period \n     shall commence upon execution of a purchase option by the \n     landowner and the Forest Service.\n       (e) Bargaining Period.--Once the landowner and Forest \n     Service each have provided to the other a completed \n     appraisal, a 45-day period of good faith bargaining and \n     negotiation shall commence. If the landowner and Forest \n     Service cannot agree within this period on the proper \n     purchase price to be paid by the United States for the land \n     or interest in land described in the purchase option, the \n     landowner may request arbitration under subsection (f) of \n     this section.\n       (f) Arbitration Process.--If a landowner and the Forest \n     Service are unable to reach a negotiated settlement on value \n     within the 45-day period of good faith bargaining and \n     negotiation, during the 10 days following this period of good \n     faith bargaining and negotiation the landowner may request \n     arbitration. The process for arbitration shall commence with \n     each party submitting its appraisal and a copy of this \n     legislation, and only its appraisal and a copy of this \n     legislation, to the arbitration panel within 10 days \n     following the receipt by the Forest Service of the request \n     for arbitration. The arbitration panel shall render a written \n     advisory decision on value within 45 days of receipt of both \n     appraisals. This advisory decision shall be forwarded to the \n     Secretary of Agriculture by the arbitration panel with a \n     recommendation to the Secretary that if the land or interest \n     in land at issue is to be purchased that the United States \n     pay a sum certain for the land or interest in land. This sum \n     certain shall fall within the value range established by the \n     two appraisals. Costs of employing the arbitration panel \n     shall be divided equally between the Forest Service and the \n     landowner, unless the arbitration panel recommends either the \n     landowner or the Forest Service bear the entire cost of \n     employing the arbitration panel. The arbitration panel shall \n     not make such a recommendation unless the panel finds that \n     one of the appraisals submitted fails to conform to the \n     Uniform Appraisal Standard for Federal Land Acquisition \n     (Interagency Land Acquisition Conference 1992). In no event, \n     shall the cost of employing the arbitration panel exceed \n     $10,000.\n       (g) Arbitration Panel.--The arbitration panel shall consist \n     of one appraiser and two lawyers who have substantial \n     experience working with the purchase of land and interests in \n     land by the United States. The Secretary is directed to ask \n     the Federal Center\n\n[[Page S9414]]\n\n     for Dispute Resolution at the American Arbitration \n     Association to develop lists of no less than ten appraisers \n     and twenty lawyers who possess substantial experience working \n     with federal land purchases to serve as third-party neutrals \n     in the event arbitration is requested by a landowner. \n     Selection of the arbitration panel shall be made by mutual \n     agreement of the Forest Service and landowner. If mutual \n     agreement cannot be reached on one or more panel members, \n     selection of the remaining panel members shall be by blind \n     draw once each party has been allowed the opportunity to \n     strike up to 25 percent of the third-party neutrals named on \n     either list. Of the funds available to the Forest Service, up \n     to $15,000 shall be available to the Federal Center for \n     Dispute Resolution to cover the initial cost of establishing \n     this program.

Mr. President, one of the real treasures of my \nState of Vermont are the people who live and\n\n[[Page S9417]]\n\nwork there. Recently, I had the pleasure of leading a trade mission to \nIreland with a group of Vermont business owners seeking strategic \nbusiness alliances to increase trade and tourism between our state and \nIreland. One of the members of the delegation, Beth Kennett, traveled \nto Ireland with specific goals in mind--to increase tourism from \nIreland to Vermont and to learn more about agri-tourism.\n  Beth Kennett is the president of Vermont Farms! as well as a co-\nowner, along with her husband Bob, of a dairy farm that also serves as \na bed and breakfast. On the trip, Mrs. Kennett was hosted by \nrepresentatives of the agri-tourism industry and visited several agri-\ntourism farms. She was very enthusiastic throughout her stay and \ncommented later on the diversity of her experiences. She said that one \nday she found herself wearing Wellies and the next she was meeting the \nLord and Lady of the Manor.\n  I can gladly say that our mission was a success. We were able to open \nup doors for new business relationships and tourism between Ireland and \nVermont, while also bringing back information on how to develop agri-\ntourism in Vermont. I ask that an article by Associated Press writer \nDavid Gram regarding Mrs. Kennett's experience be printed in the \nrecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Associated Press, June 23, 1999]\n\n               Farm life grows as tourism draw in Vermont\n\n                            (By David Gram)\n\n       Rochester, VT. Beth Kennett calls the big, five-story, red \n     barn with its cupola topped with a Holstein-shaped \n     weathervane ``one of the cathedrals of the country.''\n       And if people from around the world travel to Paris to see \n     the Notre Dame, why not to Rochester's Liberty Hill to see \n     her farm?\n       In fact, they do. In addition to milking one of the most \n     productive small herds of registered Holsteins in the state, \n     Kennett, her husband Bob and her sons Tom and David--young \n     men who are following their parents into farming--open their \n     sprawling, two-century-old farmhouse to travelers.\n       They're part of a growing number of Vermont farmers who are \n     bridging the gap between two of the mainstays of Vermont's \n     economy: agriculture and tourism.\n       The Kennetts' house dates from 1825, the barn from 1889, \n     there are splendid views of the surrounding hills, a mile of \n     frontage on the White River with several good swimming holes, \n     and hiking trails in the abutting Green Mountain National \n     Forest. Down in the well kept barn, there are 65 milkers and, \n     occasionally, a newborn calf to marvel at.\n       Kennett got into the hospitality business when a big drop \n     in prices paid to farmers for milk in 1984 prompted her and \n     her family to look for new sources of income.\n       ``We took stock of our assets, and decided that since we \n     had this big old farmhouse with 18 rooms, we might as well \n     take advantage of it,'' she recalled.\n       Now she's got a regular clientele of guests who return year \n     after year, she's president of a statewide association of \n     farmers who offer lodging, tours and other amenities for \n     visitors, and she's just back from joining Sen. Patrick \n     Leahy, D-Vt., on a trade mission to Ireland.\n       For a full dinner, big breakfast and charming country \n     lodgings complete with wide-board floors, flowered wallpaper \n     and a claw-foot bathtub, Kennett charges $70 per adult and \n     $30 per child. The house can accommodate 15 guests and \n     occasionally is the destination for reunions of several \n     branches of the same family.\n       ``Not only has it been a diversification of income for the \n     farm, but it's been invaluable in the number of friends we've \n     made over the years. And it's a wonderful opportunity to \n     educate the public about agriculture,'' she said.\n       Kennett is president of an association called VT Farms!, \n     which has grown to 56 members in less than three years of \n     existence.\n       Their offerings range from pick-your own strawberries and \n     apples to wine tasting to petting zoos. Some 15 to 20 \n     accommodate overnight guests, according to Ron Fisher, who \n     tracks the industry for the Vermont Department of \n     Agriculture.\n       ``What we're looking for with agri-tourism is to literally \n     make this another revenue stream for farmers,'' Fisher said. \n     ``It's not going to replace the milk check, but it's another \n     source of cash flow to the individual who's going to open up \n     the farm to agri-tourism.''\n       Agri-tourism may be due for a boost from the federal \n     government. Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., announced earlier \n     this month that the U.S. House had approved a $1 million \n     appropriation for a pilot project to promote the fledgling \n     industry.\n       Kennett said if some funds become available, she may look \n     for Vermont to apply some of the ideas she picked up in \n     Ireland, where she said farm-based tourism is widely \n     practiced, accepted and considered an integral part of the \n     country's allure for visitors.\n       Fisher said state officials hope agri-tourism can help \n     stanch the loss of farms in Vermont. There were more than \n     20,000 in 1950, the fast majority of them dairy operations; \n     today there are fewer than 3,000 dairy farms in the state. \n     Kennett said there were 11 farms shipping milk when she and \n     her husband moved to Rochester from Addison 20 years ago; \n     today, she said, theirs is the last farm in Rochester \n     shipping milk.\n       Blending a working farm with a hospitality business is a \n     lot of work. Kennett said she's up at milking time to make \n     breakfast for her guests, and spends afternoon preparing \n     dinner for her family and up to 15 guests.\n       But she said she has no complaints. It's been a great way \n     to beat the isolation which can be a feature of Vermont farm \n     life. She doesn't need to visit the world's concert halls, \n     because there's a family of accomplished violinists who visit \n     every year from Newton, Mass., and put on a concert at the \n     farm.\n       Then there's the art professor and his class who arrive en \n     masse for a week occasionally. They paint the surrounding \n     scenery and then put on an art show at week's end. And \n     there's the magician from New York who comes and puts on a \n     show each Fourth of July.\n       ``I don't need to go off and see the world,'' Kennett \n     said.''The world comes to me.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9417-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9417-S9418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO VERY REVEREND A.G.

I rise today to praise and commend the \ndedication and commitment of Very Reverend Abdulahad Gabriel Doumato \nwho, for the past fifty years, has led the parish of Saint Ephraim's \nSyrian Orthodox Church in Rhode Island.\n  Approximately 300 friends, family members, clergymen, elected \nofficials, and parishioners will gather on Sunday, August 1st, to honor \nFather Doumato on this milestone. A native of Syria, we in his adopted \nstate of Rhode Island have benefitted from and been enriched by Father \nDoumato's selfless service, devotion, compassion and wisdom--attributes \nwhich have characterized his long and distinguished tenure.\n  Father Doumato is a compassionate individual who cares profoundly for \nhis community. He is a deeply peaceful and religious man who possesses \nboundless hope and optimism. He has consistently and successfully \nworked for the betterment of his community and has always served with \nfaith and devotion. Indeed, he is a man of integrity, flawless \ncharacter, unquestionable commitment, and one who has earned a sterling \nreputation as a pillar of his community.\n  The original community of Saint Ephraim's Church in Rhode Island was \nformed by a group of immigrant families who came to the United States \nbefore the turn of the century. This small, industrious community \nmanaged to buy a house and use it as a parish center and chapel for \nworship. The church was subsequently chartered in 1913.\n  Although Saint Ephraim's has only been in existence for 86 years, the \nSyrian Orthodox Church has its roots in the original Christian Church \nof Jerusalem. The dean of Apostles, Saint Peter, who personally \nanointed his successor before his journey to Rome, founded the Church \nin Antioch. The Church's current supreme leader, His Holiness Mor \nIgnatius Zakka I, Patriarch of Antioch and all the East, is the 122nd \ndirect successor of Saint Peter. The church claims a wealth of \ntheological, liturgical, and musical traditions. Indeed, to this day \nthe liturgy is conducted in Aramaic, the language\n\n[[Page S9418]]\n\nspoken by Jesus Christ, and was the lingua franca in the Near East.\n  Mr. President, Father Doumato has enjoyed an interesting and \nfulfilling career in the ministry of his church. Like many of us, his \nlife has been filled with challenges, hardships and hope. Unlike many \nof us, however, he has enjoyed some truly unique and rich experiences. \nHe was born in 1918 and raised in the shadow of the Cathedral Church of \nthe Virgin Mary in the city of Homs, Syria. He was educated in Homs, \nfirst in his Church's school and later by Jesuit Brothers. His interest \nin theology and his Church was an early and important part of his life. \nHis father, the late Gabriel Doumato, who immigrated to Rhode Island in \n1973, was an ardent supporter of the Church and served his community in \nmany capacities.\n  Upon completing his education, Father Doumato taught in the Church's \nschools across Syria. At the beginning of World War II, he entered the \nFrench-run National Police Academy and graduated with honors in 1939. \nFor the next ten years, he served as a member of the National Police \nForce. Throughout this period, he continued to serve the Church as a \ndeacon and was constantly urged by His Holiness Patriarch Ephraim, the \nChurch's supreme leader, to join the ministry. In 1949, he resigned his \ncommission and entered the Seminary of the Syrian Orthodox Church in \nSyria.\n  Father Doumato was ordained into the priesthood in August 1950 by His \nHoliness Patriarch Ephraim and immediately assigned to serve the church \nin Central Falls, Rhode Island. Because of visa delays however, he was \nunable to attend to this position for two years. In the meantime, he \nremained in Homs and served as personal secretary to His Holiness the \nPatriarch.\n  Accompanied by his wife, Victoria, and their four young children, \nFather Doumato arrived in Rhode Island in August 1952 to lead his new \ncongregation. Ever since his arrival, Father Doumato has quietly and \nfaithfully served God, his parish, our State and, indeed, our country. \nHe has also authored numerous publications about the history of the \nchurch and its Divine Liturgy. In 1970, his dedication and self-\nsacrifice was recognized and honored when he was elevated to the \nposition of Cor-Episcopose--the highest distinction of the priesthood. \nIn 1991, he was again honored for his service and was awarded the Holy \nCross of the Archdioceses of the United States and Canada.\n  In closing, I would like to extend my very best wishes on this \nspecial occasion to Father Doumato, to his family, and to his \nparishioners at Saint Ephraim's Church. We are all very proud of Father \nDoumato, and appreciative of his many contributions to his community, \nand to our state.\n  I would now like to recognize my colleague, Senator Reed, who also \nwishes to honor Father Doumato.\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I, too, wish to join Senator Chafee \nin paying tribute to the Very Reverend Abdulahad Gabriel Doumato on the \noccasion of his fiftieth anniversary as leader of the parish of Saint \nEphraim's Syrian Orthodox Church in Rhode Island.\n  A proud and patriotic ``American'', Father Doumato loves his adopted \ncountry and is happiest when helping the new immigrants within his \nflock assimilate into American society. Mr. President, Father Doumato \nis responsible for sponsoring hundreds of new citizens to our great \nnation, granting them the opportunity to live the American dream. He \nhas educated these families--including those of six of his brothers and \nsisters--about our system of government and the privilege, opportunity, \nand responsibility of American citizenship.\n  Father Doumato is often heard telling his parishioners, ``There is no \ncountry like the United States. It truly is the land of opportunity and \nyou should thank God for the opportunity you have to live in this great \nland.'' A good shepherd, Father Doumato has been a shining example to \nhis family and his flock.\n  The Doumatos are a sizable and considerable clan in Rhode Island--the \nextended family numbers over 120 persons. We cannot imagine that there \nhas been a single elected official in the Blackstone Valley area, or \nacross the State, that has not come into contact with a member of the \nfamily. Indeed, father Doumato's children, grandchildren, nephews and \nnieces have been industrious citizens and have served our country in \nnumerous positions of distinction, including as officers in the Armed \nForces, diplomats, university educators, U.S. Senate aides and senior \nadvisors, engineers, and leaders in law, the arts, medicine, commerce \nand industry. He and his family have richly contributed to the \nbetterment of our community in Rhode Island.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would also like to wish Reverend Doumato \nand his wife, Victoria, a happy and healthy 57th Anniversary, which \nthey will celebrate later this year.\n  May his children and grandchildren--along with his parishioners--\ncontinue to benefit from his wisdom!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9418-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9418-S9419]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CHANNEL ONE NETWORK\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I will ask to include in the \nCongressional Record two letters recognizing the efforts of the Channel \nOne Network in educating school-age children in the dangers of drug \nuse.\n  These letters were originally included in the transcript of the \nSenate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing on \nJuly 13 regarding Drug Free Schools.\n  The first is from Richard Bonnette, President of the Partnership for \na Drug Free America. Mr. Bonnette thanks Channel One for supporting the \nmission of Partnership for a Drug-Free America by changing millions of \nyoung people's attitudes about drugs.\n  In the second letter, I join Mr. Bonnette's praise of Channel One's \nairing of $25 million worth of pro bono anti-drug public service \nannouncements over the last ten years as part of its news broadcasts to \nschool-aged children.\n  I am pleased to join Mr. Bonnette in congratulating Channel One on \ntheir efforts.\n  I ask that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  The letters follow.\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1999.\n     Hon. James Jeffords,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I respectfully request that the attached \n     letter from Richard Bonnette, President and CEO of the \n     Partnership for a Drug-Free America be made a part of the \n     record for the Committee's July 13, 1999 hearing on Drug Free \n     Schools.\n       Mr. Bonnette writes in praise of the excellent public \n     service of the Channel One Network in educating our nation's \n     youth about the dangers of drug use. I would like to join Mr. \n     Bonnette's praise of the Channel One Network.\n       Over the past ten years, Channel One has aired more than \n     $25 million worth of anti-drug public service announcements \n     as part of its news broadcasts to school-aged children. The \n     efforts of the Channel One Network demonstrates good \n     corporate citizenship. When we in Congress call upon the \n     media and entertainment industries to act responsibly for the \n     benefit of our children, this is part of what we are talking \n     about.\n       Mr. Bonnette's letter refers to a study conducted between \n     1995-1997 by the Partnership for a Drug Free America. The \n     study found strong evidence that students in Channel One \n     schools had significantly more negative attitudes about \n     drugs, and were much more aware of the risks of drugs than \n     students in non-Channel One schools. I am pleased to here add \n     my praise of their efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Sam Brownback,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Partnership For a\n\n\n                                            Drug-Free America,\n\n                                       New York, NY, May 14, 1999.\n     Mr. Kevin McAliley,\n     President and CEO, Channel One Network,\n     New York, NY.\n       Dear Mr. McAliley: I am writing to thank Channel One for \n     its unceasing dedication and steadfast commitment to \n     educating the young people of this country about the dangers \n     of drug use. Channel One has supported the Partnership's \n     mission by extensively covering the drug issue through your \n     programming and by airing more than $25 million worth of \n     anti-drug public service announcements--pro bono--since your \n     inception in 1990. The incontrovertible fact is that because \n     of Channel One, millions of teens are keeping away from \n     drugs.\n       For the past ten years, Channel One has been instrumental \n     in supporting Partnership for a Drug-Free America's mission \n     by changing millions of young people's attitudes about drugs. \n     This is not speculation--it is fact. The Partnership \n     conducted the Partnership Attitude Tracking Study, 1995-1997 \n     and compared Channel One students' attitudes towards drug use \n     versus those of students from non-Channel One schools. The \n     study found conclusive evidence that Channel One students had \n     significantly more negative attitudes about drugs and were \n     much more\n\n[[Page S9419]]\n\n     aware of the risks of drugs than students in non-Channel One \n     schools. By utilizing your Web site, Channel One has also \n     been able to expand its reach beyond the Channel One school \n     audience and encourage national youth involvement in this \n     issue.\n       Please accept our thanks and congratulations for Channel \n     One's important work. Channel One's passion and concern for \n     America's children is admirable and your support of the \n     Partnership has been vital in reinforcing anti-drug messages \n     to teens.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard D.

Sense of Senate with Respect to Promoting Travel \n     and Tourism.

Such a general \n     extension service would be analogous to the Manufacturing \n     Extension Program managed by the National Institute of \n     Standards and Technology, and the Cooperative Extension \n     Service managed by the Department of Agriculture. The report \n     shall address, at a minimum, the following--\n       (1) the need for or opportunity presented by such a \n     program;\n       (2) some of the specific services that such a program \n     should provide and to whom;\n       (3) how such a program would serve firms in rural or \n     isolated areas;\n       (4) how such a program should be established, organized, \n     and managed;\n       (5) the estimated costs of such a program; and\n       (6) the potential benefits of such a program to both small \n     businesses and the economy as a whole.\n       Sec. 212. Sense of the Senate Regarding the European \n     Council Noise Rule Affecting Hushkitted and Reengined \n     Aircraft. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) for more than 50 years, the International Civil \n     Aviation Organization (ICAO) has been the single entity \n     vested with the authority to establish international noise \n     and emissions standards; through ICAO's efforts, aircraft \n     noise has decreased by an average of 40 percent since 1970;\n       (2) ICAO is currently working on an expedited basis on even \n     more stringent international noise standards, taking into \n     account economic reasonableness, technical feasibility and \n     environmental benefits;\n       (3) international noise and emissions standards are \n     critical to maintaining United States aeronautical \n     industries' economic viability and to obtaining their ongoing \n     commitment to progressively more stringent noise reduction \n     efforts;\n       (4) European Council (EC) Regulation No. 925/1999, banning \n     certain aircraft meeting the highest internationally \n     recognized noise standards from flying in Europe, undermines \n     the integrity of the ICAO process and undercuts the \n     likelihood that new Stage 4 standards can be developed;\n       (5) while no regional standard is acceptable, this \n     regulation is particularly offensive; there is no scientific \n     basis for the regulation and it has been carefully crafted to \n     protect European aviation interests while imposing arbitrary, \n     substantial and unfounded cost burdens on United States \n     aeronautical industries;\n       (6) the vast majority of aircraft that will be affected by \n     EC Regulation No. 925/1999 are operated by United States flag \n     carriers; and\n       (7) the implementation of EC Regulation No. 925/1999 will \n     result in a loss of jobs in the United States and may cost \n     the United States aviation industry in excess of \n     $2,000,000,000.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) EC Regulation No. 925/1999 should be rescinded by the \n     EC at the earliest possible time;\n       (2) that if this is not done, the Department of State \n     should file a petition regarding EC Regulation No. 925/1999 \n     with ICAO pursuant to Article 84 of the Chicago Convention; \n     and\n       (3) the Departments of Commerce and Transportation and the \n     United States Trade Representative should use all reasonable \n     means available to them to ensure that the goal of having the \n     rule repealed is achieved.\n       This title may be cited as the ``Department of Commerce and \n     Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000''.\n\n                        TITLE III--THE JUDICIARY\n\n                   Supreme Court of the United States\n\n\n                         salaries and expenses\n\n       For expenses necessary for the operation of the Supreme \n     Court, as required by law, excluding care of the building and \n     grounds, including purchase or hire, driving, maintenance, \n     and operation of an automobile for the Chief Justice, not to \n     exceed $10,000 for the purpose of transporting Associate \n     Justices, and hire of passenger motor vehicles as authorized \n     by 31 U.S.C. 1343 and 1344;

The Secretary of Commerce (hereinafter the \n     ``Secretary'') is hereby authorized and directed to create an \n     ``Interagency Task Force on Indian Arts and Crafts \n     Enforcement'' to be composed of representatives of the United \n     States Trade Representative, the Department of Commerce, the \n     Department of the Interior, the Department of Justice, the \n     Department of the Treasury, the International Trade \n     Administration, and representatives of other agencies and \n     departments in the discretion of the Secretary to devise and \n     implement a coordinated enforcement response to prevent the \n     sale or distribution of any product or goods sold in or \n     shipped to the United States that is not in compliance with \n     the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1935, as amended.\n       Sec. 622 (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) When telephone area codes were first introduced in \n     1947, 86 area codes covered all of North America. There are \n     now more than 215 area codes, and an additional 70 area codes \n     may be required in the next 2 years.\n       (2) The current system for allocating numbers to \n     telecommunications carriers is woefully inefficient, leading \n     to the exhaustion of a telephone area code long before all \n     the telephone numbers covered by the area code are actually \n     in use.\n       (3) The proliferation of new telephone area codes causes \n     economic dislocation for businesses and unnecessary cost, \n     confusion, and inconvenience for households.\n       (4) Principles and approaches exist that would increase the \n     efficiency with which telecommunications carriers use \n     telephone numbering resources.\n       (5) The May 27, l999, rulemaking proceeding of the Federal \n     Communications Commission relating to numbering resource \n     optimization seeks to address the growing problem of the \n     exhaustion of telephone area codes.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Federal Communications Commission shall release its \n     report and order on numbering resource optimization not later \n     than December 31, 1999;\n       (2) such report and order should minimize any disruptions \n     and costs to consumers and businesses associated with the \n     implementation of such report and order; and\n       (3) such report and order should apply not only to large \n     metropolitan areas but to all areas of the United States that \n     are facing the problem of exhaustion of telephone numbers.\n       Sec. 623.

(a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of \n     terrorism by the Secretary of State and continues to be among \n     the most active supporters of terrorism in the world.\n       (2) According to the State Department's annual report \n     entitled ``Patterns of Global Terrorism'', Iran supports \n     Hizballah, Hamas, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, \n     terrorist organizations which oppose the Middle East peace \n     process, continue to work for the destruction of Israel, and \n     have killed United States citizens.\n       (3) A United States district court ruled in March 1998 that \n     Iran should pay $247,000,000 to the family of Alisa Flatow, a \n     United States citizen killed in a bomb attack orchestrated by \n     the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza in April 1995.\n       (4) The Government of Iran continues to maintain a \n     repressive political regime in which the civil liberties of \n     the people of Iran are denied.\n       (5) The State Department Country Report on Human Rights \n     states that the human rights record of the Government of Iran \n     remains poor, including ``extra judicial killings and summary \n     executions; disappearances; widespread use of torture and \n     other degrading treatment; harsh prison conditions; arbitrary \n     arrest and detention; lack of due process; unfair trials; \n     infringement on citizen's privacy; and restrictions on \n     freedom of speech, press, assembly, association, religion, \n     and movement''.\n       (6) Religious minorities in Iran have been persecuted \n     solely because of their faith, and the Government of Iran has \n     detained 13 members of Iran's Jewish community without \n     charge.\n       (7) Recent student-led protests in Iran were repressed by \n     force, with possibly five students losing their lives and \n     hundreds more being imprisoned.\n       (8) The Government of Iran is pursuing an aggressive \n     ballistic missile program with foreign assistance and is \n     seeking to develop weapons of mass destruction which threaten \n     United States allies and interests.\n       (9) Despite the continuation by the Government of Iran of \n     repressive activities in Iran and efforts to threaten United \n     States allies and interests in the Near East and South Asia, \n     the President waived provisions of the Iran and Libya \n     Sanctions Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-172; 50 U.S.C. 1701 \n     note) intended to impede development of the energy sector in \n     Iran.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the President should condemn in the strongest possible \n     terms the failure of the Government of Iran to implement \n     genuine political reforms and protect the civil liberties of \n     the people of Iran, which failure was most recently \n     demonstrated in the violent repression of student-led \n     protests in Teheran and other cities by the Government of \n     Iran;\n       (2) the President should support democratic opposition \n     groups in Iran more aggressively;\n       (3) the detention of 13 members of the Iranian Jewish \n     community by the Government of Iran is a deplorable violation \n     of due process and a clear example of the policies of the \n     Government of Iran to persecute religious minorities; and\n       (4) the decision of the President to waive provisions of \n     the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act of 1996 intended to impede \n     development of the energy sector in Iran was regrettable and \n     should be reversed as long as Iran continues to threaten \n     United States interests and allies in the Near East and South \n     Asia through state sponsorship of terrorism and efforts to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to \n     deliver such weapons.\n       Sec. 629. Section 203(p)(1)(B) of the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 484(p)(1)(B)) \n     is amended--\n       (1) by striking clause (ii);\n       (2) by inserting ``or public safety'' after ``law \n     enforcement'';\n       (3) by striking ``(i)'';\n       (4) by striking ``(I)'' and inserting ``(i)''; and\n       (5) by striking ``(II)'' and inserting ``(ii)''.\n       Sec. 630. Protection of Seniors and the Disabled in Federal \n     Family Violence Prevention Programs. (a) Findings.--Congress \n     finds that--\n       (1) of the estimated more than 1,000,000 persons age 65 and \n     over who are victims of family violence each year, at least \n     \\2/3\\ are women;\n       (2) national statistics are not available on the incidence \n     of domestic or family violence and sexual assault against \n     disabled women, although several studies indicate that abuse \n     of disabled women is of a longer duration compared to abuse \n     suffered by women who are not disabled;\n       (3) in almost 9 out of 10 incidents of domestic elder abuse \n     and neglect, the perpetrator is a family member, and adult \n     children of the victims are the largest category of \n     perpetrators and spouses are the second largest category of \n     perpetrators;\n       (4) the number of reports of elder abuse in the United \n     States increased by 150 percent between 1986 and 1996 and is \n     expected to continue increasing;\n       (5) it is estimated that at least 5 percent of the Nation's \n     elderly are victims of moderate to severe abuse and that the \n     rate for all forms of abuse may be as high as 10 percent;\n       (6) elder abuse is severely underreported, with 1 in 5 \n     cases being reported in 1980 and only 1 in 8 cases being \n     reported today;\n       (7) many older and disabled women fail to report abuse \n     because of shame or as a result of prior unsatisfactory \n     experiences with individual agencies or others who lack \n     sensitivity to the concerns or needs of older or disabled \n     individuals;\n       (8) many older or disabled individuals also fail to report \n     abuse because they are dependent on their abusers and fear \n     being abandoned or institutionalized;\n       (9) disabled women may fear reporting abuse because they \n     are fearful of losing their children in a custody case;\n       (10) public and professional awareness and identification \n     of violence against older or disabled Americans may be \n     difficult because these persons are not integrated into many \n     social networks (such as schools or jobs), and may become \n     isolated in their homes, which can increase the risk of \n     domestic abuse; and\n       (11) older and disabled Americans would greatly benefit \n     from policies that develop, strengthen, and implement \n     programs for the prevention of abuse, including neglect and \n     exploitation, and provide related assistance for victims.\n       (b) In General.--Part T of title I of the Omnibus Crime \n     Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 is amended--\n       (1) in section 2001 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg)--\n       (A) in subsection (a)--\n       (i) by inserting ``, including older women and women with a \n     disability'' after ``combat violent crimes against women'';

Short Title. This title may be cited as the \n     ``Children Who Witness Domestic Violence Protection Act''.\n       Sec. 802. Findings. Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Witnessing domestic violence has a devastating impact \n     on children, placing the children at high risk for anxiety, \n     depression, and, potentially, suicide. Many children who \n     witness domestic violence exhibit more aggressive, \n     antisocial, fearful, and inhibited behaviors.\n       (2) Children exposed to domestic violence have a high risk \n     of experiencing learning difficulties and school failure. \n     Research finds that children residing in domestic violence \n     shelters exhibit significantly lower verbal and quantitative \n     skills when compared to a national sample of children.\n       (3) Domestic violence is strongly correlated with child \n     abuse. Studies have found that between 50 and 70 percent of \n     men who abuse their female partners also abuse their \n     children. In homes in which domestic violence occurs, \n     children are physically abused and neglected at a rate 15 \n     times higher than the national average.\n       (4) Men who witnessed parental abuse during their childhood \n     have a higher risk of becoming physically aggressive in \n     dating and marital relationships.\n       (5) Exposure to domestic violence is a strong predictor of \n     violent delinquent behavior among adolescents. It is \n     estimated that between 20 percent and 40 percent of \n     chronically violent adolescents have witnessed extreme \n     parental conflict.\n       (6) Women have an increased risk of experiencing battering \n     after separation from an abusive partner. Children also have \n     an increased risk of suffering harm during separation.\n       (7) Child visitation disputes are more frequent when \n     families have histories of domestic violence, and the need \n     for supervised visitation centers far exceeds the number of \n     available programs providing those centers, because courts \n     therefore--\n       (A) order unsupervised visitation and endanger parents and \n     children; or\n       (B) prohibit visitation altogether.\n       (8) Recent studies have demonstrated that up to 50 percent \n     of children who appear before juvenile courts in matters \n     involving allegations of abuse and neglect have been exposed \n     to domestic violence in their homes.\n       Sec. 803. Definitions. In this title:\n       (1) Domestic violence.--The term ``domestic violence'' \n     includes an act or threat of violence, not including an act \n     of self defense, committed by a current or former spouse of \n     the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child \n     in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has \n     cohabited with the victim, by a person who is or has been in \n     a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with \n     the victim, by a person similarly situated to a spouse of the \n     victim under the domestic or family violence laws of the \n     jurisdiction of the victim, or by any other person against a \n     victim who is protected from that person's act under the \n     domestic or family violence laws of the jurisdiction.\n       (2) Indian tribal government.--The term ``Indian tribal \n     government'' has the meaning given the term ``tribal \n     organization'' in section 102 of the Older Americans Act of \n     1965 (42 U.S.C. 3002).\n       (3) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin \n     Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands.\n       (4) Witness domestic violence.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``witness domestic violence'' \n     means to witness--\n       (i) an act of domestic violence that constitutes actual or \n     attempted physical assault; or\n       (ii) a threat or other action that places the victim in \n     fear of domestic violence.\n       (B) Witness.--In subparagraph (A), the term ``witness'' \n     means to--\n       (i) directly observe an act, threat, or action described in \n     subparagraph (A), or the aftermath of that act, threat, or \n     action; or\n       (ii) be within earshot of an act, threat, or action \n     described in subparagraph (A), or the aftermath of that act, \n     threat, or action.\n       Sec. 804.

Congress finds that--\n       (1) the incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, national origin, religion, sexual \n     orientation, gender, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem;\n       (2) such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive;\n       (3) existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem;\n       (4) such violence affects interstate commerce in many ways, \n     including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment or participating in other commercial activity;\n       (5) perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence;\n       (6) instrumentalities of interstate commerce are used to \n     facilitate the commission of such violence;\n       (7) such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce;\n       (8) violence motivated by bias that is a relic of slavery \n     can constitute badges and incidents of slavery;\n       (9) although many State and local authorities are now and \n     will continue to be responsible for prosecuting the \n     overwhelming majority of violent crimes in the United States, \n     including violent crimes motivated by bias, Federal \n     jurisdiction over certain violent crimes motivated by bias is \n     necessary to supplement State and local jurisdiction and \n     ensure that justice is achieved in each case;\n       (10) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes;\n       (11) the problem of hate crime is sufficiently serious, \n     widespread, and interstate in nature as to warrant Federal \n     assistance to States and local jurisdictions; and\n       (12) freedom of speech and association are fundamental \n     values protected by the first amendment to the Constitution \n     of the United States, and it is the purpose of this title to \n     criminalize acts of violence, and threats of violence, \n     carried out because of the actual or perceived race, color, \n     religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or \n     disability of the victim, not to criminalize beliefs in the \n     abstract.\n       Sec. 903. Definition of Hate Crime. In this title, the term \n     ``hate crime'' has the same meaning as in section 280003(a) \n     of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 \n     (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n       Sec. 904. Prohibition of Certain Acts of Violence. Section \n     245 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (c) and (d) as subsections \n     (d) and (e), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (b) the following:\n       ``(c)(1) Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, \n     willfully causes bodily injury to any person or, through the \n     use of fire, a firearm, or an explosive device, attempts to \n     cause bodily injury to any person, because of the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, or national origin of any \n     person--\n       ``(A) shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years, or fined \n     in accordance with this title, or both; and\n       ``(B) shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for \n     life, or fined in accordance with this title, or both if--\n       ``(i) death results from the acts committed in violation of \n     this paragraph; or\n       ``(ii) the acts committed in violation of this paragraph \n     include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual \n     abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an \n     attempt to kill.\n       ``(2)(A) Whoever, whether or not acting under color of law, \n     in any circumstance described in subparagraph (B), willfully \n     causes bodily injury to any person or, through the use of \n     fire, a firearm, or an explosive device, attempts to cause \n     bodily injury to any person, because of the actual or \n     perceived religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability \n     of any person--\n       ``(i) shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years, or fined \n     in accordance with this title, or both; and\n       ``(ii) shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for \n     life, or fined in accordance with this title, or both, if--\n       ``(I) death results from the acts committed in violation of \n     this paragraph; or\n       ``(II) the acts committed in violation of this paragraph \n     include kidnapping or an attempt to kidnap, aggravated sexual \n     abuse or an attempt to commit aggravated sexual abuse, or an \n     attempt to kill.\n       ``(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the circumstances \n     described in this subparagraph are that--\n       ``(i) in connection with the offense, the defendant or the \n     victim travels in interstate or foreign commerce, uses a \n     facility or instrumentality of interstate or foreign \n     commerce, or engages in any activity affecting interstate or \n     foreign commerce; or\n       ``(ii) the offense is in or affects interstate or foreign \n     commerce.\n       ``(3) No prosecution of any offense described in this \n     subsection may be undertaken by the United States, except \n     upon the certification in writing of the Attorney General, \n     the Deputy Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General, \n     or any Assistant Attorney General specially designated by the \n     Attorney General that--\n       ``(A) he or she has reasonable cause to believe that the \n     actual or perceived race, color, national origin, religion, \n     sexual orientation, gender, or disability of any person was a \n     motivating factor underlying the alleged conduct of the \n     defendant; and\n       ``(B) that he or his designee or she or her designee has \n     consulted with State or local law enforcement officials \n     regarding the prosecution and determined that--\n       ``(i) the State does not have jurisdiction or refuses to \n     assume jurisdiction;\n       ``(ii) the State has requested that the Federal Government \n     assume jurisdiction; or\n       ``(iii) actions by State and local law enforcement \n     officials have or are likely to leave demonstratively \n     unvindicated the Federal interest in eradicating bias-\n     motivated violence.''.\n       Sec. 905. Duties of Federal Sentencing Commission. (a) \n     Amendment of Federal Sentencing Guidelines.--Pursuant to its \n     authority under section 994 of title 28, United States Code, \n     the United States Sentencing Commission shall study the issue \n     of adult recruitment of juveniles to commit hate crimes and \n     shall, if appropriate, amend the Federal sentencing \n     guidelines to provide sentencing enhancements (in addition to \n     the sentencing enhancement provided for the use of a minor \n     during the commission of an offense) for adult defendants who \n     recruit juveniles to assist in the commission of hate crimes.\n       (b) Consistency With Other Guidelines.--In carrying out \n     this section, the United States Sentencing Commission shall--\n       (1) ensure that there is reasonable consistency with other \n     Federal sentencing guidelines; and\n       (2) avoid duplicative punishments for substantially the \n     same offense.\n       Sec. 906. Grant Program. (a) Authority to Make Grants.--The \n     Office of Justice Programs of the Department of Justice shall \n     make grants, in accordance with such regulations as the \n     Attorney General may prescribe, to State and local programs \n     designed to combat hate crimes committed by juveniles, \n     including programs to train local law enforcement officers in \n     investigating, prosecuting, and preventing hate crimes.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n       Sec. 907. Authorization for Additional Personnel to Assist \n     State and Local Law Enforcement. There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to the Department of the Treasury and the \n     Department of Justice, including the Community Relations \n     Service, for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002 such sums as \n     are\n\n[[Page S9441]]\n\n     necessary to increase the number of personnel to prevent and \n     respond to alleged violations of section 245 of title 18, \n     United States Code (as amended by this title).\n       Sec. 908. Severability. If any provision of this title, an \n     amendment made by this title, or the application of such \n     provision or amendment to any person or circumstance is held \n     to be unconstitutional, the remainder of this title, the \n     amendments made by this title, and the application of the \n     provisions of such to any person or circumstance shall not be \n     affected thereby.\n       Sec. 909. Hate Crimes. (a) Declarations.--Congress declares \n     that--\n       (1) further efforts must be taken at all levels of \n     government to respond to the staggering brutality of hate \n     crimes that have riveted public attention and shocked the \n     Nation;\n       (2) hate crimes are prompted by bias and are committed to \n     send a message of hate to targeted communities, usually \n     defined on the basis of immutable traits;\n       (3) the prominent characteristic of a hate crime is that it \n     devastates not just the actual victim and the victim's family \n     and friends, but frequently savages the community sharing the \n     traits that caused the victim to be selected;\n       (4) any efforts undertaken by the Federal Government to \n     combat hate crimes must respect the primacy that States and \n     local officials have traditionally been accorded in the \n     criminal prosecution of acts constituting hate crimes; and\n       (5) an overly broad reaction by the Federal Government to \n     this serious problem might ultimately diminish the \n     accountability of State and local officials in responding to \n     hate crimes and transgress the constitutional limitations on \n     the powers vested in Congress under the Constitution.\n       (b) Studies.--\n       (1) Collection of data.--\n       (A) Definition of hate crime.--In this paragraph, the term \n     ``hate crime'' means--\n       (i) a crime described in subsection (b)(1) of the first \n     section of the Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 \n     note); and\n       (ii) a crime that manifests evidence of prejudice based on \n     gender or age.\n       (B) Collection from cross-section of states.--Not later \n     than 120 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Comptroller General of the United States, in consultation \n     with the National Governors' Association, shall select 10 \n     jurisdictions with laws classifying certain types of crimes \n     as hate crimes and 10 jurisdictions without such laws from \n     which to collect data described in subparagraph (C) over a \n     12-month period.\n       (C) Data to be collected.--The data to be collected are--\n       (i) the number of hate crimes that are reported and \n     investigated;\n       (ii) the percentage of hate crimes that are prosecuted and \n     the percentage that result in conviction;\n       (iii) the length of the sentences imposed for crimes \n     classified as hate crimes within a jurisdiction, compared \n     with the length of sentences imposed for similar crimes \n     committed in jurisdictions with no hate crime laws; and\n       (iv) references to and descriptions of the laws under which \n     the offenders were punished.\n       (D) Costs.--Participating jurisdictions shall be reimbursed \n     for the reasonable and necessary costs of compiling data \n     under this paragraph.\n       (2) Study of trends.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States and the General Accounting Office shall complete a \n     study that analyzes the data collected under paragraph (1) \n     and under the Hate Crime Statistics Act of 1990 to determine \n     the extent of hate crime activity throughout the country and \n     the success of State and local officials in combating that \n     activity.\n       (B) Identification of trends.--In the study conducted under \n     subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General of the United \n     States and the General Accounting Office shall identify any \n     trends in the commission of hate crimes specifically by--\n       (i) geographic region;\n       (ii) type of crime committed; and\n       (iii) the number of hate crimes that are prosecuted and the \n     number for which convictions are obtained.\n       (c) Model Statute.--\n       (1) In general.--To encourage the identification and \n     prosecution of hate crimes throughout the country, the \n     Attorney General shall, through the National Conference of \n     Commissioners on Uniform State Laws of the American Law \n     Institute or another appropriate forum, and in consultation \n     with the States, develop a model statute to carry out the \n     goals described in subsection (a) and criminalize acts \n     classified as hate crimes.\n       (2) Requirements.--In developing the model statute, the \n     Attorney General shall--\n       (A) include in the model statute crimes that manifest \n     evidence of prejudice; and\n       (B) prepare an analysis of all reasons why any crime \n     motivated by prejudice based on any traits of a victim should \n     or should not be included.\n       (d) Support for Criminal Investigations and Prosecutions by \n     State and Local Law Enforcement Officials.--\n       (1) Assistance other than financial assistance.--\n       (A) In general.--At the request of a law enforcement \n     official of a State or a political subdivision of a State, \n     the Attorney General, acting through the Director of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, shall provide technical, \n     forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form of assistance in \n     the criminal investigation or prosecution of any crime that--\n       (i) constitutes a crime of violence (as defined in section \n     16 of title 18, United States Code);\n       (ii) constitutes a felony under the laws of the State; and\n       (iii) is motivated by prejudice based on the victim's race, \n     ethnicity, or religion or is a violation of the State's hate \n     crime law.\n       (B) Priority.--In providing assistance under subparagraph \n     (A), the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes \n     committed by offenders who have committed crimes in more than \n     1 State.\n       (2) Grants.--\n       (A) In general.--There is established a grant program \n     within the Department of Justice to assist State and local \n     officials in the investigation and prosecution of hate \n     crimes.\n       (B) Eligibility.--A State or political subdivision of a \n     State applying for assistance under this paragraph shall--\n       (i) describe the purposes for which the grant is needed;

Mr. President, after weeks of difficult decisions, \ndecisions which have in too many respects divided us by party, we have \ntoday an easy vote--a vote on which we can all agree. We can support \nreservists and small business by voting for S. 918, the Military \nReservists Small Business Relief Act of 1999. When I introduced this \nbill on April 29th, it had 31 cosponsors. It now has the endorsement of \n52 Senators--31 Democrats and 21 Republicans.\n  A majority of the Senate--Senators from Maine to Utah, Michigan to \nNorth Carolina--have said that the men and women who serve as \nreservists need and deserve help maintaining their businesses while \nthey are serving on active duty. That is an important statement about \nour commitment to the reservists who serve our country.\n  Today, more than 4,700 reservists are serving on active duty around \nthe world. Where are they? In Haiti, Iraq, Bosnia, and Kosovo. And \nwhere are their businesses and jobs? Pick any state--Massachusetts, \nArizona, Georgia, Ohio, Michigan.\n  When these men and women are called to action, they often have little \nnotice, and their families face financial and emotional hardships. With \nhalf of America's military forces serving in reserve and National Guard \nunits--a total of 1.4 million Americans--the Pentagon has acknowledged \nthat extensive missions now require quicker call-ups. As a veteran of \nthe Vietnam War and Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee, I \nknow how disruptive active service can be for reservists who are \nsuddenly called away from their families and work to serve our country.\n  What does a small business with few financial or personal reserves do \nwithout the owner, manager or employee who is essential to the daily \noperation and success of the small business? If you're in a rural area \nor small town, it will be hard to find a replacement. And if your \nfamily steps in, often they don't have the experience or time to run \nthe business. A Commander from Danvers, Mass, who owns two gas station \nconvenience stores said the tight job market only exacerbates the \ndifficulty of finding a replacement, and that training someone well \nenough to ``leave the\n\n[[Page S9443]]\n\nbusiness in [their] hands would be near impossible.'' We need to help \nthese men and women, their families and communities, bridge the gap \nbetween when the troops leave and when they return.\n  The Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act of 1999 offers \nsmall businessmen and women three types of assistance. First, it \nauthorizes the SBA to defer loan repayments and to reduce interest \nrates on any of its direct loans, including disaster loans. The \ndeferrals and reductions authorized by this bill are available from the \ndate that the military reservist is called to active duty until 180 \ndays after his or her release from active duty.\n  For microloans and loans guaranteed under the SBA's financial \nassistance programs, such as the 504 and 7(a) loan programs, the bill \ndirects the Agency to develop policies that encourage and facilitate \nways for SBA lenders to defer or reduce loan repayments. For example, a \nmicrolenders' ability to repay its debt to the SBA is dependent upon \npayments from microborrowers. So, with this bill's authority, if a \nmicrolender extends or defers loan repayment to a borrower who is a \ndeployed military reservist, in turn the SBA would extend repayment \nobligations to the microlender.\n  Second, the bill establishes a low-interest economic injury loan \nprogram to be administered by the SBA through its disaster loan \nprogram. These loans would be available to provide interim operating \ncapital to any small business when the departure of a miliary reservist \nto active duty causes substantial economic injury. Under the bill, such \nharm includes three general cases: inability to make loan payments; \ninability to pay ordinary and necessary operating expenses; or \ninability to market, produce or provide a service or product that it \nordinarily provides. Under this provision, an eligible small business \nmay apply for an economic injury loan from the date that the company's \nmilitary reservist is ordered to active duty until 90 days after \nrelease from active duty.\n\n  Third, the bill directs the SBA and all of its private sector \npartners, such as the Small Business Development Centers and the \nWomen's Business Centers, to make every effort to reach out to those \nbusinesses affected by call up of military reservists to active duty \nand offer business counseling and training. Those left behind to run \nthe business, whether it's a spouse, a child, or an employee, while the \nmilitary reservist is serving, may be inexperienced in running the \nbusiness and need quick access to management and marketing counseling. \nWe need to do what we can to help them keep their doors open and reduce \nthe impact of military conflicts and national emergencies on the \neconomy.\n  Finally, at the insightful suggestion of my colleague Senator Levin, \nthe bill will be effective for all qualified reservists who are \ndemobilized as of March 24th, 1999. According to the Department of \nDefense, 1,266 reservists have been demobilized from Bosnia, Iraq and \nKosovo since the 24th.\n  The provisions for this bill should already be available for those \nwho need it, and I deeply regret that this bill hasn't been acted on \nearlier. The nature of the legislation is uncontroversial, it passed \nthe Committee on Small Business June 9th, almost 50 days ago, by \nunanimous consent and, to repeat, it has the endorsement of 51 \nSenators. Since then, it has also passed the full House and the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business as part of H.R. 1568, the Veterans \nEntrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999.\n  As much as I am frustrated by the delay on this bill, it probably \ndoesn't compare to that of reservists who are on active duty and losing \nsleep over how they are going to keep their businesses going and avoid \nruining their credit records. Ask the truck driver who serves in the \nMissouri National Air Guard and reported to active duty four months \nago. He bought a new rig shortly before being called up and has hefty \nmonthly payments to meet. He lined up a replacement to drive his truck \nwhile he was gone to keep money coming in, but the driver backed out of \nthe agreement right before the reservist was to leave.\n  He tried to do the right thing--to implement a contingent plan--and \nyet something beyond his control interfered. It's hard to keep your \ncustomers happy when their merchandise isn't getting delivered. And \nit's even harder to make your loan payments when you're not bringing in \nenough money.\n  Or ask the reservist from Oklahoma who has supported his wife and \nfour children for the past five years with a carpet and upholstery \nbusiness. In 1998, he was called up for eight months, and he's been \nactive this year since May 8th. What made it particularly damaging for \nhis business this year was that he was called up at the beginning of \nthe industry's high season. January to April are slow times, and April \nto December are the money-making months. He called my office a month \nago to find out about this bill and find out how he could get \nassistance.\n  Though this bill was still waiting for action by the full Senate, we \nput him in contact with the SBA headquarters in Oklahoma to find some \nway to help. After reviewing his options and what it would take to \nresuscitate his business, he called to say that he was closing shop for \ngood: ``I'm just going to close my business down. I'm not going to try \nto get a small business loan. I want to cut my losses now. . . .''\n  We have yet to know the full impact on and needs of reservists \ncurrently deployed, but, unfortunately, we know the veteran reservists \nof the Persian Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm, suffered substantial \nset-backs while away from their businesses. They left their businesses \nor companies in good shape and returned to hardships ranging from \nbankruptcy to financial ruin, from deserted clients to layoffs.\n  When I introduced this bill, I talked about a small-business owner \nfrom New England, a physician and Lieutenant Commander in the Navy \nReserve. He was called up for Operation Desert Storm as a flight \nsurgeon in January 1991. For ten years, he had been a solo \npractitioner. After six months of service, he had to file bankruptcy. \nThat bankruptcy affected not only him and his wife, but also his two \nemployees and their families. After one year on duty, he returned home \nto face civilian life without a business or a job. He was only one of \nmany. We must never let that happen again.\n  The Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act is timely because \nit can help those 6,500 reservists who have been serving in Kosovo \nsince as far back as March. Even those who have already come home and \nare struggling to keep their businesses afloat. However, it is also \nimportant for future reservists because it can offer them relief if \nthey serve any future contingency operations such as Kosovo, military \nconflicts or national emergencies.\n  For example, in 1993, the National Guard in Missouri was deployed for \ntwo months to help with the devastating flood of the Missouri and \nMississippi Rivers that left 14 miles of Missouri river-front land \nunder water. While on active duty, two reservists, one with a \nsuccessful hair salon in a suburb of St. Louis and another with a \npainting business in Rolla, lost so many of their clients they \neventually had to close their small businesses. One of them resigned \nfrom the National Guard after that experience because he felt it had \ntaken too big a toll on his life. At a time when America so badly needs \nmore of our citizens to give of themselves, to sign up as military \nreservists, to make a sacrifice, we must pass this bill to make sure \nthat service will not mean financial ruin. We must pass this \nlegislation to take a stand for our reservists.\n  In closing, I want to thank and acknowledge Jan Behon of Pittsburgh, \nPennsylvania, and Dr. Harold V. Nelson of Louisville, Kentucky, who \nvolunteer for SERRR, the Self-Employed Recalled Reservists and Retirees \ncommittee, for their support, years of sacrifice and experience that \nthey lent to this bill.\n  I also want to thank the National Guard Association of the United \nStates for backing this legislation and ask that the Association's \nletter of support be included in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, particularly the 51 cosponsors \nof my bill, for their support of this important legislation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nCommittee substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be \nread the third time, and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n\n[[Page S9444]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of H.R. 66, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 66) to preserve the cultural resources of the \n     Route 66 corridor and to authorize the Secretary of Interior \n     to provide assistance.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 66) was considered read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am so very pleased that the Senate has \npassed H.R. 66, and taken an historic step in preserving one of \nAmerica's cultural treasures--Route 66. I have long championed \npreservation of Route 66, the ``Mother Road,'' which changed and shaped \nAmerica in the twentieth century. This body had already passed my \nlegislation earlier this year, S. 292, the Route 66 Corridor \nPreservation Act. Congresswoman Heather Wilson of Albuquerque, New \nMexico, reintroduced a companion bill (H.R. 66) in the House of \nRepresentatives, and after a few amendments, we have finally got \nlegislation which will preserve the unique cultural resources along the \nfamous Route and authorize the Interior Secretary to provide assistance \nthrough the Park Service. I have been working for this day for nine \nyears.\n  This legislation almost became law at the end of the 105th Congress, \nbut failed to pass in the House of Representatives due to last minute \npolitical wrangling. However, no one has ever questioned the merit of \nthis legislation.\n  I introduced the ``Route 66 Study Act of 1990,'' which directed the \nNational Park Service to determine the best ways to preserve, \ncommemorate, and interpret Route 66. As a result of that study, I \nintroduced legislation last Congress authorizing the National Park \nService to join with Federal, State, and private efforts to preserve \naspects of historic Route 66, the Nation's most important thoroughfare \nfor East-West migration in the twentieth century.\n  H.R. 66 authorizes a funding level over 10 years and stresses that we \nwant the Federal Government to support grassroots efforts to preserve \naspects of this historic highway. The Secretary of the Interior can now \nsupport State, local, tribal, and private organizations' efforts to \npreserve these resources.\n  Designated in 1926, the 2,200-mile Route 66 stretched from Chicago to \nSanta Monica, CA. It rolled through eight American States and three \ntime zones. In New Mexico, it went through the communities of \nTucumcari, Santa Rosa, Albuquerque, Grants, and Gallup. New Mexico \nadded to the aura of Route 66, giving new generations of Americans \ntheir first experience of our colorful culture and heritage. Route 66 \nallowed generations of vacationers to travel to previously remote areas \nand experience the natural beauty and cultures of the Southwest and Far \nWest.\n  While mobility of Americans has increased, few have forgotten the \nimpact of this two-lane roadway of our youth. The ``Grapes of Wrath'' \nillustrates how depression-era families utilized this ``Mother Road'' \nto escape the dust bowl and start new lives in the West. The western \nU.S. was later opened to tourism, and many people learned the beauties \nof this entire country, Midwest to West. And I think a few folks \ndiscovered that New Mexico really is the Land of Enchantment.\n  The bill is designed to assist private efforts to preserve structures \nand other cultural resources of the historic Route 66 corridor. I am \npleased that as we reach the turn of the century, we have recognized \nthis historic landmark, and the impact it had on this Nation in this \ncentury.\n  I thank my colleagues for once again recognizing the importance of \nthis legislation. I also want to thank the many New Mexicans and the \nNational Historic Route 66 Federation for their support and help in \nthis effort. Finally we will have a law recognizing the twentieth \ncentury equivalent to the Santa Fe Trail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9444-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9444-S9447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MUHAMMAD ALI BOXING REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 161, S. 305.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 305) to reform unfair and anticompetitive \n     practices in the professional boxing industry.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, with amendments; as follows:\n\n  (The parts of the bill intended to be stricken are shown in boldface \nbrackets and the parts of the bill intended to be inserted are shown in \nitalic.)\n\n                                 S. 305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Professional boxing differs from other major, \n     interstate professional sports industries in the United \n     States in that it operates without any private sector \n     association, league, or centralized industry organization to \n     establish uniform and appropriate business practices and \n     ethical standards. This has led to repeated occurrences of \n     disreputable and coercive business practices in the boxing \n     industry, to the detriment of professional boxers nationwide.\n       (2) Professional boxers are vulnerable to exploitative \n     business practices engaged in by certain promoters and \n     sanctioning bodies which dominate the sport. Boxers do not \n     have an established representative group to advocate for \n     their interests and rights in the industry.\n       (3) State officials are the proper regulators of \n     professional boxing events, and must protect the welfare of \n     professional boxers and serve the public interest by closely \n     supervising boxing activity in their jurisdiction. State \n     boxing commissions do not currently receive adequate \n     information to determine whether boxers competing in their \n     jurisdiction are being subjected to contract terms and \n     business practices which may be violative of State \n     regulations, or are onerous and confiscatory.\n       (4) Promoters who engage in illegal, coercive, or unethical \n     business practices can take advantage of the lack of \n     equitable business standards in the sport by holding boxing \n     events in states with weaker regulatory oversight.\n       (5) The sanctioning organizations which have proliferated \n     in the boxing industry have not established credible and \n     objective criteria to rate professional boxers, and operate \n     with virtually no industry or public oversight. Their ratings \n     are susceptible to manipulation, have deprived boxers of fair \n     opportunities for advancement, and have undermined public \n     confidence in the integrity of the sport.\n       (6) Open competition in the professional boxing industry \n     has been significantly interfered with by restrictive and \n     anti-competitive business practices of certain promoters and \n     sanctioning bodies, to the detriment of the athletes and the \n     ticket-buying public. Common practices of promoters and \n     sanctioning organizations represent restraints of interstate \n     trade in the United States.\n       (7) It is necessary and appropriate to establish national \n     contracting reforms to protect professional boxers and \n     prevent exploitative business practices, and to require \n     enhanced financial disclosures to State athletic commissions \n     to improve the public oversight of the sport.\n       (8) Whereas the Congress seeks to improve the integrity and \n     ensure fair practices of the professional boxing industry on \n     a nationwide basis, it deems it appropriate to name this \n     reform in honor of Muhammad Ali, whose career achievements \n     and personal contributions to the sport, and positive impact \n     on our society, are unsurpassed in the history of boxing.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to protect the rights and welfare of professional \n     boxers by preventing certain exploitative, oppressive, and \n     unethical business practices they may be subject to on an \n     interstate basis;\n       (2) to assist State boxing commissions in their efforts to \n     provide more effective public oversight of the sport; and\n\n[[Page S9445]]\n\n       (3) to promoting honorable competition in professional \n     boxing and enhance the overall integrity of the industry.\n\n     SEC 4.

Mr. President, there is a final amendment at the desk, \nand I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions), for Mr. Moynihan, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1370.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 20, after line 13, add the following:\n       (d) Standardized Physical Examinations.--Section 5(1) of \n     the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 (15 U.S.C. \n     6304(1)) is amended by inserting after ``examination'' the \n     following: ``, based on guidelines endorsed by the American \n     Medical Association, including a circulo-respiratory check \n     and a neurological examination,''.\n       (e) CAT Scans.--Section 6(b)(2) of the Professional Boxing \n     Safety Act of 1996 (15 U.S.C. 6305(b)(2)) is amended by \n     inserting before the period the following: ``and, with \n     respect to such renewal, present proof from a physician that \n     such boxer has taken a computerized axial tomography (CAT) \n     scan within the 30-day period preceding that date on which \n     the renewal application is submitted and that no brain damage \n     from boxing has been detected''.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, on January 3, 1999, Jerry Quarry, a \nperennial heavyweight boxing champion contender in the 1960's and \n1970's, died of pneumonia brought on by an advanced state of dementia \npugilistica. He was 53. The Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996 was \nan excellent step toward making professional boxing safer for its \nparticipants. Nevertheless, it contains several gaps.\n  The amendment I proposed here today is aimed at protecting \nprofessional fighters by requiring more rigorous prefight physical \nexaminations and by requiring a brain catscan before a boxer can renew \nhis or her professional license.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, as \namended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1370) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 305), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/27/senate-section/article/S9447-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 28, 1999\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
