Mr. President, I am authorized by the distinguished \nmajority leader to ask for 5 minutes prior to the vote to be equally \ndivided between Mr. Nickles and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent also that other \nSenators may include statements in the Record if they so wish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1664) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations for military operations, refugee relief, and \n     humanitarian assistance relating to the conflict in Kosovo, \n     and for military operations in Southwest Asia for the fiscal \n     year ending September 30, 1999, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, no one cares about our Nation's \nsteelworkers and steel industry more than I.\n  Since 1979, I have been at the forefront in support of Ohio's steel \nindustry. As Mayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio, I pressured the \nReagan and Bush Administrations to enforce the voluntary restraint \nagreements, VRAs, on steel and to make sure that all U.S. trade laws \nwere enforced as soon as those agreements expired. In 1991, I set up \nthe first Ohio Steel Industry Advisory Council as a public-private \npartnership to strengthen ties among the steel industry, the state of \nOhio and its citizens.\n  And last year, when steel imports reached record levels, I was one of \nthe first elected officials to pressure the Clinton administration to \nstop the illegal dumping of steel in our country. Since October of \n1998, I have written the President three letters urging him to take \naction on behalf of the steel industry.\n  Ohio is now the largest steel producing state in the Nation--a \ndevelopment that occurred during my term as governor. Many have assumed \nthat because steel is so important to the state of Ohio that I would \nvote in favor of this legislation. But it is because steel is so \nimportant that I cannot vote in favor of this legislation. There are \nthree fundamental reasons why.\n  First, this bill does not provide industry-wide assistance. The \nlegislation as it has been presented to the Senate provides loan-\nguarantee assistance to a few steel companies, and not all companies. \nIn fact, the vast majority of steel companies in Ohio have not \napproached me indicating that my vote in favor of this legislation was \ncrucial. Some steel companies in my state are opposed to this bill.\n  It does not make sense that in an economy as strong as ours, with \nsteel production in the United States at record, all-time highs, with \nall the construction that is occurring in our nation, and all the cars \nthat are being made and the record unemployment, that we should pass a \npackage that is meant to assist only a handful of companies.\n  Which brings me to my second point: the government should not be in \nthe position of picking winners and losers. What this legislation does \nis tell those companies that may have made poor business decisions that \nthey will be given help. Meanwhile, we ignore those\n\n[[Page S7248]]\n\ncompanies that have done the right actions to make themselves \ncompetitive. This is not the spirit of American enterprise.\n  Indeed, I have to ask if we are going to make it the business of the \nfederal government to help companies inside particular industries on a \nregular basis. We could be here in the Senate spending every taxpayer \ndollar bailing out specific businesses inside specific industries \nwhenever we saw an economic threat or whenever we desired. Where will \nwe draw the line? How will we decide which failing companies we'll bail \nout? What criteria will we use? Every time a company has a bad quarter \nor a bad year, should the federal government provide them with \nfinancial assistance? How are we different from those foreign countries \nwe criticize for subsidizing their companies that are struggling to \ncompete? These are the kinds of questions we need to ask if this is \ngoing to be the policy our government pursues.\n  Third, the history behind such loan programs points to a high default \nrate. The proponents of this legislation have indicated that they \nexpect a default rate on the loans of 14%. That means of the $1 billion \nworth of loans that the government will guarantee for steel \nmanufacturers, $140 million of that is expected to never be repaid. For \nthe oil and gas industry, the expected default rate is higher, 25%, or \n$125 million on a loan guarantee of $500 million.\n  In essence, what Congress wants to do is allow the federal government \nto simply write off $265 million of taxpayer funds. That money has to \ncome from somewhere, whether it's the Social Security trust fund, tax \nincreases, or cuts in essential programs for our children.\n  The last time this nation established a steel loan guarantee program \nin 1978, the default rate was 77%. Five companies took out loans--all \nfive companies defaulted and the U.S. taxpayer was forced to pick-up \nthe tab for $222 million. The U.S. Commerce Department's Economic \nDevelopment Administration said at the time, ``By any measurement, \nEDA's steel loan program would have to be considered a failure.'' In \naddition, EDA said, ``the program is an excellent example of the folly \ninherent in industrial policy programs.'' Now, I cannot guarantee that \nthe companies today, if given these loan guarantees, will default at \nsuch a high rate, but I do not believe we should be making the same \nmistakes twice at the expense of other federal programs.\n  Mr. President, there have been scant few instances where the Federal \nGovernment getting involved in market decisions has been productive. I \ndo not believe that we should do so here.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, yesterday during consideration of the \nSteel and Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program the Senator from Illinois, \nSenator Fitzgerald, raised several concerns regarding the potential for \nprogram abuse. During these discussions, my colleague from Illinois \nquestioned whether or not a bank, or other investor, would be able to \ntransfer their risk to the government upon enactment of the Steel and \nOil and Gas Loan Guarantee Program.\n  Fiscal responsibility is a top priority of mine and upon hearing of \nthese concerns, I was initially troubled. However, I have been assured \nby the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, that the \nloan approval board is structured such that these situations will be \nprevented. Loans will not be approved on a whim and the taxpayers' \ndollars will not be thrown about recklessly to benefit those who did \nnot need help in the first place. This program provides much needed, \ntemporary assistance to keep our steel industry afloat.\n  It should be noted that the Steel and Oil and Gas Loan Guarantee \nProgram sunsets in three years and is not a permanent change in public \npolicy. We are simply responding to the crisis currently faced by many \nin our nation's steel industry.\n  I rise in support of this measure and thank the Senator from West \nVirginia for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this bill on which we are about to vote is a \nbuy-American bill. A vote for this bill is a buy-American vote, a vote \nof confidence in American steel, American workers, and American \nfamilies. But a vote against the bill sends a very different message. \nIt says buy Russian, buy Japanese, buy South Korean, buy from our \nforeign competitors and send our steel industry and our steel jobs \noverseas. I urge my colleagues to vote American.\n  Now, if I have any time remaining in the 2\\1/2\\ minutes, I wish to \ncompliment Mr. Nickles, Mr. Gramm, and others who were the opponents of \nthe bill. They were honorable opponents, and I think they made good \ncontributions, especially in our discussions yesterday. Their proposals \nimprove the bill. I was happy to support their proposals and to join as \na cosponsor of the amendment.\n  I especially wish to thank Senator Stevens and Senator Domenici. \nSenator Stevens has kept his word. He is a man of his word. Senator \nDomenici has done a great job in proposing a similar program for the \noil and gas industry. I hope that he will be able to speak likewise at \nsome point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against this \nbill. I compliment the sponsors of it, Senator Byrd and Senator \nDomenici. They are very persistent. I expect they will be successful \ntoday, but I hope that this bill doesn't pass either today in the \nSenate or in the conference.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote against it. The reason is because I \nthink it is a mistake. It is not that I don't want to help the steel \nindustry or that I don't want to help the oil and gas industry. I want \nto help both.\n  I do not think the Federal Government guaranteeing loans is the right \nthing to do. We have tried it. We have been there. It did not work. We \ndid it in 1978 and 1979. The Federal Government had a loan guarantee \nprogram for the steel industry--$290 million worth of steel loans were \nmade, guaranteed by the Federal Government. The Federal Government \nloaned $222 million on which the steel industry defaulted. That is a 77 \npercent default rate. Basically, the people who ran the program at the \ntime or later said, well, really, it was replacing the marketplace with \npoliticians making those decisions, saying that we don't think that the \nmarketplace should be making capital decisions; we are going to have \nthose decisions being made by Government.\n  I think that was a serious mistake. We have urged other countries not \nto go into this industrial policy; let the marketplace work. And now we \nare trying to come back and do it. We have done it before. It did not \nwork before.\n  I want to help the oil and gas industry. It is really hurting in my \nState. But I do not think that having the Federal Government \nguaranteeing loans is the right solution. As a matter of fact, I do not \nthink it will help anybody. I do not think it will even help the steel \nindustry. It might help them reshuffle some debt, but I do not think it \nmakes sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this bill today.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass? The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman) is \nabsent attending a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program. (a) Short \n     Title.--This chapter may be cited as the ``Emergency Steel \n     Loan Guarantee Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Congressional Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States steel industry has been severely \n     harmed by a record surge of more than 40,000,000 tons of \n     steel imports into the United States in 1998, caused by the \n     world financial crisis;\n       (2) this surge in imports resulted in the loss of more than \n     10,000 steel worker jobs in 1998, and was the imminent cause \n     of 3 bankruptcies by medium-sized steel companies, Acme \n     Steel, Laclede Steel, and Geneva Steel;\n       (3) the crisis also forced almost all United States steel \n     companies into--\n       (A) reduced volume, lower prices, and financial losses; and\n       (B) an inability to obtain credit for continued operations \n     and reinvestment in facilities;\n       (4) the crisis also has affected the willingness of private \n     banks and investment institutions to make loans to the United \n     States steel industry for continued operation and \n     reinvestment in facilities;\n       (5) these steel bankruptcies, job losses, and financial \n     losses are also having serious negative effects on the tax \n     base of cities, counties, and States, and on the essential \n     health, education, and municipal services that these \n     government entities provide to their citizens; and\n       (6) a strong steel industry is necessary to the adequate \n     defense preparedness of the United States in order to have \n     sufficient steel available to build the ships, tanks, planes, \n     and armaments necessary for the national defense.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section:\n       (1) Board.--The term ``Board'' means the Loan Guarantee \n     Board established under subsection (e).\n       (2) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Emergency \n     Steel Guarantee Loan Program established under subsection \n     (d).\n       (3) Qualified steel company.--The term ``qualified steel \n     company'' means any company that--\n       (A) is incorporated under the laws of any State;\n       (B) is engaged in the production and manufacture of a \n     product defined by the American Iron and Steel Institute as a \n     basic steel mill product, including ingots, slab and billets, \n     plates, flat-rolled steel, sections and structural products, \n     bars, rail type products, pipe and tube, and wire rod; and\n       (C) has experienced layoffs, production losses, or \n     financial losses since the beginning of the steel import \n     crisis, in January 1998 or that operates substantial assets \n     of a company that meets these qualifications.\n       (d) Establishment of Emergency Steel Guarantee Loan \n     Program.--There is established the Emergency Steel Guarantee \n     Loan Program, to be administered by the Board, the purpose of \n     which is to provide loan guarantees to qualified steel \n     companies in accordance with this section.\n       (e) Loan Guarantee Board Membership.--There is established \n     a Loan Guarantee Board, which shall be composed of--\n       (1) the Secretary of Commerce;\n       (2) the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System, who shall serve as Chairman of the Board; and\n       (3) the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n       (f) Loan Guarantee Program.--\n       (1) Authority.--The Program may guarantee loans provided to \n     qualified steel companies by private banking and investment \n     institutions in accordance with the procedures, rules, and \n     regulations established by the Board.\n       (2) Total guarantee limit.--The aggregate amount of loans \n     guaranteed and outstanding at any one time under this section \n     may not exceed $1,000,000,000.\n       (3) Individual guarantee limit.--The aggregate amount of \n     loans guaranteed under this section with respect to a single \n     qualified steel company may not exceed $250,000,000.\n       (4) Timelines.--The Board shall approve or deny each \n     application for a guarantee under this section as soon as \n     possible after receipt of such application.\n       (5) Additional costs.--For the additional cost of the loans \n     guaranteed under this subsection, including the costs of \n     modifying the loans as defined in section 502 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 661a), there is \n     appropriated $140,000,000 to remain available until expended.\n       (g) Requirements for Loan Guarantees.--A loan guarantee may \n     be issued under this section upon application to the Board by \n     a qualified steel company pursuant to an agreement to provide \n     a loan to that qualified steel company by a private bank or \n     investment company, if the Board determines that--\n       (1) credit is not otherwise available to that company under \n     reasonable terms or conditions sufficient to meet its \n     financing needs, as reflected in the financial and business \n     plans of that company;\n       (2) the prospective earning power of that company, together \n     with the character and value of the security pledged, furnish \n     reasonable assurance of repayment of the loan to be \n     guaranteed in accordance with its terms;\n       (3) the loan to be guaranteed bears interest at a rate \n     determined by the Board to be reasonable, taking into account \n     the current average yield on outstanding obligations of the \n     United States with remaining periods of maturity comparable \n     to the maturity of such loan;\n       (4) the company has agreed to an audit by the General \n     Accounting Office prior to the issuance of the loan guarantee \n     and annually thereafter while any such guaranteed loan is \n     outstanding;

Petroleum Development Management. (a) Short \n     Title.--This chapter may be cited as the ``Emergency Oil and \n     Gas Guaranteed Loan Program Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n\n[[Page S7250]]\n\n       (1) consumption of foreign oil in the United States is \n     estimated to equal 56 percent of all oil consumed, and that \n     percentage could reach 68 percent by 2010 if current prices \n     prevail;\n       (2) the number of oil and gas rigs operating in the United \n     States is at its lowest since 1944, when records of this \n     tally began;\n       (3) if prices do not increase soon, the United States could \n     lose at least half its marginal wells, which in aggregate \n     produce as much oil as the United States imports from Saudi \n     Arabia;\n       (4) oil and gas prices are unlikely to increase for at \n     least several years;\n       (5) declining production, well abandonment, and greatly \n     reduced exploration and development are shrinking the \n     domestic oil and gas industry;\n       (6) the world's richest oil producing regions in the Middle \n     East are experiencing increasingly greater political \n     instability;\n       (7) United Nations policy may make Iraq the swing oil \n     producing nation, thereby granting Saddam Hussein tremendous \n     power;\n       (8) reliance on foreign oil for more than 60 percent of our \n     daily oil and gas consumption is a national security threat;\n       (9) the level of United States oil security is directly \n     related to the level of domestic production of oil, natural \n     gas liquids, and natural gas; and\n       (10) a national security policy should be developed that \n     ensures that adequate supplies of oil are available at all \n     times free of the threat of embargo or other foreign hostile \n     acts.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Board.--The term ``Board'' means the Loan Guarantee \n     Board established by subsection (e).\n       (2) Program.--The term ``Program'' means the Emergency Oil \n     and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program established by subsection \n     (d).\n       (3) Qualified oil and gas company.--The term ``qualified \n     oil and gas company'' means a company that--\n       (A) is--\n       (i) an independent oil and gas company (within the meaning \n     of section 57(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986); or\n       (ii) a small business concern under section 3 of the Small \n     Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632) (or a company based in Alaska, \n     including an Alaska Native Corporation created pursuant to \n     the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et \n     seq.)) that is an oil field service company whose main \n     business is providing tools, products, personnel, and \n     technical solutions on a contractual basis to exploration and \n     production operators that drill, complete wells, and produce, \n     transport, refine, and sell hydrocarbons and their byproducts \n     as the main commercial business of the concern or company; \n     and\n       (B) has experienced layoffs, production losses, or \n     financial losses since the beginning of the oil import \n     crisis, after January 1, 1997.\n       (d) Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Program.--\n       (1) In general.--There is established the Emergency Oil and \n     Gas Guaranteed Loan Program, the purpose of which shall be to \n     provide loan guarantees to qualified oil and gas companies in \n     accordance with this section.\n       (2) Loan guarantee board.--There is established to \n     administer the Program a Loan Guarantee Board, to be composed \n     of--\n       (A) the Secretary of Commerce;\n       (B) the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \n     Reserve System, who shall serve as Chairman of the Board;

and\n       (4) the company has agreed to an audit by the General \n     Accounting Office before issuance of the loan guarantee and \n     annually while the guaranteed loan is outstanding.\n       (g) Terms and Conditions of Loan Guarantees.--\n       (1) Loan duration.--All loans guaranteed under this section \n     shall be repayable in full not later than December 31, 2010, \n     and the terms and conditions of each such loan shall provide \n     that the loan agreement may not be amended, or any provision \n     of the loan agreement waived, without the consent of the \n     Board.\n       (2) Loan security.--A commitment to issue a loan guarantee \n     under this section shall contain such affirmative and \n     negative covenants and other protective provisions as the \n     Board determines are appropriate. The Board shall require \n     security for the loans to be guaranteed under this section at \n     the time at which the commitment is made.\n       (3) Fees.--A qualified oil and gas company receiving a loan \n     guarantee under this section shall pay a fee to the \n     Department of the Treasury to cover costs of the program, but \n     in no event shall such fee exceed an amount equal to 0.5 \n     percent of the outstanding principal balance of the \n     guaranteed loan.\n       (4) Guarantee level.--No loan guarantee may be provided \n     under this section if the guarantee exceeds 85 percent of the \n     amount of principal of the loan.\n       (h) Reports.--During fiscal year 1999 and each fiscal year \n     thereafter until each guaranteed loan has been repaid in \n     full, the Secretary of Commerce shall submit to Congress a \n     report on the activities of the Board.\n       (i) Salaries and Administrative Expenses.--For necessary \n     expenses to administer the Program, $2,500,000 is \n     appropriated to the Department of Commerce, to remain \n     available until expended, which may be transferred to the \n     Office of the Assistant Secretary for Trade Development of \n     the International Trade Administration.\n       (j) Termination of Guarantee Authority.--The authority of \n     the Board to make commitments to guarantee any loan under \n     this section shall terminate on December 31, 2001.\n       (k) Regulatory Action.--Not later than 60 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Board shall issue such \n     final procedures, rules, and regulations as are necessary to \n     carry out this section.\n\n\n               federal administrative and travel expenses\n\n                             (rescissions)\n\n       Sec. 202.

No part of any appropriation contained in the Act \n     shall remain available for obligation beyond the current \n     fiscal year unless expressly so provided herein.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Steel Loan \n     Guarantee and Emergency Oil and Gas Guaranteed Loan Act of \n     1999''.\n\n       The title was amended so as to read: ``An Act providing \n     emergency authority for guarantees of loans to qualified \n     steel and iron ore companies and to qualified oil and gas \n     companies, and for other purposes.''.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7250-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7250-S7253]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 2000 AND 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report H.R. 886.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 886) to authorize appropriations for the \n     Department of State for fiscal years 2000 and 2001; to \n     provide for enhanced security at United States diplomatic \n     facilities; to provide for certain arms control, \n     nonproliferation, and other national security measures; to \n     provide for the reform of the United Nations; and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, to make the Record absolutely clear, what \nis the pending business now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is S. 886.\n  Mr. HELMS. Which is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. State Department authorization.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent with respect to the \nState Department authorization bill, all amendments in order pursuant \nto the consent agreement of June 10 must be offered and debated during \nFriday's session of the Senate. I further ask\n\n[[Page S7251]]\n\nconsent that any votes relative to the bill occur in a stacked sequence \nbeginning at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, with 2 minutes for explanation prior \nto each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. We will please have \norder in the body.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, I will object, and I want \nto explain why. The reason I object is there are several amendments \nfrom Senators who are not going to be able to be here today. They are \nnecessarily absent. So they would be shut out completely from \nintroducing their amendments.\n  On behalf of the leadership, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, with the permission of my colleague from \nNorth Carolina, I ask unanimous consent, with respect to the State \nDepartment authorization bill, any amendments on the list of amendments \nin order to the State Department authorization bill must be filed at \nthe desk by 11:30 today, that there be no further votes today, and the \nnext vote would occur beginning at 5:30 on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HELMS. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request \nrelating to staff?\n  Mr. HELMS. Certainly.\n\n\n                         privilege of the floor\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the privilege of \nthe floor be granted to the following members of the minority staff of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee: David Auerswald, an American political \nscience fellow, and Joan Wadelton, a Pearson fellow, during the \npendency of the State Department authorization bill, S. 886.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I suggest \nSenators not leave town because there are going to be additional votes \ntoday.\n  Having made that announcement, I hope it is clear to all Senators we \nwere willing to offer an agreement, but that failing, we must proceed.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. REID. I could not quite hear, but you indicated there would be \nvotes during today?\n  Mr. HELMS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. REID. There was an announcement made by the leader yesterday that \nthere would be no votes occurring after 11:45 a.m. today. There are \npeople who have based their schedules on that public announcement made \nyesterday.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask the Chair if the unanimous consent agreement stated \n11:45 a.m.\n  Mr. REID. I am not sure there was a unanimous consent agreement. \nThere was a public statement made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no agreement on limiting votes for \nthe remainder of the day.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I believe I am authorized to say there will \nbe no votes after 11:45 a.m. today. At least I will not participate in \nordering them.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I understand a couple of Senators are out \nof town and therefore are not, even though they may want to, able to \nphysically meet the unanimous consent request of the chairman. I wonder \nif the purposes of the Senate in moving this legislation forward are \nnot equally well served by narrowing the universe of amendments by \nrequiring that they all be laid down before the hour when there will be \nno further votes. We will then have a fixed universe of amendments, and \nwe can begin debating them and proceed rapidly.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am unable to pass judgment on that. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HELMS. I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue \ncalling the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am a father. Like everybody else, every \ndaddy wants to get home, except a few who will not give time agreements \non their amendments. So we will just have to plow ahead and do the best \nwe can.\n  On behalf of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I offer the \nforeign relations authorization bill, approving specific State \nDepartment activities for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, including funds \nfor payment of some dues arrearages to the United Nations and other \ninternational organizations conditioned upon reform of those \ninstitutions.\n  In the course of debate, the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. \nBiden, and I will offer an amendment naming this bill the Admiral James \nW. Nance Foreign Relations Authorization bill, in memory and in honor \nof the late chief of staff of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bud \nNance.\n  The Foreign Relations Committee approved this bipartisan legislation \nback in April--I believe on April 21st--by a vote of 17 to 1.\n  This is the first authorization of State Department activity since \nenactment last October on the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring \nAct, which required the consolidation of the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency and the U.S. Information Agency into the State \nDepartment. These were temporary agencies. They were established in the \n1950s and were explicitly and emphatically described as temporary \nagencies.\n  As Ronald Reagan said, there is nothing so near eternal life as a \ntemporary Federal agency. So what we did, we folded two of those into \nthe State Department, their responsibilities, and got rid of them.\n  Both of these temporary agencies were created about a half century \nago, and this effort by the Foreign Relations Committee is the first \ntime any body has tried to do away with those nontemporary or temporary \nagencies.\n  The bill addresses several significant oversight and authorization \nissues. It proposes to strengthen and preserve the arms control \nverification functions of the U.S. Government, while addressing other \nnonproliferation matters as well.\n  The bill authorizes a 5-year $3 billion construction blueprint for \nupgrading U.S. embassies around the world to provide secure \nenvironments for America's personnel overseas. Unlike the funds \nprovided more than a decade ago in the wake of a report by Admiral \nInman calling for improved security of U.S. embassies, this bill \ncreates a firewall for funding from other State Department expenditures \nwhich will ensure that embassy funds are not raided to pay for other \nState Department pet projects.\n  The bill makes some reforms to strengthen the Foreign Service. Most \nForeign Service officers are supportive of ensuring poor performing \nmembers of the Foreign Service are not automatically kept in the \nService by statutes manipulated to protect unworthy employees from \ndischarge and/or personnel actions. The changes in the bill will \nstreamline the grievance and disciplinary process stipulated by the \nForeign Service Act.\n  The bill augments a coordination and oversight of the U.S. \nGovernment's role in assisting parents seeking return of abducted \nchildren. These provisions are an outgrowth of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee oversight hearing this past year on the growing problem of \ninternational abduction of children in disputes growing out of divorce \nand separation. It is a real problem, I say to the distinguished \noccupant of the Chair.\n\n[[Page S7252]]\n\n  Significantly, the bill includes a U.N. reform package which includes \npayments of arrearages in exchange for--I reiterate for emphasis--in \nexchange for key reforms of and by the United Nations.\n  I say parenthetically to the distinguished occupant of the Chair that \non the day that Kofi Annan was designated to be the Secretary General \nof the United Nations, I called him and invited him to come to \nWashington. We worked out a stipulated number of reforms that had to be \ndone before any thought or agreement could be considered regarding the \nso-called arrearages.\n  He agreed to that. He went back to the United Nations and made some \nother statements, but we are working that out.\n  Interestingly enough, we are getting some support from the gentleman \nwho probably will be confirmed in a week or so as the new U.S. \nAmbassador to the United Nations who strongly favors the reform of the \nUnited Nations. He stipulated that to me yesterday.\n  The reform agenda required by this bill, prior to the payment of any \nU.S. taxpayer dollars, has the full support of the Secretary of State \nand the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden, and me. These \nreforms were approved by the Senate during the 105th Congress by a vote \nof 90-5, but it was vetoed by the President of the United States.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  I believe we are going to have to have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. There is not order in \nthe body.\n  Please, may we have order in the body so we can proceed on this \nimportant piece of legislation. Conversations will please be taken off \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum until we \ncan get order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am going to depart from what we agreed to. The \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont needs 3 minutes, he says, for a \nstatement in the form of a eulogy. I yield that time to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n\n\n                             LEONARD RIESER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Vermont and the United States lost one of \nits most distinguished academics last winter. Leonard Rieser, a \nphysicist, a professor, a dean, and chairman of the board of the \nBulletin of Atomic Scientists, holder of so many titles that we \ncouldn't repeat all of them, died at the same time his great gifts and \ntalent were still expanding.\n  I knew Leonard and his wife, Rosemary, through their son, Tim Rieser. \nTim has been the most extraordinary advisor to me for many years, and \nhe holds the best attributes of his father: decency, a towering \nintellect, and a constant search for knowledge.\n  Leonard Rieser is a man who lived more in a decade than most people \nwill live in a lifetime. He accomplished in a few years what others \nwould be proud to have as their life's work. What is extraordinary is \nthat he did it for decade after decade.\n  In Vermont and throughout the Nation, expressions of sorrow but also \nof admiration and gratitude for his life poured in. We have all \nbenefited by his life. He leaves a great void, especially for his wife, \nhis sons, Tim, Leonard, and Ken, his daughter, Abby, his grandchildren \nand all his friends.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that just one of the many \ntributes written about him be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the tribute was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      [From the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Mar./Apr. 1999]\n\n                      Leonard M. Rieser, 1922-1998\n\n                            (By Mike Moore)\n\n       Leonard M. Rieser, 76, who chaired the board of the \n     Bulletin from 1985 to June of last year, died in December of \n     pancreatic cancer. His tenure as chairman spanned a \n     tumultuous era. When Rieser took the chair, the Bulletin's \n     ``Doomsday Clock'' stood at three minutes to midnight and \n     ``Evil Empire'' rhetoric still ricocheted back and forth \n     across the Atlantic.\n       But by late 1991, the United States and the Soviet Union \n     had signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, a coup \n     attempt in the Soviet Union had failed, and the United States \n     and Russia had begun to withdraw thousands of tactical \n     nuclear weapons from forward deployment. That fall, the board \n     voted to move the minute hand ``off the scale''--from 10 \n     minutes to 17 minutes to midnight.\n       In speaking to the press after the meeting, Rieser \n     displayed the rooted-in-the-real-world optimism that \n     characterized his life. The Cold War was clearly over, \n     Leonard told the audience, as was the East-West arms race. \n     That was a cause for celebration, and it surely justified the \n     unprecedented seven-minute move. ``But the world is still a \n     dangerous place and governments continue to pour vast sums of \n     money and intellectual capital into weaponry. The Bulletin \n     has much work left to do. It will continue reporting on the \n     destructiveness of seeking military solutions to the world's \n     ills.''\n       He was surely right about the Bulletin having more work to \n     do. In 1995, the board moved the minute hand back onto the \n     scale, to 14 minutes to midnight, in part because of the slow \n     U.S. and Russian pace in cutting back nuclear arsenals. And \n     last June, the board moved the hand to nine minutes to \n     midnight, partly because of nuclear tests by India and \n     Pakistan, and partly because East-West arms reductions were \n     still agonizingly slow.\n       In December of 1942, Rieser, an undergraduate in physics at \n     the University of Chicago, enlisted in the army, but received \n     a deferment so he could finish his degree. After receiving \n     his baccalaureate, he was assigned to the Manhattan Project, \n     first in the Chicago laboratory and then at Los Alamos.\n       In later years, he seldom talked of his bomb-related work, \n     other than to say that he had no interest in pursuing weapons \n     work after the war. Al Baez, a physicist who met Rieser in \n     the late 1940s while both were graduate students at Stanford, \n     said they became lifelong friends partly because of their \n     mutual belief that scientists had a moral responsibility to \n     weigh the consequences of their work.\n       Rieser joined the Dartmouth College physics faculty in 1952 \n     and remained active in Dartmouth affairs until his death. He \n     became dean of the faculty, provost, and the Sherman \n     Fairchild Professor in the Sciences. During the socially and \n     politically chaotic years of the late 1960s and early 1970s, \n     he helped transform Dartmouth from a small men's liberal arts \n     school into a more diverse coed institution.\n       Rieser retired as provost in 1982, the year he joined the \n     board of the Bulletin, but he remained chairman of \n     Dartmouth's Montgomery Endowment, which brings scholars, \n     artists, and political figures to the campus for periods \n     ranging from a week to a year. In 1984, he became the \n     founding director of the John Sloan Dickey Center for \n     International Understanding at Dartmouth.\n       Despite his decision to follow a largely administrative \n     track, he remained passionately committed to science, pure \n     and applied, and to the teaching of science. He was a member \n     of the American Physical Society, the American Association of \n     Physics Teachers, and the American Association for the \n     Advancement of Science (AAAS).\n       Rieser chaired the AAAS's Commission on Science Education \n     from 1966 to 1971, and he successively served as president-\n     elect, president, and chairman of the AAAS board in the early \n     1970s. He later chaired the association's Committee on Future \n     Directions and the Committee on Scientific Freedom and \n     Responsibility.\n       In 1974, Rieser was a co-founder of the Interciencia \n     Association, an organization based in Caracas that is \n     dedicated to uniting scientific communities in the Americas, \n     so they can more effectively promote the welfare of the \n     people. He later served as president of Interciencia, and he \n     was still a director at his death.\n       At various times, Rieser was president of the New England \n     Council on Graduate Education, an overseer at Harvard, a \n     member of the Commission on the International Exchange of \n     Scholars, a member of the Council on Humanities and Sciences \n     at Stanford, a trustee of Hampshire College, and a trustee of \n     the Latin American Student Programs at American Universities.\n       In 1990, Rieser became a consultant to the John D. and \n     Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in Chicago. For four years, \n     beginning in 1993, he chaired MacArthur's Fellows program--\n     the so-called ``genius grant'' program in which scholars, \n     artists, and innovators of all description are awarded \n     handsome sums so they can more readily pursue their work by \n     freeing them of financial constraints.\n       The program's yearly awards regularly make headlines. They \n     have been applauded as being imaginative and visionary and \n     criticized for being too offbeat, ``too politically \n     correct.''\n       ``It was not a matter of `political correctness,' '' says \n     Adele Simmons, president of MacArthur. ``Leonard delighted in \n     finding people not already being supported by mainstream \n     institutions, and giving them an opportunity to look at \n     institutions and issues in a new way, getting people to \n     really think.''\n       Victor Rabinowitch, senior vice president of MacArthur, \n     said Rieser took particular\n\n[[Page S7253]]\n\n     joy in mentoring younger people. ``He loved to play that \n     role. He was idealistic--but also realistic. He believed in \n     the goodness of people, a man of enormous decency. The \n     secretaries all adored him--he listened to them.''\n       An adjective often used to describe Rieser is \n     ``graceful''--in the sense that he was a considerate man, a \n     ``gentleman'' in the old-fashioned use of the term. \n     Listening, says Barbara Gerstner, assistant provost at \n     Dartmouth, was one of Rieser's greatest gifts. ``When he \n     conducted a meeting, he made sure that everyone's point of \n     view was heard and understood. A person could leave a meeting \n     unsatisfied with the result. But at least he knew he had had \n     a fair chance to be heard.''\n       MacArthur's Rabinowitch, who has attended high-powered \n     meetings throughout the world for most of his professional \n     life, says simply: ``Leonard was the most talented chairman I \n     have ever seen.''\n       Dorothy Zinberg, on the faculty at Harvard's John F. \n     Kennedy School of Government, recalls Rieser's ability to put \n     people at ease. She first met Leonard in the early 1970s, \n     when she ``parachuted into Washington'' to serve as the \n     ``token woman'' on the AAAS's Committee for Science and \n     Social Responsibility. It was a small but steller group that \n     included former Chief Justice Earl Warren and John Knowles, \n     then president of the Rockefeller Foundation, and Alan Astin, \n     a towering figure in Washington science policy. Zinberg, who \n     was then a young professor at Harvard, was ill at ease. \n     ``Don't worry,'' said Leonard. ``You have every right to be \n     here. Speak up.'' That she did, and she went on to serve on \n     several more aaas committees.\n       In the early 1990s, Zinberg was a consultant at the \n     MacArthur Foundation and often found herself working closely \n     with Rieser. ``Leonard challenged every statement to make \n     certain that no issue under discussion had been superficially \n     examined. Behind the boyish smile, the informal style, the \n     casual country clothes, and the droll humor lay a steely \n     determination to get things right.''\n       Leonard M. Rieser, according to those who knew him well, \n     did get it right.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Kilborn)\n\n       Kokomo, Ind, June 16.--A year and a half ago, Doris Rude, a \n     taxi driver who is partly disabled by a herniated disc, was \n     living at the edge of her income of $300 a week and had just \n     $5 in the bank. Then she received a $1,900 hospital bill. \n     With poor credit and no money, she turned in desperation to a \n     new, fast-growing American institution: The payday loan \n     company.\n       For a fee of $30, the company agreed to advance her a two-\n     week loan of $100. To obtain the loan, she wrote the company \n     a check for $130 that the lender greed to hold until her next \n     payday. With the $30 fee, the lender was charging her an \n     annual interest rate that consumer advocates say is 780 \n     percent.\n       But two weeks later, with no change in her living expenses, \n     her check was sure to bounce. So the lender let Ms. Rude \n     renew the loan for another two weeks, for another $30 fee. \n     Soon she was bounding from one payday lender to another, six \n     in all, borrowing from the next to pay the accumulating fees \n     of the others.\n       Ms. Rude had fallen into a trap that regulators worry is an \n     increasingly common one, not just for lower-paid workers like \n     Ms. Rude but for higher-salaried ones as well.\n       Payday lending companies are sprouting up all over the \n     country, having increased to nearly 8,000 today from 300 \n     seven years ago. Although this is the most prosperous \n     peacetime decade of the century, many workers have become \n     trapped by debts run up in free spending or have been driven \n     deeper into debt by misfortune. But these workers have the \n     two basic things needed to obtain a payday loan: paychecks \n     and checking accounts.\n       Although plentiful in big cities like New York and Los \n     Angeles, the payday lenders have become most visible in \n     places like Kokomo; Springfield, Ohio, and Cleveland, Tenn. \n     Ten have opened in Kokomo, a city of 45,000 people.\n       Bearing names like Check Into Cash, Check 'n Go and Fast \n     Cash, payday lenders grant loans to workers against their \n     next paychecks. In return, the companies charge a ``fee,'' \n     typically $15 to $35. At annual rates, the fees normally \n     exceed 300 percent and 400 percent and in some cases they \n     reach four digits.\n       At least a dozen national chains have sprung up. The \n     biggest, Ace Cash Express in Irving, Tex., has around 900 \n     stores and revenue last year--what it collected in loan \n     fees--of $100 million, twice that of 1996. Check Into Cash, \n     in Cleveland, Tenn., reported that its revenue had jumped to \n     $21 million in the first six months of 1998 from $10 million \n     three years ago and $1 million five years ago.\n       In much of the country, these companies escape the routine \n     scrutiny and regulations faced by banks, finance companies \n     and pawn shops, because in some states they are too new to \n     have stirred much controversy and in others they have used \n     political clout to stave off legislation.\n       As of late last year, the Consumer Federation of America \n     reported that 19 states, including all of those in New \n     England, as well as Pennsylvania, Texas and Virginia, \n     prohibited payday lending, most by limiting annual, small-\n     loan interest to less than 40 percent. But the federation \n     said the 31 other states, including New York and New Jersey, \n     condoned it by law or by the absence of law.\n       A spokesman for the New York State Banking Department, Rick \n     Hansen, disputed this assertion, saying the state's usury law \n     forbids charging more than 25 percent annual interest on any \n     loan.\n       The payday lenders say they are providing a vital service. \n     As commercial banks have shunned the poorest borrowers, in \n     part by raising the minimum amounts they will lend, people \n     who need small sums to get over a hump, like paying for a \n     medical prescription or buying tires for a car, have few \n     choices. These include people who are unable to get credit \n     cards or who have charged or exceeded their cards' credit \n     limits.\n       Industry leaders say comparing payday lenders' fees with \n     annual interest rates is unfair because most of the loans are \n     paid off within a month.\n       Consumer advocates consider the payday lenders' interest \n     rates exorbitant.\n       ``I know of loan sharks in New York who wouldn't charge \n     this kind of interest,'' said Gary L. Calhoun, a lawyer here \n     who provides legal services for members of the United \n     Automobile Workers.\n       State Representative Richard W. Bodiker of Indiana, a \n     Democrat whose bill this year to regulate the lenders fell to \n     intense industry lobbying, calls the fees, ``in excess of \n     what usury laws consider loan-sharking.''\n       Robert C. Rochford, deputy counsel of the National Check \n     Cashers Association, an industry trade group, called such \n     accusations spurious.\n       ``Loan-sharking involves coercive tactics to collect the \n     debt,'' Mr. Rochford said. ``No major direct deposit provider \n     has been convicted of that.''\n       One reason for the lenders' growth is people's comfort with \n     debt. The nation's savings rate, the percentage of people's \n     disposable income that is saved, dropped to 0.5 percent last \n     year and to nothing at all by earlier this year from 6 \n     percent a decade ago. Rather than save, people are spending \n     more than ever and borrowing more than ever.\n       ``We know there's a pretty sizable group of folks whose \n     credit cards are maxed out,'' said Mark B. Tarpey, a \n     supervisor in the consumer finance division of the Indiana \n     Department of Financial Institutions.\n       With payday lenders around, Mr. Tarpey said: ``They don't \n     have to tell the boss they need a cash advance. They don't \n     have to give up their TV's and furniture. They don't have to \n     run a credit check.''\n       Another reason is a level of unemployment, 4.2 percent, \n     that economists used to call unattainable. To succeed, payday \n     lenders need customers with bank accounts and regular checks, \n     in particular paychecks, and these days, just about every \n     able-bodied adult receives one.\n       Under such conditions, said Mr. Rochford, the deputy \n     counsel for the check cashers' association, payday lenders' \n     revenues will grow to $1.44 billion this year from $810 \n     million last year.\n       Payday lending exists, Mr. Rochford said, ``because there's \n     a need for it.'' A short-term deferred deposit loan, the \n     industry's preferred term, helps a worker through an \n     emergency and is cheaper than bouncing a check.\n\n[[Page S7254]]\n\n     Most banks do not make loans for less than $1,000, he said, \n     and pawning is embarrassing.\n       Borrowers like a payday loan, Mr. Rochford said, because \n     ``it is private,'' adding: ``It is quick. And they do not \n     need a lot of documentation.'' The fees cover loans that turn \n     sour, he said, and the cost of employees to process loans.\n       Kokomo, about 50 miles north of Indianapolis, may be a case \n     in point. A steel and asphalt city of immense new Daimler-\n     Chrysler and Delphi-Delco automobile component factories, \n     Kokomo is fertile terrain for payday lending.\n       Strapped by bad credit and unmanageable or unexpected \n     expenses, people here used to go to pawn shops for loans. But \n     of three pawn shops here two years ago, one has closed, and \n     another, Bob's, passed up renewing its license this month. \n     Now people go to the city's new payday lenders.\n       Unemployment, which has exceeded 20 percent in Kokomo in \n     recessions, was just 1.4 percent in March, according to the \n     latest survey by the Kelley School of Business at Indiana \n     University. About 20,000 people, roughly 40 percent of the \n     area work force, is employed by automotive companies. They \n     earn $50,000 to $60,000 a year and are the new lenders' \n     biggest customers.\n       The payday lenders here approve most loans within 10 \n     minutes. ``No Credit Check, Instant Approval,'' Easy Money's \n     flier promises. ``The fastest way to payday,'' read the \n     banners on the walls of Check 'n Go.\n       For this service, some states specify a maximum fee of $15 \n     on a one- or two-week loan of $100 or $200. In Indiana the \n     limit is $33. At $33, the annual rate on a two-week $100 loan \n     is 858 percent.\n       And as borrowers amass loans, taking new ones to pay the \n     fees on the others, the fastest way to payday becomes a fast \n     way, too, to garnished wages and bankruptcy.\n       Kathy Jo King, 41, earns almost $60,000 a year as an \n     assembly-line worker at the Daimler-Chrysler transmission \n     plant. But she has no savings, in part because she is paying \n     creditors $113 a week to work her way out of a bankruptcy \n     that followed a serious automobile accident and left her \n     husband partly disabled and both with high medical bills.\n       Then early last year, Ms. King and her husband and their \n     boys, 18 and 11, had to move, incurring $1,500 in unexpected \n     expenses.\n       ``I've got kids to feed,'' she said. ``I had to go do \n     something.'' With her credit in ruins, she could not go to a \n     bank for a loan, so she went to payday lenders.\n       ``We did several payday loans all at once,'' Ms. King said. \n     ``They make you feel real at ease about it.'' She started \n     paying off the loans bit by bit but became saddled with $200 \n     in fees alone every two weeks and could not keep up.\n       So one lender tried to redeem her last $330 check covering \n     a loan of $300 and a fee of $30. She did not have money in \n     the bank to cover the check and it bounced. The bank and the \n     lender then charged her $80 in fees for a bad check.\n       Next, the lender sued, and Ms. King lost. The court awarded \n     the lender triple damages--$990, or three times the amount of \n     the check, plus $150 in lawyer fees and $60 for court costs. \n     With the $80 for bouncing the check, Ms. King owes $1,280 on \n     her original loan of $330.\n       Currently, about 100 payday lenders suits against borrowers \n     are on file in the Howard County Superior Court in Kokomo. \n     Lenders here also send out letters threatening their \n     customers with imprisonment for bouncing a loan check, \n     although none is known to have tested the state penal code \n     provision that they invoke in making the threat. Some lenders \n     start taking legal action within a month to obtain unpaid \n     loans; others try to work longer with customers to avoid a \n     lawsuit.\n       David Hannum, coordinator of the Consumer Credit Counseling \n     Service, said borrowers kept paying the fees, digging \n     themselves deeper into debt, out of fear that lenders would \n     otherwise try to redeem their checks when they did not have \n     money in the bank to cover them, further tainting their \n     credit ratings.\n       To tap into this market, Carol Brenner, 36, opened Quick \n     Cash here in September. Ms. Brenner now has 350 clients, most \n     of whom return every week or two to have their loans renewed \n     or to pay them off, but then they often take another a few \n     days later. She charges less than most lenders: $20 for a \n     two-week $100 loan, for an annual percentage rate of 521 \n     percent, and $30 for $200, or 391 percent.\n       Unlike some lenders, Ms. Brenner lets her clients pay off \n     portions of their loans as they extend them and in that way \n     work them down. And to avert probable trips to small-claims \n     court, she says she will not lend to people who already have \n     more than two loans from other payday lenders.\n       The biggest borrowers, many lenders say, are not Kokomo's \n     low-wage service workers, but auto industry employees who \n     earn more than $20 an hour.\n       ``Most of my customers are from Chrysler and Delco,'' said \n     Marc Sutherland, manager of the Kokomo office of Nationwide \n     Budget Finance.\n       Shari Harris, 39, who earns around $25,000 a year as an \n     information security analyst, was managing money well enough \n     until the father of her two children, 10 and 4, stopped \n     paying $1,200 a month in child support.\n       ``And then,'' Ms. Harris said, ``I learned about the payday \n     loan places.''\n       She qualified immediately for a two-week $150 loan at Check \n     Into Cash, handing it a check for $183 to include the $33 \n     fee. ``I started maneuvering my way around until I was with \n     seven of them,'' she said.\n       In six months, she owed $1,900 and was paying fees at a \n     rate of $6,006 a year. ``That's the sickness of it,'' Ms. \n     Harris said. ``I was in the hole worse than when I started. I \n     had to figure a way to get out of it.''\n       So she asked her employer to stop paying her wages into her \n     checking account, emptying it, and putting her checks into a \n     savings account. She stopped paying the biweekly fees to \n     extend the loans, so the lenders tried to redeem her checks. \n     ``I let them all bounce,'' she said.\n       She took a second job, working in a department store, and \n     turned to the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, which \n     worked out a plan under which she is paying $440 a month to \n     work down the loans.\n       Jean Ann Fox, director of consumer protection at the \n     Consumer Federation of America and a prominent critic of \n     payday lending, said, ``There's nothing wrong with small \n     loans at reasonable interest rates, reasonable terms and \n     reasonable collection practices.\n       ``But these practices are designed to keep you in perpetual \n     debt.''\n\n\n                             What it costs\n\n       An Expensive $100--A payday loan is a short-term cash \n     advance, for a fee, to be paid off with a check that will be \n     cashed on the borrower's next payday. But with fees like $30 \n     for a two-week loan of $100, they are far more expensive than \n     even credit cards:\n       Payday loan: $60 a month--A $30 fee for a two-week $100 \n     loan, renewed for two more weeks; $100 cash loan--$60 $100 \n     cash advance--$5.\n       Credit card: About $5 a month--A card available to people \n     with poor credit might have a 3 percent fee for a cash \n     advance, plus an annual interest rate of 19.8 percent, or \n     about $2 a month on $100.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I know it must appear to the Chair and \nothers that this is sort of a disjointed way to begin consideration of \na major bill, but we are trying to work out time agreements. Senators \nare being very cooperative. I think we are approaching some \nreconciliation on it; I am not sure.\n  In the meantime, Senator Sarbanes needs to get away for an important \nappointment. How much time will the Senator need?\n  Mr. SARBANES. This is the amendment I indicated I could do in 40 \nminutes. Once the amendment is explained, I hope that the committee \nwill accept it. I would be prepared to offer it now. I have another \namendment which will take longer.\n  I am prepared to go ahead and offer it now if the chairman wishes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Why don't we do that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from North Carolina, we \nare working on a unanimous consent request. Would the Senator allow us \nto interrupt his statement if necessary?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes, absolutely.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may interrupt for a moment on a \nmatter of procedure, I recognize the difficulty the leader has in \ntrying to orchestrate things in the body. I know he is working very \ndiligently to try to come up with time agreements and the possibility \nof stacking votes and holding them over until Monday. I remember that \nformer Senator Jake Garn sort of had an affinity for a family-friendly \nprocess, and I want to commend the leadership for trying to follow \nthat.\n  I want to point out that I happen, by coincidence, to live very far \naway. For me to make a Monday vote, I have to leave Sunday night and \nfly all night to get here. If I leave on the very first flight from \nFairbanks, AK, on Monday and leave at 8 o'clock, I get arrive in \nWashington in the evening. Ordinarily, I don't go back to my State on a \nweekend; I stay here. But Father's Day and Mother's Day are fairly \nimportant, so I intend to go to Alaska today.\n  Unfortunately, I will miss the stacked votes that are proposed on \nMonday. I was inclined to object to the unanimous-consent agreement, \nbut in\n\n[[Page S7255]]\n\nthe spirit of cordiality, which I have pretty much maintained around \nhere in the last 19 years, I will defer to the leadership. I wanted to \nexplain this uniqueness to those who live in Chicago or for those who \ncan take the train next door. I wish I could. It is a little different \nset of circumstances.\n  I have made my concerns known. As we plan events, I think we should \nrecognize there are a couple of special days, and Father's Day is one \nof them. I have 11 grandchildren who are coming, so sayonara.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly wish the Senator from Alaska a \nwonderful trip. I know how important his family is to him. I also want \nto thank him for his magnanimous decision not to object to the stacked \nvotes. I know it is important to him to be here and participate in \nrecorded votes. I also know his family is very important and Father's \nDay is very important. He could have objected, but he decided not to. I \nhope other Senators will follow that example. I try very hard to \naccommodate every Senator on both sides of the aisle.\n  I fear that the problem in the Senate now is that I have been too \naccommodating, because we try to work votes around every Senator's \nschedule, and it is absolutely out of control. I have Senators come in \nhere and say: Oh, please, please, please, don't have another vote after \n9:30 on Friday. And other Senators say: You mean we are going to vote \nMonday afternoon?\n  I realize voting is a problem, but it is required to move bills \nalong. So I ask my colleagues to not get mad at me for trying to get \nour work done.\n  This week has been unusually productive. With this bill, if we could \nhave finished it today, we would have completed seven bills this week. \nSenator Reid and Senator Daschle share my frustration at what we go \nthrough. You would not believe the kinds of requests we get from \nSenators not to have votes during the middle of the day on Tuesday, or \nin the morning on Wednesday, or on Thursday afternoon. My colleagues, \nit is just out of control.\n\n  We try to say on Mondays or Fridays, for good and valid reasons, we \nwill not have votes on occasion. We try to tell Members in advance. \nBecause of a number of problems, we have notified both sides of the \naisle that there won't be votes next Friday, the 25th. But there is a \nlimit as to how much we can do. I was always used to working Monday \nthrough Friday. I realize that when we go home, we are still working. \nWhen we tell Senators we are not going to have votes before 5 on Monday \nor after 12 on Friday, we still have difficulty.\n  I thank Senator Murkowski for his attitude. I must say to all the \nSenators that we just have to be prepared to be here and vote.\n  Here is another thing. Senators have now gotten to where, when there \nis a death in the family, they don't even want to miss a vote. That is \na terrible and difficult time, but your constituents will understand. \nYou can't ask 99 Senators not to have a recorded vote because you have \nhad a death in the family. Sometimes it is an in-law. People understand \nif you can't be here. Meanwhile, back in the jungle, we have to get our \nwork done. So I ask for your indulgence.\n  I yield to Senator Murkowski.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My only frustration, I share with the leader, is that \nthe assumption today was that we were going to have some votes. As a \nconsequence, I made my plans accordingly for a 2 o'clock airplane. I \ncould have gotten a 10:30 airplane. After 2 o'clock, there are no more \nairplanes. I share the frustration of the leader who, obviously, is \ntoday accommodating a number of Senators who want to get out of here \nearly, even though the leader said today we are going to vote in the \nmorning at least. We did vote in the morning. It works both ways, Mr. \nPresident. When the leader says so, the consistency of that statement, \nI think, should be followed through, if I can make an appropriate \nsuggestion.\n  Mr. LOTT. I must say, if I may respond, it was our intent to have \nmore votes, but obstructionists can quite often prevail in the Senate. \nIf somebody objects, it is pretty hard to force a vote. On Monday, I \ncould call up Executive Calendar items. I can force votes, but I prefer \nnot to do that. I have never liked the so-called ``bed check'' votes. I \ntry to have votes on substance. That is the problem. Today, we had a \nblowup here at 9:45, and all kinds of efforts to be reasonable and get \nagreements came apart. I believe maybe by 11 o'clock, if enough people \nare gone, we can get this thing worked out.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I appreciate the frustrations the \nmajority leader has to work under. But he has just had a very \nproductive week. We passed half a dozen bills of consequence here in \nthe Senate this week. So I guess I would better understand this \nreaction if we hadn't done anything all week. I thought we had a \nproductive week. I am right next door here, so it is easy for me. \nSometimes you get more with a carrot than you do with a stick.\n  Mr. LOTT. I don't believe there has been a majority leader since \nMansfield who has used a carrot as much as this majority leader. We \ndon't go late on Mondays or Fridays.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I acknowledge that the majority leader worked hard to \ntry to make the calendar more family friendly.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you for doing that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader and the others \nassembled here, not only have we done a good job this week on those \nthings we voted upon--major appropriations bills--but also there are a \nlot of things that have gotten a lot of attention that are completed \nand passed in this body, not the least of which is the resolution \nsponsored by the four leaders and everybody else in the Senate, and \nbasically a vast majority here, dealing with commending the troops and \nall those who were involved in the Kosovo war. That took some work \nbetween the two sides, and we worked that out. It is a beautiful \nresolution. It is passed. If we had more time today, we would talk \nabout that.\n  Lots of things occurred here. There, of course, is some question as \nto whether there are other things we would like to do. We have talked \nabout the Patients' Bill of Rights. But we have to say that we have \naccomplished a great deal this week, and I think we should feel good \nabout that.\n  Having served in the other body and this body, I think every Senator \nwho has served here for a matter of years appreciates the work of the \nleader in making this body one where we have certainty as to our \nschedule. That has been a big help.\n  We had a vote this morning. We didn't have as many people as we \nthought, but we had a vote. Our time wasn't wasted this morning. The \nprogress made on this State Department bill, I think, is terrific. I \nhave been involved in this bill when we have taken more than a week to \ndeal with this bill. We will resolve this in a matter of a few hours.\n  I appreciate the anxiety and frustration of the leader, but we want \nto work with the leader and make sure we get more done. I speak for \neveryone on this side.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will use leader time to respond briefly. I thank Senator \nReid for his comments. I note the fact he was willing to work with us. \nWe had the resolution worked out over a period of several days, \ncommending our troops and commending the President and others for their \nwork in Kosovo. That could have been difficult, could have caused \namendments, and there could have been requests for recorded votes.\n  That was one of several things we have done this week. I note the \nSenator from Nevada in his new role as the whip on the Democratic side \nhas really made a difference. We appreciate his cooperation. Quite \noften, it takes a lot of time to work through the pending amendments. \nHe has been very helpful.\n  I am glad we had a good week. I am hoping every week will be similar \nto this week. I will keep working in that effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 689\n\n  (Purpose: To revise the deadlines with respect to the retention of \nrecords of disciplinary actions and the filing of grievances within the \n                            Foreign Service)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. I have an amendment at the desk which I ask be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S7256]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 689.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 39, strike lines 14 and 15 and insert the \n     following: ``for a period commensurate with the seriousness \n     of the offense, as determined by Director General of the \n     Foreign Service, except that the personnel records shall \n     retain any record with respect to a reprimand for not less \n     than one year and any record with respect to a suspension for \n     not less than two years.'.''.\n       On page 41, line 16, strike ``one year'' and all that \n     follows through the end of line 22 and insert the following: \n     ``two years after the occurrence giving rise to the grievance \n     or, in the case of a grievance with respect to the grievant's \n     rater or reviewer, one year after the date on which the \n     grievant ceased to be subject to rating or review by that \n     person, but in no case less than two years after the \n     occurrence giving rise to the grievance.'.''.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I hope the committee will find it \npossible to accept this amendment. I will very briefly describe it.\n  This amendment seeks to address two provisions in the bill which \naffect the rights of those who serve in the Foreign Service. The first \nproblem deals with the time period given in order to file a grievance. \nUnder the current system, employees have a period of 3 years to file a \ngrievance; that is the current law, 3 years. The bill does two things: \nIt reduces that period to 1 year. It will take away the employee's \nright, which was upheld by a 1989 decision by the Foreign Service Labor \nRelations Board, to challenge an old evaluation that has been used \nagainst them.\n  It does two things. The amendment addresses those issues. It extends \nthe period for filing a grievance to 2 years. In other words, the \ncommittee bill brings it down from 3 years to 1 year. We put it back up \nto 2 years.\n  Let me explain why I think this is important. Members of the Foreign \nService have limited access to lawyers and personnel files while they \nare overseas. This amendment, moving the period back up to 2 years, \ngives them time to return to the United States on home leave, which \nthey are entitled to only after they have been at their post for 18 \nmonths. They can come back on home leave in order to research and file \ntheir case.\n  If the grievance is against an employee's supervisor, the employee \nwould have 1 year after he or she ceased to be supervised by that \nindividual to file the grievance. I think the fairness of that is \nobvious on its face.\n  In addition--and this is a complicated, but I think important point--\nthe amendment deletes the sentence that would preclude employees from \ngrieving old evaluations used against them. Currently, promotion panels \ncan reinterpret old reports to select out Foreign Service personnel \nusing report statements which did not seem and were not intended at the \ntime to be negative. The promotion panels can go back to these old \nreports and reinterpret them.\n  The bill, as it is written, eliminates the ability to challenge an \nold evaluation on the part of the employee. Civil service employees \nhave this protection now. They can contest all bases cited for their \ntermination, regardless of when the matter occurred. A Foreign Service \nemployee should have the same due process rights.\n  In fact, following this 1989 decision to which I referred, the \nForeign Service Association and the five foreign affairs agencies in \nthe Government reached an agreement under which employees may contest \nrecords to the extent they are used as a basis for grievable actions \ntaken against them.\n  Denying employees the ability to do that, among other things, would \nlead to filing unnecessary preemptive grievances for fear they would be \nused against them in the future. In other words, if you are going to \nsay these old evaluations can't be ``grievanced,'' then it will serve \nas an incentive to contest more evaluations earlier.\n  This amendment restores the limited right, if an old evaluation is \nused to challenge it, and it would preclude the need for such \npreemptive grievances.\n  That is the first part of the amendment. It seems to me to make \neminent good sense to do this. I have tried to take into account some \nof what the committee was seeking to accomplish. As I have indicated, \nwe accept bringing the 3 years down, but we think it should come down \nto 2. I think taking it to 1 is going too far. The employees overseas \nwould have a difficult time because they don't get the home leave for \n18 months.\n\n  The second part of the amendment relates to the length of time a \ndisciplinary action stays in an employee's personnel file. Under the \ncurrent system, a reprimand stays in the employee's file for 1 year and \na suspension for 2 years. The bill would extend that period in all \ncases until the employee is tenured as a career member of the service \nor next promoted. In effect, you may significantly lengthen the time in \nwhich these disciplinary actions stay in the employee's file.\n  There is a balancing to be done because under the current system \ndisciplinary records are removed from the file after 1 or 2 years, no \nmatter how serious. Therefore, they are not always available to \nreviewers when a Foreign Service employee is considered for promotion. \nThat is something we need to look at. I understand the committee was \nfocused on that.\n  The bill attempts to rectify this problem by requiring all records of \ndisciplinary action to remain in the employee's file until the employee \nis tenured or next promoted. The proposed change makes no distinction \nbetween a suspension of 1 day or 1 month, between a minor infraction or \na major violation. By failing to differentiate between minor and major \nviolations, this change could have the unintended effect either of \nextending the length of punishment beyond a reasonable time period or \nreducing the likelihood that appropriate disciplinary actions will be \nimposed in the first place. The disciplining authorities may forego \nimposing these actions in the more minor cases because they know these \nthings will remain in the file perhaps for a long period--until tenure \nor the next promotion.\n  This part of the amendment requires the Director General of the \nForeign Service to decide when taking a disciplinary action what length \nof time it should remain in the employee's record based on the \nseriousness of the violation. In no case, however, would the letter \nremain in the file less than 1 year for a reprimand or 2 years for a \nsuspension.\n  So we set, as it were, a minimum requirement of 1 year for a \nreprimand and 2 years for a suspension. Beyond that, the Director \nGeneral, at the time of the disciplinary action, could indicate the \nadditional length of time, as it were, that the disciplinary action \nwould remain in the employee's file. I think this accomplishes the \npurpose of distinguishing between major and minor infractions, in a \nsense. It does not put the minor infractions in there indefinitely or \nuntil tenure or promotion is reached, but it does permit the Director \nGeneral, on the major infractions, to extend them beyond the minimum of \n1 year for a reprimand or 2 years for a suspension.\n  In both instances here I have tried to take into account what I have \nperceived to be the concerns of the committee in including these \nprovisions. Neither proposal, in effect, eliminates the committee \nprovisions. It only seeks to modify them or to adjust them, and I think \nwould make for a more equitable system. I very much hope the committee \nwill find it possible to accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I had a very brief discussion with the \nchairman of the committee about the second part of the Senator's \namendment, which I happen to support fully; that is, instead of going \nfrom 3 years down to 1 year. All the reasons the Senator stated seem \nvalid to me. A 2-year time period, it seems to me, is more reasonable. \nI suspect the chairman may be inclined to agree with that.\n  With regard to the first part of the amendment of the Senator \nrelating to this issue of the seriousness of the offense, right now it \nis 1 year and 2 years. This would allow the State Department to make an \nindependent judgment as to whether or not a reprimand or suspension \nshould stay in the file beyond the time period here.\n\n[[Page S7257]]\n\n  I raise the question whether or not we may be able to work something \nout. I have not had a chance to talk to the chairman about this to see \nwhether it makes sense to him, but it seems to me the greatest \ndifficulty with the first part of the amendment of the Senator, as it \nrelates to the reforms we are trying to implement, is leaving open-\nended this notion of who determines the seriousness of the offense. \nHaving the Director General of the Foreign Service determine the \nseriousness of the offense without us, the committee, knowing how he or \nshe will go about making that determination, in effect leaves a hole \nwide enough to eliminate the reform. I am not asking my colleague from \nNorth Carolina to respond to this yet.\n  I raised a moment ago in private with the Senator from Maryland \nwhether or not he would be agreeable to amend the first part of his \namendment to suggest the Director General had to submit to the Congress \nand the committee a set of regulations about how he or she would \ndetermine what constitutes the seriousness of the offense; in other \nwords, how that would be determined. We would put the burden on them to \ncome back to us to tell us, so we had some faith it would not be an ad \nhoc way of approaching this and we would have some sense of how to \nproceed.\n  I do not know whether or not that is amenable. It obviously needs to \nbe fleshed out more than I have just outlined it, whether or not that \nis amenable to the chairman. But I suggest there is a possibility that \nthe Senator, if he is willing, could work with us to see if we could \nwork out some procedure that may enable the chairman to agree, for his \npart, to accept the amendment. Is the Senator amenable to that \napproach, I ask the Senator from Maryland?\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me say to my distinguished colleague, I think we \ncould work something out. I am not trying to create a situation in \nwhich the Director General can simply end up retaining the current \nsystem. Because, as I understand it, the committee's concern was that \nthese disciplinary records were taken out of the file after 1 or 2 \nyears, no matter how serious, and therefore they were not always \navailable for review when a Foreign Service employee was considered for \npromotion. So the committee said, all right, we are going to keep it in \nthe record until you are tenured or you are next promoted.\n  I think that is reasonable to do for serious violations, but I think \nwe need to create a differentiation between serious violations and what \nwould be minor infractions. But I think if we require regulations be \nproposed that would define that difference and that would be submitted \nto the committee, it seems to me maybe that would work it out in a way \nthat is amenable to everyone.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I say to my friend from Maryland, I appreciate his \nwillingness to try to work this out. I think we can work out the issue \nof the nature of the seriousness of the offense through regs being \nsubmitted.\n  I am told there is one other concern that is being suggested now. \nRight now there is a floor of 2 years for suspension.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We keep that floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Pardon me?\n  Mr. SARBANES. We keep that floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I understand it, but rather than do this negotiation, \nprobably on the floor, that is another part Senator Helms wants to take \na look at.\n  What I suggest is I think we are very close to being able to work \nthis out. I commit to the Senator we will attempt to do that. \nObviously, if we do not, he is entitled to a vote on this, but I am \ninclined to believe we can do this and accept it to his satisfaction in \nthe managers' amendment. But we will have between now and Monday \nevening to try to work that out, if he is willing to do that?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes. I will be happy to work with the committee \nmembers. I am trying to recognize the committee's concerns and, in a \nsense, simply fine-tune the language. I am not contending in either \ninstance that there is no validity in the committee concerns. I concede \nthe validity of the committee concerns. But I am trying to fine-tune \nthis thing so I think it works in a better fashion.\n  Does the Senator want me to request it be temporarily laid aside so \nothers can offer amendments?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I suggest that, if the Senator is willing to do that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this amendment \nbe temporarily set aside, thereby opening the way for other Members to \noffer amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today we begin consideration of the State \nDepartment Authorization Act for fiscal year 2000 and 2001, which was \nreported out of the committee 17-1.\n  Mr. President, as I said, today the Senate begins consideration of \nthe State Department Authorization Act for Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001. \nThe bill was reported by the Committee on Foreign Relations on April 21 \nby an overwhelming vote of 17 to 1.\n  The bill contains several titles, which Chairman Helms has just \nsummarize. Let me just take a few minutes to highlight the major \nprovisions of the bill.\n  First the bill revives the so-called Helms-Biden legislation on \npaying our overdue bills to the United Nations.\n  This proposal, I remind my colleagues, was approved by the Senate in \nJune 1997 by a 90 to 5 vote. Unfortunately, it was ultimately \nsidetracked by the other body in the last Congress.\n  The version in this bill contains several changes from the bill \napproved in 1997--changes that were made to reflect the time that has \npassed since the deal was devised in the 105th Congress.\n  This package meets the central objective that I have--to pay back \nmost of our back dues, or arrears--to the United Nations. It provides \nfor the payment of $926 million in arrears, nearly all that we owe to \nthe United Nations, over the course of three years, with the amount of \nfunding released in each year contingent on the achievement of specific \nreforms in the United Nations.\n  Significant changes have been made to the final plan that we passed \nin the last Congress:\n  First, the bill provides a waiver for the two toughest provisions in \nthe package--the requirement to achieve a reduction to 20 percent in \nour regular budget assessment rate, and a requirement to establish a \n``contested arrears'' account for those arrears that are in dispute \nbetween the United States and the United Nations.\n  Seocnd, the bill provides more money upfront. A provision permitting \nthe President to waive $107 million in reimbursements owed by the \nUnited Nations to the United States has been moved from ``year three'' \nto ``year two'' of the bill. This will allow $682 million to be paid to \nthe United Nations as soon as the ``year one'' and ``year two'' \nconditions are met.\n  That is enough to cover most of our $712 million debt to the regular \nand peacekeeping budgets, which together constitute the bulk of our \narrears. I should emphasize here that a significant amount of this \nfunding--$575 million--has already been appropriated in the last two \nfiscal years.\n  I expect that the third year of funding will be appropriated this \nyear--because this money is exempt from the limits imposed by the 1997 \nBalanced Budget Act. So once we pass this bill, and the Secretary of \nState makes the necessary certifications, the money can begin to flow.\n  This package is the product of lengthy negotiations that began over \ntwo years ago.\n  The final details of this revised package were negotiated earlier \nthis year between the chairman, the Secretary of State, and me. It is \nsupported by the Clinton administration.\n  I think we have a good deal here. It is not everything that I wanted. \nIt is not everything that the Secretary of State wanted. And it is not \neverything the chairman wanted. That is the essence of compromise. And \nthis is a solid compromise that I hope our colleagues will support.\n  Let me briefly discuss a few other provisions in the bill.\n  First, we fully funded the President's budget request for most of the \nbill, including the operating accounts of the Department of State, \ninternational and cultural exchanges, and international broadcasting \noperations such as the Voice of America.\n\n[[Page S7258]]\n\n  Second, we developed bipartisan legislation to improve security at \nour embassies. The tragic bombings of our embassies in Kenya and \nTanzania last August underscored the vulnerability of our diplomatic \nposts. Some 80 percent of our embassies do not meet government security \nstandards for setback from the street.\n  An official review chaired by retired Admiral William Crowe concluded \nthat there had been a ``collective failure'' in the U.S. Government in \nfailing to address security at our embassies overseas, and called on \nthe government to devote $1.4 billion a year over each of the next ten \nyears to strengthen security.\n  The bill before the Senate authorizes $3 billion over the next five \nyears for construction of more secure facilities.\n  This meets the President's requested funding level, and accelerates \nit by a year. Even though it is the amount that the President sought, \nwe must recognize that it is just the beginning of what must be a \nsustained program of enhancing security.\n  Working overseas is dangerous. We can never make our embassies bomb-\nproof or risk-free. But we owe it to our dedicated employees who work \noverseas to provide the resources necessary to minimize known risks.\n  Third, the bill provides for the establishment of a new Assistant \nSecretary of State for Verification and Compliance, which will carry \nout a function that was handled at an equivalent level in the former \nArms Control and Disarmament Agency.\n  The verification function has long been headed by a Senate-confirmed \nofficial, and for good reason. Once a treaty is signed, we don't want \nits enforcement to be lost in the bureaucratic shuffle. Moreover, the \nexistence this office will be of considerable importance in obtaining \nSenate approval of future arms control treaties.\n  Fourth, the bill reauthorizes Radio Free Asia, which began \nbroadcasting in 1996 pursuant to legislation that I introduced.\n  Although it has been on the air less than three years, Radio Free \nAsia already plays an important role in providing news and information \nto the people living under dictatorial rule in East Asia, particularly \nthe People's Republic of China, where freedom of the press remains a \ndistant dream.\n  I am pleased that we are giving our stamp of approval to continue the \nradio at an increased level of funding.\n  This bill is a solid piece of legislation which enjoyed strong \nbipartisan support in the Foreign Relations Committee--as was reflected \nin the strong vote of 17 to 1 in the committee.\n  I want to join the chairman in putting the Senate on notice in two \nrespects.\n  First, we will oppose any amendments that address foreign assistance \nor security assistance. Those measures do not belong on the State \nDepartment authorization bill.\n  Second, we will oppose any measures dealing with ``sanctions reform'' \nor imposing new sanctions.\n  The chairman has scheduled hearings for next month to consider the \nvarious bills on sanctions reforms that are pending in the committee; \ntherefore, it would be premature to consider amendments on that subject \nat this time.\n  I pay public tribute to the chairman. Quite frankly, his leadership \nand the consensus which he has built in the committee in the last 18 \nmonths has been remarkable. This bill is a product of Jesse Helms.\n  There are some serious, significant changes we make--one of which I \nwill speak to in a moment--with the United Nations. That is through the \npersistence of my friend from North Carolina. As my mom might say, \neveryone is capable of redemption, and of late, the State Department \nhas finally redeemed itself on this one. I am confident--the Senator is \ncorrect--if and when Mr. Holbrooke is confirmed, we will have an \nadvocate for the Senator's position at the United Nations.\n  This bill contains several titles which the chairman has summarized. \nI will take a few minutes to highlight the major provisions of the bill \nfrom my perspective.\n  First, the bill revives the so-called Helms-Biden legislation on \npaying our overdue bills at the United Nations. The Senator from North \nCarolina and I have always been friends. We have become very close \nfriends, and we suffer from the same problem: Our friends get very \nangry with us when we compromise.\n  I am sure the friends of the Senator from North Carolina are very \nangry that he has worked out a solution to the so-called arrearages to \nget this moving, and Senator Biden's friends, on my side of the aisle, \nare very angry that I have agreed to it because they think it should be \nmore.\n  The bottom line is, we have done some good work. The Senate acted on \nwhat we did once before. It was the herculean efforts of the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, taking on folks on his side of the aisle, which \ncame to naught, and the not so herculean efforts on my part to take on \nfolks on my side of the aisle who did not think this was enough. We are \nback.\n  Hopefully, a little reason has permeated the environment and the \npurists on both sides will understand that what we have done is \nnecessary in the national interest, very much in the interest of the \nAmerican taxpayers, and is coupled to genuine reforms with which, when \none thinks about it, nobody really disagrees.\n  The argument on my side of the aisle is: We should not make them \nagree to the reforms by holding dues over their heads and holding \narrearages over their heads. Nobody I have spoken with says what \nChairman Helms wants is unreasonable.\n  I do not hear anybody coming to the floor saying there is no bloated \nbureaucracy at the United Nations. I do not hear anyone coming to the \nfloor saying that the United States should pay more. Everybody says we \nshould pay less as a percentage. I do not hear anyone arguing about the \nsubstance the chairman has been insisting on for years.\n  We are down to: Are we doing it the right way? It reminds me of an \nexpression--I will probably get myself in trouble with the French \nGovernment--which I think is classic. I was meeting with a State \nDepartment person, who will remain nameless, in a very significant \nposition, negotiating a very significant agreement with the French \nrelative to NATO. That is as much as I will say about it.\n  I asked this fellow: Are the French going to agree with this?\n  He said: Yes, I think they will, but it is kind of difficult.\n  I said: What do you mean?\n  He said: My friend's counterpart duly said to me last night, ``Yes, \nyes, yes, this will work in practice, but will it work in principle?''\n  That is what we are hung up on here. What the Senator has suggested \nin these reforms is practically what everyone has acknowledged is \nneeded. What we have been hung up on is the principle of whether or not \nit should be done the way in which we are doing it.\n  On the other side of the equation, nobody argues that if we do not \ncome up with this $926 million we are going to badly hurt the United \nNations. We are hurting our allies, we are hurting England, we are \nhurting the Germans, we are hurting others, because over $700 million \nof this money is for peacekeeping accounts that we agreed to sign on to \nwith the Brits, with the French, with the Germans, and with our NATO \nallies.\n  I think and I hope, I say to the chairman, a little bit of reason is \nseeping into this debate--I hope.\n  I guess I am preaching to the choir here, but hopefully some of the \ncongregation on the House side will hear what the choir is saying, \nbecause it is very important that we finally settle this issue and put \nit to bed.\n  The version in this bill contains several changes from the bill \napproved in 1997, changes that were made to reflect the time that has \npassed since the deal we put together--the chairman actually put \ntogether--devised in the 105th Congress which made sense. Time has \npassed. We have had to make some adjustments. I compliment and thank \nthe chairman, as well as the Secretary of State, who was not \noverwhelmingly enthused about this approach.\n  We finally, through the leadership of the chairman actually, are all \nsinging from the same hymnal, as they say up my way. The State \nDepartment is on the same page now, the Senator is on the same page, I \nam on the same page, hopefully, the House will get on the same page, \nand we can go on to the next hymn.\n  I think this package meets the central objectives that we have, at \nleast\n\n[[Page S7259]]\n\nthe ones I have--to pay back most of our so-called arrears to the \nUnited Nations. It provides for a payment of $926 million in arrears--\nnearly all of that we owe to the United Nations--over the course of 3 \nyears, with the amount of funding released in each year contingent on \nachievement of specific reforms in the United Nations.\n  This package is a product of very lengthy negotiations begun over 2 \nyears ago. The details of this revised package were negotiated earlier \nthis year between the chairman, the Secretary of State, and me. It is \nnow supported by the Clinton administration. I think we have a good \ndeal. It is not everything I wanted, and it is not everything the \nSecretary wanted, and it is clearly not everything the chairman wanted, \nbut that is the essence of compromise. This is a solid compromise. I \nhope our colleagues will support it.\n  Let me briefly discuss a few other provisions of the bill.\n  First, we fully funded the President's budget request for most of the \nbill, including the operations account in the State Department, \ninternational and cultural exchanges, and the international \nbroadcasting operations, such as the Voice of America.\n  Second, we developed a bipartisan legislative approach to improve the \nsecurity of our embassies. The tragic bombings of our embassies in \nKenya and Tanzania last August underscored the vulnerability of our \ndiplomatic posts. Some 80 percent of our embassies do not meet \nGovernment security standards for setbacks from the streets, just to \nstate one aspect of the problem.\n  The official review, chaired by retired Admiral William Crowe, \nconcluded that there had been a ``collective failure'' in the U.S. \nGovernment in failing to address the security of our embassies overseas \nand called on the Government to devote $1.4 billion a year over each of \nthe next 10 years to strengthen security.\n  The bill before the Senate authorizes $3 billion over the next 5 \nyears for the construction of more secure facilities. This meets the \nPresident's requested funding level and accelerates it by a year. Even \nthough it is the amount that the President sought, we must recognize \nthat it is just the beginning of what must be a sustained program of \nenhancing security.\n\n  I know my colleague in the Chair knows better than anybody in this \nbuilding what it is like to have a Government building vulnerable to \nand subject to terrorist attacks. No one knows the tragedy that flows \nfrom that better than the Presiding Officer.\n  We are as exposed in our foreign embassies around the world as \nbuildings are in this town. We cannot and we should not become \n``Fortress America'' internally. But we must do the reasonable things \nthat can be done outside of the country in hostile environments or \nenvironments where we have less control over the protection of our \ncitizens.\n  Working overseas is dangerous. We can never make our embassies \nbombproof or risk-free. But we owe it to our dedicated employees who \nwork overseas to provide resources necessary to minimize the known \nrisk.\n  Third, the bill provides for the establishment of a new Assistant \nSecretary of State for Verification and Compliance, who will carry out \na function that was handled at the equivalent level in the former Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency.\n  I might add, all we are doing now is putting in place what the \ndistinguished chairman is the father of, and that is a significant \nreorganization of the State Department apparatus. When people ask me, \nwhy was this so important to Senator Helms and why did he work so hard \nto get it done, I analogize it to what our former colleague, Barry \nGoldwater, did in terms of the reorganization of the Defense \nDepartment. It is as consequential, it is as significant, and I believe \nit will be remembered as successful as Senator Goldwater's initiatives \nwere with regard to the Defense Department.\n  It basically takes us into the 21st century and recognizes how \nfundamentally changed the world is. I think he is to be complimented \nfor it. I plan, as long as I am here, that every time we implement a \nnew aspect of his reorganization plan, to remind our colleagues why it \nis occurring. It is occurring because the Senator from North Carolina \nwas as persistent as he was, and as consistent as he is, in making sure \nthis organization is modernized.\n  The verification function had long been headed by a Senate confirmed \nofficial, and for a good reason. Once a treaty was signed, we did not \nwant its enforcement to be lost in the bureaucratic shuffle. Moreover, \nthe existence of this office will be of considerable importance to \nobtaining Senate approval of future treaties.\n  Fourth, the bill reauthorizes Radio Free Asia, which began \nbroadcasting in 1996 pursuant to legislation I introduced.\n  I must tell you that we all have our pet initiatives that we care a \ngreat deal about because we think they have a significant impact on our \nsecurity and our interests. I have been ferocious, and some suggest too \nvocal, in my support of the radios.\n  But I want to again publicly thank the chairman, who maybe disagreed \nwith me in some aspects of this, but was willing to go along with my \nbasic approach on how to deal with the radios. I know, from his many \nyears during the cold war, of his devotion to Radio Free Europe and \nVoice of America. I appreciate his lending his considerable support and \nweight to the way in which we are approaching, under the \nreorganization, the so-called radios.\n\n  Although it has been on the air less than 3 years, by the way, Radio \nFree Asia already plays an important role in providing news and \ninformation for people living under the dictatorial rule in East Asia, \nparticularly the People's Republic of China, where freedom of the press \nremains a distant dream. I am pleased that we are giving our stamp of \napproval to continue the radio at increased levels of funding to make \nit workable.\n  There is much more to say, but I will stop at this point in the \ninterest of accommodating my colleagues. But this bill is a solid piece \nof legislation which enjoys strong bipartisan support in the Foreign \nRelations Committee. Again, I want to remind everybody, this, as the \ndefense authorization bill, usually attracts every contentious issue \nthat is out there. It is because of the leadership of the chairman that \nwe came out of the committee with a 17-1 vote.\n  My colleagues should understand--it is presumptuous for me to say \nthis--that this is a reflection of the fact that what is in this bill \nis solid. It is a solid, solid bill. We would not have gotten this kind \nof consensus out of an ideologically divided committee but a committee \nwhere we are totally committed to making sure we have the strongest \nability, the greatest ability, to project our foreign policy around the \nworld.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for his leadership. I still think people \nare probably scratching their heads: How do Biden and Helms get along \nso well and produce such bipartisan approaches? Because I think we both \nrespect each other, but also because I understand that the chairman's \nmotivation here is to make this committee's work a product that can \npass the bipartisan muster of the Senate and the Congress. I compliment \nhim again for his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator, the ranking \nmember of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Biden, is far too \ngenerous. Several times in the past year or two, former Secretaries of \nState, and other past foreign policy officials of this Government, have \nsaid that the Foreign Relations Committee is now relevant. I think that \nis a high compliment to the committee.\n  But it would not have happened if it had not been for Joe Biden. When \nJoe Biden became--by his choice--the ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, when I became chairman, we made a pact that we \nwould work together. I have not enjoyed any other of my services in the \nSenate more than the cooperation with him.\n  I have just been amazed at how much he has learned about foreign \npolicy since we have been on opposite sides of the committee. I have \ngotten to know Joe Biden well. He is a good partner, a good Senator, \nand an expert on foreign policy. And I compliment him.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n\n[[Page S7260]]\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask the chairman to yield so that I may \nenter this unanimous consent agreement.\n  I join in that exchange of compliments to each Senator. I commend the \nchairman of the committee and the ranking member on the Democratic \nside, Senator Biden. Senator Helms, you have done a great job. I know \nyou have put a lot of time and energy into this particular bill, and we \nwould not be here without your persistence and without the cooperation \nof Senator Biden.\n  It is an important bill. When you showed up in my office a week or so \nago and said we are ready to go, we need to do this, I was determined \nwe would find a place to do it. I think you have now worked through an \nagreement that will allow us to get it completed and final passage, \nhopefully, Monday afternoon. I would like to enter into this unanimous \nconsent request and thank both of you for the outstanding work that you \nare doing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that with respect to the State Department \nauthorization bill, all amendments must be filed by 11:45 today, with \nthe exception of the managers' amendment and any second-degree \namendments.\n  I further ask that any votes ordered with respect to amendments be \nstacked at a time to be determined by the majority leader and the \nDemocratic leader, and the following amendments limited to the \nfollowing times, to be equally divided in the usual form.\n  The amendments are as follows: Dodd amendment regarding the inspector \ngeneral, 30 minutes; Sarbanes amendment No. 689; Wellstone amendment \nregarding child soldiers, 90 minutes; Wellstone-Harkin, ILO convention \namendment, 30 minutes; Wellstone, women and children amendment, 90 \nminutes; Feingold, war crimes in Rwanda, 30 minutes; Sarbanes amendment \nwith regard to the U.N., 2 hours; Feingold amendment regarding NED, 40 \nminutes; the Leahy amendment regarding East Timor, 20 minutes; the \nHelms-Biden managers' amendment; the Feinstein arms trafficking \namendment, 30 minutes; and a relevant amendment by the majority leader \nand the Democratic leader.\n\n  Before the Chair rules, let me say again, the managers' packet will \ninclude the following: Amendments offered by Senators Abraham, \nAshcroft, Kennedy, Dodd, Durbin, Moynihan, Reid of Nevada, Bingaman, \nThomas, Biden, Lugar, Grams, another one by Lugar, and others that have \nbeen cleared by the two managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. In light of the agreement, there will be no further votes \ntoday, and the next votes will occur at 5:30 on Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7260-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REDUCTION IN VOLUME STEEL IMPORTS--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Because the legislation \n     would affect direct spending and revenues, pay-as-you-go \n     procedures would apply; the net impact would generally be \n     less than $500,000 a year.\n       Section 4 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) \n     excludes from the application of that act any provisions that \n     are necessary for the national security or the ratification \n     or implementation of international treaty obligations.

The bill specifies \n     authorizations of appropriations that total $15.4 billion \n     over the 2000-2004 period. In addition, it contains a number \n     of other provisions with potential budgetary impacts. CBO \n     estimates that the bill would result in outlays totaling \n     $13.6 billion over the five-year period, assuming \n     appropriation of the authorized amounts. CBO assumes that \n     outlays would follow historical spending patterns except for \n     payments of arrears to the United Nations (U.N.).\n       Arrears to the United Nations. Title IX would authorize the \n     appropriation of funds to pay amounts owed by the United \n     States under various treaties to the U.N. and related \n     agencies. Specifically, the bill would authorize new \n     appropriations totaling $244 million for fiscal year 2000 and \n     obligation of previously appropriated amounts for 1998 and \n     1999--$100 million and $475 million, respectively. In \n     addition, subject to appropriation action, the bill would \n     authorize the President to forgo $107 million that the United \n     Nations owes the Department of Defense (DOD), in return for a \n     corresponding reduction in U.S. payments owed to the United \n     Nations.\n       Appropriations for the 1998 and 1999 installments have not \n     been obligated pending an authorization. CBO estimates that \n     enactment of S. 886 would permit the $100 million provided \n     for 1998 to be obligated and disbursed in 2000. S. 886 would \n     retain the conditions that were enacted in the 1999 \n     appropriations act that are likely to delay obligation of the \n     $475 million until 2001. Based on information from the \n     Department of State, CBO estimates that the conditions \n     attached to the funding for 2000 are likely to delay their \n     obligation and expenditure until at least 2002.\n       Fees for Affidavits of Support. Subject to approval in \n     advance in an appropriation act, section 212 would authorize \n     the State Department to charge a fee for helping to prepare \n     certain affidavits as part of an immigrant visa application. \n     Proceeds from the fees would be deposited as offsetting \n     collections and would be available for spending, subject to \n     appropraiton. Based on information from the department, CBO \n     estimates that it would charge a $50 fee and collect roughly \n     $17 million a year. Because spending would initially lag \n     behind collections, this provision would lower net outlays by \n     $3 million in 2000 and $1 million each year in 2001 and 2002 \n     before spending would completely offset collections.\n       Currency Fluctuations. In addition to the bill's specific \n     authorizations for contributions to international \n     organizations and programs, section 801(f) would authorize \n     such sums as may be necessary in 2000 and 2001 to compensate \n     for adverse fluctuations in exchange rates that might affect \n     those contributions. Any funds appropriated for this purpose \n     would be obligated and expended subject to certification by \n     the Office of Management and Budget. Currency fluctuations \n     are extremely difficult to estimate in advance, and they \n     could result in spending either higher or lower than the \n     amounts specifically authorized in the bill for contributions \n     to international organizations and programs. Therefore, CBO \n     estimates no change in spending from this provision.\n       Miscellaneous Provisions. The bill includes several \n     provisions that would combine to cost about $1 million \n     annually, but each provision would probably cost less than \n     $500,000 a year. The individual budgetary impacts are \n     insignificant because they would involve small payments to a \n     few people.\n       Section 312 would allow U.S. citizens hired abroad to \n     receive a different (usually higher) amount of compensation \n     than a foreign national employed in the same position.\n       Section 331 would grant employees living in the United \n     States and working in Canada or Mexico adjustments for \n     locality pay equal to what they would receive if they worked \n     nearby in the United States.\n       Section 332 would allow federal employees who transfer to \n     an international organization to make retroactive \n     contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) upon their \n     return to the federal government and to receive matching \n     government contributions and lost earnings on their \n     retroactive contributions. (See the following section for the \n     revenue effects of this provision.)\n       Section 333 would authorize allowances to compensate \n     dependents of a deceased employee who are returning to the \n     United States.\n       Section 334 would allow employees working abroad who send a \n     dependent to school away from their post to use an education \n     allowance to pay for room, board, and periodic travel between \n     the post and the school.\n       Section 335 would authorize advances of pay for employees \n     with medical emergencies.\n       Direct Spending and Revenues. The bill contains other \n     provisions that would affect direct spending or revenues by \n     less than $500,000 in most years.\n       Machine Readable Visa. S. 886 would extend, through 2001, \n     the Secretary of State's authority to charge a fee for \n     machine readable visas and border crossing cards and to spend \n     the collections on consular activities. CBO estimates the \n     State Department would collect and spend over $300 million in \n     2001 under this authority.\n       Deaths and Estates of U.S. Citizens Overseas. Section 214 \n     would expand the authority of the State Department to oversee \n     and liquidate the estates of U.S. citizens who lived overseas \n     but died intestate. Under current law, the department is \n     authorized to take possession of and dispose of estates. \n     After a certain period, if no claims have been made against \n     the estate, the proceeds from the sale are transferred to the \n     U.S. state in which the deceased citizen last lived. If the \n     state is unknown, the proceeds are deposited into the \n     Treasury as miscellaneous receipts (revenues).\n       The bill would make three substantive changes that would \n     increase miscellaneous receipts. First, if the country in \n     which the citizen died is unable to issue a death \n     certificate, the State Department would issue a report of \n     death (or presumptive death), which would allow for the \n     disposition of the estate. The $10 fee charged for the report \n     would be deposited in the Treasury. (The fee and other \n     expenses associated with disposition of the estate are paid \n     by the estate.) Second, instead of transferring the proceeds \n     of the sale to the U.S. state, these proceeds would be \n     deposited directly into the Treasury. Finally, the bill would \n     allow the State Department to take title to any real \n     property. The department would have the option to retain the \n     property for its own use or sell it and deposit the proceeds \n     in the Treasury. CBO estimates that these changes would raise \n     miscellaneous receipts by less than $500,000 in most years; \n     however, sales of real property could net over $500,000 in \n     rare instances\n       Thrift Savings Plan. CBO estimates that section 332, \n     discussed above, would reduce income tax receipts by less \n     than $100,000 annually. Under current law, federal employees \n     can count service with an international organization towards \n     their retirement annuity, but they cannot participate in TSP \n     during this period. Under S. 886, employees who are covered \n     by the Foreign Service Pension System or the Federal \n     Employees' Retirement System would be eligible to make \n     retroactive contributions to TSP. Like all TSP contributions, \n     these retroactive contributions would not be subject to \n     income tax until distributed. According to information from \n     the State Department, approximately 90 federal employees are \n     serving with international organizations at any one time.\n       Reimbursement from the United Nations. Section 813 would \n     require the President to seek reimbursement for goods and \n     services provided to the United Nations for peacekeeping \n     operations and other emergencies. The President has authority \n     to provide goods and services on a reimbursable basis and to \n     credit reimbursements to current appropriations if the funds \n     are received within 180 days after the close of the fiscal \n     year in which the services were provided. This section would \n     credit the funds to current appropriations regardless of when \n     the reimbursement is received or allow them to be used to \n     offset peacekeeping assessments if the funds cannot be \n     applied to any appropriation. The section could reduce \n     offsetting receipts, though CBO estimates that the loss of \n     receipts would not be significant.\n       During the mid-1990s, DoD provided $175 million in goods \n     and services on a reimbursable basis to support U.N. \n     peacekeeping activities. Most of the reimbursements were \n     deposited into the Treasury. In recent years, however, the \n     DoD has provided less than $1 million a year in goods and \n     services to the United Nations. CBO expects this more recent \n     pattern to continue for the next five years.\n       Lockerbie Trial. Section 727 would authorize the President \n     to seize and liquidate blocked Libyan assets to pay the \n     reasonable costs of travel for certain individuals to attend \n     the trial of those suspected of bombing Pan American flight \n     103. The bill would authorize payment of travel expenses to \n     the Netherlands for the immediate family members of U.S. \n     victims, and the authorized amount would be whatever is \n     necessary to cover those expenses. According to information \n     from the Office of Foreign Assets Control, there are \n     currently $400 million in blocked Libyan assets and roughly \n     $600 million in claims against them.\n       Although CBO does not expect that this provision would have \n     a significant net budgetary impact over the next five years, \n     liquidating Libyan assets could create a claim against the \n     U.S. government. Should the United States and Libyan \n     governments return to normal relations, the United States \n     might be required to repay the funds or reduce the amount of \n     compensation to other claimants. CBO estimates that \n     transportation and per diem for two weeks would cost $3,000 \n     per person. Depending on the number of family members that \n     choose to attend the trial and on the length of their stay, \n     costs could approach $500,000.\n       Reimbursements From a State. Section 824 would authorize \n     the commissioner of the International Boundary and Water \n     Commission to accept and spend funds from state and local \n     governments. Upon request, those contributions would be used \n     to provide technical tests, surveys, or similar services. CBO \n     estimates that collections and spending would not be \n     significant in any year.\n\n[[Page S7262]]\n\n       Pay-as-you-go Considerations: The bill contains several \n     provisions that affect direct spending and revenues; however, \n     the net impact is estimated to be less than $500,000 a year.\n       Intergovernmental and Private-Sector Impact: Section 4 of \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) excludes from the \n     application of that act any provisions that are necessary for \n     the national security or the ratification or implementation \n     of international treaty obligations. CBO has determined that \n     the provisions in title VI of S. 886 either fall within that \n     exclusion or contain no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates. All other titles of the bill contain no private-\n     sector or intergovernmental mandates and would have no \n     significant effects on the budgets of state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       Estimate Prepared by: Federal Costs: Sunita D'Monte and \n     Joseph C. Whitehill (226-2840) for the Department of State; \n     Gary Brown (226-2860) for the International Boundary and \n     Water Commission; Eric Rollins (226-2820) for retirement \n     benefits; and Jennifer Winkler (226-2880) for employee \n     compensation.\n       Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: Leo Lex \n     (225-3220).\n       Impact on the Private Sector: Keith Mattrick (226-2940).\n       Estimate Approved by: Robert A.

Mr. President, 1 year ago the distinguished minority \nleader, Mr. Daschle, and I introduced S. 2180, the Superfund Recycling \nEquity Act, to overcome the unintended consequences of Superfund which \ncontinue to have major negative impacts on recycling. There is \nwidespread recognition of the need for relief in this area, as \nevidenced by the number of Superfund bills that have been introduced \nsince the 103d Congress, as well as the measures being considered in \nthis Congress, all of which include nearly identical recycling relief \nprovisions.\n  I am grateful for the decision by Senators Chafee and Smith to \ninclude a strong recycling provision in their Superfund reform bill \ncurrently pending before the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nThis inclusion was an important contributing reason to my decision to \nbe an original cosponsor of the Superfund Program Completion Act of \n1999 (S. 1090). As the committee approaches a markup of its \nlegislation, I understand that the committee chairman and subcommittee \nchairman are negotiating with their minority counterparts and the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency in an effort to reach a bipartisan \nconsensus. In the spirit of the last year's Superfund Recycling Equity \nAct, which collected 63 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle, I \nendorse such an approach and look forward to debating the bill on the \nSenate floor.\n  Today, I am pleased to join the minority leader in bringing to the \nattention of the Senate the need to move expeditiously in this regard, \nrecognizing that another year has passed without needed relief for \nrecyclers.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The distinguished majority leader is correct in noting \nthe attention of many bills directed at Superfund relief for recyclers \nin this session, the bipartisan interest in this subject, and the broad \nbased, bicameral commitment directed to correcting these unintended \nconsequences. The Superfund Litigation Reduction and Brownfields \nCleanup Act of 1999 (S. 1105), introduced by Senators Baucus, \nLautenberg, Lincoln, and me, contains a provision similar to the \ndistinguished majority leader's and my bill, S. 2180, introduced in \nthis body 1 year ago.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have worked for years with my colleagues to reform \nSuperfund. We must put this important program back on track to get the \nenvironment cleaned up effectively and efficiently, with polluters \npaying the bills, not innocent parties. There was clear tangible \nevidence of how Superfund is off track in a recent GAO report which was \nrequested by House Commerce Committee Chairman Bliley. The GAO report \nrevealed that a majority of the funds go for activities other than \nclean up, and this is clearly wrong. I hope the Senate will act soon \nbecause America deserves a viable Superfund program.\n  While there are different bills being considered in the Senate at \nthis time, both the minority leader and I stand committed to Superfund \nrelief for recyclables and we assure all Senators that the differences \nbetween the bills in their recycling language will be addressed in the \ninterest of moving forward with this needed legislation. With the \nbipartisan support of this needed relief in place, Mr. President, it is \nessential to stress that relief for recycling, an issue of fundamental \nfairness, must be accomplished in this session.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Along with my Senate colleagues, I have worked for years \nto reform Superfund, and by all accounts the program has been vastly \nimproved over the past 6 years. Today, I reaffirm my commitment to work \nwith the majority leader to ensure passage of needed Superfund relief \nfor recyclables in this session and urge passage of a recycling bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. In this regard, I applaud the efforts of Chairman Shuster \nand Boehlert, who have worked tirelessly with their very competent \nstaffs to help resolve the one significant remaining issue in \ncontention.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of a recently negotiated and signed agreement dealing with paper \nscrap by all the affected parties.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                Institute of Scrap\n\n\n                                   Recycling Industries, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1999.\n     Hon.

This amendment \n     has been negotiated over the last two months and reflects a \n     compromise that we find to be both reasonable and functional. \n     None of us will seek, or encourage others to seek, amendments \n     that would undermine the compromise we have reached. We are \n     satisfied with the legislative language we have labored so \n     long to craft and intend that this language be used in any \n     legislative vehicle that addresses recycling issues in either \n     House of Congress.\n       In closing, we would like to thank you for your patience as \n     we worked to remove one of the longstanding obstacles to \n     meaningful\n\n[[Page S7263]]\n\n     Superfund reform.

The successful efforts of Congressmen Shuster and Boehlert \ndemonstrate again that the recycling issue can proceed on a bipartisan \nbasis and that no serious opposition to its adoption exists.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am pleased to join majority leader in documenting that \na compromise has been reached on the paper scrap issue. This compromise \nis especially important in light of the fact that during her recent \ntestimony before the House Water Resources and Environment \nSubcommittee, the EPA Administrator repeated her support for the \nrecycling provision, a version of which collected 310 House cosponsors. \nThe Administrator stated that should identical language to S. 2180 show \nup again this year, the administration ``would continue to support \nit.''\n  And, in answer to a question, Administrator Browner stated at the \nhearing that EPA would oppose an exemption for PCB-contaminated paper \nor materials in excess of 50 parts per million. This issue is important \nnot only to EPA, but also the Department of Justice and the \nenvironmental community. For that reason, I am delighted that a \ncompromise was found.\n  Mr. LOTT. Finally, I would like to thank Mr. Phil Morris of New \nAlbany, MS, a long time friend and fellow Mississippian, who, as a \ntraditional recycler, has struggled with the negative aspects of \nSuperfund. Phil first brought this subject to my attention and, though \nour inability to pass Superfund reform last year led to sharp increases \nin his unintended Superfund liability, I commit to him and his fellow \nrecyclers that Congress will act this year to ensure that such \nunreasonable, unfair and unintended actions under Superfund will cease. \nI again thank all supporters of this provision, especially the \ndistinguished minority leader for supporting this attempt to restore \nequity and fairness where it has long been missing.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As is the case with Senator Lott, my constituents have \nsuffered because Superfund has been inappropriately directed at them. \nOn this first anniversary of the introduction of S. 2180, it is an \nappropriate time for all Senators to commit to act on this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. As the original Senate sponsor of legislation designated \nto remove unintended Superfund hindrances to recycling, which I \nproposed for correction in the 103rd Congress, I applaud the majority \nand minority leaders for their continuing joint efforts. There is no \nmore telling statement of need than to see partisan politics put aside \nin the greater public interest. Both Senators Lott and Daschle have \ndemonstrated outstanding leadership in helping to assure increased \nrecycling that will occur when the Superfund burden, so inappropriately \nassessed, will finally be removed.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. It was my privilege as a Member of the other body to \nintroduce a bill in the 103rd Congress that would have eliminated much \nof the unintended Superfund hindrance that is limiting legitimate \nrecycling.\n  Now as a Senator, I am proud to stand with the majority and minority \nleaders and the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia on this \nfirst anniversary of the introduction of S. 2180 to ensure Superfund \nrelief for recycling will be addressed in this session of the 106th \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7263-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7263-S7264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE FEDERAL ERRONEOUS RETIREMENT COVERAGE CORRECTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the Senator from \nMississippi, Mr. Cochran, in introducing S. 1232, the Federal Erroneous \nRetirement Coverage Corrections Act. This legislation provides relief \nto those federal employees who were placed in an incorrect retirement \nsystem during the transition to the Federal Employees Retirement System \nfrom the Civil Service Retirement System in the mid-1980s.\n  As the ranking Democrat on the International Security, Proliferation, \nand Federal Services Subcommittee, I am committed to correcting the \nerroneous pension problems facing anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 \nindividuals. S. 1232 provides a reasonable solution in affording \nmisclassified federal workers, former employees, retirees, and \nsurvivors with equitable relief from\n\n[[Page S7264]]\n\nthese retirement coverage errors. Moreover, the measure gives those \naffected a choice between corrected retirement coverage and the \ncoverage the employee expected to receive, without disturbing Social \nSecurity coverage law.\n  Similar legislation was offered in 1998, and my colleague, the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, \nand Federal Services, held a hearing on the measure at which officials \nfrom the Office of Personnel Management and the Federal Retirement \nThrift Investment Board testified in support of the bill.\n  I believe this measure addresses the concerns of federal workers who \nhave been placed in the wrong retirement system. It offers a workable \nand reasonable solution, and I ask my colleagues to support this \nlegislation. I also wish to note that S. 1232 enjoys the support of the \nOffice of Personnel Management and the two largest federal employee \nunions, the American Federation of Government Employees and the \nNational Treasury Employees Union, that are encouraged by the \nbipartisan effort that went into crafting this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7264-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               GUN CRIME COMMITTED BY 18 TO 20 YEAR OLDS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week, Vice President Gore released a \nnew study focusing on the connection between young adults and gun \ncrimes. This report, jointly prepared by the Departments of Treasury \nand Justice, documents an alarmingly high rate of gun violence among 18 \nto 20 year olds.\n  The report shows that while 18, 19, and 20 years olds make up only 4 \npercent of the U.S. population, they commit an astounding 24 percent of \ngun murders in our country. In addition, the report shows that 18 year \nolds commit 35 percent more gun murders than 21 year olds; double the \ngun murders of 24 year olds; triple the gun murders of 28 year olds; \nand four times the gun murders of 30 year olds.\n  There are several loopholes in our current firearms laws that permit \nyoung people access to handguns and other deadly weapons. We must close \nthose loopholes, especially for the 18 to 20 year olds, who contribute \nto such a high percentage of gun crimes. One of those loopholes allows \n18 to 20 year olds, minors, to purchase handguns from unlicensed \ndealers, private collectors or friends, even though it would be illegal \nfor them to purchase the same handgun from a federally licensed dealer.\n  There are also additional loopholes in federal law that permit 18 to \n20 year olds to purchase semiautomatic weapons and large capacity \nammunition feeding devices from anyone willing to sell them. These \nweapons, such as AK-47s and Uzis, and the 50 rounds per minute clips \nthat accompany them, are not the type of weapons needed for hunting, \nthey are the type needed for killing, and that is what they are too \noften used for.\n  There is strong precedent for imposing minimum age requirements for \nengaging in dangerous activities. Congress and the states worked \ntogether in the past to minimize public safety concerns by ensuring \nthat states raised their legal drinking ages to 21. This was in \nresponse to evidence that young adults were involved in proportionately \nfar more driving accidents while intoxicated. Increasing the age \nrequirement for drinking alcohol, reduced automobile accidents \ndramatically. And, in the first year after Michigan raised its drinking \nage from 18 to 21, there was a 21 percent decline in alcohol related \ndeaths among drivers age 18 to 20.\n  Most recently, a report to be released today by a national commission \nstudying the impact of gambling will apparently recommend that the \nminimum age for all forms of gambling be raised to 21. Although \ncurrently most casinos require gamblers to be 21, other forms of \ngambling, such as state lotteries have an age requirement of 18. The \nNational Gambling Impact Study Commission contends that there should be \ntighter restrictions on state lotteries and other forms of betting \nbecause of the dangers and risks of excessive gambling.\n  Surely if there are clear and compelling reasons to prevent young \npeople from drinking and gambling, there are even better reasons, as \ndocumented by the Gore report, to prevent 18, 19 and 20 year olds from \nowning an assault weapon or a handgun. I am a cosponsor of legislation \nintroduced by Senator Schumer, S. 891, that would prohibit the sale or \ntransfer of these weapons to young adults as well as prohibit \npossession of these weapons by those under 21, while maintaining \nexemptions under current law. In my judgment, it is critical that \nCongress act quickly to close these loopholes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7264-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7264-S7266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-3781.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to make \npermanent the visa waiver program for certain visitors to the United \nStates; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                        the visa waiver program\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend the \nImmigration and Nationality Act to make permanent the visa waiver \nprogram for certain visitors to the United States.\n  The visa waiver program has been an unprecedented success in reducing \nbarriers to travel and tourism to and from the United States. The \nprogram allows a citizen of a participating country to forego visa \napplication at a U.S. consulate abroad, and allows them to travel to \nthe U.S. for business or pleasure and make application for entry \ndirectly to the INS at a port of entry. To use this privilege, an \napplicant agrees to waive rights to challenge the decision of the INS \ninspector, and agrees to depart the U.S. within 90 days. More than 10 \nmillion visitors used the visa waiver program in fiscal year 1995. This \nrepresents 76 percent of the total number of non-immigrant entries by \ncitizens of visa waiver countries. Visitors entering under the visa \nwaiver program accounted for just under 50 percent of all temporary \nbusiness and tourist entries.\n  In the ten years since the implementation of the visa waiver program, \ninternational visitors have become accustomed to the program's \nrequirements, and use it routinely. The program has effectively served \nthe purpose for which it was designed, to facilitate the efficient flow \nof low-risk foreign tourists and business travelers. Simultaneously, \nthe program has afforded Department of State consular officers more \ntime to focus efforts on individuals who visit the U.S. for other \npurposes, such as employment or study, or those who intend to remain in \nthe U.S. for extended periods. Further, it has allowed the Department \nof State to drastically reduce its consular staff at low-risk \nlocations, and strengthen efforts in high risk locations. Yet, all this \npales in comparison to the real benefit of the visa waiver program, \nthat of expanded foreign travel and tourism to the U.S. Put simply, the \nU.S. needs this program to remain competitive with the many other \nnations around the globe who are competing for the finite pool of \nbusiness travelers and tourists.\n  In 1996, the World Tourism Organization reported that the United \nStates was the second most popular international tourist destination \nand the number one location for tourism expenditures. Of the 44.8 \nmillion arrivals that year, 12.4 million entered under the visa waiver \nprogram. International tourism in the U.S. is a $65 billion enterprise \nwhich boosts the economies of many local communities.\n  In my home state of Hawaii, tourism is an $11 billion indusry which \ngenerates about one-quarter of the state's tax revenue and one-third of \nits jobs. It is estimated that 80 percent of all international visitors \narriving at Honolulu International Airport arrive under the visa waiver \nprogram. We know that the visa waiver program has been very successful \nbecause it provides a big boost for Japanese visitors to travel to \nHawaii. Our long-term goal for a permanent visa waiver program would be \nto expand participation of the program in the Asia-Pacific region. \nCurrently, most of the 26 eligible countries are in Europe. Only four \nof these countries are in the Asia-Pacific region--Australia, Japan, \nBrunei, and New Zealand. We hope that South Korea and China will be \nfuture participants in an expanded program.\n\n  While the pilot program has been extended periodically since its \ninception,\n\n[[Page S7267]]\n\nits unqualified success justifies a permanent program. Further, because \nthe program's life has at times been uncertain and somewhat \nunpredictable, particularly at times when an authorization is about to \nexpire, any real or perceived lapse in the program causes needless \nturmoil and uncertainty among the industry and government both here and \nabroad and, most important, the traveling public. In the ten years \nsince it commenced, the benefit of the program has been clearly proven, \nand the need for it to remain a pilot program has ceased. To sunset the \nprogram in April 2000 or in the future would require a reinvestment of \nsignificant capital, both human and otherwise. In addition, because the \nvisa waiver program is based on reciprocity, any termination or \nrestriction of the program would likely result in a substantial \nbacklash by other participating nations against U.S. citizens traveling \nabroad, resulting in more entry burdens for U.S. citizens when they \nattempt to enter other visa waiver countries.\n  Visa waiver participants, by their very definition, are low-risk \ntravelers. There is no data which indicates that visa waiver travelers \nstay longer than permitted otherwise violate the terms of their \nadmission in any greater numbers than any other population of the \ntraveling public. Another important benefit of the visa waiver program \nis the standardization of passports and machine readable documentation, \nwhich is used as an inducement for acceptance of a country into the \nprogram. The ability to read a document by machine has greatly \nincreased the efficiency of the Federal inspection service process.\n  I can say without reservation that this program is a resounding \nsuccess. It has bolstered the U.S. economy through the expedited \nadmission of millions of legitimate short-term visitors for business, \nallowing for the negotiation of contracts for the provision of American \ngoods and services to the world. It has provided a welcome boost to the \nU.S. tourism industry, which employs thousands of American citizens, \nthrough the visa-free admission of millions of foreign tourists. We \nmust support permanent reauthorization of this highly effective \nprogram. The visa waiver program is not just a win-win situation, it is \na win for business, a win for tourism, and a win for effective \nmanagement of the Department of State.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1242\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to revise and \nextend the prostate cancer preventive health program; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n              PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH AND PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, this year 37,000 American men will die, and \n179,300 will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, the second leading \ncause of cancer-related deaths in American men. Cancer of the prostate \ngrows slowly, without symptoms, and thus is often undetected until in \nits most advanced and incurable stage. It is critical that men are \naware of the risk of prostate cancer and take steps to ensure early \ndetection.\n\n  While the average age of a man diagnosed with prostate cancer is 66, \nthe chance of developing prostate cancer rises dramatically with age--\nwhich makes it important for men to be screened or consult their \nhealthcare professional. The American Cancer Society and the American \nUrological Association recommend that men over 50 receive both an \nannual physical exam and a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood test. \nAfrican-American men, who are at higher risk, and men with a family \nhistory of prostate cancer should begin yearly screening at age 40.\n  Even if the blood test is positive, however, it does not mean that a \nman definitely has prostate cancer. In fact, only 25 percent of men \nwith positive PSAs do. Further testing is needed to determine if cancer \nis actually present. Once the cancer is diagnosed, treatment options \nvary according to the individual. In elderly men, for example, the \ncancer may be especially slow growing and may not spread to other parts \nof the body. In those cases, treatment of the prostate may not be \nnecessary, and physicians often monitor the cancer with follow-up \nexaminations.\n  Unfortunately, preventive risk factors for prostate cancer are \ncurrently unknown and the effective measures to prevent this disease \nhave not been determined. In addition, scientific evidence is \ninsufficient to determine if screening for prostate cancer reduces \ndeaths or if treatment of disease at an early stage is more effective \nthan no treatment in prolonging a person's life. Currently, health \npractitioners cannot accurately determine which cancer will progress to \nbecome clinically significant and which will not. Thus, screening and \ntesting for early detection of prostate cancer should be discussed \nbetween a man and his healthcare practitioners.\n  In an effort to help address the serious issues of prostate cancer \nscreening, to increase awareness and surveillance of prostate cancer, \nand to unlock the current mysteries of prostate cancer through \nresearch, I rise to introduce the ``Prostate Cancer Research and \nPrevention Act.''\n  The ``Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention Act'' expands the \nauthority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to \ncarry-out activities related to prostate cancer screening and overall \nawareness and surveillance of the disease and extends the authority of \nthe National Institutes of Health to conduct basic and clinical \nresearch in combating prostate cancer.\n  The bill directs the CDC to make grants to States and local health \ndepartments to increase awareness, surveillance, information \ndissemination regarding prostate cancer, and to examine the scientific \nevidence regarding screening for prostate cancer. The main focus is to \ncomprehensively evaluate of the effectiveness of various screening \nstrategies for prostate cancer and the establishment of a public \ninformation and education program about the issues regarding prostate \ncancer. The CDC will also strengthen and improve surveillance on the \nincidence and prevalence of prostate cancer with a major focus on \nincreasing the understanding of the greater risk of this disease in \nAfrican-American men.\n  The bill also reauthorizes the authority of the CDC to conduct a \nprostate screening program upon consultation with the U.S. Preventive \nServices Task Force and professional organizations regarding the \nscientific issues regarding prostate cancer screening. The screening \nprogram, when implemented, will provide grants to States and local \nhealth departments to screen men for prostate cancer with priority \ngiven to low income men and African-American men. In addition the \nscreening program will provide referrals for medical treatment of those \nscreened and ensure appropriate follow up services including case \nmanagement.\n  Finally, to continue the investment in medical research, the bill \nextends the authority of the National Cancer Institute at the National \nInstitutes of Health to conduct and support research to expand the \nunderstanding of the cause of, and find a cure for, prostate cancer. \nActivities authorized include basic research concerning the etiology \nand causes of prostate cancer, and clinical research concerning the \ncauses, prevention, detection and treatment of prostate cancer.\n  Mr. President, as we celebrate Father's Day this weekend, I hope that \nwe\n\n[[Page S7268]]\n\ntake time to reflect on the serious health threat of prostate cancer. \nIt is my hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the \n``Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention Act,'' so that we can further \nunderstand the issues surrounding this disease and continue to move \nforward on developing effective treatment and finding a cure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      American Cancer Society,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: On behalf of the more than 2 million \n     volunteers of the American Cancer Society, I am writing to \n     offer our support for the Prostate Cancer Research and \n     Prevention Act. Thank you for introducing this important \n     legislation that reauthorizes important programs, with \n     respect to prostate cancer research and prevention activities \n     at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the Agency for \n     Health Care Policy (AHCPR), the Health Resources and Services \n     Administration (HRSA) and the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention (CDC).\n       Prostate cancer represents one of the most significant \n     medical and social challenges facing our country today. In \n     1999, approximately 179,300 new cases of prostate cancer will \n     be diagnosed in the United States and it is estimated that \n     this disease will cause more than 37,000 deaths this year. \n     While aggressive detection and treatment programs have begun \n     to show some promise of reducing the mortality rate for this \n     disease, we still have a long way to go.\n       The Society support the continuation of prostate cancer \n     research programs at the NIH, APCPR, HRSA and CDC. These \n     programs may yield better tests to detect prostate cancer at \n     an early stage, new treatments to cure prostate cancer, and \n     improved knowledge of the psychosocial and quality-of-life \n     impacts of men diagnosed with prostate cancer.\n       Your legislation also recognizes the need for more \n     information on how best to tackle the many challenges this \n     disease brings. Specifically, the bill addresses the need \n     for: additional research on the effectiveness of prostate \n     cancer screening strategies; more data on how best to improve \n     training, education, and skills of health practitioners with \n     regards to prostate cancer; and more information about how \n     men seek medical attention, make decisions about treatment, \n     and follow-up on treatment recommendations.\n       All of this information would support the development and \n     communication of messages by public and private health \n     professionals about prostate cancer early detection and \n     treatment for men and their families, as well as provide for \n     the establishment of a prostate cancer screening program. The \n     American Cancer Society believes that prostate cancer \n     education, awareness and screening programs should give \n     priority to those populations at high risk of developing this \n     disease--specifically, African American and older men.\n       Lastly, your legislation takes a crucial first step at \n     addressing several critical issues related to increasing \n     access to prostate cancer screening and appropriate follow-up \n     care. While the American Cancer Society recognizes that often \n     an incremental approach to complex health care issues is \n     preferable than attempting comprehensive reform or crafting \n     multifaceted policy solutions, the Society asks that you and \n     your colleagues take this opportunity to consider some of the \n     larger health care quality and access challenges to our \n     health care delivery system. We urge you to explore other \n     legislative provisions that would help to assure access to \n     quality care--for all patients--especially those \n     disproportionately affected by cancer.\n       Again, the American Cancer Society applauds your leadership \n     and support for the reauthorization of these valuable \n     programs. Thank you for your continued dedication to cancer \n     control and prevention.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Charles J. McDonald, MD,\n     President of the Board of Directors.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Urological\n\n\n                                            Association, Inc.,\n\n                                     Baltimore, MD, June 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     The U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: As President of the American Urological \n     Association (AUA), representing 9,200 urologists in this \n     country, I would like to thank you for introducing the \n     ``Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention Act.'' The AUA \n     supports this legislation, which recognizes that prostate \n     cancer early detection and education are vital tools in the \n     fight against prostate cancer. As you know, the American \n     Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that 179,300 new cases of \n     prostate cancer will be diagnosed in 1999, and that 37,000 \n     men will die from this disease this year.\n       In a recent paper by Roberts et al (Journal of Urology \n     161:529, 1999), U.S. prostate cancer deaths per 100,000 men \n     from the years 1989 to 1992 were compared to the years 1993 \n     to 1997. The authors found that prostate cancer deaths have \n     fallen significantly, and conclude that early detection may \n     have led to a decline in prostate cancer deaths.\n       We would only point out a concern we have about the bill's \n     reliance on the United States Preventive Services Task Force \n     (USPSTF), which currently does not recommend prostate cancer \n     early detection. This varies from the AUA and ACS policy \n     positions (see attachment), and we believe this could send a \n     confusing message to patients. Moreover, Congress enacted \n     prostate cancer early detection coverage for Medicare \n     beneficiaries aged 50 and older in 1997. We believe reliance \n     on USPSTF could engender confusion about the value of \n     prostate cancer early detection.\n       Again, thank you for introducing this important \n     legislation, and we look forward to working with you to \n     advance this effort. To coordinate any future efforts, please \n     contact Scott Reid, AUA Government Relations Manager.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Lloyd H. Harrison, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Men's Health Network,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 1999.\n     Hon. Bill Frist, M.D.,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Public Health, Senate Committee on \n         Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: I am writing on behalf of the Men's \n     Health Network (MHN) in support of legislation which will \n     revise and extend the prostate cancer prevention health \n     program at the Centers for Disease Control. We thank you for \n     proposing this important legislation. As you know, educating \n     the public as to the prevalence and risks of prostate cancer \n     is of great importance in fighting this deadly disease.\n       As the baby boom generation ages, the risk of prostate \n     cancer, if unchecked, will continue to increase. Prostate \n     cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in America, \n     affecting about 200,000 men in 1999. Nearly 40,000 men will \n     lose their lives to the disease this year. A man has a one in \n     six chance of getting prostate cancer in his lifetime. If he \n     has a close relative with prostate cancer, his risk doubles. \n     With two close relatives, his risk increases five-fold. With \n     three close relatives, his risk is nearly 97%. Today, \n     African-American men have the highest prostate cancer \n     incidence rate in the world. The African-American mortality \n     rate from the disease is more than twice that of the rate for \n     Caucasian Americans.\n       With the right investment in education and research, \n     prostate cancer is preventable, controllable and curable. \n     There is no better time than National Men's Health Week for \n     all of us to focus on prostate cancer and men's health. It is \n     vitally important to educate not only men but their families \n     as to the risk factors associated with this disease and the \n     need for annual screenings.\n       Thank you for addressing this critical public health issue. \n     If there is anything we can do in the future to assist in the \n     passage of your bill, please do not hesitate to let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Tracie Snitker,\n                                             Government Relations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n        Kerrey, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1244. A bill to establish a 3-year pilot project for the General \nAccounting Office to report to Congress on economically significant \nrules of Federal agencies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n                    truth in regulating act of 1999\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Truth in \nRegulating Act.'' This legislation would establish a 3-year pilot \nproject to support Congressional oversight to ensure that important \nregulatory decisions are efficient, effective, and fair.\n\n  The foundation of the ``Truth in Regulating Act'' is the right of \nCongress and the people we serve to know about important regulatory \ndecisions. Through the General Accounting Office, which serves as \nCongress' eyes and ears, this legislation will help us get access to \nthe important information that Federal agencies use to make regulatory \ndecisions before the horse gets out of the barn. So, in a real sense, \nthis legislation not only gives people the right to know; it gives them \nthe right to see--to see how the government works, or doesn't. And by \nproviding us with information that agencies use to make regulations, it \nwill enable Congress to ensure that agency regulations are consistent \nwith Congress' intent and the authority that Congress has delegated to \nthe agencies by statute. This will make the regulatory process more \ntransparent, more accountable, and more democratic. It will help \nimprove the quality and fairness of important regulations. This will \ncontribute to the success of programs the public values and improve \npublic confidence in the Federal Government, which is a real concern \ntoday.\n  Under the 3-year pilot project established by this legislation, a \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S7269]]\n\nof either House of Congress may request the Comptroller General to \nreview an economically significant rule as it is being developed. The \nComptroller General shall submit a report no later than 180 calendar \ndays after a committee request is received. This should allow Congress \nample time to decide whether it wants to disapprove the rule under the \nCongressional Review Act. The Comptroller General's independent \nanalysis of the rule shall include: an analysis of the potential \nbenefits of the rule, the potential costs of the rule, any alternative \napproaches that could achieve the goal in a more cost-effective manner \nor that could produce greater net benefits, the extent to which the \nrule would affect State or local governments, and a summary of how the \nresults of the analysis of the Comptroller General differ, if at all, \nfrom the results of agency analyses. The Comptroller General will have \nthe discretion to develop the procedures for determining the priority \nof requests.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the ``Truth in Regulating Act'' \nwill encourage Federal agencies to make better use of modern \ndecisionmaking tools, such as risk assessment and benefit-cost \nanalysis. Currently, these important tools often are viewed simply as \noptions--options that aren't used as much or as well as they should be. \nThe Governmental Affairs Committee has reviewed and developed a \nvoluminous record showing that our regulatory process is not working as \nwell as intended and is missing important opportunities to achieve \ngreater benefits at less cost. On April 22, I chaired a hearing in \nwhich we heard testimony on the need for this proposal. The General \nAccounting Office has done important studies for Governmental Affairs \nand other committees showing that agency practices--in cost-benefit \nanalysis, risk assessment, and in meeting transparency and disclosure \nrequirements of laws and executive orders--need significant \nimprovement. Many other authorities support these findings.\n  All of us benefit when government performs well and meets the needs \nof the people it serves. I want to thank Blanche Lincoln, George \nVoinovich, Bob Kerrey, and John Breaux for joining me as original \ncosponsors of this bill. All of us on both sides of the aisle should \npull together to improve the quality of our government. I urge by \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the ``Truth in Regulating Act'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1244\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ISLAMIC REPUBLIC \n    OF IRAN, AND PARTICULARLY THE RECENT ARRESTS OF MEMBERS OF THAT \n                       COUNTRY'S JEWISH COMMUNITY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 41\n\n       Whereas 10 percent of the citizens of the Islamic Republic \n     of Iran are members of religious minority groups;\n       Whereas, according to the State Department and \n     internationally recognized human rights organizations, such \n     as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, religious \n     minorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran--including Sunni \n     Muslims, Baha'is, Christians, and Jews--have been the victims \n     of human rights violations solely because of their status as \n     religious minorities;\n       Whereas the 55th session of the United Nations Commission \n     on Human Rights passed Resolution 1999/13, which expresses \n     the concern of the international community over ``continued \n     discrimination against religious minorities'' in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran, and calls on that country to moderate its \n     policy on religious minorities until they are ``completely \n     emancipated'';\n       Whereas more than half the Jews in Iran have been forced to \n     flee that country since the Islamic Revolution of 1979 \n     because of religious persecution, and many of them now reside \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas the Iranian Jewish community, with a 2,500-year \n     history and currently numbering some 30,000 people, is the \n     oldest Jewish community living in the Diaspora;\n       Whereas five Jews have been executed by the Iranian \n     government in the past five years without having been tried;\n       Whereas there has been a noticeable increase recently in \n     anti-Semitic propaganda in the government-controlled Iranian \n     press;\n       Whereas, on the eve of the Jewish holiday of Passover 1999, \n     thirteen or more Jews, including community and religious \n     leaders in the city of Shiraz, were arrested by the \n     authorities of the Islamic Republic of Iran; and\n       Whereas, in keeping with its dismal record on providing \n     accused prisoners with due process and fair treatment, the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran failed to charge the detained Jews \n     with any specific crime or allow visitation by relatives of \n     the detained for more than two months: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that the \n     Clinton administration should--\n       (1) be commended for supporting Resolution 1999/13, and \n     should continue to work through the United Nations to assure \n     that the Islamic Republic of Iran implements that \n     resolution's recommendations;\n       (2) condemn, in the strongest possible terms, the recent \n     arrest of members of Iran's Jewish minority and urge their \n     immediate release;\n       (3) urge all nations having relations with the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran to condemn the treatment of religious \n     minorities in Iran and call for the release of all prisoners \n     held on the basis of their religious beliefs; and\n       (4) maintain the current United States policy toward the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran unless and until that country \n     moderates its treatment of religious minorities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7270-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7270-S7271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 125--ENCOURAGING AND PROMOTING GREATER INVOLVEMENT OF \n  FATHERS IN THEIR CHILDREN'S LIVES AND DESIGNATING JUNE 20, 1999, AS \n                    ``NATIONAL FATHER'S RETURN DAY''\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nMack, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Allard, Mr. Cochran, \nMs. Landrieu, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Robb, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nAkaka, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nHutchinson, Mr. Sessions, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Thurmond) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 125\n\n       Whereas more than 1 out of every 3 children currently live \n     in a household where the child's father does not reside;\n       Whereas approximately half of all the children born in the \n     United States will spend at least half of their childhood in \n     a family without a father figure;\n       Whereas approximately 40 to 50 percent of all marriages are \n     predicted to end in divorce;\n       Whereas approximately 3 out of every 5 divorcing couples \n     have at least 1 child;\n       Whereas almost half of all children aged 11 through 16 that \n     live in mother-headed homes have not seen their father in the \n     last 12 months;\n       Whereas 79 percent of people in the United States believe \n     that the most significant family or social problem facing the \n     country is the physical absence of fathers from the home, \n     resulting in a lack of involvement of fathers in the rearing \n     and development of children;\n       Whereas the likelihood that a young male will engage in \n     criminal activity doubles if he is reared without a father \n     and triples if he lives in a neighborhood comprised largely \n     of single-parent families;\n       Whereas studies reveal that even in high-crime, inner city \n     neighborhoods, over 90 percent of children from safe, stable, \n     2-parent homes do not become delinquents;\n\n[[Page S7271]]\n\n       Whereas compared to children reared in 2-parent families, \n     children reared in single-parent families are less likely to \n     complete high school and thus, more likely as adults to \n     obtain low paying, unstable jobs;\n       Whereas researchers have linked the presence of fathers \n     with improved fetal and infant development, and father-child \n     interaction has been shown to promote a child's physical \n     well-being, perceptual abilities, and competency for \n     interpersonal relations;\n       Whereas researchers have also found that both boys and \n     girls demonstrate a greater ability to take initiative and \n     exercise self-control when they are reared by fathers who are \n     actively involved in their upbringing;\n       Whereas the general involvement of parents in the lives of \n     their children has decreased significantly over the last \n     generation;\n       Whereas a Gallup Poll indicated that over 50 percent of all \n     adults agree that fathers today spend less time with their \n     children than their fathers spent with them;\n       Whereas nearly 20 percent of children in grades 6 through \n     12 report that they have not had a meaningful conversation \n     with even 1 parent in over a month;\n       Whereas in a broad survey of 100,000 children in grades 6 \n     through 12, less than half of the children ``feel they have \n     family boundaries or high expectations from parents or \n     teachers'';\n       Whereas 3 out of 4 adolescents report that ``they do not \n     have adults in their lives that model positive behaviors'';\n       Whereas in a widely cited study of the health risks to the \n     young people in the United States, University of Minnesota \n     researchers found that ``independent of race, ethnicity, \n     family structure and poverty status, adolescents who are \n     connected to their parents, their schools, and to their \n     school community are healthier than those who are not'', and \n     that ``when teens feel connected to their families, and when \n     parents are involved in their children's lives, teens are \n     protected'';\n       Whereas millions of single mothers in the United States are \n     heroically struggling to raise their children in safe and \n     loving environments;\n       Whereas promoting responsible fatherhood is not meant to \n     diminish the parenting efforts of single mothers, but rather \n     to increase the chances that children will have 2 caring \n     parents to help them grow up healthy and secure;\n       Whereas many of this country's leading experts on family \n     and child development agree that it is in the best interest \n     of both children and the United States to encourage more 2-\n     parent, father-involved families to form and endure;\n       Whereas in 1994, the National Fatherhood Initiative was \n     formed to further the goal of raising societal awareness \n     about the ramifications of father absence and father \n     disengagement by mobilizing a national response to father \n     absence;\n       Whereas the Congressional Task Force on Fatherhood \n     Promotion and the Senate Task Force on Fatherhood Promotion \n     that were formed in 1997, the Governors' Task Force on \n     Fatherhood Promotion of 1998, and the Mayor's Task Force on \n     Fatherhood Promotion of 1999 were created to work in \n     partnership with the National Fatherhood Initiative;\n       Whereas on June 14, 1999, the National Fatherhood \n     Initiative is holding a national summit on supporting urban \n     fathers in Washington, D.C., to mobilize a response to father \n     absence by many powerful sectors of society, including public \n     policy, social services, educational, religious, \n     entertainment, media, and civic groups; and\n       Whereas those groups are working across party, ideological, \n     racial, and gender lines in order to reverse the trend of \n     father absence and disengagement by encouraging and \n     supporting responsible fatherhood and greater father \n     involvement in children's lives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that the creation of a better United States \n     requires the active involvement of fathers in the rearing and \n     development of their children;\n       (2) urges each father in the United States to accept his \n     full share of responsibility for the lives of his children, \n     to be actively involved in rearing his children, and to \n     encourage the emotional, academic, moral, and spiritual \n     development of his children;\n       (3) urges the States to hold fathers who ignore their legal \n     responsibilities accountable for their actions and to pursue \n     more aggressive enforcement of child support obligations;\n       (4) encourages each father to devote time, energy, and \n     resources to his children, recognizing that children need not \n     only material support, but also, more importantly, a secure, \n     affectionate, family environment;\n       (5) urges governments and institutions at every level to \n     remove barriers to father involvement and enact public \n     policies that encourage and support the efforts of fathers \n     who do want to become more engaged in the lives of their \n     children;\n       (6) to demonstrate the commitment of the Senate to those \n     critically important goals, designates June 20, 1999, as \n     ``National Father's Return Day'';\n       (7) calls on fathers around the country to use the day to \n     reconnect and rededicate themselves to their children's \n     lives, to spend National Father's Return Day with their \n     children, and to express their love and support for them; and\n       (8) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Father's Return Day'' with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n

The sheer \n     volume of available weaponry has been a major factor in the \n     devastation witnessed in recent conflicts in Angola, \n     Cambodia, Liberia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, \n     Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan, among others, and has contributed \n     to the violence endemic to narcotrafficking in Colombia and \n     Mexico.\n       (2) Increased access by terrorists, guerrilla groups, \n     criminals, and others to small arms and light weapons poses a \n     real threat to United States participants in peacekeeping \n     operations and United States forces based overseas, as well \n     as to United States citizens traveling overseas.\n       (3) In accordance with the reorganization of the Department \n     of State made by the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring \n     Act of 1998, effective March 28, 1999, all functions and \n     authorities of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency were \n     transferred to the Secretary of State. One of the stated \n     goals of that Act is to integrate the Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency into the Department of State ``to give new \n     emphasis to a broad range of efforts to curb proliferation of \n     dangerous weapons and delivery systems''.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     containing--\n       (1) an assessment of whether the export of small arms poses \n     any proliferation problems including--\n       (A) estimates of the numbers and sources of licit and \n     illicit small arms and light arms in circulation and their \n     origins;\n       (B) the challenges associated with monitoring small arms; \n     and\n       (C) the political, economic, and security dimensions of \n     this issue, and the threats posed, if any, by these weapons \n     to United States interests, including national security \n     interests;\n       (2) an assessment of whether the export of small arms of \n     the type sold commercially in the United States should be \n     considered a foreign policy or proliferation issue;\n       (3) a description of current Department of State activities \n     to monitor and, to the extent possible ensure adequate \n     control of, both the licit and illicit manufacture, transfer, \n     and proliferation of small arms and light weapons, including \n     efforts to survey and assess this matter with respect to \n     Africa and to survey and assess the scope and scale of the \n     issue, including stockpile security and destruction of excess \n     inventory, in NATO and Partnership for Peace countries;\n       (4) a description of the impact of the reorganization of \n     the Department of State made by the Foreign Affairs Reform \n     and Restructuring Act of 1998 on the transfer of functions \n     relating to monitoring, licensing, analysis, and policy on \n     small arms and light weapons, including--\n       (A) the integration of and the functions relating to small \n     arms and light weapons of the United States Arms Control and \n     Disarmament Agency with those of the Department of State;\n       (B) the functions of the Bureau of Arms Control, the Bureau \n     of Nonproliferation, the Bureau of Political-Military \n     Affairs, the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law \n     Enforcement, regional bureaus, and any other relevant bureau \n     or office of the Department of State, including the \n     allocation of personnel and funds, as they pertain to small \n     arms and light weapons;\n       (C) the functions of the regional bureaus of the Department \n     of State in providing information and policy coordination in \n     bilateral and multilateral settings on small arms and light \n     weapons;\n       (D) the functions of the Under Secretary of State for Arms \n     Control and International Security pertaining to small arms \n     and light weapons; and\n       (E) the functions of the scientific and policy advisory \n     board on arms control, nonproliferation, and disarmament \n     pertaining to small arms and light weapons; and\n       (5) an assessment of whether foreign governments are \n     enforcing their own laws concerning small arms and light \n     weapons import and sale, including commitments under the \n     Inter-American Convention Against the Illicit Manufacturing \n     of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives, and \n     Other Related Materials or other relevant international \n     agreements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  LEAHY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 694\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. Reed, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Wellstone) submitted an amendment intended \nto be proposed by them to the bill, S. 886, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bil, insert the following:\n\n\n                   self-determination for East Timor\n\n       Sec.   . (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) On May 5, 1999 the Governments of Indonesia and \n     Portugal signed an agreement that provides for an August 8, \n     1999 ballot organized by the United Nations on East Timor's \n     political status;\n       (2) On January 27, 1999, President Habibie expressed a \n     willingness to consider independence for East Timor if a \n     majority of the East Timorese reject autonomy in the August \n     8th ballot;\n\n[[Page S7273]]\n\n       (3) Under the May 5th agreement the Government of Indonesia \n     is responsible for ensuring that the August 8th ballot is \n     carried out in a fair and peaceful way in an atmosphere free \n     of intimidation, violence or interference;\n       (4) The inclusion of anti-independence militia members in \n     Indonesian forces responsible for establishing security in \n     East Timor violates the May 5th agreement which states that \n     the absolute neutrality of the military and police is \n     essential for holding a free and fair ballot;\n       (5) The arming of anti-independence militias by members of \n     the Indonesian military for the purpose of sabotaging the \n     August 8th ballot has resulted in hundreds of civilians \n     killed, injured or disappeared in separate attacks by these \n     militias who continue to act without restraint;\n       (6) The United Nations Secretary General has received \n     credible reports of political violence, including \n     intimidation and killings, by armed anti-independence \n     militias against unarmed pro-independence civilians;\n       (7) There have been killings of opponents of independence, \n     including civilians and militia members;\n       (8) The killings in East Timor hsould be fully investigated \n     and the individuals responsible brought to justice;\n       (9) Access to East Timor by international human rights \n     monitors and humanitarian organizations is limited, and \n     members of the press have been threatened;\n       (10) The presence of members of the United Nations \n     Assistance Mission in East Timor has already resulted in an \n     improved security environment in the East Timorese capital of \n     Dili;\n       (11) A robust international observer mission and police \n     force throughout East Timor is critical to creating a stable \n     and secure environment necessary for a free and fair ballot;\n       (12) The Administration should be commended for its support \n     for the United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor which \n     will provide monitoring and support for the ballot and \n     include international civilian police, military liaison \n     officers and election monitors;\n       (b) Policy.--The President, Secretary of State, Secretary \n     of Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury (acting through \n     the United States executive directors to internaional \n     financial institutions) should immediately intensify their \n     efforts to prevail upon the Indonesian Government and \n     military to--\n       (A) disarm and disband anti-independence militias;\n       (B) grant full access to East Timor by international human \n     rights monitors, humanitarian organizations, and the press;\n       (C) allow Timorese who have been living in exile to return \n     to East Timor to participate in the ballot; and\n       (2) the President should submit a report to the Congress, \n     not later than 21 days after passage of this Act, containing \n     a description of the Administration's efforts and his \n     assessment of steps taken by the Indonesian Government and \n     military to ensure a stable and secure environment in East \n     Timor, including those steps described in paragraph (1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       SARBANES AMENDMENT NO. 695\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SARBANES submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 886, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 116, strike ``$94,000,000 for the fiscal year 2000 \n     and $940,000,000'' and insert ``$963,308,000 for the fiscal \n     year 2000 and $963,308,000''.\n       On page 121, line 6, strike ``$215,000,000 for the fiscal \n     year 2000 and $215,000,000'' and insert ``$235,000,000 for \n     the fiscal year 2000 and $235,000,000''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                WELLSTONE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 696\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \nKennedy, and Mr. Torricelli) submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by them to the bill S. 886, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 115, after line 18, insert the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC. 730. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING CHILD LABOR.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The International Labor Organization (in this \n     resolution referred to as the ``ILO'') estimates that at \n     least 250,000,000 children under the age of 15 are working \n     around the world, many of them in dangerous jobs that prevent \n     them from pursuing an education and damage their physical and \n     moral well-being.\n       (2) Children are the most vulnerable element of society and \n     are often abused physically and mentally in the work place.\n       (3) Making children work endangers their education, health, \n     and normal development.\n       (4) UNICEF estimates that by the year 2000, over \n     1,000,000,000 adults will be unable to read or write on even \n     a basic level because they had to work as children and were \n     not educated.\n       (5) Nearly 41 percent of the children in Africa, 22 percent \n     in Asia, and 17 percent in Latin America go to work without \n     ever having seen the inside of a classroom.\n       (6) The President, in his State of the Union address, \n     called abusive child labor ``the most intolerable labor \n     practice of all,'' and called upon other countries to join in \n     the fight against abusive and exploitative child labor.\n       (7) The Department of Labor has conducted 5 detailed \n     studies that document the growing trend of child labor in the \n     global economy, including a study that shows children as \n     young as 4 are making assorted products that are traded in \n     the global marketplace.\n       (8) The prevalence of child labor in many developing \n     countries is rooted in widespread poverty that is \n     attributable to unemployment and underemployment among \n     adults, low living standards, and insufficient education and \n     training opportunities among adult workers and children.\n       (9) The ILO has unanimously reported a new Convention on \n     the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (10) The United States negotiators played a leading role in \n     the negotiations leading up to the successful conclusion of \n     the new ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor.\n       (11) On September 23, 1993, the United States Senate \n     unanimously adopted a resolution stating its opposition to \n     the importation of products made by abusive and exploitative \n     child labor and the exploitation of children for commercial \n     gain.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) abusive and exploitative child labor should not be \n     tolerated anywhere it occurs;\n       (2) ILO member States should be commended for their efforts \n     in negotiating this historic convention;\n       (3) the Senate should consider the new ILO Convention on \n     the Worst Forms of Child Labor as soon as practical after \n     submission by the President;\n       (4) it should be the policy of the United States to \n     continue to work with all foreign nations and international \n     organizations to promote an end to abusive and exploitative \n     child labor; and\n       (5) ILO member States should take necessary steps to meet \n     the standards and objectives of the new ILO Convention.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      WELLSTONE AMENDMENT NO. 697\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill, S. 886, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following--\n       Sec.  .\n       Expressing the sense of Senate that the global use of child \n     soldiers is unacceptable and that the International Community \n     must find remedies to end this practice:\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are at least 300,000 children below the age of 18 \n     who are involved in armed conflict in at least 25 countries \n     around the world. This is an escalating international \n     humanitarian crisis which must be addressed promptly;\n       (2) Children are uniquely vulnerable to military \n     recruitment because of their emotional and physical \n     immaturity, are easily manipulated and can be drawn into \n     violence that they are too young to resist or understand;\n       (3) Children are most likely to become child soldiers if \n     they are orphans, refugees, poor, separated from their \n     families, displaced from their homes, living in a combat \n     zone, or have limited access to education;\n       (4) Child soldiers, besides being exposed to the normal \n     hazards of combat, are also afflicted with other injuries due \n     to their lives in the military. Young children may have \n     sexually related illnesses, suffer from malnutrition, have \n     deformed backs and shoulders which are the result of carrying \n     loads too heavy for them, as well as respiratory and skin \n     infections;\n       (5) One of the most egregious examples of the use of child \n     soldiers in the abduction of thousands of children, some as \n     young as 8 years of age, by the Lord's Resistance Army (in \n     this resolution referred to as the ``LRA'') in northern \n     Uganda;\n       (6) The Department of State's Country Reports on Human \n     Rights Practice for 1999 reports that in Uganda the LRA \n     abducted children ``to be guerrillas and tortured them by \n     beating them, raping them, forcing them to march until \n     collapse, and denying them adequate food, water, or \n     shelter.'';\n       (7) Children who manage to escape from LRA captivity have \n     little access to trauma care and rehabilitation programs, and \n     many find their families displaced, missing, dead, or fearful \n     of having their children return home;\n       (8) A large number of children have participated and been \n     killed in the armed conflict in Sri Lanka and the use of \n     children as soldiers has led to a breakdown in law and order \n     in Sierra Leone;\n       (9) Graca Machel, the former United Nations expert on the \n     impact of armed conflict on children, identified the \n     immediate demobilization of all child soldiers as an urgent \n     priority, and recommended the establishment through an \n     optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the \n     Child of 18 as the minimum age for recruitment and \n     participation in armed conflict; and\n       (10) The international community is trying to reach a \n     consensus on how to most effectively deal with this grave \n     problem and\n\n[[Page S7274]]\n\n     among these options is the raising of the international legal \n     age of recruitment to 18 years old;\n       (11) The International Committee of the Red Cross, the \n     United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations \n     High Commission on Refugee, and the United Nations High \n     Commissioner on Human Rights also support the establishment \n     of 18 as the minimum age for military recruitment and \n     participation in armed conflict;\n       (12) The United Nations has decided to make 18 the minimum \n     age for its own peacekeeping forces;\n       (13) International organizations such as the European \n     Parliament and the 8th Assembly of the World Council of \n     Churches have condemned the use of child soldiers;\n       (14) Religious leaders such as Pope John Paul II and Nobel \n     Peace Prize winner Arch Bishop Desmond Tutu have urged that \n     children no longer be used as soldiers;\n       (15) US civic organizations drawn from the religious, peace \n     and justice and human rights communities such as the 36 \n     member organizations of the Washington Coalition on Child \n     Soldiers seek US support for alleviating this crisis;\n       (16) The United Nations created a Working Group to \n     negotiate language that would formulate an Optional Protocol \n     to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which would \n     raise the age of recruitment of children.\n       (17) For the past four years the international community \n     has been negotiating language for an Optional Protocol \n     without reaching a consensus agreement: Now, therefore, be it \n     Resolved, That the Senate hereby--\n       1) Joins the international community in condemning the use \n     of children as soldiers and combatants by governmental and \n     non-governmental armed forces;\n       2) Expresses the sense of Congress that US policy should be \n     one of permitting consensus on the language of an Optional \n     Protocol.\n       3) Directs the State Department to address positively and \n     expediently this issue in the next session of the Working \n     Group, before this process is abandoned, resulting therefore \n     in the protection of hundreds of thousands of children from \n     the life of a soldier and the horrors of war;\n       4) Directs the State Department to study the issue of the \n     rehabilitation of former child soldiers, the manner in which \n     their suffering can be alleviated and the positive role that \n     the US can play in such an effort, and to submit a report to \n     Congress on the issue of rehabilitation of child soldiers and \n     their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      WELLSTONE AMENDMENT NO. 698.\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill, S. 886, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 115, after line 18, add the following new subtitle:\n\n  Subtitle C--International Trafficking of Women and Children Victim \n                               Protection\n\n     SEC. ____01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``International \n     Trafficking of Women and Children Victim Protection Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The worldwide trafficking of persons has a \n     disproportionate impact on women and girls and has been and \n     continues to be condemned by the international community as a \n     violation of fundamental human rights.\n       (2) The fastest growing international trafficking business \n     is the trade in women, whereby women and girls seeking a \n     better life, a good marriage, or a lucrative job abroad, \n     unexpectedly find themselves in situations of forced \n     prostitution, sweatshop labor, exploitative domestic \n     servitude, or battering and extreme cruelty.\n       (3) Trafficked women and children, girls and boys, are \n     often subjected to rape and other forms of sexual abuse by \n     their traffickers and often held as virtual prisoners by \n     their exploiters, made to work in slavery-like conditions, in \n     debt bondage without pay and against their will.\n       (4) The President, the First Lady, the Secretary of State, \n     the President's Interagency Council on Women, and the Agency \n     for International Development have all identified trafficking \n     in women as a significant problem.\n       (5) The Fourth World Conference on Women (Beijing \n     Conference) called on all governments to take measures, \n     including legislative measures, to provide better protection \n     of the rights of women and girls in trafficking, to address \n     the root factors that put women and girls at risk to \n     traffickers, and to take measures to dismantle the national, \n     regional, and international networks on trafficking.\n       (6) The United Nations General Assembly, noting its concern \n     about the increasing number of women and girls who are being \n     victimized by traffickers, passed a resolution in 1998 \n     calling upon all governments to criminalize trafficking in \n     women and girls in all its forms and to penalize all those \n     offenders involved, while ensuring that the victims of these \n     practices are not penalized.\n       (7) Numerous treaties to which the United States is a party \n     address government obligations to combat trafficking, \n     including such treaties as the 1956 Supplementary Convention \n     on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions \n     and Practices Similar to Slavery, which calls for the \n     complete abolition of debt bondage and servile forms of \n     marriage, and the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labor Convention, \n     which undertakes to suppress and requires signatories not to \n     make use of any forced or compulsory labor.\n\n     SEC. ____03. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this subtitle are to condemn and combat the \n     international crime of trafficking in women and children and \n     to assist the victims of this crime by--\n       (1) setting a standard by which governments are evaluated \n     for their response to trafficking and their treatment of \n     victims;\n       (2) authorizing and funding an interagency task force to \n     carry out such evaluations and to issue an annual report of \n     its findings to include the identification of foreign \n     governments that tolerate or participate in trafficking and \n     fail to cooperate with international efforts to prosecute \n     perpetrators;\n       (3) assisting trafficking victims in the United States by \n     providing humanitarian assistance and by providing them \n     temporary nonimmigrant status in the United States;\n       (4) assisting trafficking victims abroad by providing \n     humanitarian assistance; and\n       (5) denying certain forms of United States foreign \n     assistance to those governments which tolerate or participate \n     in trafficking, abuse victims, and fail to cooperate with \n     international efforts to prosecute perpetrators.\n\n     SEC. ____04.

Mr. President, I bring to the Senate's attention \nan excellent article written by Alan Emory, the Senior Washington \nCorrespondent for the Watertown Daily Times, entitled ``WWII Seaplane \nCrew Still Battling With Navy Red Tape Over Medals.'' Mr. Emory tells \nthe incredible story of the rescue of a U.S. Airman by the crew of the \nPatrol Bomber Martin from the waters off Japan in World War II. \nRemarkably, the crew was denied the proper recognition for this act, \nand they have battled over the years to right that wrong.\n  At the time the rescue took place, the Navy, according to those \ninvolved, promised the pilot the Navy Cross and his crew the Silver \nStar. When the medals were actually awarded, however, all were awarded \nlesser medals. The disappointed crew accepted the medals without \ncomplaint. Years later when an appeal was filed, the Navy rejected the \nclaim on the grounds that the deadline for such appeals had passed. \nBut, a 1997 law waived the time limitation on appeals for such heroic \nacts.\n  The Navy has denied that any promise was made to the pilot or the \ncrew. However, a newly declassified document from six months after the \nrescue showed that in fact the Navy had promised the pilot, Robert H. \nMacgill, the Navy Cross. The crew had signed affidavits that they were \npromised the\n\n[[Page S7276]]\n\nSilver Star. Unfortunately no document has been found to back up their \nclaim, but this in no way decreases the gravity of this oversight.\n  To date, the Department of the Navy has refused to upgrade the medal \nstatus of those involved, though the case is still under review. I \nthank Mr. Emory for bringing this important act of bravery and \nincredible oversight to our attention.\n  I ask that the article be printed into the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Watertown Daily Times, Apr. 4, 1999]\n\n    WWII Seaplane Crew Still Battling With Navy Red Tape Over Medals\n\n                            (By Alan Emory)\n\n       Washington--One of the most daring exploits of World War II \n     took place in the water off Kobe, Japan, on July 24, 1945.\n       The war itself ended about a month later.\n       For the pilot, copilot and crew of the huge Patrol Bomber \n     Martin (PBM) seaplane that plucked a U.S. airman out of the \n     water as Japanese boats headed for him, however, a post-war \n     battle with Navy bureaucracy is still going on, nearly 54 \n     years later.\n       The men, now all in their 70s, were promised certain \n     medals--a Navy Cross for pilot Robert H. Macgill of Miami, \n     Fla., and Silver Stars for the others. All agree the pilot \n     regularly receives the highest honor because he makes the key \n     decisions.\n       When medals were awarded however, Mr. Macgill received a \n     Silver Star and the others Air Medals, which are given to any \n     service personnel performing five flights in a combat area.\n       Though disappointed, the fliers accepted their downgraded \n     decorations without complaint, but a Korean War fighter pilot \n     heard about the situation and launched an appeal to the Navy \n     Department with the help of the PBM copilot, David C. Quinn.\n       The Navy rejected the appeal, saying the deadline for such \n     awards had expired. Last year, however, the ``Mariner/Marlin \n     Association Newsletter'' reported that a 1997 law had waived \n     the time limitation, and many war heroes had medal \n     eligibility restored.\n       The Navy stood its ground, however, so Mr. Quinn, a North \n     Salem, N.Y., lawyer and husband of syndicated columnist Jane \n     Bryant Quinn, took his case to Rep. Sue W. Kelly, R-Katonah, \n     and Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan D-N.Y. The evidence was \n     reviewed, and they agreed the higher-level medals should be \n     awarded.\n       Their case took on added political clout when one of the \n     crewmen, Jerrold A. Watson, now a peach grower in Monetta, \n     S.C., turned out to be a constituent of both Chairman Floyd \n     Spence, R-S.C., of the House Armed Services Committee, and \n     Sen. J. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., former chairman of the Senate \n     Armed Services Committee.\n       Sen. Moynihan called the rescue of the downed Corsair \n     fighter pilot, Ensign Edwin A. Heck, 22, of Barrackville, \n     W.Va., ``an act of bravery deserving of high recognition.''\n       Rep. Kelly said the ``extraordinary rescue,'' in the water \n     off Japan's fourth largest city, merited ``something more \n     than an Air Medal.''\n       She rejected the finding by Karen S. Heath, principal \n     deputy to the Navy's chief of manpower and reserve affairs, \n     that the awards were appropriate, countering that they \n     resulted from ``errors in Navy records.''\n       Last September, then-Navy Secretary John H. Dalton told \n     Sen. Moynihan that upgrading the Quinn medal was ``not \n     warranted,'' and the Air Medal was ``appropriate and \n     consistent'' with those awarded at the time.\n       The Navy argued steadily that there was no documentary \n     proof that a Navy Cross for Mr. Macgill and Silver Stars for \n     his crew had actually been recommended, although all involved \n     signed affidavits that they had been promised those medals.\n       A declassified Navy memorandum six months after the rescue \n     shows that Mr. Macgill had been recommended for a Navy Cross, \n     though it does not affirm the oral recommendation for the \n     Silver Stars for Mr. Quinn and the others.\n       Mr. Quinn says that, instead of a trio of ``antique, \n     disjointed medal-beggars,'' they were bolstered by the \n     discovery that Mr. Macgill was alive in Miami.\n       His address was found by a computer search, with a phone \n     number that gave only a recorded response, but he received a \n     forwarded letter and, last Oct. 30, phoned Mr. Quinn and \n     confirmed the original medal recommendations.\n       The PBM seaplane, known in Navy slang as a Dumbo because of \n     its size, was part of a rescue squadron stationed at Okinawa \n     on the seaplane tender Pine Island. Their mission was to \n     rescue airmen shot down while raiding Japanese installations.\n       Their aircraft was enormous, with a wingspread equal to the \n     height of a 12-story building, and was very slow.\n       On July 24, 1945, Mr. Heck was shot down and floated in a \n     life jacket for about five hours in Kobe harbor. A radio call \n     asked, ``Is there a Dumbo in the area?'' and the Macgill \n     crew answered affirmatively. Sixteen Corsair fighters \n     formed an escort and strafed Japanese boats trying to \n     reach Mr. Heck.\n       The PBM flew over the docks of Kobe at an altitude of about \n     400 feet, with people standing there watching, according to \n     the Nov. 16, 1998, deposition of Mr. Macgill. The fighter \n     escort, getting low on fuel, had to leave.\n        A Japanese fighter made a run at the PMB, and shore \n     batteries opened antiaircraft fire, but, Mr. Macgill says, it \n     was ``amazing'' that they were not shot down. More than 14 \n     hours after they had left Okinawa, they returned, hugging the \n     Japanese coast, with the rescued fighter pilot.\n       The official Navy report said, ``The Dumbo, sweating out \n     the remaining fuel, returned to Okinawa at 300 feet altitude \n     and approximately 10 miles offshore.''\n       Mr. Macgill, quoting Navy officers there, said they \n     believed it was ``impossible'' to achieve an air-sea rescue \n     on Japan's mainland.\n       ``I distinctly recall,'' he said, that Squadron Commanding \n     Officer Lt. Cmdr. William Bonvillian and Capt. William L. \n     Erdmann, Greenburg, Ind., the officer in charge of rescue \n     missions, had both said they were urging the Navy Cross for \n     Mr. Macgill and Silver Stars for the others.\n       ``My original memory was correct,'' he said, and the \n     confusion over his own medal was never carried over to the \n     ``unquestioned recommendation'' that the others in the crew \n     receive Silver Stars.\n       Mr. Quinn maintains that an official Navy account, marked \n     ``Secret,'' disputes the finding that his rescue occurred \n     ``seven miles southwest of Kobe'' and therefore, should be \n     lumped in with other missions.\n       A Smithsonian Institution Press book about the exploits of \n     28 World War II combat pilots in their own words includes the \n     Quinn story because of the uniqueness of air-sea rescues and \n     the high-risk Kobe flight.\n       One war correspondent wrote that it was ``perhaps the most \n     daring and the most spectacular of all Pacific air-sea \n     rescues,'' the first into the Inland Sea, with the downed \n     pilot within the sight of people walking the streets of Kobe.\n       Judi Briner of St. Louis, daughter of PBM crewman Robert \n     Briner, who has terminal cancer, told Mr. Quinn she would \n     like to see Rep. Ike Shelton, D-Mo., an influential member \n     of the House Armed Services Committee, brought into the \n     case.\n       Ironically, Mr. Quinn found out that another St. Louis \n     resident, whose plea for a Bronze Star for his great-uncle \n     had been ignored for more than a year, received the medal two \n     weeks after Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo., got in touch with the \n     Army. It came along with a letter entitled, ``Expedite/\n     Congressional Interest.''\n       The Navy's Awards Branch has never challenged the \n     description of the PMB crew's combat bravery. Instead, Mr. \n     Quinn asserts, its accounts of the medal dispute are \n     ``diametrically opposed'' and, he feels, are ``tainted and \n     (should be) disallowed.''\n       A former assistant state attorney general, he says he flew \n     Navy planes for 26 years, four in World War II, and he holds \n     a Vietnam War Campaign Medal. He says, ``I do not easily \n     throw in towels.''\n       Richard Danzig, the new Navy secretary, who is scheduled to \n     address the National Press Club on Tuesday, told Sen. \n     Moynihan Jan. 28 that the Navy Awards Branch was reviewing \n     the documents.\n       At a March 11 Capitol Hill meeting with key lawmakers and \n     their aides, Ms. Heath said the Navy had, since the 50th \n     anniversary of World War II, been ``inundated with requests'' \n     for a new look at the war's awards, and Jeane Kirk, her aide, \n     insisted the Quinn situation was ``not all that unique.''\n       Congressional staffers raised the possibility of a \n     ``bureaucratic snafu'' leading to the medal downgrades. They \n     stressed that the PBM mission was ``different,'' but the Navy \n     could not explain why it had not been treated that way.\n       The congressional pressure, however, did have an impact.\n       The Navy officials promised to ``reboard,'' or review, the \n     case with a panel of four ``senior captains.''\n       Secretary Danzig had promised a ``careful study.''\n       Rep. John M. McHugh, R-Pierrepont Manor, the senior New \n     Yorker on the House Armed Services Committee, feels that if \n     the issue were brought before the full New York congressional \n     delegation and, possibly, the committee, it would receive a \n     sympathetic hearing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7276-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7276-S7277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GENERAL CHARLES C. KRULAK\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I'd like to pay a special tribute \ntoday to General Charles C. Krulak, the 31st Commandant of the Marine \nCorps, soon to relinquish command of our nation's Corps of Marines \nafter almost forty years in uniform. With receipt of his final orders, \ndirecting him to stand-down and retire from active duty, an \nevolutionary change will occur--marking the first time in 70 years that \na Krulak will be absent from the rolls of the United States Marine \nCorps. His father, Lieutenant General Brute Krulak, served as the \nCommanding General, Fleet Marine Forces Pacific.\n  From the blood stained rice fields of Vietnam, where General Krulak \ncommanded Marines during two tours of duty, to the wind swept sands of \nKuwait where General Krulak lead his men to victory, this Marine has \ndistinguished himself time and time again.\n\n[[Page S7277]]\n\n  For his devoted service to our country and for the brave Marines he \nled, General Krulak was awarded the Silver Star Medal; Bronze Star \nMedal with Combat ``V'' and two gold stars; Purple Heart with gold \nstar; Combat Action Ribbon; and the Republic of Vietnam Cross of \nGallantry.\n  While General Krulak's inspirational leadership has always \ncharacterized his military service, it is his tenure as the 31st \nCommandant of the Marine Corps that will resonate long and far into the \nnext millennium, ensuring the Marine Corps remains the world's premier \ncrisis response force--the Nation's 911 force. A professional force \nthat is committed, capable, and reliable to meet any challenge, under \nany circumstance, anytime and anyplace in the world.\n  General Krulak had the wisdom and foresight to field an agile and \nadaptable force--a Corps of Marines who could prevail against the \nmultifaceted threats which would challenge our Nation's security and \nits interests. General Krulak understood the importance of developing \nnew concepts and techniques that would ensure decisive victory in the \n``savage wars of peace.'' He forged his Corps of Marines through \nunrelenting sacrifice, initiative, and courage.\n  His many initiatives as Commandant include, the Marine Corps \nWarfighting Laboratory, the DoD lead in nonlethal weapons technology \nand the Chemical Biological Incident Response Force. He created and \nimplemented the ``Transformation Process'' of making Marines--a \nholistic approach to recruiting and developing young men and women to \nensure they have the skills and basic character needed to effectively \nmeet the asymmetric 21st century threat.\n  Today, the Corps is meeting its recruiting requirements, forty-eight \nmonths consecutively and achieved its retention goals --a testimony to \nthe wisdom and foresight of General Krulak.\n  A key contributor to the Marine Corps family and a person General \nKrulak owes much success to is his wife, Zandi Krulak. She gave dignity \nand grace to the maturation of the Marine Corps family.\n  In closing I want to recognize General Krulak for his uncompromising \nintegrity to always do the right thing, for the Nation and his beloved \nCorps. The Marine Corps is a better institution today then it was four \nyears ago, thanks to the sacrifice and devotion to duty by General \nKrulak. He has made a significant and lasting contribution to the Corps \nand to this Nation's security. Through his stewardship there is a \nrenewed sense of esprit de corps.\n  I call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to wish General \nKrulak, his wife Zandi and their two sons, David and Todd, fair winds \nand following seas as he steps down as the 31st Commandant of the \nMarine Corps. General Krulak's distinguished and faithful service to \nour country is greatly appreciated. He will be sorely missed, but \nsurely not forgotten. Once a Marine, Always a Marine. Semper \nFi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7277-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO EVE LUBALIN\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as you know, this will be my \nlast term in the Senate. My 17 years here have been exciting and \nchallenging. And I'd like to think my work here has made a real \ndifference in giving Americans a healthier, safer country.\n  But I have not done it alone. I had a lot of help from a very \ndedicated staff. And one staffer in particular deserves special \nrecognition for her outstanding leadership and her commitment to the \ncauses that have defined my career in the Senate.\n  That staffer is Eve Lubalin, my chief of staff, who recently \nannounced her retirement after 17 years with my office.\n  Eve joined my staff as legislative director in 1983, when I was just \ngetting to know my way around the Senate. From the start, she impressed \nme with her intelligence, her vision and her wit. She never lost sight \nof the goals that I set, and she never failed to deliver 100 percent of \nher talent and her energy to accomplish those goals.\n  In 1986, I promoted her to chief of staff. She has been our team \nleader ever since. And somehow, even with all the hours she has put in \non the job, and there were countless hours, she has managed to maintain \na full healthy relationship with her husband, Jim, and their daughter, \nKendra. And I know she looks forward to spending more time with them \nduring the years ahead.\n  Eve's high standards made her a star in the academic world even \nbefore she came to work for me. In 1966, she graduated summa cum laude \nfrom Syracuse University. From there, she went on to obtain a master's \ndegree from the University of Virginia and a Ph.D. in Political Science \nfrom Johns Hopkins. She later worked in several key staff positions for \nSenator Birch Bayh from Indiana. After her tenure in Senator Bayh's \noffice, she also worked as an advocate for the city of New York on \nlegislative issues.\n  When she arrived in my office, Eve made my priorities her priorities. \nAnd we scored some significant victories together. The laws I authored \nraising the national drinking age to 21, banning smoking on domestic \nairplane flights, cleaning up the environment--these were battles we \nfought together. I could not have asked for a more loyal comrade-in-\narms than Eve Lubalin.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing Eve the \nvery best as she moves on from the Senate. And I want Eve to always \nremember how much I and everyone connected with my office appreciates \nher contributions. She is a model public servant, a spectacular leader \nand person. I wish her a happy and rewarding retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7277-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7277-S7278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL MEN'S HEALTH WEEK\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, as we honor our fathers, \ngrandfathers and husbands this Fathers' Day, it is important to \nrecognize the crisis that is taking place with regard to men's health. \nAs highlighted by National Men's Health Week, which ends on Fathers' \nDay, this crisis in the health and well-being of American men is \nongoing, increasing, and predominantly silent.\n  National Men's Health Week, which was established in 1994 under the \nleadership of former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, has helped shed \nlight on some of the primary factors that have lead to this steady \ndeterioration: lack of awareness, inadequate health education, and \nculturally-induced behavior patterns at work and at home.\n  Many have rightly argued, that one main cause is the cultural message \nthat men should not react to pain. Men continue to fear the risk of \nappearing unmanly, or merely mortal, if they change their behavior or \ntheir environment. Unfortunately that includes visits to the doctor. On \naverage, women on average make 6.5 visits per year while men average \n4.9.\n  This lack of attention to health is perhaps best demonstrated by male \nmortality figures. In 1920, the life expectancy of men and women was \nroughly the same. Since that time, however, the life expectancy of men \nhas steadily dropped when compared to women. In 1990, life expectancy \nfor women was 78.8 years but only 71.8 years for men. Today, the life \nexpectancy of men is a full 10 percent below that of women.\n  Another indicator: men have a higher death rate for every one of the \ntop 10 leading causes of death. Men are twice as likely to die of heart \ndisease, the nation's leading killer. In fact, one in every five men \nwill suffer a heart attack before age 65.\n  Male specific cancers, testicular and prostate, and other non-gender \nspecific cancers have also reached epidemic proportions among men. One \nin six will develop prostate cancer at some point in his life, and \nAfrican-American men are especially at risk, with a death rate that is \ntwice the rate of white men.\n  Death by suicide and violence is another predominantly male \nphenomenon. Men are the victims of approximately three out of four \nhomicides, and account for approximately four out of every five deaths \nby suicide. Workplace accidents are also a major killer. Ninety-eight \npercent of all employees in the 10 most dangerous jobs are men, and 94 \npercent of all those who die in the workplace are men.\n  As demonstrated by the events this week on Capitol Hill--like the \nhealth screenings for prostate and colorectal cancer hosted by the \nMen's Health Network--National Men's Health Week has done much to end \nthe silence surrounding the real state of health of American men. But \nmuch more needs to be done. This Fathers' Day let us all do everything \nwe can to silence as well the cultural mind set that has claimed\n\n[[Page S7278]]\n\nthe lives of so many of our husbands, fathers, and brothers. Let's show \nthem how much we truly love them by making them aware of the very \nreal--and very preventable--dangers that await them if they fail to pay \nattention to their health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7278-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7278-S7279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GENERAL CHARLES C. KRULAK\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know a number of Senators are going to \nwant to join me in paying tribute to a great Marine, the Commandant, \nGeneral Krulak. I hope that others will come to the floor this \nafternoon, or on Monday, and join me in expressing our appreciation for \nthe work he has done.\n  Mr. President, Marines do it all--in the air, on the land, and on the \nsea. With a service like the Marine Corps, sometimes people come in and \nsay: Well, can't they go ahead and just be in charge of it all? I \ncertainly understand that when you get to know an outstanding man like \nGeneral Krulak. It is especially true when you consider that the \nNation's Marines have a tremendous record of pride and history and \ngoing out and doing the job when it is the toughest. Their attitude has \nbeen exemplified by this feisty, pull-no-punches Commandant. I have \nreally appreciated the fact that when I met with him privately and \nasked him direct questions, he gave me direct answers. I have \nappreciated the fact that when he has been before committees of \nCongress--particularly the Armed Services Committee--he responded in a \nway he thought was best for our country, as to what the marines really \nneeded, and not necessarily what he was expected to say or even told to \nsay. That is typical of the Marines and typical of this General and his \nfamily.\n  So I want to pay special tribute to General Charles C. Krulak, the \n31st Commandant of the Marine Corps, soon to relinquish command of our \nNation's Corps of Marines after almost 40 years in uniform. General \nKrulak's retirement will mark the first time in 70 years that a Krulak \nwill be absent from the rolls of the United States Marine Corps. His \nfather, Lieutenant General Brute Krulak, served as a Commanding \nGeneral, Fleet Marine Forces Pacific.\n  General Krulak's illustrious career is replete with achievements from \nthe blood-stained rice fields of Vietnam, where he commanded Marines \nduring two tours of duty, to the wind-swept sands of Kuwait, where he \ncommanded Marines during the Gulf War.\n  For his devoted service to our country and for the brave Marines he \nled, General Krulak was awarded the Silver Star Medal; Bronze Star \nMedal with Combat ``V'' and two gold stars; Purple Heart with gold \nstar; Combat Action Ribbon; and the Republic of Vietnam Cross of \nGallantry.\n  During his tenure as the 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps, the \nSenate has come to know of many of the virtues of this modern-day \nwarrior. His accomplishments will resonate long into the next \nmillennium, ensuring that the Marine Corps remains the world's premier \ncrisis response force.\n  I remember that during a 1996 Senate Armed Services Committee hearing \non the posture of our military, the service chiefs were asked what they \nneeded most. The other service chiefs rattled off some new weapons \nsystems. Not Chuck Krulak. The Senate always relied on his frank and \nhonest opinion, no matter the issue. He wanted Gore-Tex cold weather \ngear and boots for his troops. General Krulak has always placed his \nMarines first. That is why he is loved as Commandant. The people came \nfirst; the men and women of the Marine Corps came first.\n  General Krulak is a visionary, a person who clearly understands the \nsituation at hand. He understood the importance of developing new \nconcepts and techniques that would ensure decisive victory in the \n``savage wars of peace.'' He forged his Corps of Marines through \nunrelenting sacrifice, initiative, and courage.\n  His foresight resulted in the creation of the Marine Corps \nWarfighting Lab, taking the DOD lead in nonlethal weapons technology \nand the creation of the Chemical Biological Incident Response Force. He \ncreated and implemented the ``Transformation Process'' of making \nMarines--a holistic approach to recruiting and developing young men and \nwomen to ensure they have the skills and basic character needed to \neffectively meet the Asymmetric 21st century threat. He labored to \ninstitutionalize the Marine Corps core values of honor, courage and \ncommitment, while maintaining, and in many cases elevating, performance \nstandards in every aspect of the Marine Corps recruiting and \ndevelopment processes, be they mental, physical, or moral.\n\n  Today, the Corps has met its recruiting requirements forty-eight \nmonths consecutively and has achieved its retention goals--a testimony \nto the wisdom and foresight of General Krulak.\n  General Krulak not only pursued better Marines and asked for Marines \nto be capable of winning our Nation's future battles, but he also made \nbetter Americans. He promoted a focus on character development and high \nethical and moral standards. He stressed the core values of honor, \ncourage, and commitment, which exemplify the Corps. They are attributes \nthat will serve the Marines well long after they have hung up their \nuniforms. In a way, I don't think Marines ever hang up their uniforms; \nthey wear them the rest of their lives.\n  I remember, years ago, I had on my staff a man that worked on the \nMississippi Gulf Coast, Cecil Dubuisson, a Sergeant Major. A Sergeant \nMajor in the Marine Corps is really super-special. As we traveled \naround South Mississippi into Louisiana, I would run into people--young \nmen and older men--and they always recognized him as ``Sergeant \nMajor.'' There was a special bond between these men that the rest of us \ncould only hope to achieve.\n  In closing, I want to recognize General Krulak for his uncompromising \nintegrity to always do the right thing for the Nation and his beloved \nCorps, and for his unwavering conviction that exemplifies a way of \nlife, not just a motto. It speaks powerfully to the citizens he serves. \nIt has been my good fortune, and the Senate's good fortune, to witness \nthe resolve of a person who believes so strongly about the institution \nin which he serves. General Krulak, the Marine Corps is a better \ninstitution today than it was 4 years ago.\n  Your sacrifice and devotion to duty have made it so. You have \nprovided a significant and lasting contribution to your Corps and to \nthe Nation's security. Through your leadership, there is a renewed \nsense of esprit de corps. Those who follow your example will be a \ntestament to the legacy you leave behind.\n  I wish General Krulak, your wonderful wife Zandi, and your two sons, \nDavid and Todd, ``fair winds and following seas'' as you step down as \nthe 31st Commandant of the Marine Corps on June 30, 1999. Your \ndistinguished and faithful service to our country is greatly \nappreciated. You will be sorely missed but surely not forgotten.\n  Thank God for the Marines Corps, thank God for General Krulak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Acting in my capacity as an individual Senator \nfrom Kansas and a former marine, let me thank the majority leader and \nindicate what all marines would indicate were they present--``oo-yah.''\n  The distinguished Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased and honored to stand with \nSenator Lott today, our majority leader, in honor of the coming change \nof command of the U.S. Marine Corps and the Commandant and the \nretirement of Gen. Charles C. Krulak.\n  We all share one thing, and I think the leader missed one thing the \nGeneral stands for. It is written out there on the Iwo Jima Memorial. \nUncommon valor was a common virtue. Every marine carries that and \nsemper fi. As a former enlisted marine, there is no other comparable \nmilitary fraternity. In fact, I credit the Marines Corps for saving my \nlife. I remember as a young man I was sort of adrift. The Marine Corps \nhas the habit of setting a person straight.\n  I share the kindred spirit that is fundamentally the heart and the \nsoul of the Corps. It has been my pleasure to work with General Krulak \nin my duties as chairman of the Senate Military Construction \nAppropriations Committee since he assumed his duties as the 31st \nCommandant in 1995.\n  His military career extended back almost 40 years to his entry in the \nU.S. Naval Academy. He graduated in 1964 and went on to The Basic \nSchool in Quantico, VA. He continued to distinguish himself in command \npositions\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\ntoo numerous to count, including two tours in Vietnam. During the gulf \nwar, General Krulak commanded the 2nd Force Service Support Group for \nthe Atlantic Fleet Marine Forces. If you read through his commendation \nlist, it seems he earned almost every award and decoration possible, \nincluding the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, a Silver Star, \nBronze Star, two Gold Stars, and a Purple Heart, just to make a few.\n  I think it goes to show every American how appropriate it was for \nGeneral Krulak to be nominated for the Commandant's office. He told me \nthe other day that when he leaves the Marines Corps this will be the \nfirst time a Krulak has not been in a marine uniform for over 80 years. \nWhat a great tradition. He knows the marines. He was raised in the \nsociety. He stood up for them and their fundamental beliefs.\n  In his farewell to the Corps in the June edition of Leatherneck \nMagazine, General Krulak reminds us of two simple qualities that define \nall marines. First is the Touchstone of Valor. When marines are called \nto battle, they suit up and go, and they fight. Winning is mandatory; \nlosing is not an option. This has been true from the earliest days of \nthe Revolutionary War through modern-day battles. The battle list is \nlong and distinguished: Iwo Jima, Inchon, Danang, Kuwait, and now \nKosovo. The Commandant reminds us that ``the memory of the marines who \nfought in these battles lives in us and in the core values of our \nprecious Corps.''\n  The second quality is the Touchstone of Values. Marines have always \nheld themselves to the highest standards. Words like ``honor,'' \n``courage,'' and ``commitment'' are convictions that are embedded \nwithin the recruitment and training of all marines. Semper Fidelis is \nnot just a Marine Corps motto; it is a heartfelt passion.\n  When you hear General Krulak's statement, you understand why the name \nU.S. Marine brings confidence to America's allies and general respect \nfrom all of our potential enemies. He was a leader by example and he \nwill continue to be a leader by example. He stood as an anchor on the \nJoint Chiefs, paving the way for Congress to make some progress in \nmilitary readiness. He is widely known for his openness, his honesty, \nand his cruel truth.\n  The general has the toughness of the Corps, but he has a sensitive \nside also, which is the quality of a leader.\n  I have a shirttail cousin who served in the Marine Corps and was \nwounded in Vietnam. Last summer, Cpl. Dan Critten and his wife visited \nthis town and attended a dinner and we were honored to have General \nKrulak attend. Danny is confined to a wheelchair because of his injury \nsustained in Vietnam. He was at Danang. As it turned out, General \nKrulak was just a hill away that very day. Dan came home back to \nMissouri in a wheelchair, and he went right back to farming. He fixed \nup his tractor. He had all the hydraulic lifts and he could chase his \ncattle and do his farming. He never whimpered once. He, too earned the \nBronze Star and has lived a life that is truly the model of an American \nand a marine that we all know and notice.\n  I remember that meeting when we went to that dinner, when the general \nmet the corporal that evening. It was a special moment in the human \nexperience. There was no rank, just a special feeling of two warriors \nwho faced and survived the horrors of war. I will never forget that \nmoment. It reminded me why this Nation, this United States, will lead \nthe world and why the Corps is respected wherever it is assigned. It \nhas dedicated men and women who have a sense of duty, the willingness \nto win but also a quality of heart.\n  Every change of command brings happiness and sadness. There is \nsatisfaction and appreciation for a job well done, and there is \nmourning for departing the fellowship of the Corps. The good news is \nthere is no such thing as an ex-marine. I am convinced that General \nKrulak will be as effective in his future position as he was a marine.\n  On behalf of United States, I say thank you, General, for your \nincredible service and your dedication to your country. We owe you and \nall marines a debt that can never be repaid. You have lived honorably \nin extraordinary circumstances and have left the Corps stronger and \nmore capable in your wake. We say, Semper Fi.\n  Now we welcome a new Commandant, another marine who has stood the \ntest on the field of battle and among his peers. I have no doubt about \nthe future of this Nation's U.S. Marine Corps. The tradition continues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise \ntoday to commend the Senate for doing this, and to read from an \nexcellent memorandum underscoring the need for a quick resolution and \nfinal passage of a conference report.\n  A memorandum prepared by the Year 2000 Technical Information Focus \nGroup of the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the \n``I triple E,'' provides the best analyses and explanations I have seen \nof the complexity of Y2K litigation; of why the argument we heard \nduring floor debate that the bill is designed to protect ``bad actors'' \nand that it fails to provide sufficient incentives for remediation is \ngenerally hollow; and of why it is so important that we do what we can \nto minimize the economically paralyzing effects of a predictable and \nutterly overwhelming legal snarl.\n  The memorandum, sent to various members of Congress, is particularly \ncompelling because its authors do not represent businesses that may be \nsued, but are members of an international non-profit association of \nengineers and computer scientists.\n  The memorandum is so good that rather than simply have it printed in \nthe Record, I will read it:\n\n                                          TAB Year 2000 Technical,\n\n\n                                      Information Focus Group,\n\n                                     Piscataway, NJ, June 9, 1999.\n     To: Members, Senate Commerce, Science And Transportation \n       Committee; Members, Special Senate Committee On The Year \n       2000 Technology Problem; Members, House of Representatives \n       Committee on Science, Subcommittee on Technology; Members, \n       Committee on Government Reform, Subcommittee on Government \n       Management Information, and Technology; Sponsors, House \n       Bill ``Year 2000 Readiness and Responsibility Act of \n       1999,'' H.R. 775.\n\n     Re: Year 2000 Liability Legislation.\n     From: The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers \n       (IEEE), Technical Activities Board, Year 2000 Technical \n       Information Focus Group.\n       Dear Honorable Senators, Congressmen and Congresswomen: As \n     leaders of the Y2K effort of the Institute of Electrical and \n     Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the oldest and largest \n     international non-profit association of engineers and \n     computer scientists in the world, we would like to offer some \n     thoughts on the pending legislation involving Y2K liability \n     obtained from our years of work and collective wisdom spent \n     studying Y2K. The IEEE has drafted an Institute position on \n     Y2K Legal Liability regarding United States federal law, to \n     which our committee greatly contributed. We offer these \n     additional thoughts in hopes that they may further assist \n     your understanding as you attempt to reconcile two very valid \n     but conflicting underlying public policy goals in structuring \n     and passing the Year 2000 Liability Legislation currently \n     under consideration.\n       Minimize Damage to the Economy and Quality of Life: \n     minimize the overall damage to the nation's economy and \n     quality of life by reducing the need of organizations to \n     redirect their limited resources away from the task of \n     maintaining their operations in the face of Y2K in order to \n     defend themselves from lawsuits arising from alleged Y2K \n     failures.\n       Maximize Incentive for Y2K Failure Prevention: maximize the \n     incentive of every organization to prevent Y2K failures as \n     well as preserve the legal rights and remedies available for \n     those seeking legitimate redress for wrongs they may suffer \n     resulting from Y2K failures.\n       In addressing public policy issues we have no more \n     expertise than the literate public. However, we do possess \n     expertise in the technical issues underlying the situation \n     that should be considered as you weigh the conflicting public \n     policy goals in formulating appropriate Year 2000 Liability \n     Legislation. In particular, for your consideration we offer \n     the following points pertaining to the technical realities of \n     Y2K.\n       1. Prevention of all Y2K Failures Was Never Possible: For \n     many large and important organizations, technical prevention \n     of all Y2K failures has never been possible in any practical \n     way for these reasons:\n\n[[Page S7280]]\n\n       1.1  ``Y2K Compliant'' Does Not Equal ``No Y2K Failures.'' \n     If an organization makes all of its systems ``Y2K \n     compliant'', it does not mean that that same organization \n     will not experience Y2K failures causing harm to itself and \n     other organizations. In fact, efforts to become ``Y2K \n     compliant'' in one place could be the direct cause of such \n     failures in others. If interconnected systems are made \n     compliant in different ways, they will be incompatible \n     with each other. Many systems in government and industry \n     are mistakenly being treated as if they were independent \n     and fixed in the most expedient way for each of them. When \n     this ``Humpty Dumpty'' is put back together again, it will \n     not work as expected without complete testing, which is \n     unlikely (see Complexity Kills below).\n       1.2  All Problems Are Not Visible or Controllable. In the \n     best case organizations can only address those things they \n     can see and those things they have control over. Given this \n     reality, many Y2K failures are inevitable because some \n     technical problems will not be discernible prior to a \n     failure, and others, while discernible, may not be within an \n     organizations' jurisdictional control to correct. This is \n     especially true in large complex organizations with large \n     amounts of richly interconnected software involved in long \n     and complex information chains and in systems containing a \n     high degree of embedded devices or systems purchased in whole \n     from external parties. (The temporary lifting of certain \n     copyright and reverse engineering restrictions for specific \n     Y2K protection efforts should also be considered as long as \n     copyright holders are not unduly harmed.)\n       1.3  Incoming Data May Be Bad or Missing. To maintain their \n     operations many organizations require data imported from \n     other organizations over which they have no control. Such \n     data may have unknowingly been corrupted, made incompatible \n     by misguided compliance efforts or simply missing due to the \n     upstream organizations lawful business decisions.\n       1.4  Complexity Kills. The internal complexity of large \n     systems, the further complexity due to the rich \n     interconnections between systems, the diversity of the \n     technical environments in type and vintage of most large \n     organizations and the need to make even small changes in most \n     systems will overwhelm the testing infrastructure that was \n     never designed to test ``everything at once.'' Hence, much \n     software will have to be put back into use without complete \n     testing, a recipe, almost a commandment, for widespread \n     failures.\n       2.  Determining Legal Liability Will Be Very Difficult. \n     Traditionally the makers of products that underlie customer \n     operations are liable if those products are ``defective'' \n     enough to unreasonably interfere with those operations \n     resulting in damage. Y2K is different in that those customers \n     themselves are also at risk for legal action if they fail to \n     fulfill contractual obligations or fail to maintain their \n     stock values and their failure to ``fix'' their Y2K problems \n     can be shown as the cause. This customer base of technology \n     producers cannot be overlooked in this issue. As it \n     constitutes most of the organizations in the world, its needs \n     and the implications of legislative actions on it considered \n     now should not be overshadowed by undue focus on the much \n     smaller technology producer sector. Nonetheless, even there \n     liability is not as clear as tradition might indicate. \n     Several factors make liability determination difficult, \n     expensive, time consuming and not at all certain.\n       2.1  There Is a Shared Responsibility Between Buyers, \n     Sellers and Users of Technology. Computer products themselves \n     have only clocks that have dates in them. Application \n     software products usually offer optional ways of handling \n     dates. The customer/user organizations, especially larger, \n     older ones, have created much of their application software \n     in-house. When new products are introduced into the buying \n     organization, the customer/user usually has vast amounts of \n     data already in place that have date formats and meaning \n     already established. These formats and meanings cannot be \n     changed as a practical matter. The majority of, and the \n     longest-lasting, potential system problems lay in application \n     software and the data they process, not in clock functions. \n     (Clock-based failures, those likely to happen early in \n     January 2000, while potentially troublesome, will be for the \n     most part localized and of short duration.) Various service \n     providers can be optionally called in to help plan and apply \n     technology for business purposes. But it is only when these \n     are all merged together and put to actual use that failures \n     can emerge. It is very rare that one of them alone can cause \n     a failure that carries legal consequences.\n       2.2  Many Things Are Outside the Control of Any Defendant. \n     Incoming data from external sources outside its control may \n     be corrupted, incompatible or missing. Devices and systems \n     embedded in critical purchased equipment may be beyond the \n     defendant's knowledge or legal access. Non-technical goods \n     and services the defendant depends upon may not be available \n     due to Y2K problems within their source organizations or \n     distribution channel.\n       2.3  There Will Be a Strong Defense of Impracticability. \n     Existing large-scale systems were not made safe from Y2K long \n     ago for good reasons. Many systems resist large-scale \n     modernization (e.g., IRS, FAA Air Traffic Control, Medicare) \n     for the same reasons. Wide-spread, coordinated modifications \n     across entrenched, diverse, interconnected systems is \n     technically difficult if not impossible at the current level \n     of transformational technology. New products must be made to \n     operate within the established environment, especially date \n     data formats. Technology producers will claim, with reason, \n     that the determining factor in any Y2K failures lay in the \n     way the customer chose to integrate their products into its \n     environment. It will be asserted, perhaps successfully, by \n     user organizations that economic impracticability prevented \n     the prevention of Y2K failures. Regardless of the judicial \n     outcome, it will take a long time and many resources to \n     finally resolve. And that resolution may have to come in \n     thousands of separate cases.\n       3. Complexity and Time Negates Any Legal Liability \n     Incentive. Even if making all of an organization's systems \n     ``Y2K compliant'' would render an organization immune from \n     Y2K failures (it will not), the size and complexity of the \n     undertaking is such that if any but the smallest organization \n     is not already well into the work, there is not enough time \n     for the incentive of legal liability to have any discernible \n     positive effect on the outcome. As an analogy, providing any \n     kind of incentive to land a man on Mars within one year would \n     have no effect on anyone's efforts to achieve that unless \n     they had been already working to that end for many years. A \n     negative effect will result from management diverting \n     resources from prevention into legal protection.\n       4. The Threat of Legal Action Is a Dangerous Distraction at \n     a Critical Time. There will be system failures, especially in \n     large, old, richly interconnected ``systems of systems'' as \n     exist in the financial services and government sector. The \n     question is how to keep such technical failures from becoming \n     business or organization failures. We should be asking \n     ourselves how we as a society can best keep the flow of goods \n     and services going until the technical problems and failures \n     can be overcome. The following points bear on these \n     questions.\n       4.1  Y2K Is a Long Term, Not Short Term, Problem. \n     Irrespective of the notion of Y2K being about time, a point \n     in time, or the fixation on the rollover event at midnight \n     December 31, 1999, or even the name `Year 2000' itself, Y2K \n     computer problems will be causing computer system \n     malfunctions and failures for years into the next decade. Y2K \n     is much more about the dates that can span the century \n     boundary represented in data that must be processed by \n     software than it is about any calendar time or clock issues. \n     Because of the vast amounts of these, the complex \n     intertwining among them and our less than complete \n     understanding of the whole, it will take years for the \n     infrastructure to ``calm down'' after Y2K impacts themselves \n     AND the impacts of the sometimes frantic and misguided \n     changes we have made to it. The current prevention phase is \n     only the beginning.\n       4.2  Rapid and Effective Organizational Adaptability Will \n     Be a Prime Necessity. They key to an organization's ability \n     to continue to provide the goods and services other \n     organizations and individuals need to continue their \n     operations will be determined by an organization's ability to \n     adapt its practices and policies quickly and effectively in \n     the face of potentially numerous, rapid and unexpected \n     events.\n       4.3  Lawsuits, Actual or Threatened, Will Divert Requisite \n     Resources. Preventing and minimizing harm to society from Y2K \n     disruption is different than, and at times opposed to, \n     protecting one's organization from legal liability. \n     Addressing lawsuits, and even the threat of a lawsuit, will \n     divert requisite resources, particularly management \n     attention, from an organization's rapid and effective \n     adaptation. This is already happening regarding technical \n     prevention and will get worse the longer such legal \n     threats remain. Organizational management has much more \n     experience dealing with legal threats than they do \n     addressing something as unique and unprecedented as Y2K. \n     Their tendency is to address the familiar at the expense \n     of the novel. They must be allowed to focus on the greater \n     good.\n       4.4  Judicial System Overload Is Another Danger. Given the \n     great interactive and interdependent complexity of Y2K's \n     impact on the operations of our institutions on a national \n     and global scale, the effort to determine exactly what \n     happened, why it happened and who is legally responsible for \n     each micro-event is itself a huge undertaking requiring the \n     resolution of many questions. For the legal and judicial \n     system to attempt to resolve the legal rights and remedies of \n     affected parties while Y2K impacts are still unfolding will, \n     in any case, threaten to overwhelm the legal and judicial \n     system's capacity to assure justice in the matter, let alone \n     its ability to continue to do its other necessary work.\n       For all of the reasons discussed above, we support \n     limitations on Y2K-related legal liability. Minimizing harm \n     and assessing blame are each formidable and important tasks, \n     but they cannot be done simultaneously without sacrificing \n     one for the other. Minimizing harm is more important and \n     there is an increased threat to our welfare if assessing \n     blame adversely interferes with our ability to minimize harm. \n     The value of incentives at this late date is very small. We \n     trust that the collective wisdom of Congress will find ways \n     to reduce these threats. We have additional background \n     material available. Please contact IEEE staff contact Paula \n     Dunne if you are interested in this material. We have other \n     ideas beyond the scope of this legislation of what the U.S. \n     federal government can do to help minimize\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\n     harm throughout this crisis. We are ready to help in any way \n     you may deem appropriate.\n           Respectfully,\n     The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), \n      Technical Activities Board, Year 2000 Technical Information \n                                                      Focus Group.\n\n  Mr. President, the bill we passed earlier this week is modest. It may \nvery well not meet all the concerns expressed by the IEEE. The \nlegislation may, however, at least reduce these threats. As a \nconsequence, we must enact meaningful legislation and we must enact it \nquickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7281-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         USE OF CAPITOL GROUNDS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Res. 125\n\n       Whereas more than 1 out of every 3 children currently live \n     in a household where the child's father does not reside;\n       Whereas approximately half of all the children born in the \n     United States will spend at least half of their childhood in \n     a family without a father figure;\n       Whereas approximately 40 to 50 percent of all marriages are \n     predicted to end in divorce;\n       Whereas approximately 3 out of every 5 divorcing couples \n     have at least 1 child;\n       Whereas almost half of all children aged 11 through 16 that \n     live in mother-headed homes have not seen their father in the \n     last 12 months;\n       Whereas 79 percent of people in the United States believe \n     that the most significant family or social problem facing the \n     country is the physical absence of fathers from the home, \n     resulting in a lack of involvement of fathers in the rearing \n     and development of children;\n       Whereas the likelihood that a young male will engage in \n     criminal activity doubles if he is reared without a father \n     and triples if he lives in a neighborhood comprised largely \n     of single-parent families;\n       Whereas studies reveal that even in high-crime, inner city \n     neighborhoods, over 90 percent of children from safe, stable, \n     2-parent homes do not become delinquents;\n       Whereas compared to children reared in 2-parent families, \n     children reared in single-parent families are less likely to \n     complete high school and thus, more likely as adults to \n     obtain low paying, unstable jobs;\n       Whereas researchers have linked the presence of fathers \n     with improved fetal and infant development, and father-child \n     interaction has been shown to promote a child's physical \n     well-being, perceptual abilities, and competency for \n     interpersonal relations;\n       Whereas researchers have also found that both boys and \n     girls demonstrate a greater ability to take initiative and \n     exercise self-control when they are reared by fathers who are \n     actively involved in their upbringing;\n       Whereas the general involvement of parents in the lives of \n     their children has decreased significantly over the last \n     generation;\n       Whereas a Gallup Poll indicated that over 50 percent of all \n     adults agree that fathers today spend less time with their \n     children than their fathers spent with them;\n       Whereas nearly 20 percent of children in grades 6 through \n     12 report that they have not had a meaningful conversation \n     with even 1 parent in over a month;\n       Whereas in a broad survey of 100,000 children in grades 6 \n     through 12, less than half of the children ``feel they have \n     family boundaries or high expectations from parents or \n     teachers'';\n       Whereas 3 out of 4 adolescents report that ``they do not \n     have adults in their lives that model positive behaviors'';\n       Whereas in a widely cited study of the health risks to the \n     young people in the United States, University of Minnesota \n     researchers found that ``independent of race, ethnicity, \n     family structure and poverty status, adolescents who are \n     connected to their parents, their schools, and to their \n     school community are healthier than those who are not'', and \n     that ``when teens feel connected to their families, and when \n     parents are involved in their children's lives, teens are \n     protected'';\n       Whereas millions of single mothers in the United States are \n     heroically struggling to raise their children in safe and \n     loving environments;\n       Whereas promoting responsible fatherhood is not meant to \n     diminish the parenting efforts of single mothers, but rather \n     to increase the chances that children will have 2 caring \n     parents to help them grow up healthy and secure;\n       Whereas many of this country's leading experts on family \n     and child development agree that it is in the best interest \n     of both children and the United States to encourage more 2-\n     parent, father-involved families to form and endure;\n       Whereas in 1994, the National Fatherhood Initiative was \n     formed to further the goal of raising societal awareness \n     about the ramifications of father absence and father \n     disengagement by mobilizing a national response to father \n     absence;\n       Whereas the Congressional Task Force on Fatherhood \n     Promotion and the Senate Task Force on Fatherhood Promotion \n     that were formed in 1997, the Governors' Task Force on \n     Fatherhood Promotion of 1998, and the Mayor's Task Force on \n     Fatherhood Promotion of 1999 were created to work in \n     partnership with the National Fatherhood Initiative;\n       Whereas on June 14, 1999, the National Fatherhood \n     Initiative is holding a national summit on supporting urban \n     fathers in Washington, D.C., to mobilize a response to father \n     absence by many powerful sectors of society, including public \n     policy, social services, educational, religious, \n     entertainment, media, and civic groups; and\n       Whereas those groups are working across party, ideological, \n     racial, and gender lines in order to reverse the trend of \n     father absence and disengagement by encouraging and \n     supporting responsible fatherhood and greater father \n     involvement in children's lives: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that the creation of a better United States \n     requires the active involvement of fathers in the rearing and \n     development of their children;\n       (2) urges each father in the United States to accept his \n     full share of responsibility for the lives of his children, \n     to be actively involved in rearing his children, and to \n     encourage the emotional, academic, moral, and spiritual \n     development of his children;\n       (3) urges the States to hold fathers who ignore their legal \n     responsibilities accountable for their actions and to pursue \n     more aggressive enforcement of child support obligations;\n       (4) encourages each father to devote time, energy, and \n     resources to his children, recognizing that children need not \n     only material support, but also, more importantly, a secure, \n     affectionate, family environment;\n       (5) urges governments and institutions at every level to \n     remove barriers to father involvement and enact public \n     policies that encourage and support the efforts of fathers \n     who do want to

Mr. President, during the course of this week we have \ncome to the Senate floor many times to discuss pending legislation of \ngreat importance to families across America.\n  Last night--I guess this morning, in the early morning hours--the \nHouse of Representatives failed to pass the gun control legislation \nwhich the Senate enacted 3 weeks ago.\n  You may remember that Vice President Gore came to the floor, cast the \ndeciding vote, broke the tie, and we passed a bill which would try to \nclose the loopholes for the sales of firearms at so-called gun shows, \ntrying to find a way--any way we can--to reduce the likelihood that \nguns will get into the hands of children and criminals.\n  America's heart was broken by Littleton, CO. Families across America, \nwho may have heard these numbing statistics about 13 children a day \ndying, finally realized it could happen there--it could happen in \nLittleton, CO, in Conyers, GA, in Jonesboro, AR, in Pearl, MS, West \nPaducah, KY, Springfield, OR, or in Springfield, IL, my hometown. It \ncould happen anywhere.\n  Guns are just too easy to come by in America. Troubled kids, who are \nalways a problem, become tragedies when they take these guns into the \nclassrooms, killing their classmates and teachers.\n  So we passed legislation, good legislation, bipartisan legislation, \nand sent it to the House of Representatives. Frankly, they decided, \nbecause of the political heat that might be generated, to call for a \nvote in the middle of the night, at 1:15 in the morning, to ask the \nHouse of Representatives to go on the Record, because the leadership in \nthe House thought Americans would not notice it if it happened in the \nmiddle of the night. The National Rifle Association did not think \nAmericans would care. They are both wrong.\n  America understands what happened in the dark of night. There was a \nshot in the dark, and it hit American families right where they live--\nfamilies who worry about whether sending their kids to school anymore \nis a safe thing to do, families who wonder, when they say good-bye to \ntheir child in the morning, if those are the last words they will ever \nshare with their child.\n  That is where we are in America. That is where gun violence has \nbrought us. But this is not a fatal shot on the American families. They \nhave, I guess, the hope and the confidence that this Congress will come \nto its senses and once and for all say no to these gun lobbies and yes \nto safety in our schools.\n  The big debate in the House was whether or not we ought to post the \nTen Commandments in schools. Let me go on the Record and say I support \nvalues for families. I support strengthening families. I believe that \nthose families who believe, as my family did, that the practice of \nreligion is an important part of values, those families should be \nencouraged in every way whatsoever. We should make sure our kids grow \nup with values. But it is so naive to believe that simply posting the \nTen Commandments in schools is going to change the climate in America.\n\n  Perhaps, though, we could post the Ten Commandments at the gun shows \nand underline the Commandment that says: Thou shalt not kill, saying to \npeople who want to buy and sell these guns without any background \nchecks, accept your moral responsibility for what is about to occur.\n  The Illinois State Police did a survey of the crime guns they had \nconfiscated recently and found over 25 percent of them came out of \nthese gun shows, sold to people who, frankly, face no background check \nwhatsoever.\n  We tried to close that loophole in the Senate; the House has failed. \nWe cannot leave this issue alone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7282-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7282-S7284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. But there is another issue that haunts American families \nbeyond the violence in our schools and beyond the question of gun \nsafety. It is the issue of health insurance.\n  Mr. President, 115 million Americans, when asked, said that either \nthey personally or a member of their family had run into serious \nproblems when it came to health insurance and health insurance \ncompanies.\n  I started speaking on the floor about this issue just this week, and \nI have started getting letters from my State of Illinois and across the \ncountry. People said: Yes, you are right. Let me read you two of these \nletters to give you an idea.\n  Here is one that comes from Raymond and Marianne Eberhardt. These are \nfolks who, frankly, could be any of us. They write:\n\n       Enclosed is a picture of Theresa, needless to say she is a \n     very beautiful child. She was hospitalized from September 2, \n     1998 to February 15, 1999 due to fighting the insurance \n     company for certain provisions we could not do without in our \n     home. Her daddy is a police officer and [her] mommy stays at \n     home.\n       She most likely would not have had to be vented--\n\n  She is on a ventilator.\n\n     if she were able to leave when the doctors had said she could \n     go. However, we had to fight and fight with the insurance \n     company for things that the doctors had said were needed. So \n     we fought for 2\\1/2\\ months.\n\n  Can you imagine, as parents, fighting to keep this lovely little girl \nalive, getting up every morning and saying a prayer that she will \nsurvive, and then getting on the telephone to fight with the insurance \ncompany for the basics that the doctors say she needs to continue \nliving? Their battle went on for 2\\1/2\\ months. She writes:\n\n       We eventually did get everything that we needed, except it \n     was a very long battle. Can you imagine having your family \n     separated that long because the insurance company did not \n     want to help? Seven months is a long time for a family to \n     have to go through something like this. Theresa caught RSV in \n     the hospital--\n\n  This is a malady which clearly is very serious.\n\n     while we were waiting for the appeals to go through.\n\n  That is, with the insurance company.\n\n       That is why she is now vented and has a trach. Theresa \n     copes extremely well with what all has been done to her. It \n     does not\n\n[[Page S7283]]\n\n     fade her in the least. She has Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type \n     1. She is very strong willed and is a joy to be around. I \n     hope something can be done in regards to insurance companies \n     helping families more and be a little more compassionate. I \n     know in my heart we would have lost her if we did not get the \n     proper equipment. I am thankful to them that they eventually \n     changed their minds. I just wish it did not have to take so \n     long.\n\n  As a parent, I have sat in a waiting room at the hospital with my \ndaughter in surgery. My wife and I have been through that several \ntimes. You will never in your life feel as helpless as that moment. You \nwill never feel as vulnerable. You pray to God that everything turns \nout right. You hope those doctors and nurses and technicians who are in \nthat operating room are the best and the brightest that could possibly \nbe there. But you don't want to sit there and have to worry about \nwhether you are going to have to fight with an insurance company over \nwhether or not that surgery will go forward or whether, when that \nsurgery is finished, your child receives the kind of treatment that is \nessential.\n  Here is another letter we received:\n\n       This letter is to introduce you to our precious angel child \n     Roberto Antonio Cortes. He is 11 months old now and is so \n     special to us. He was diagnosed with Spinal Muscular Atrophy \n     Type I, the Werdnig Hoffman disease. He is currently on a \n     home ventilator.\n       My husband, Rigo, is self-employed at this time and doing \n     contract work out of our house.\n\n  They indicated they would be more than happy to talk to our office \nabout the battles they have faced with insurance companies.\n  Here is another letter from Addison, IL, Dolores Pavletich:\n\n       Dear Senator Durbin,\n       Just a note to thank you for taking a stand on Health Care \n     Issues.\n       Last night when I returned home from work and turned on TV, \n     I caught part of C-Span where you, Senator Kennedy, \n     Senator Schumer, Senator Daschle [and Senator Boxer] were \n     asking to negotiate the Health Care Issues. When you \n     spoke, you addressed all the issues so many of us are \n     concerned with. I have recently had such bad experiences \n     with Insurance Companies. I started by choosing a doctor \n     from a book, being treated by him, and half way through \n     treatment was told the doctor was dropped [by the \n     insurance company] and I would have to change doctors or \n     they would not pay [for it.] I did not think it was fair \n     to stop treatment and start over with another doctor. I \n     then chose a doctor only to find out that the hospital he \n     was on staff was not [covered by my insurance company] \n     therefore, any tests or blood workup could not be done at \n     his hospital. Blood tests would have to be sent to a lab, \n     and if I had to be admitted to a hospital, I would have to \n     choose yet another doctor.\n       I am a 57 year old woman, on my own, and now find that the \n     company I work for is down sizing and my job may be \n     eliminated soon. I cannot retire yet, am not eligible for \n     medicare and with only unemployment cannot afford Cobra \n     [Insurance] because of it being so expensive [and I do not \n     know if I can afford it.]\n       I am so interested in the Health Care Issue I would do \n     anything to help make life easier for so many people. If \n     there is anything I can contribute towards this issue I would \n     gladly devote as much time as possible to assure everyone the \n     right to choose [their doctor, their insurance company.] I \n     wish I could speak to you in person to tell you what people \n     are being faced with today.\n       Please continue to speak for the majority of people in this \n     country. We've chosen you to do what you do best and we look \n     forward to you to speak for us.\n\n  That is why I am here on this floor. We have a choice. We have a \nthing that we can do that can make a difference. There is a Patients' \nBill of Rights the Democrats have introduced, which has been endorsed \nby over 200 major health organizations, which will finally step forward \nand stand up for consumers and stand up for families and say we are \ngoing to address the basics. We are going to make sure you can choose \nthe specialist you need. We are going to make sure when you sit down in \nthe office with the doctor that you get straight talk and honest \nanswers. You aren't going to hear a doctor parrot some insurance \ncompany line instead of telling you the truth about your medical care \nand what you need.\n  We want to make certain that when you go to an emergency room, you go \nto the one you need for your family because of medical necessity. You \ndon't fumble through the dashboard looking for the health insurance \npolicy to figure out which hospital you can go to without paying for it \nout of your pocket.\n  These are the basics, to make sure that the women across America who \ntrust their medical care to an OB/GYN can continue to pick that doctor \nthey trust, the doctor they have confidence in, and not be told by the \ninsurance company to pick up and move; to make certain that doctors, \nwhen they say surgery is necessary, won't be overruled by some clerk \nsitting in an insurance company office in Omaha, NE. The decision \nshould be made by our doctors, not by insurance company clerks.\n  This debate is central to really giving peace of mind to families \nacross America. Why haven't we debated it for over 2 years? Because the \ninsurance companies do not want this issue to come to the floor of the \nSenate. They do not want to face the votes which we would call for on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights that the Democrats support is a bill \nwhich gives to those who are providing health care fair treatment. \nRight now if something happens that is wrong in medical treatment, who \ngets sued? The doctors and the hospitals. But what if the insurance \ncompany made the wrong decision? Under the law, they are protected. The \ncurrent law protects them. They can't be held accountable. Is that \nfair? Is that American? I don't believe it is. We are each held \naccountable for our actions, as every business is held accountable. \nThere is no reason why health insurance companies should be exempt from \nthat responsibility.\n  Here is what faces us: Will we, in the closing weeks before we break \nfor the Fourth of July or our August recess, have the political courage \nto bring this issue to the floor? We spent 5 days debating giving \nprotection to computer companies against being sued for Y2K problems, 5 \ndays. We were worried about computer companies. Well, maybe we should \nbe. But can't we spend 5 hours on this debate to stand up for families \nacross America who want protection when it comes to the health care \nthat means so much?\n  Look at these photographs. Imagine what life is like battling every \nsingle day with the insurance company and then praying to God, as you \ngo to sleep at night, that this beautiful little baby will be alive in \nthe morning. That is the reality of health care in America.\n  I challenge the Republican leadership, challenge them to bring to the \nfloor of the Senate within the next week the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nLet us have this debate. Let us face the tough votes. That is what we \nare here for, for goodness' sake. This is supposed to be a deliberative \nbody where we debate and argue and come to the best conclusion for the \npeople we represent.\n  I will stand behind the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, because \nI believe it is the best one. I believe it is the only one that is \nhonest and complete and will help American families. The Republican \nplan, as this chart indicates, would leave over 100 million Americans \nbehind, would not give them the protections which we believe are \nessential to health insurance.\n  It is true they protect 48 million Americans, just as we do, but they \nleave behind 113 million who are protected by the Democratic bill.\n  I think it is time to have this debate, for the good of families \nacross America, for the Pavletichs in Addison, IL, for the Cortez \nfamily from Elk Grove Village, for the Eberhardts, who have written to \nme and told me their story, from Yorkville, IL.\n  I promise you this: As long as my voice holds out, I will be on my \nfeet on the Senate floor saying to my colleagues, we have a \nresponsibility. The 105th Congress left town a little over 6 months ago \nand did nothing. It was a do-nothing Congress. This Congress is not \ngoing to leave town without addressing this critical issue, this issue \nthat means so much to Americans across this country and people who \ncontinue to write on a daily basis.\n  I will close by saying this: Keep the letters and photographs coming \nin. As long as you will send me your stories of your family struggling \nto provide quality health care, I will continue to stand on this floor \nand tell these stories, in the hopes that my colleagues in the Senate \nwill address this important issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \ncontinue as in morning business for 15 minutes.\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Illinois \nrepresents one of the greatest States of our country, a significant and \nvery large State, with millions of people, ranging from one of the best \nknown, most dynamic cities not only in this country but in the world, \nand also with very small rural areas. I, in turn, represent a very \nsmall State, where the largest city is 40,000 people. We go down to a \ntown of 40 people. But I couldn't help but think, while listening to \nthe statement of my good friend from Illinois, about some of the \nletters he read. The names of the towns might be different, but we \nmight have heard similar letters from Vermont. Sometimes the problems \nare compounded by the fact that we are a rural State. As he knows, in \nthe rural areas of his great State the problems are even worse because \nof the distances they have to travel and the lack of choices they may \nhave. I hope he will continue to speak because he speaks not just for \nthe people of Illinois, but for the people of Vermont and everywhere \nelse.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7284-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE POWERFUL GUN LOBBY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while we talk about the actions in the \nother body, it is fascinating to me what has happened in the dark of \nnight. The members of the other body aren't controlling their destiny; \nit apparently was controlled by a powerful lobby in this country. For a \nwhile, the same thing happened in the U.S. Senate. I asked the question \non the floor of the Senate: ``Who will run the Senate, the U.S. \nSenators or the powerful gun lobby?'' Finally, by the slimmest of \nmargins, they answered the question and said that the U.S. Senate will \nrepresent the people of America.\n  I have watched how posturing and symbolism sometimes wins out over \nsubstance. Members of the other body are all sworn to uphold the \nConstitution of the United States. They have taken the same oath that I \nand every Member of the Senate have taken. They flew in the face of the \nConstitution, a Supreme Court decision outlined in the Constitution, \nand said that we, the Members of the Congress, will say the 10 \ncommandments shall be or may be put on schoolhouse walls.\n  Why did the House of Representatives do this and turn against the \nConstitution that they are sworn to uphold? Why? So that the students \nseeing it would be inspired to uphold the law. That's fascinating. We \nsay that the other body will--the House of Representatives--will turn \nits back on the Constitution, and in so doing will encourage children \nwho should look to them for leadership to uphold the laws of this \ncountry. It is an example that I cannot fathom. This is what they ought \nto do--work harder and make it possible for the parents of these \nchildren to spend more time with them, make it possible to have an \neducational system that can help teach the difference between right and \nwrong. Perhaps, if they are going to talk about the 10 commandments, \nthey should remind the gun lobby of the fifth commandment: Thou shalt \nnot kill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7284-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7284-S7285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PENDING NOMINATION OF BILL LANN LEE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on Wednesday of this week, I was fortunate \nto be present during the ceremony commemorating the presentation of the \nCongressional Gold Medal to Mrs. Rosa Parks. What an inspiring time. I \nheard Mrs. Parks, Reverend Jackson, and the President each take the \noccasion to remind us that the struggle for equality is not over.\n  I heard Jesse Norman, with that incomparable voice, sing to us both \nour National Anthem and really the anthem of the civil rights movement. \nEvery one of us--black or white, old or young, man or woman, Republican \nor Democrat, were inspired by what we saw and heard. How could you not \nbe inspired in the magnificent rotunda of the U.S. Capitol?\n  But then I went back to my office and I started asking myself, have \nwe listened? I serve as the ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and the committee still has pending before it, waiting, the \nnomination of another who has dedicated his life's work to the rights \nof others. I asked the Judiciary Committee on Thursday, in the spirit \nof the Congressional Gold Medal to Rosa Parks, and in the tradition of \nRosa Parks, that the committee recognize the quiet dignity and strength \nof Bill Lann Lee and send his nomination to the full Senate so that the \nU.S. Senate may, at long last, vote on that nomination and, I hope, \nconfirm this fine American to full rank as the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for Civil Rights.\n\n  Bill Lann Lee is the first Asian American to be nominated to head the \nCivil Rights Division in its 42-year history. He is currently serving \nas Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, as he has for \nalmost 18 months. He has done an impressive job in enforcing our \nNation's civil rights laws. Mr. Lee was originally nominated in July of \n1997, almost exactly 2 years ago. Two years is too long to have to wait \nfor a vote by the Senate on this nomination. I hope the Senate will be \nallowed the opportunity to vote on his nomination before the Fourth of \nJuly recess.\n  Six former Assistant Attorneys General for Civil Rights, from the \nEisenhower administration through the Bush administration, wrote the \nJudiciary Committee in November of 1997 in support of this outstanding \nnominee: Harold Tyler, Burke Marshall, Stephen J. Pollak, J. Stanley \nPottinger, Drew Days, and John R. Dunne. Nonetheless, the Senate did \nnot vote, and Mr. Lee had to be renominated again in January of 1998 \nand, again, in March of 1999.\n  It is past time to do the right thing, the honorable thing, and \nreport this qualified nominee to the Senate so the Senate may fulfill \nits constitutional duty under the advise and consent clause and vote on \nthis nomination. In deference to the advise and consent power of the \nSenate, the President has not used his recess appointment power in \nconnection with this nomination.\n  After consultation with the Senate in late 1997, the President chose \nto renominate Mr. Lee in January 1998. The Attorney General named him \nActing Assistant Attorney General. When the Senate refused all last \nyear to consider the nomination--not to vote him up or down, or not to \neven vote at all--the President sent that nomination to the Senate for \na third time in a third succeeding year, in 1999. Now, no one can \nfairly contend that the Senate has not been respected. The President \nhas gone the extra mile, and Mr. Lee has shown extraordinary patience \nduring this extended period of Senate indifference to his nomination.\n  Acting Assistant Attorney General Lee is properly serving while his \nnomination remains pending. It is the responsibility of the Senate to \nvote on that nomination. I believe that in a fair and open vote on the \nmerits of this nomination on the Senate floor, the Senate will embrace \nthe opportunity to confirm this fine person, this dedicated public \nservant. They will confirm him.\n  If I am wrong, if the Senate were to disappoint me and all those who \nsupport this nomination, and if a majority of the Senate were to vote \nagainst the nomination, and then he could not continue to serve as \nActing Assistant Attorney General--that is a mechanism Congress \nestablished by law, but it properly relies on a vote by the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Civil rights is about human dignity and opportunity. Bill Lann Lee's \nnomination ought to have the opportunity for an up-or-down vote on the \nSenate floor. Twenty-three months and 3 sessions of Congress is too \nlong for this nomination to have to wait. He should no longer be forced \nto ride in the ``back of the nominations bus,'' but be given the fair \nvote he deserves.\n  When Bill Lee appeared before our committee way back in 1997, he \ntestified candidly about his views, his work and his values. He told us \nwhy he became a person who has dedicated his life to equal justice for \nall, specially when he talked about the treatment his parents received \nas immigrants. He told us how his parents faced prejudice almost every \nday here in this country. But Mr. Lee told us how, in spite of his \nfather's personal treatment, the experience of prejudice he faced, the \nnames he was called, and the slurs he had to\n\n[[Page S7285]]\n\nhear, his father, William Lee, remained a fierce American patriot and \nvolunteered to serve in the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II.\n  He never lost his belief in America. His father, William Lee, \ninspired his son, Bill, just as Bill Lann Lee now inspires his own \nchildren and countless others across the land.\n  This is what he told us:\n\n       My father is my hero, but I confess that I found it \n     difficult for many years to appreciate his unflinching \n     patriotism in the face of daily indignities. In my youth, I \n     did not understand how he could remain so deeply grateful to \n     a country where he and my mother faced so much intolerance. \n     But I began to appreciate that the vision he had of being an \n     American was a vision so compelling that he could set aside \n     the momentary ugliness. He know that the basic American tenet \n     of equality of opportunity is the bedrock of our society.\n\n  I know that Bill Lann Lee has remained true to all that his father \ntaught him and I hope that the ``momentary ugliness'' of people \nopposing his nomination based on an ideological litmus test, and of \npeople distorting his achievements and beliefs, and of some succumbing \nto narrow partisanship, will not be his reward for a career of good \nworks. Such treatment drives good people from public service and \ndistorts the role of the Senate.\n  Bill Lee's skills, his experience, the compelling personal journey \nthat he and his family have traveled, his commitment to full \nopportunity for all Americans--these qualities appeal to the best in \nus. Let us affirm the best in us. Let us confirm--or at least allow the \nSenate to vote on the confirmation--of this good man. We need Bill \nLee's proven problem-solving abilities in these difficult times.\n  If the Senate is allowed to decide, I believe Bill Lann Lee will be \nconfirmed and will move this country forward to a time when \ndiscrimination will subside and affirmative action is no longer needed; \na time when each child--girl or boy, black or white, rich or poor, \nurban or rural, regardless of national or ethnic origin and regardless \nof sexual orientation or disability--shall have a fair and equal \nopportunity to live the American dream.\n  I have often referred to the Senate as acting at its best when it \nserves as the conscience of the Nation. In my 25 years I have seen it \ndo that. Again I speak to the conscience of this body. I call on the \nJudiciary Committee of the Senate to bring this nomination to the \nfloor. Let the Senate have an up-or-down vote on Bill Lann Lee without \nobstruction, without further delays, so the Senate may vote.\n  If we do, I am convinced that a majority of this body will confirm a \nfine person to lead the Civil Rights Division into the next century. \nRacial discrimination and harmful discrimination in all its forms \nremains one of the most vexing, unsolved problems in all of our \nsociety. In a country so blessed as ours, so rich, so powerful, so \nwonderful, we still have this cancer of discrimination that shows up \nrandomly throughout our society. Let's not perpetuate it here in the \nSenate. Let the Senate move forward from the ceremony commemorating the \nCongressional Gold Medal for Rosa Parks by doing what is right, by \nvoting on the nomination of Bill Lann Lee.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/18/senate-section/article/S7285-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 21, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
