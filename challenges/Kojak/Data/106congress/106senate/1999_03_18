Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow resume consideration of S. 544, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 544) making emergency supplemental \n     appropriations and rescissions for recovery from natural \n     disasters, and foreign assistance, for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 1999, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Specter amendment No. 77, to permit the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services to waive recoupment of Federal government \n     medicaid claims to tobacco-related State settlements if a \n     State uses a portion of those funds for programs to reduce \n     the use of tobacco products, to improve the public health, \n     and to assist in the economic diversification of tobacco \n     farming communities.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 90 minutes remaining on the Specter amendment, No. 77, to \nbe equally divided.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before proceeding with this amendment, I \nhave been asked to make this statement on behalf of the majority \nleader.\n  This morning, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. Under the order, there will be 90 \nadditional minutes for debate on the pending Specter amendment, No. 77.\n  All Senators are, therefore, notified that the first vote this \nmorning will be at approximately 11 a.m., if all debate is used. \nFollowing that vote, additional amendments are expected, and Senators \nshould anticipate rollcall votes throughout today's session. Any \nSenators intending to offer amendments to this legislation are \nencouraged to notify the managers so that they can be scheduled for \nconsideration.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 77\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I found on my desk this morning a ``Dear \nColleague'' letter entitled, ``Oppose the Specter-Harkin Amendment That \nSeizes $123 Billion in State Funds.''\n  Instead of outlining the provisions of the Specter-Harkin amendment, \nI would just refer my colleagues to this ``Dear Colleague'' letter \nsigned by the opponents, and tell them that the amendment is exactly \ncontrary to what is in this ``Dear Colleague'' letter, so that by \nreading the letter, they can just conclude the opposite, and they will \nhave a statement of what the pending amendment is.\n  Before dealing in detail with the ``Dear Colleague'' letter, or this \nmisstatement, permit me to outline in very general terms that the \npending amendment has been offered by the chairmen and ranking members \nof the two Senate committees which are charged with authorization of \nappropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services. Senator \nJeffords, the chairman of the authorizing committee, and Senator \nKennedy, the ranking member, are cosponsors of the amendment which has \nbeen offered by Senator Harkin, the ranking member on the \nappropriations subcommittee which has the responsibility for \nappropriations for the Department of Health and Human Services, and the \nsubcommittee which I have the honor to Chair.\n  We must survey--the four of us in our positions as chairmen and \nranking members--the health needs of America in a very, very \nconstrained budget. We have seen the budget resolution, which\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\nhas come out of Budget Committee, and the limitations on discretionary \nfunding. Our subcommittee has the responsibility for funding not only \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, but also the Department of \nEducation and the Department of Labor, where so many vital programs for \nworker safety are involved.\n  So our responsibility is a very heavy one. As we have observed, the \nsettlement with the States is in excess of some $200 billion over a 25-\nyear period. The thought immediately came to mind that these funds, \nwhich have been obtained from settlements on tobacco issues, could be \nused and should be used in very large part, frankly, if not entirely, \nfor health purposes.\n  In the Appropriations Committee meeting, an amendment was offered by \nthe distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, to have the \nFederal Government relinquish all claims to these funds, and have these \nfunds paid entirely to the State governments.\n  I can understand the popularity of this kind of an amendment.\n  It is backed by all 50 Governors; it would be shocking if it weren't. \nIt is backed by all 50 State legislatures; it would be shocking if it \nweren't. It is backed by all State attorneys general; again, it would \nbe shocking if it were not.\n  I support the proposition that there ought to be minimal strings, \nminimal requirements mandated by the Federal Government, especially in \nthe context where we mandate requirements and do not fund them.\n  Last week, we passed the Ed-Flex bill to give flexibility to the \nStates. But I submit to you that it is fundamentally different to say \nthat where there are Federal appropriations for a specific purpose, \nthere ought to be latitude for State governments and local governments \nto figure out how to spend those funds, contrasted with saying that all \nof $200 billion-plus ought to go to the States to spend as they choose, \nwhen some States have already made an announcement that they intend to \nuse these funds, at least in part, for highway construction or for debt \nretirement.\n  When a settlement is reached on matters of this sort by State \ngovernments and officials representing the States, those funds \nrealistically are impressed with the trust, where the claims are \nbrought because of damages due to public health, due to tobacco. There \nis a specific purpose that the lawsuits were started, and that was to \nredress public claims on these important areas. Even without a Federal \ndirection limiting, in some way, or articulating a portion of these \nfunds to go for medical purposes, it is my legal judgment that those \nfunds are impressed with the trust. I would not be surprised to see \nthat, if the State governments undertake spending on items far afield, \nthey may face a class action or taxpayer suits or people who have been \ninjured by tobacco seeking to impress that trust.\n  We had a hearing in the appropriations subcommittee this Monday. Our \nsubcommittee took up the issue on an emergency basis to try to see if \nwe could find some area for resolution. We heard testimony from the \nGovernor of Kentucky and the attorneys general of Pennsylvania, Texas, \nand Iowa. Those four witnesses all emphasized the desirability of \nhaving some resolution of this issue so that they could make plans for \ntheir budgets.\n  I agree with that proposition. A very forceful letter was filed by \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, Donna Shalala, strenuously \nobjecting to having the money paid over to the States, because the \nFederal law gives her the authority to make an allocation as to how \nmuch of those funds should be deducted from the Federal obligation to \nthe States on Medicaid.\n  The States have the obligation under Federal law to sue to collect on \nclaims that Medicaid has. And the States have the authority--and \nexercise the authority--to release the tobacco companies from liability \nto the Federal Government. That is provided for under existing Federal \nlaw. So for those who say that the Federal Government can bring \nlawsuits, it simply is not so, because those claims have all been \nreleased.\n  It may be, Mr. President, that we are in an area where largely, if \nnot entirely, the States will recognize the duty to use these \nsettlement proceeds for tobacco-related purposes. The distinguished \nattorney general of Pennsylvania, Mike Fisher, who testified on Monday, \noutlined a program for the use by Pennsylvania of $11.3 billion. I \nbelieve that, in conjunction with our distinguished Governor Tom Ridge, \nthere will be a program to use these funds for tobacco-related \npurposes. But it is not sufficient to say that States may recognize \nthis obligation, because States may not recognize the obligation, as we \nhave already seen from preliminary indications of spending these funds \non unrelated purposes--debt reduction and highway construction.\n  In a ``Dear Colleague'' letter that has been circulated today, which \nI referred to earlier, the statement is made:\n\n       The Specter-Harkin amendment will require every Governor--\n     each year--for the next 25 years to submit a plan to \n     Washington asking for permission on how to spend fifty \n     percent of the State's own money.\n\n  That is flatly wrong.\n  It is true that there is a 20-percent requirement for smoking \ncessation education to try to dissuade youngsters from smoking and a \n30-percent requirement on medical plans. But there is no need for \nGovernors to submit a plan to Washington asking for permission on how \nto spend that money, that 50 percent. That is a matter where the \nGovernors only have to tell the Department of Health and Human Services \nhow the money was spent after in fact it is spent. They don't have to \nsubmit a plan, and they don't have to ask for prior authorization.\n  The ``Dear Colleague'' letter further says:\n\n       This is a classic ``Washington Knows Best'' policy, an \n     unprecedented Federal power grab.\n\n  In a sense, it is complimentary to call it an ``unprecedented Federal \npower grab.'' Considering all the Federal power grabs that have been \nrecorded historically, this is really a gentle nudge to the States, \nsaying that here we have funds realized from a tobacco settlement with \na statement of policy that 50 percent ought to be used for a specific \npurpose.\n  On the 50 percent, it is actually on the low side. The facts show \nthat some 50 percent of the funds involved here come from Medicaid, so \nthat the percentage could have been substantially higher.\n  So, Mr. President, it is my hope that we will have a statement of \ncongressional policy on this vote today which will, in a very gentle \nway, without regulations, without the requirement of submitting the \nplan to Washington, simply say to the Governors that at least 50 \npercent ought to be used for tobacco-related purposes, such as \neducation to discourage children from smoking, where we see a very high \nrate of juvenile smoking and overwhelming statistics of deaths \nresulting from juvenile smoking--where we have a reasonable amount \nallocated for that educational purpose, and a reasonable amount--some \n30 percent--allocated not only for public health measures but also for \naiding smoking cessation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter supporting my \namendment from the American Lung Association dated March 17, 1999, and \na letter of support from the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids dated March \n18, 1999, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    American Lung Association,\n\n                                                   March 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: The American Lung Association is \n     pleased to support the legislation you are introducing with \n     Senator Harkin that requires states spend the federal share \n     of tobacco settlement funds on tobacco and health purposes. \n     The American Lung Association is a strong supporter of the \n     Medicaid program. However, if the decision is made to forego \n     the federal share of the Medicaid recovery, legislation like \n     your proposal must be enacted to ensure that the funds are \n     spent on tobacco control, prevention and cessation activities \n     and health programs. It would be extremely shortsighted not \n     to use these resources to reduce the cause of the disease \n     that led to the need for the recovery in the first place.\n       We favor your approach and the similar proposal by Senators \n     Kennedy and Lautenberg (S. 584) because they require tobacco \n     settlement dollars to be invested in tobacco control and \n     improving the public health.\n       Effective tobacco education, prevention and cessation \n     programs will help reduce the horrible toll tobacco takes on \n     American families. Reducing tobacco use also will help reduce \n     the enormous cost to taxpayers that tobacco-related disease \n     imposes. Investing\n\n[[Page S2883]]\n\n     funds in the public health programs will improve the health \n     of millions of Americans. We also support efforts to help \n     tobacco growing communities diversify their economies.\n       To ensure their efficacy, the American Lung Association \n     supports rigorous federal review, evaluation and oversight of \n     tobacco control programs. Congress should contain Medicaid \n     costs and promote public health by affirming the authority of \n     the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco \n     products, implementing a vigorous national advertising and \n     education program to counter the tobacco industry's marketing \n     efforts and by enacting other policies and programs to reduce \n     tobacco use.\n       The American Lung Association looks forward to working with \n     you to enact strong legislation to combat the addiction, \n     disease and death caused by tobacco.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Fran Du Melle,\n     Deputy Managing Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids--National Center for \n           Tobacco-Free Kids,\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids \n     fully supports your amendment to the supplemental \n     appropriations bill to require states to spend 20 percent of \n     the money they receive from their settlements with the \n     tobacco companies on comprehensive programs to prevent \n     tobacco use. The Federal government has a legitimate claim to \n     a share of the settlement money and should condition its \n     waiver of the federal share on states funding effective \n     tobacco prevention programs.\n       Investing in tobacco prevention will save lives and money. \n     the evidence continues to build that statewide tobacco \n     prevention strategies are effective in reducing tobacco use. \n     Several states already have tobacco prevention campaigns and \n     have reduced overall smoking levels within their borders at a \n     faster rate than elsewhere in the country. And while youth \n     smoking rates have risen dramatically nationwide, they have \n     decreased or increased much more slowly in these states. Just \n     this week, results were released showing decreases in teen \n     smoking in Florida less than a year after that state's \n     comprehensive tobacco program was launched.\n       In addition to saving lives, decreasing tobacco use will \n     save money. Public and private direct expenditures to treat \n     health problems caused by smoking annually total more than \n     $70 billion. Aggressive tobacco prevention initiatives in \n     every state would reduce these costs for federal and state \n     governments as well as for businesses and individuals. \n     Requiring the states to devote resources to solving the \n     tobacco problem will save federal dollars in the future.\n       We heartily endorse your efforts to ensure that funds from \n     the tobacco settlement are used to address the reason for the \n     lawsuits in the first place--reducing the number one \n     preventable cause of death in this country. Thank you for \n     standing up for America's kids.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Matthew L. Myers,\n\n                                      Executive Vice President and\n                                                  General Counsel.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time has been consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 12 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator.\n  Does the Senator from Hawaii, who was on the floor first, seek \nrecognition on this issue?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to speak on the emergency \nsupplemental and rescissions bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in that case, I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Rhode Island on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for \nyielding the time, and I also commend him and Senator Harkin for their \namendment to this supplemental bill. They have done something that I \nthink is incredibly important, and that is to provide some emphasis on \nsmoking cessation and also public health in the use of the funds from \nthe tobacco settlements that the States are beginning to receive.\n  The amendment by Senator Specter and Senator Harkin strikes a very \nreasonable balance between the desires of the Governors to use these \nfunds and also the willingness of the Federal Government to forgo its \nshare of the tobacco settlement, and also the need to ensure that we do \nhave in place significant tobacco prevention activities, as well as \nbeing able to meet other public health priorities. This amendment \nreserves 25 percent of the overall settlement to these priorities--\nsmoking cessation and public health--and allows 75 percent of the funds \nto be spent at the discretion of the States. I think this is an \nappropriate way to deal with the proceeds of the tobacco settlement.\n  When we consider the fact that the basis of these claims rested upon \nMedicaid spending by the States, and we also consider the significant \ncontribution the Federal Government makes to the Medicaid Program, it \nis not unrealistic--in fact, it is entirely appropriate--that we would \nbe able to, and should be able to, lay out some broad guidelines as to \nthe use of a small portion of the settlement funds. I can't think of \nany more appropriate topic of concern at every level of government than \nthe reduction of smoking in this society.\n  Let's step back a minute. This process of suing the tobacco \ncompanies, this process that led to the settlements, is not about \ngetting some money for new highways or new types of programs at the \nState level. It started with the realization that smoking is the most \ndangerous public health problem in this country and we have to take \nconcerted steps to do that. The suits resulted in a settlement, \nfinancially, but it won't result in the effective eradication, \nelimination, or reduction of smoking unless we apply those proceeds to \nsmoking cessation programs and other public health initiatives that are \ncritical to the health and welfare of this country.\n\n  We know that each day more than 3,000 young people become regular \nsmokers. We also know that 90 percent of those who are long-term \nsmokers began before they were 18 years old. So there is a critical \nneed for more and more efforts particularly targeted at youngsters to \nensure that they do not start the habit of smoking, and by requiring a \ncertain portion, a rather small portion, of the proceeds of these \nsettlements to that end is, again, not only sensible but it is \ncompelled by the crisis we face in the public health area of smoking in \nthe United States.\n  One of the other things that we must also recognize is that this \nsettlement represents a concession, an acknowledgement by the tobacco \nindustry that their marketing practices were sinister, that they \ntargeted young people, and that, in fact, their product causes disease \nand death. And in that context we have to respond with some of these \nfunds to recognize the public health impact of smoking overall. On both \nthe law and the logic, it seems to me entirely appropriate that this \namendment should not only be debated but passed.\n  I think we have to recognize, too, that what the amendment proposes \nis not some type of grandiose Federal program. It simply directs the \nGovernors and the legislatures in their own way, form, and fashion to \nuse these funds for very broad programmatic initiatives in public \nhealth which encompass such things as smoking cessation.\n  So this is not an overwhelming usurpation of State and local \nprerogatives by the Federal Government; it is a common way to deal with \nproblems that got us here in the first place, the fact that smoking, \nparticularly youthful smoking, is one of the major public health crises \nin this country.\n  I believe Senator Specter and Senator Harkin have balanced and \ncomplemented the way in which States are using these funds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REED. Their efforts are complementing what States are doing. Our \nLieutenant Governor, Bernard Jackvony, is proposing this initiative.\n  I hope we can all stand behind this amendment, and I thank the \nSenator for yielding me time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I have two speakers on the amendment, \nbut I know Senator Akaka wants to speak on the bill. I would like to \nask him if he could take 5 minutes--and then let us get back to the \namendment--equally divided from Senator Specter's side and my side.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Texas for yielding \nme this time. I want her to know that I will be speaking on the \nemergency supplemental and rescissions bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I understand that the Senator was not aware we had \nset aside this time by unanimous consent for the amendment. So I am \nhappy to give him 5 minutes equally divided between Senator Specter's \nside and my side, if he will do that, and then allow us to go back to \nthe amendment under\n\n[[Page S2884]]\n\nthe current unanimous consent agreement. Is that acceptable?\n  Mr. AKAKA. I certainly would accept that, and I thank my friend from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern on the FY 1999 \nemergency supplemental and rescissions bill. I support disaster relief \nfor Central America and the Caribbean, emergency relief for America's \nfarmers in crisis, and aid to Jordan to implement the Wye River \nagreement. It is important that these priorities be funded.\n  My concern is that one of the budget offsets to pay for this bill \npits these important foreign and domestic needs against the needs of \nthe country's poorest families--something that Hawaii's poorest \nfamilies can ill afford. This supplemental bill seeks to defer $350 \nmillion in funding from ``unobligated balances'' under the Temporary \nAssistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program until fiscal year 2001. \nThe language in the bill requires deferral of portions of states' \nunobligated TANF funds.\n  The deferral is based on the states' share of total unobligated \nfunds. Preliminary estimates show this means Hawaii would not be able \nto spend about $800,000 of its TANF funds until fiscal year 2001.\n  It is my understanding that my friend from Alaska, chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, is working to find a \ndifferent offset so that the $350 million in TANF funds will not have \nto be deferred. I strongly encourage him in these efforts and urge that \nthis be done.\n  In the meantime, we all know that TANF replaced the Aid to Families \nwith Dependent Children welfare program in 1996. I am a critic of the \nTANF Program for failing to provide an adequate safety net for low-\nincome families. However, I am adamant that full funding must continue \nto go to the states to assist welfare families and their children. No \npart of it should be deferred to offset supplemental spending.\n  The term ``unobligated,'' may seem self-explanatory. Anyone may think \nthat a $350 million deferral of unobligated funds under the bill would \napply to funds that have simply not been spent under this program. \nProponents would argue that welfare rolls have fallen so far that this \nmoney is not needed by states, which is why it remains unobligated. \nHowever, Mr. President, we know that funding decisions by state and \nlocal governments take time. Transfers of expenditures must go through \na process. States often commit funding to counties and local \ngovernments that is not transferred immediately, so the amount is not \ntaken off the states' books.\n  The fact is many states rely heavily on these unobligated funds and \nhave already committed them for a wide variety of uses, such as \ndistribution to counties and local agencies, ``rainy day'' funds for \ncontingencies such as economic downturns that swell the rolls and leave \nstates without enough money until the next federal payment, transfers \ninto child care and social services activities, or other basic expenses \nto help low-income families become self-sufficient.\n  My state of Hawaii continues to plan uses for all available funds to \nprovide child care services to our TANF families so that they can be \ngiven a chance to continue at their jobs and make it work. Hawaii is \ndoing this the right way, instead of simply looking at the numbers and \nacting to drop welfare recipients off their rolls. Hawaii is truly \n``teaching them to fish,'' so that they truly achieve self sufficiency.\n  Deferring release of TANF funds for a number of years and using the \n$350 million for emergency spending violates the agreement made when \nTANF was passed. I have a letter here from Governor of Hawaii, Benjamin \nCayetano, dated March 12th, that describes the agreement between \nGovernors, Congress, and the administration that the entitlement nature \nof the old AFDC Program would be replaced with a set amount of funding \nto states under TANF. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: I am writing you today to express \n     concern about information I have received which predicts \n     Congress will attempt to cut the funding for the Temporary \n     Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program this year. My \n     concern is that there was an agreement between the Governors, \n     Congress, and the Administration that the entitlement nature \n     of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) Program \n     would disappear in favor of a set amount of funding in block \n     grant form under TANF.\n       The funding under TANF is not overly generous. If fact, in \n     Hawaii, we have not experienced a decrease in the welfare \n     population and every dollar is needed.\n       I have been told that Congress may be viewing unspent TANF \n     allocations as a surplus that could be used to fund other \n     initiatives. This is being discussed even though child \n     poverty has increased since the passage of Welfare Reform.\n       While I cannot speak for other States, I can assure you we \n     are trying very hard to assist welfare recipients to become \n     employed and self-sufficient. It appears many States may have \n     tightened their eligibility criteria, but have not been \n     successful in getting welfare recipients employed. If this is \n     the case, the States will be needing their TANF allocation to \n     address the continuing hardships of these families.\n       I hope you will agree that the TANF funding needs to be \n     safeguarded to provide States with the necessary resources to \n     assist welfare families. Thank you for your attention to this \n     matter. Your strong support is greatly appreciated.\n       With warmest personal regards,\n           Aloha,\n                                             Benjamin J. Cayetano.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. To use TANF funding as an offset abrogates this agreement. \nI hope my colleagues, the appropriators, are working to keep this \nagreement intact. Hawaii and other states need this money to assist \npoor families.\n  And of all states, Hawaii needs assistance the most.\n  Mr. President, our Nation is enjoying the longest peacetime expansion \nin American history--yet Hawaii is not benefiting from this expansion. \nWhile the country is enjoying the lowest unemployment in nearly 30 \nyears and tremendous job creation, Hawaii is losing jobs and its people \nare having a difficult time finding work at a living wage. Our \nunemployment rate is at 5.7 percent as of November 1998--well above the \ncountry's average of 4.3 percent. Bankruptcy filings increased more \nthan 30 percent form 1997 to 1998. Retail sales fell 7 percent from \n$16.3 billion in 1997 to $15.2 billion in 1998. These are some recent \neconomic indicators. Hawaii has been suffering from an economic \ndownturn for most of this decade. As if this were not enough, my state \nhas had to endure the worst of all states from the economic crisis in \nAsia. The Aloha State welcomed 11 percent fewer tourists from Japan and \nother parts of Asia in 1998. If anything should be slated for emergency \nfunding, Hawaii should.\n  With all of this need, you can see why $800,000 in TANF funding means \na lot to my state. The number of families in Hawaii receiving \nassistance under this program has increased since the new law was \npassed. According to the Hawaii Department of Human Services, as of \nJanuary, 1999, 16,575 single-parent families and 7,119 two-parent \nfamilies were on the rolls, for a total of 23,694 families receiving \nassistance. This represents an increase of more than 2,000 families \nsince 1995 when the number of families receiving assistance was 21,480. \nHawaii's numbers have increased because of the tough economic \nconditions we are now enduring.\n  Hawaii needs every bit of our TANF funding to make sure that our poor \nfamilies continue to be self-sufficient. This is stated in the letter I \nsubmitted earlier from Governor Cayetano. We have not put our \nunobligated balances aside for a rainy day fund because we do not have \nenough of it--we need to use every dollar we have for caseloads now.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and \nthe gentleman from Alaska, Chairman Stevens, to continue working to \nfind another $350 million offset for this emergency supplemental bill, \nrather than defer much-needed TANF funds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Texas for \nyielding me time.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Texas yield me 5 \nminutes at this point?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nWashington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, one of the ways in which the Congress of \nthe United States has been the bane of every Governor and State \nlegislator in the United States of America is its constant willingness \nto impose unfunded mandates on States and on local communities. We \nconstantly pass laws that tell States and local communities what they \nare to do, but we rarely pass appropriations sufficient to cover the \ncosts of carrying out those duties.\n  Just last week we debated the overwhelming unfunded mandate that is \nincluded in our rules relating to the education of special needs \nstudents, and, in fact, we moved, at least slightly, in the direction \nof funding some portion of those unfunded mandates. Here, on the other \nhand, we have the exact mirror image of an unfunded mandate originally \nimposed by the Congress of the United States. Here we are asked, in \nthis amendment, to decide that billions of dollars recovered by almost \nevery State in the Union in tobacco litigation against tobacco \ncompanies will be appropriated, effectively, by the Federal Government, \nunless the States agree on the way in which we think that money ought \nto be spent.\n  Mr. President, 50 percent of all recoveries that the States have \nmade, pursuant to this amendment, must be spent in accordance with this \namendment, and detailed regulations are promulgated by the Federal \nGovernment for every State in the country. Every Governor will have to \nmake a new application every year for 25 years and meet these \nrequirements or will, in effect, lose an amount of money equal to 50 \npercent to 100 percent of the money that State has already recovered in \nan action in which the United States of America was not a party at all.\n  That is fundamentally unfair. It makes an assumption, an unwarranted \nassumption, that these were Medicaid claims that were presented by the \nStates of the United States. My attorney general, the attorney general \nof the State of Washington, Christine Gregoire, one of the three or \nfour leaders of this effort, brought and prosecuted a case through much \nof the trial period, before it was ultimately settled, without the \nslightest mention of Medicaid. There were all kinds of fraud and \ncontract and tort claims connected with this litigation, quite \nindependent of Medicaid claims on the part of the various States of the \nUnited States of America. Last year, this body spent weeks debating \nwhether or not we should control the settlements that the States were \nmaking. We ultimately abandoned that effort and left it entirely to the \nStates.\n  As a consequence, we have absolutely no right, at this point, to tell \nthe States how they are to spend their money. Many are already engaged \nin extensive and sometimes successful antismoking efforts. Many have \npriorities that are different than the priorities here in the U.S. \nSenate. But if Members of the U.S. Senate want to control the spending \nin their own States, money that their own States have recovered, they \nshould run for the State legislature, not for the Senate of the United \nStates.\n\n  The position taken by the Senator from Texas and her companion, the \nSenator from Florida, a position that was accepted by the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, is the right and just position. This money \nwas recovered by the States, this money belongs to the States, and the \nspending of this money should be determined by each of the 50 States of \nthe United States of America.\n  It is no more difficult than that. It is as simple as that. We have \nalready imposed too many unfunded mandates on the States by our \nsubstantive legislation here. Let's not do essentially the same thing \nby telling States that money they have already recovered has to be \nspent on our priorities, rather than their own. Support the position of \nthe Senator from Texas and Florida. Reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again I thank my friend and my colleague \nand my leader, Senator Specter, for bringing forth this amendment, \nwhich is common sense and which goes to the heart of what the smoking \nproblem in America is all about. It is about health.\n  I might just say, at the outset, really the provision in the \nsupplemental bill we are talking about should not even be on the \nsupplemental. It is not an appropriations measure. It more \nappropriately ought to be in the Finance Committee, but it was slipped \nin as a rider on the appropriations bill, the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Texas, Senator Hutchison.\n  What Senator Hutchison's amendment says is all the money already \nrecouped by the States in their settlement with the tobacco companies \nshould be kept by the States and they can do with it whatever they want \nto do with it. That is all right as far at the State's money goes.\n  I have no problem with that. But that also includes the Federal share \nof Medicaid. As I have continually pointed out, under the Social \nSecurity Act the States are required to go after recoupments in \nMedicaid from third parties. In fact, they are the only ones who can \nsue for third party recoupment. The Federal Government is preempted \nfrom doing that. Only the States can do that. So they act as an agent \nfor the Federal Government and recoup them. Keep in mind, the law \nstates, regarding any money recouped by the States for Medicaid, the \nFederal portion has to be returned to the Federal Government.\n  We have to keep in mind what we are talking about here. Are we \ntalking about the fact that the tobacco companies didn't build a number \nof highways in Texas? Or that they did not build prisons in Alabama? Or \nthey did not build a sports arena in Michigan--or on and on and on? No. \nThat is not why these lawsuits were brought. They were brought because \ntobacco is the biggest killer we have in America today. You add up \nalcohol, accident, suicide, homicide, AIDS, illegal drugs, fires--add \nthem all up and tobacco kills more a year than all of these combined.\n\n  What has this tobacco debate been about, that we have been here for \nyears and years on end debating? That is what it is about. Tobacco is \nhooking young people, getting them addicted. And the tobacco companies \nhave lied and lied and lied, year after year, and covered up, and \nfought with powerful money and powerful interests here in Washington to \nkeep us from doing what we need to do to protect the public health. \nThat is what it is all about.\n  Now, the CDC estimates that smoking among high school students has \nrisen 32 percent since 1991--32 percent. The tobacco companies say they \nare going to cut down on their advertising to kids and stuff. If they \nreally want to do that, get rid of the Marlboro Man. You don't see the \nMarlboro Man disappearing, do you? No, he is still out there. And the \nVirginia Slims and all that kind of stuff is still out there; the \nMarlboro gear--that is all out there. They are still hooking kids.\n  Tobacco, an estimated $50 billion a year in health care costs alone, \nand a big portion of that is borne by the Federal taxpayers who finance \nover half the costs of Medicaid.\n  Again, to repeat for emphasis' sake, what does the Specter amendment \ndo? It only would require the States to use 20 percent of the total \nsettlement to reduce tobacco use and 30 percent for public health \nprograms or tobacco farmer assistance, helping some of our tobacco \nfarmers, and we would then waive the Federal claim to the tobacco \nsettlement funds. We do not dictate what the States spend their money \non. If the States want to take their portion and build a sports arena, \nthat is up to the voters of that State. I can tell you if it happened \nin my State, I would be on the side of any other taxpayers in my State, \nsuing the Governor or anybody else who was spending the money that way, \nbecause I think that money is held in trust for the very purposes which \nI just enumerated, and that is to cut down on smoking and to help the \npublic health.\n  CBO estimates the Federal share would be about $14 billion over 5 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S2886]]\n\nOthers are saying that the Federal Government had no role in these \nlawsuits. I just covered that.\n  Under the Social Security Act, it is the responsibility of the States \nto recover any costs and, in fact, the law states that only the States \ncan file such suits.\n  I want to correct something that was said last night by my colleague \nfrom Alabama, Senator Sessions. He claimed that only one State had \nfiled suit to recover tobacco-related Medicaid costs. Sorry. That is \nwrong. In fact, the following States had Medicaid claims in their \nlawsuits: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, \nFlorida, Hawaii, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New \nJersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, \nRhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin--all \nhad Medicaid claims in their lawsuits.\n  I think this is really the crux of it--whether or not a State \nincluded a Medicaid claim isn't the issue. The fact is every State that \nsettled in November of 1998, and that included all 50 States and the \nterritories, even those that did not include a Medicaid claim in their \nsuit, waived their right to recover tobacco-related Medicaid costs in \nthe future. Why do you think that was put in the settlement? If, in \nfact, the lawsuits were not about Medicaid, why do you think that the \ntobacco companies came in and insisted, as a condition of the \nsettlement, that the States had to waive their right for any future \nsuits based on Medicaid? It is curious. If that is not what this was \nall about, why did they put that in there? Because the tobacco \ncompanies, smart lawyers that they have got, knew this is what it is \nabout. It is about health care. It is about hooking kids on smoking.\n  They could see that the States are going to get all this money. What \ndo the States want to do with it? They want to reduce debt. They want \nto build prisons and highways. They want to reduce taxes.\n  How many are going to use it to cut down on what the tobacco \ncompanies are most afraid of? What they are afraid of is losing young \npeople who would not be smoking, who won't take up the habit. That is \nwhat they are afraid of. That is why they put it in there. Not only did \nthe settlement waive the right of the States forever to sue to recoup \nfor Medicaid, it waives our rights, the Federal Government's rights to \nsue. Why? Because under the Social Security law, only the States can \nsue for recoupment under third parties. When they waive their right, \nthey waive our rights. The States, in making this deal with the tobacco \ncompanies, have effectively taken away the right of the Federal \nGovernment to go into court and to go after tobacco companies to get \nthe Federal taxpayers' share of the money for the health care costs of \nMedicaid. That is what it is about.\n  The provision put in by the Senator from Texas says let them have it. \nLet the States have all this money. If they want to build highways, let \nthem build them. I tell my colleagues, I know where the tobacco lobby \nis on this one. The tobacco lobby is foursquare for this provision in \nthe bill, because they do not want States spending money to cut down on \nteen smoking. Some States will. I compliment and commend the Governor \nof my own State of Iowa who has said that they will use a large portion \nof this for education, intervention, cutting down on youth smoking. How \nmuch, I do not know, a large portion of it.\n\n  Again, this is a bipartisan, commonsense amendment. For the life of \nme, I do not know why anyone would oppose it, unless it is under some \ntheory that we can't tell the States what to do with this money. I \ndon't want to tell the States what to do with their money, but when the \nFederal taxpayers provide over 50 percent of Medicaid monies to the \nStates and we are paying 50 billion bucks a year in health-related \ncosts and much of that through Medicaid, then I think we have a right \nand an obligation to say that some portion of that money that is \nFederal money ought to go for health-related purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. For example, in Maine, I am told the Governor wants to \nuse it for a tax cut. In Michigan, the Governor wants to use the \nsettlement for college scholarships; no funds for tobacco prevention. \nThe Nevada Governor wants it for college scholarships. New Hampshire's \nGovernor wants the money for education; no proposal on tobacco. In New \nYork, the Governor wants to spend 75 percent for debt relief. In South \nDakota, the Governor wants money for prisoners, nothing on tobacco. In \nRhode Island, the Governor wants money to cut the car tax. That is all \nwell and good, but that is not what this is about.\n  I say to my friends, we have a statement of policy from the Executive \nOffice of the President which says, referring to the emergency \nsupplemental bill, S. 554:\n\n       Were the bill to be presented to the President with the \n     Senate Committee's proposed offsets and several objectionable \n     riders discussed below, the President's senior advisers would \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  One of the provisions:\n\n       A provision that would completely relinquish the Federal \n     taxpayers' share of the Medicaid-related claims in the \n     comprehensive State tobacco settlement without any commitment \n     whatsoever by the States to use those funds to stop youth \n     smoking. Federal taxpayers paid more than half, an average of \n     57 percent of Medicaid smoking-related expenditures. The \n     Administration believes that the States should retain those \n     funds but should make a commitment that the Federal share of \n     the settlement's proceeds will be spent on shared national \n     and State priorities: to reduce youth smoking, protect \n     tobacco farmers, improve public health and assist children.\n\n  So there we have it. If this amendment stays in there untouched, the \nPresident's senior advisors will recommend a veto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to thank my Scottish cousin, Senator \nGraham, for letting me go first so I can go back to the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I am very happy to be here and join both Senator Graham of Florida \nand my colleague from Texas in strongly opposing this amendment.\n  The idea that the Federal Government is trying to seize $18.9 billion \nfrom the States to spend in Washington, DC, when we had nothing to do \nwith their settlement and when we were in the process of trying to \nimpose our own taxes and, in fact, when the President has in his budget \nthe imposition of new taxes on tobacco, is absolutely outrageous.\n  The amazing thing is the President proposes taking the money away \nfrom the States and then giving them a bunch of money, but then telling \nthem how to spend it.\n  This amendment is the height of absurdity. In my State, this \namendment would tell Texas that we have to spend $4 billion on smoker \ncessation. We could literally hire thousands of people and have a \npersonal trainer for each person who are chewing tobacco or dipping \nsnuff. Why should the Federal Government have the right to tell the \nStates how to spend this money?\n  I suggest our colleagues read the tenth amendment of the \nConstitution--powers not specifically delegated to the Federal \nGovernment are reserved to the several States and to the people.\n  This amendment is an outrageous power grab. Where we in Washington, \nthe day before yesterday, were trying to be the school board for all \nAmerica, now we are trying to tell the States how to get people to stop \nsmoking, when we have done a very poor job of it in the Federal \nGovernment. We are trying to tell the States how to spend their money. \nSomewhere this has got to stop. My suggestion to our colleagues is, if \nyou want to run the schools in America, quit the Senate and go run for \nthe school board.\n  If you want to be a State legislator, leave the Senate and run for \nthe State senate or the State house or run for Governor. Our job is not \nto tell the States how to spend their money.\n  This is an outrageous amendment. I just cannot understand the logic \nof this, other than the belief that only we know what is best. The idea \nthat we on the floor of the Senate will tell Texas how they have to \nspend $4 billion over this period is absolutely absurd--that Texas has \nto file a report every year\n\n[[Page S2887]]\n\nwith Health and Human Services, and then they have to approve how Texas \nis spending its own money that the Federal Government had nothing to do \nwith, had no part in claiming, no role in the settlement. In fact, in \nthe President's budget this year where he tries to reclaim this money, \nhe is talking about imposing a tobacco tax. Are we going to let the \nStates tell us how to spend that money? I think not.\n  I congratulate my colleague from Texas. This is an amendment that \ndeserves to be defeated overwhelmingly. I hope 80 or 90 of our fellow \nSenators will vote against this amendment. Again, if you want to tell \nTexas how to spend its money, quit the Senate, move to Texas, establish \nresidence, run for the State legislature; if you can get elected, go at \nit. But do not get elected from another State and come here and try to \ntell our State or any other State how to spend its money.\n  The Federal Government needs to butt out. We have plenty of our own \nproblems to deal with here. Social Security is going broke, Medicare is \ngoing broke quicker, and what are we doing? The day before yesterday, \nwe were trying to run all the schools in the country as a national \nschool board. Today we are trying to spend money in every State to tell \nthem how to deal with their tobacco settlements.\n  It seems to me we are running away from real problems that we ought \nto be solving and trying to find somebody else's problems to solve \nwhere we don't have any responsibility if things go bad.\n  Again, I congratulate my colleague from Texas. I congratulate the \nSenator from Florida. I thank him for letting me come in and speak at \nthis time. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will withhold, does the Senator \nfrom Texas yield to the Senator from Florida?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield 10 minutes to my colleague.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and Teutonic cousin \nfor his kind remarks and for his comments against this misguided \namendment.\n  First, I strongly support the original purpose of this legislation, \nwhich is to provide relief to our neighbors in the Central American \ncountries and the Caribbean which were so devastated last year by a \nseries of hurricanes.\n  I had the opportunity to visit Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and \nDominican Republic which were primarily affected by those hurricanes \nand can testify that the need is great and that the humanitarian \nassistance which the United States has already provided, and which this \nlegislation will allow us to continue, has been of immeasurable value \nand has added to the strength of the relationship between the United \nStates and those affected countries.\n  I also strongly support the tobacco recoupment amendment which was \nadded in the Appropriations Committee by my colleague, the Senator from \nTexas. In addition to the wisdom of the amendment, there is a sense of \nurgency to move forward with this. Many State legislatures are meeting \nas we meet this week. Many of those legislatures are well along toward \ntheir adjournment date. Many of those States are awaiting our action on \nthis issue to make a determination as to what is the most appropriate \nway to utilize funds that have been secured through the tobacco \nsettlement for purposes that will benefit their citizens.\n  We need to resolve this issue and resolve it in a way that has been \nsuggested by the amendment recommended by the Appropriations Committee, \nwhich is that the Federal Government keep its hands off this money \nwhich has been secured solely as a result of the actions of the States.\n  Let me give a brief history of this issue, with particular focus on \nthe State of Florida, which was one of the first four States to secure \nan individual settlement with the tobacco industry.\n  Under the leadership of our departed friend and colleague, Lawton \nChiles, the Florida Legislature amended its law to allow a specific \nstatute to be passed, under which the State brought litigation against \nthe tobacco industry. At the time that occurred, Governor Chiles wrote \na letter to Attorney General Janet Reno suggesting that the Federal \nGovernment join in the lawsuit--not join in the lawsuit as it relates \nto any specific claim, such as the Medicaid claim, but, rather, join in \nthe lawsuit to advance Federal interests that were at stake. I will \ntalk later about what those Federal interests are.\n  This is the letter--and I quote it in part--dated June 6, 1995, which \nwas sent from the Attorney General to the Governor of Florida:\n\n       Dear Governor Chiles: Thank you for your letter concerning \n     the possibility of the Department of Justice participating in \n     the State of Florida's lawsuit against cigarette \n     manufacturers. As you know, similar suits have been filed by \n     the States of Mississippi, Minnesota and West Virginia. At my \n     request, the Department's Civil Division has been monitoring \n     the tobacco litigation. Thus far, we have not been persuaded \n     that participation would be advisable. We will continue to \n     actively monitor these cases, however, and will reconsider \n     this decision should circumstances persuade us otherwise in \n     this regard.\n\n  There were no subsequent reconsiderations, and the Federal Government \nessentially said, ``We will stand apart from these States' efforts.'' \nStand apart until the States, having spent enormous amounts of money, \neffort, and political resources now have secured a settlement.\n  At this point, the Federal Government wishes to invite itself back \ninto this litigation by, in the President's budget proposal, taking \nhalf the money and having the Federal Government spend it or, in this \namendment proposal, having the Federal Government serve as the parent \nfor the States and tell them how to spend their tobacco settlement \nmoney.\n  The assumption of this legislation started with another letter from \nWashington which went to the States which stated, in effect, that the \nFederal Health Care Financing Administration was going to initiate an \nadministrative collection procedure under an arcane provision of the \nSocial Security statute--specifically, 1903(D)(3)--in which it would \nrecoup a substantial portion of the States' settlements.\n  The specific language which was relied upon by the Federal Health \nCare Financing Administration is the language which states:\n\n       The pro rata share to which the United States is equitably \n     entitled, as determined by the Secretary, of the net amount \n     recovered during any quarter by the State or any political \n     subdivision thereof with respect to medical assistance \n     furnished under the State plan. . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I argue that that statute, which is the basis of the \nFederal efforts to recoup, is inapplicable to the tobacco litigation. \nWhat that statute was intended to do was, in the case where a State \nhad, for instance, overpaid a provider and subsequently received a \nrepayment, that a portion of that repayment that was related to the \npercentage of the Federal Medicaid share under the State Medicaid plan \nwould go back to the Federal Government.\n  This was not recovered pursuant to any State health care plan. It was \nrecovered based on litigation brought by the States on a variety of \nclaims against the Federal Government. And that is the first of two \nfundamental erroneous assumptions behind this amendment. And that first \nassumption is that 100 percent of the collections that the States have \nmade were as a result of the Medicaid claims; and, therefore, that the \nFederal Government can legitimately assume the right to control its \nshare or 50 percent of those funds. That assumption is just \nfundamentally incorrect.\n\n  First, Florida's causes of action included a violation of the State's \nRICO statute, the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations \nstatute. Fourteen other States filed a similar RICO claim. Remedies \navailable to the States under RICO statutes are enormous: disgorgement \nof profits and treble damages. I argue that these claims far exceed any \nmoney damages available under the Medicaid claim.\n  Twenty-eight States filed claims under violations of consumer \nprotection laws. Remedies include significant monetary penalties per \nviolation--per sale of each pack of cigarettes--plus disgorgement of \nprofits. For instance, the Missouri remedy allows for a penalty of \n$1,000 per pack of cigarettes sold. The Oregon remedy was up to $25,000 \nper violation, which could have potentially totaled billions of \ndollars.\n  Thirteen States filed under public nuisance. In Iowa, the remedy \nrequested was equal to not the profits made through cigarette sales, \nbut the price of cigarettes sold in each year involved.\n\n[[Page S2888]]\n\n  Twenty States filed antitrust claims. Available remedies again \ninclude disgorgement of profits and treble damages.\n  In three States, the courts dismissed the Medicaid claims--Indiana, \nIowa, and West Virginia. So those States' claims could not have \nincluded a Medicaid component because it had been rejected by the \ncourts prior to the settlement.\n  Further, the State of Florida, which did have a Medicaid claim among \nall of its other claims, estimates that at most only 10 percent of its \nentire settlement could have been attributed to Medicaid.\n  I ask the Senator from Texas if I can have an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Does the Senator from Texas \nyield an additional 5 minutes?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am happy to yield an additional 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Florida. If he can take any less than that, we have other \nMembers signed up for the time. Thank you.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So Mr. President, the first assumption that all this \nmoney was generated by Medicaid claims is fundamentally inaccurate.\n  The second assumption, which is that unless Washington acts the \nStates will fritter this money away, is a fundamental assault against \nthe principles of Federalism: That we are a Nation in which political \npower is divided between the States and the Federal Government, and \nthat we have a respectful appreciation of the responsibility of our \nState partners.\n  In the case of the State of Florida, through the use of the initial \ntobacco settlement money, 250,000 children who previously did not have \nfinancing for health care now have that financing. That was proposed by \nformer Governor Lawton Chiles. Current Governor Jeb Bush has suggested \nthe establishment of an endowment so that these funds would be \nprotected in perpetuity and the interest earnings from that endowment \nwould be used for a variety of children's and seniors' programs. That \nnot only indicates the care with which the States are using, but the \nfact that it is a bipartisan issue, the appropriate use of these funds.\n\n  Let us face it, those State officials, those Governors, those State \nlegislators are just as much accountable to the voters as we are. And \nshould they act in a way that the voters consider to be inappropriate, \nthey will suffer the consequences of those actions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Let me complete my final comments, and then I will yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. OK.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, what we have at stake here is that the \nFederal Government is dealing with the wrong issue at the wrong time. \nIt is time for the Federal Government to move on. The way in which the \nFederal Government should move on is by pursuing its own litigation \nagainst the tobacco industry rather than trying to steal a portion of \nthe State settlement.\n  I was, therefore, very pleased that the President, in his State of \nthe Union Message, indicated that it was the intention of the Federal \nGovernment to pursue precisely such a course of action.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, that for those of us, like Senator Harkin \nand others, who joined last year in an effort to craft a bipartisan \ntobacco bill, we recognize that the most significant way in which we \nwill reduce teenage smoking is to increase the price of cigarettes. \nEvery other technique to reduce teenage smoking pales in comparison \nwith increasing the price. The Centers for Disease Control has \nestimated that for every 10-percent increase in the price of \ncigarettes, there will be a 7-percent reduction in smoking by \nteenagers.\n  The Federal Government's potential claims against the tobacco \nindustry are much greater than the States. The Medicare Program is much \nlarger than Medicaid. The Federal Government has all the array of \nantitrust and RICO claims which the States so successfully pursued.\n  What we need to be encouraging the administration to do is to \naggressively carry out the direction of the President to effectively \nbring action against the tobacco industry. And those will be the funds \nthat will be 100 percent under the control of the Federal Government \nfor the purposes that it considers most appropriate.\n  My own feeling is that we ought to use a substantial share of those \nFederally derived funds from successful litigation against the tobacco \nindustry to add to the solvency of the Medicare trust fund, and then to \nuse a portion of those to assist in financing what the American people \ndesperately want, which is a prescription drug benefit, a major share \nof which will go to dealing with the illnesses generated by tobacco \nuse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership that the \nSenator from Texas has provided. I appreciate her generosity and time. \nI urge the defeat of this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this amendment \noffered to earmark a portion of the tobacco settlement proceeds for \nhealth and anti-smoking programs. The use of the money for these \npurposes goes to the very heart of my support for the global settlement \na year ago and my reason for sponsoring a bill to implement the \nsettlement.\n  It was never my intention or understanding that this money would be \nused for building roads, prisons, or to simply inflate the government's \ncoffers. It was my understanding and intent that the money would be \nused primarily to fight the evils of the tobacco industry and to keep \n3,000 kids a day from starting to smoke.\n  I am also a strong proponent of states' rights. In considering this \namendment, it is my understanding that no federal approvals are \nrequired, but only that reports be filed demonstrating that the funds \nare being used in programs designed to achieve the public health goals \nof the litigation. This information is important for Congress and the \nAdministration to have so that we can continue to evaluate the need for \nfederal legislation addressing any issues not covered by the settlement \nagreement. If the states are successful in achieving what the \nlitigation and settlement set out to achieve, then there will be no \nneed for additional action. If not, we can revisit the issues.\n  I do not perceive this amendment as requiring federal approval of all \nstate spending or programs, but as an informational requirement. I am \ncertainly open to further discussion on how to best ensure that the \nmoney is being spent as intended, to keep kids from smoking.\n  I hope that we will continue the dialogue on this very important \nissue and that we can reach consensus on how to ensure that the \nsettlement funds are used to protect kids, if not today, then as the \nbill progresses to the House and conference.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am very concerned about a number of \nprovisions in the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  First, I strongly oppose the offsets included in this bill, which \nwill take money away from programs that help the most vulnerable \nAmericans.\n  Before I discuss the specific offsets, let me begin with a reminder--\nemergency supplemental funds do not need to be offset. This is the law \nand it is grounded in the understanding that Congress needs to act \nexpediently when disaster strikes. Emergencies are just that, \nemergencies, and they require swift action and the ability to release \nfunds quickly. We do not need offsets to provide essential assistance \nto Central America, our farmers, or U.S. steel workers.\n  Nevertheless, a series of offsets have been proposed that will hurt \nthe most vulnerable Americans, low-income children and families and \nimmigrants. Included in their offset package, are proposals to defer \n$350 million in Temporary Assistance to Needy Funds (TANF), a $285 \nmillion cut in the Food Stamp Program, and a $25 million recision in \nINS programming which will reduce INS' ability to provide immigration \nbenefits and services. A $40 million cut in INS border enforcement is \nalso being proposed.\n  Taking from one poor, vulnerable community to pay for the needs of \nanother is unacceptable. We must draw the line here to prevent the \nraiding programs that help poor children and families.\n  In 1996, when the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation Act (PRWORA) was passed, Congress gave states the \nauthority and flexibility to design their own unique\n\n[[Page S2889]]\n\nprograms to help low-income families move from welfare-to-work. The \nTANF program provides fixed block grants to the states totaling \napproximately $16.5 billion annually. TANF is a new program that \nsupports a wide array of services. States are using their funds to \nassist needy families, strengthen job preparation, and promote self-\nsufficiency. Across the country, states and social service agencies are \ndeveloping and implementing the best strategies to move their clients \nfrom welfare to self-sufficiency.\n  In addition to giving states the authority to develop their own \nassistance programs for low-income families, Congress also gave them \nthe power to carry forward unobligated TANF funds for future use. \nStates were expressly given the ability to tap into unspent funds at \nany point during the five-year block grant period, to optimize \nflexibility and meet their own unique needs and circumstances. In FY98, \nstates obligated or spent 84% of the total federal funds received. \nNineteen states have obligated 100% of their FY98 TANF funds.\n  The Republican Leadership seems to have confused ``unobligated'' with \n``unneeded.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. There are a \nvariety of reasons why some states have unobligated funds. Many states \nhave specifically set aside part of their funds in a ``rainy day'' \naccount. This reflects wise planning. The strong economy and low \nunemployment rates which we are currently enjoying may not last \nforever. These states will be prepared because they have set aside \nsufficient funds to protect themselves if the economy turns downward.\n  Other states have experienced large caseload declines but require \nfurther state legislative action to reprogram funds from cash \nassistance to other investments, such as child care and job training, \nwhich promote work and end dependency. Other states have proceeded \nslowly because they chose to engage in careful planning and needs \nassessment research before embarking on innovative new efforts to move \npeople from welfare to work. Now, they are ready to utilize their \nfunds, and now the feds are trying to take back these funds.\n\n  Let me also point out that unobligated funds are not surplus funds. \nThese funds are essential to the overall success of welfare reform. \nMany of the families remaining on welfare face substantial barriers to \nemployment including lack of educational and workforce skills, \nsubstance abuse, domestic violence, and disability. States anticipate \nthat greater investments will be required if families are going to \nsuccessfully transition from welfare-to-work. As an increasing number \nof families with infants and young children move into the work force, \nthe need and competition for child care, particularly during evening \nhours, will continue to expand. Without assistance, many states will \nnot be able to provide needed services to low-income families.\n  Now, just a few years after dramatically overhauling the welfare \nsystem, the Republican Leadership wants to take $350 million in \nunobligated TANF funds to offset some of the expenses incurred by the \nEmergency Supplemental Act. This is unacceptable. Congress told states \nto spend their money carefully, to engage in thoughtful long-term \nplanning, and that they could keep their unobligated funds, and here we \nare two years later, changing the rules of the game.\n  The Republican Leadership also wants to take $252 million from the \nFood Stamp Program base appropriations level. Senate appropriators \ncontend that these funds would otherwise be unspent. Once again, the \nRepublicans are taking a short-sighted approach. First, assuming these \nfunds are unspent, they are not unneeded. The current base \nappropriations level provides an important cushion to meet \nunanticipated need. Second, recently released statistics on hunger and \nundernutrition suggest that we need to reinvest in food assistance \nprogramming. Hunger is still an urgent problem. The recent decline in \nfood stamp use from 28 million to under 19 million does not mean that \nhunger is no longer a significant concern. Just a few weeks ago the \nUrban Institute reported that one-third of America's children are in \nfamilies grappling with hunger and food insecurity.\n  We cannot let this happen. We cannot take any more money from \nprograms that help children and needy families. Furthermore, Congress \nmust uphold its commitment to the states--federal money pledged to the \nstates should not be taken away, especially when emergency funding is \navailable without offsets.\n  Another disturbing aspect of the Supplemental is the inclusion of the \nHutchinson Medicaid Amendment. This issue does not belong in an \nemergency appropriations bill. If approved, the long-term cost to \nMedicaid of this amendment would be approximately $140 billion. No \nserious consideration has been given to the enormous impact that could \nhave on national health policy. Instead of being used to deter youth \nsmoking and to improve the nation's health, the language in the \nCommittee bill would permit states to use these federal Medicaid \ndollars to pave roads, to build prisons and stadiums, and to fund state \ntax cuts. Those are not appropriate uses for Medicaid dollars. Congress \nhas a vital interest in how those federal dollars are used.\n\n  Fifty-seven cents of every Medicaid dollar spent by the states comes \nfrom the federal government. The cost of Medicaid expenditures to treat \npeople suffering from smoking-induced disease was at the core of state \nlawsuits against the tobacco industry. While the federal government \ncould legally demand that the states reimburse Washington from their \nsettlements, I believe the states should be allowed to keep one hundred \npercent of the money. However, the federal share must be used by the \nstates for programs that will advance the goals of protecting children \nand enhancing public health which were at the heart of the litigation \nand are consistent with the purposes of Medicaid. That would be an \neminently fair and reasonable compromise of this contentious issue.\n  While there were a variety of claims made by the states against the \ntobacco industry, the Medicaid dollars used to treat tobacco-related \nillness constituted by far the largest claim monetarily, and it formed \nthe basis for the national settlement. As part of that settlement, \nevery state released the tobacco companies from federal Medicaid \nliability, as well as state Medicaid liability. Medicaid expenditures \nheavily influenced the distribution formula used to divide the national \nsettlement amongst the states. In light of these undeniable facts, the \ndollars obtained by the states from their settlements cannot now be \ndivorced from Medicaid. States are free to use the state share of their \nrecoveries in any way they choose. However, Congress has a clear and \ncompelling interest in how the federal share will be used.\n  States should be required to use half of the amount of money they \nreceive from the tobacco industry each year (the federal share) to \nprotect children and improve public health. At least thirty-five \npercent of the federal share would be spent on programs to deter youth \nsmoking and to help smokers overcome their addiction. This would \ninclude a broad range of tobacco control initiatives, including school \nand community based tobacco use prevention programs, counter-\nadvertising to discourage smoking, cessation programs, and enforcement \nof the ban on sale to minors. Three thousand children start smoking \nevery day, and one thousand of them will die prematurely as a result of \ntobacco-induced disease. Prevention of youth smoking should be, without \nquestion, our highest priority for the use of these funds. Reducing \nyouth smoking would, of course, result in a dramatic savings in future \nMedicaid expenditures. The state settlements provide the resources to \ndissuade millions of teenagers from smoking, to break the cycle of \naddiction and early death. We must seize that opportunity.\n  The remainder of the federal share should be used by states to fund \nhealth care and early learning initiatives which they select. States \ncould either use the additional resources to supplement existing \nprograms in these areas, or to fund creative new state initiatives to \nimprove public health and promote child development.\n  Smoking has long been America's foremost preventable cause of disease \nand early death. It has consumed an enormous amount of the nation's \nhealth care resources. Finally, resources taken from the tobacco \ncompanies would be used to improve the nation's health. A state could, \nfor example, use a portion of this money to help\n\n[[Page S2890]]\n\nsenior citizens pay for prescription drugs, or to provide expanded \nhealth care services to the uninsured. Funds could be used to support \ncommunity health centers, to reduce public health risks, or to make \nhealth insurance more affordable.\n\n  For years, the tobacco companies callously targeted children as \nfuture smokers. The financial success of the entire industry was based \nupon addicting kids when they were too young to appreciate the health \nrisks of smoking. It is particularly appropriate that resources taken \nfrom this malignant industry be used to give our children a better \nstart in life. States could use a portion of these funds to improve \nearly learning opportunities for young children, or to expand child \ncare services, or for other child development initiatives.\n  Congress has an overwhelming interest in how the federal share of \nthese dollars is used. They are Medicaid dollars. They should not be \nused for road repair or building maintenance. They should be used by \nthe states to create a healthier future for all our citizens, and \nparticularly for our children.\n  These problems with the supplemental need to be fixed. Congress \nshouldn't let emergency assistance get bogged down by these extraneous \nprovisions. A clean supplemental should be approved as quickly as \npossible so that this aid can go out quickly to those in greatest need.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition to \nthe amendment offered by Senators Specter and Harkin that is based on a \n``Washington Knows Best'' policy. Under this amendment, every \nGovernor--each year--for the next 25 years would be required to submit \na plan to Washington asking for permission on how to spend fifty \npercent of the state's own money. I'm voting ``no'' to this \n``Washington Knows Best'' amendment.\n  My state of Iowa stands ready to receive $1.7 billion over the next \n25 years for its share of this landmark settlement. Iowa began a \nthoughtful process years ago to establish a framework to guide the \nstate on how to utilize these new resources should the state succeed \nwith its case against the tobacco industry. Two years ago, after much \nstate and local deliberation, the Iowa Legislature passed laws \nestablishing a governing framework. Now that success has come for Iowa, \nit is prepared. Among top priorities for the use of these new funds are \nincreased medical assistance and programs to reduce teen smoking. \nFurthermore, Iowa's Governor Vilsack enthusiastically advocates a \nnumber of new initiatives for combating teen smoking, including an \ninitiative to spend $17.7 million of its settlement money on tobacco \nprevention and control programs. I am confident in the leadership of \nour Governor and State Legislature in deciding how to best spend its \nresources for the well-being of Iowans.\n  The states are entitled to the full amount of their settlement. Years \nago, the states began to organize their case against the tobacco \nindustry. They sought assistance from the federal government in their \nefforts, but received none. The states took on all the risk, and \ninvested all of the time, money and energy. They have been rewarded for \ntheir commitment to the case with a landmark settlement. It is unfair \nfor Congress, at this very late stage, to dip into the state's multi-\nbillion dollar settlement. What's more, last year Congress made \nattempts at a federal settlement but failed. Congress is in no position \nto interfere with what the states have independently accomplished.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of Senator Hutchinson's bill \nto protect the states' claims on the funds from the settlement that \nthey negotiated with the tobacco industry, I oppose the Harkin-Specter \namendment.\n  I am not a lawyer, and maybe that's why I'm not particularly \nimpressed by all the legal hairsplitting we've been hearing from the \ngovernment's lawyers about their claim to these funds. But you don't \nhave to be a lawyer to recognize unfairness when you see it.\n  In fact, I think my little granddaughter would recognize the story \nthat's unfolding in Washington today: it's called the ``Little Red \nHen.'' As my colleagues probably will recall, this story is about some \npeople doing all the work and other people, who didn't lift a finger to \nhelp, wanting to share in the product of that work.\n  In this case, we have the states who initiated lawsuits against the \ntobacco industry, who took all the risks, who received no assistance \nfrom the federal government in making their claims, and who ultimately \nsucceeded in negotiating the historic Master Settlement Agreement last \nNovember. Now that the work has been done by these 46 little red hens, \nand the other four who negotiated individual settlements, the federal \ngovernment wants to sweep in and take over.\n  Mr. President, I do not think what we have here is an attempt to \nassert legal rights, but an attempt to assert control. Quite simple, \nthe federal government wants to direct the spending of these funds by \nthe states, despite the fact that this effort is likely to provoke more \nlitigation, which in turn will only prevent the funds from being used \nto benefit the health or welfare of any state's residents. I do not \nthink the federal government has the law on its side, and I know it \ndoesn't have the equities or even common sense on its side.\n  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from Idaho Attorney General Al Lance, objecting to the \nattempted money grab.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                      Boise, ID, January 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Larry Craig,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Re: Idaho tobacco settlement monies.\n       Dear Senator Craig: You are no doubt aware that Idaho \n     settled its lawsuit against the tobacco defendants. Under the \n     settlement agreement, Idaho is set to receive annual payments \n     totaling $711 million over the first 25 years of the \n     settlement. Now that the settlement is complete, it is my \n     understanding that the Clinton Administration intends to lay \n     claim on a significant portion of settlement monies for its \n     own use. This is wrong. I ask that you help Idaho protect \n     itself from this money grab by supporting appropriate federal \n     legislation.\n       Idaho was one of 40 states that filed suit against various \n     tobacco defendants, alleging violations of various state \n     statutes. In Idaho's complaint we sought reparation for \n     damages incurred by the State, as well as civil penalties, \n     costs, and fees as a result of the defendants' actions. We \n     alleged as damages the increased Medicaid costs attributable \n     to tobacco use, which Idaho has spent, as well as the \n     increased insurance premiums attributable to smoking that the \n     State has paid for its state employees. We sought civil \n     penalties under our consumer protection laws.\n       Section 1903(d) of the Social Security Act provides that a \n     State must allocate from the amount of any Medicaid-related \n     recovery ``the pro-rata share to which the United States is \n     equitably entitled.'' Relying upon this statute, it is our \n     understanding that the Health Care Financing Administration \n     will be taking the position that Idaho's settlement payments \n     represent a credit applicable to Idaho's Medicaid program, \n     regardless of whether the monies are received directly by the \n     State's Medicaid program. This should not be so.\n       It is not equitable for the federal government to take the \n     fruits of the states' efforts. This is particularly true in \n     this case. Idaho filed its suit, took significant risks, and \n     fought for significant changes in how the tobacco industry \n     will market its products. What did the Clinton Administration \n     do in this regard with the federal government's vast \n     resources? Nothing.\n       I have great confidence that Idaho's Legislature will \n     properly determine how Idaho's tobacco proceeds should be \n     spent. I am sure you share that trust as well. That will not \n     happen, however, if the federal government is allowed to take \n     that money and spend it as it pleases. I ask for your \n     assistance in making sure that does not happen.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Alan G. Lance,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I wholeheartedly agree with Attorney General Lance's \nconfidence that the Idaho state legislature is quite capable of \nproperly determining how Idaho's share of the tobacco settlement should \nbe spent.\n  It is my strong hope that the Senate will defeat this amendment and \nallow my state's legislature, and those of the other 49 states, to make \nthese decisions without interference.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we have a difficult decision before us. I \nbelieve most, if not all of us, hope the states will do the right thing \nand spend the tobacco litigation money to stop underage smoking, reduce \nadult smoking, and provide critical public health services. I know I am \nunequivocally committed to those objectives and will\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\ntherefore support the Specter-Harkin amendment to ensure they do so.\n  That said, I want the states to have the greatest degree of \nflexibility and discretion in allocating these settlement funds to the \nhealth needs of their residents as possible. This amendment does just \nthat. It broadly requires states to spend 20 percent of the settlement \non programs to reduce the use of tobacco products, including \nenforcement, school education programs, and advertising campaigns. It \nalso requires 30 percent to be spent on public health.\n  If we do not reduce smoking and stop at least some of the 3,000 new \nkids per day from smoking, the federal taxpayer will end up the loser. \nThat is why we should have a voice in directing use of these funds. The \nMedicare Trust Fund is financially solvent only until 2009, so we need \nto do everything possible to reduce overall health care costs. If one \nstate does not reduce the deadly impact of smoking, the federal \ntaxpayers will foot the bill. So, all American taxpayers have a big \nstake in reducing smoking. They have the right to push all states to \nsave their tax dollars by reducing health care costs.\n  Still, the Specter-Harkin amendment targets only a portion of \nsettlement dollars; just that portion that could be attributed to the \nfederal share of Medicaid. Because Medicaid is a federal-state \npartnership and the settlement includes claims arising out of this \nprogram, federal taxpayers have a valid claim to make in how those \nsettlement dollars are spent.\n  I am proud of my home state of Washington. It has already made a \ncommitment to public health and smoking reduction. The Specter-Harkin \namendment only reinforces what my state has done. Once again Washington \nstate is a leader on protecting public health and saving the premature \ndeath of five million of today's children. I have attached a letter I \nreceived from the Western Pacific Division of the American Cancer \nSociety urging me to support this amendment for these very reasons, to \nsupport the ``health of our kids and our families.''\n  I also continue to support Senator Hutchinson's work to ensure the \nstates receive the credit they deserve. They have scored a major \nvictory for public health. The success of the Attorney's General in \ntheir settlement with the tobacco companies is unprecedented. I applaud \nthem and especially Washington's Attorney General, Chris Gregoire, who \nhas been a champion in this cause.\n  The federal government must not rely on the states to do all of its \nwork for them. It is the responsibility of the federal government to \nrecover Medicaid funds and I will urge the Administration to move \nforward with necessary litigation. The federal government must seek \nrestitution from the tobacco companies for the years of lies and \ndeception that have resulted in the premature deaths of millions of \nAmericans. Smoking-related illnesses are still the number-one killer of \nAmericans.\n  I am pleased Senators Specter and Harkin could find the appropriate \nbalance between the rights of the states to enjoy their well-deserved \nsettlement funds and the rights of federal taxpayers to ensure those \nfunds are spent to protect the public health and reduce their future \ntax obligations under Medicare and Medicaid by reducing the cost of \ntobacco-related illnesses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Parliamentary inquiry. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry. How much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes 11 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Does the Senator from Iowa wish to go at this time? \nBecause if not, Senator Voinovich was next in line for our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is controlled by the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as a former Governor, I introduced my \nown tobacco recoupment legislation. I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of Senator Hutchison's and Senator Graham's bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Under this settlement, the tobacco companies agreed to pay 46 States, \nincluding Ohio, $206 billion over 25 years. Four other States \npreviously won a $40 billion settlement. Ohio was slated to receive \n$9.8 billion over 25 years, beginning with $400 million in 2000 and \n2001.\n  I just want you to know that the Nation's Governors are adamantly \nopposed to imposing restrictions on State funding. I have distributed a \nletter from the chairman and vice chairman of the National Governors' \nAssociation. It will be on the desk of all of the Senators expressing \ntheir adamant opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              National Governors' Association,\n\n                                                   March 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader and Senator Daschle: As the Senate \n     moves forward with consideration of the Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations bill, we write to inform you of \n     the nation's Governors' strong support for language now \n     included in the bill that would protect state tobacco \n     settlement funds. In addition, we are adamantly opposed to \n     any amendments that would restrict how states spend their \n     tobacco settlement money. The settlement funds rightfully \n     belong to the states, and states must be given the \n     flexibility to tailor the spending of the tobacco funds to \n     the needs of their citizens.\n       There is a proposal under consideration, the Harkin/Specter \n     amendment, to require states to earmark 20 percent of the \n     settlement funds for smoking cessation programs, and an \n     additional 30 percent for health care programs. Governors are \n     adamantly opposed to any restrictions on the tobacco \n     settlement funds, but even more so to this proposal, because \n     it obligates state tobacco settlement funds to federal \n     programs or to specific state programs only if approved by \n     the Secretary of HHS.\n       Furthermore, although the nation's Governors agree with the \n     goal of substantially reducing smoking, we are strongly \n     opposed to earmarks on smoking cessation on the basis that it \n     represents unsound public policy. There are already four \n     major initiatives that are going into effect to reduce \n     smoking.\n       1. The price of tobacco products has already increased \n     between 40 cents and 50 cents per pack. Additional price \n     increases may come over time as companies attempt to hold \n     profit margins and make settlement payments. These price \n     increases will substantially reduce smoking over time.\n       2. The tobacco settlement agreement already contains two \n     major programs funded at $1.7 billion over ten years \n     dedicated to reducing smoking. $250 million over the next ten \n     years will go towards creation of a national charitable \n     foundation that will support the study of programs to reduce \n     teen smoking and substance abuse and the prevention of \n     diseases associated with tobacco use. An additional $1.45 \n     billion over five years will go towards a National Public \n     Education Fund to counter youth tobacco use and educate \n     consumers about tobacco-related diseases. The fund may make \n     grants to states and localities to carry out these purposes.\n       3. The settlement agreement has a significant number of \n     restrictions on advertising and promotion. The settlement \n     prohibits targeting youth in tobacco advertising, including a \n     ban on the use of cartoon or other advertising images that \n     may appeal to children. The settlement also prohibits most \n     outdoor tobacco advertising, tobacco product placement in \n     entertainment or sporting events, and the distribution and \n     sale of apparel and merchandise with tobacco company logos. \n     Further, the settlement places restrictions on industry \n     lobbying against local, state, and federal laws. Over time, \n     these restrictions on tobacco companies' ability to market \n     their products to children and young adults will have a major \n     impact on smoking.\n       4. States are already spending state funds on smoking \n     cessation and will substantially increase funding as the \n     effectiveness of programs becomes established. Many states \n     have already invested years in program design, modification, \n     and evaluation to determine the best ways to prevent youth \n     from taking up cigarette smoking and helping youth and adults \n     quit smoking. Governors and states are highly motivated to \n     implement effective programs. We see the human and economic \n     burdens of tobacco use every day in lost lives, lost wages \n     and worker productivity, and medical expenditures for \n     tobacco-related illnesses.\n       All of these initiatives are likely to substantially reduce \n     tobacco consumption. It would be foolish to require large \n     expenditures over the next 25 years to such programs without \n     a good sense of how these initiatives will reduce the current \n     level of\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\n     smoking. Any additional expenditures for smoking cessation \n     must be carefully coordinated with these other four major \n     policy initiatives as they will cause smoking behavior to \n     shift dramatically. Furthermore, while there have been some \n     studies on the effectiveness of alternative smoking cessation \n     programs, the ``state of the art'' is such that we just do \n     not know what types of programs are effective. States are \n     still in the process of experimentation with effective \n     methods of preventing and controlling tobacco use; there is \n     no conclusive data that proves the efficacy of any particular \n     approach.\n       Governors feel it would be wasteful, even counterproductive \n     to mandate huge spending requirements on programs that may \n     not be effective. Governors need the flexibility to target \n     settlement funds for state programs that are proven to \n     improve the health, welfare, and education of their citizens \n     to ensure that the money is wisely spent. Furthermore, the \n     federal government must maintain its fiscal commitment to \n     vital health and human services programs, and not reduce \n     funding in anticipation of increased state expenditures.\n       We strongly urge you to vote against the Harkin/Specter \n     amendment and support flexibility for states to tailor the \n     spending of the tobacco funds to the needs of their citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gov. Thomas R. Carper,\n                                      Chairman, State of Delaware.\n     Gov. Michael O. Leavitt,\n                                     Vice Chairman, State of Utah.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The proposition is clearly unsupportable, for the \nfollowing reasons:\n  First of all, States filed complaints that included a variety of \nclaims--consumer protection, racketeering, antitrust, disgorgement of \nprofits and civil penalties for isolations of State laws.\n  Medicaid was just one of the many issues in many cases. Furthermore, \nState-by-State allotments were determined by the overall health care \ncosts in each State and not based on Medicaid expenditures--not based \non Medicaid expenditures.\n  Medicaid was not even mentioned in some cases. As a matter of fact, \nin Ohio the Medicaid claim was thrown out of court. The Federal \nGovernment was invited to participate in the lawsuits, but the Federal \nGovernment declined. States bore the risk of initiating the suits and \nthe burden of the unprecedented lawsuits against a well-financed \nindustry. It was not until after the States prevailed that the Federal \nGovernment became interested.\n  The tobacco settlement negotiated between attorneys general and the \ntobacco companies is completely different from the agreement that \nfailed to pass in the 105th Congress.\n  With the failure of that legislation, the States were forced to \nproceed with their own State-only lawsuit and settlement.\n  States must be given the flexibility to tailor their spending to the \nunique needs of their citizens. And States will spend their funding on \na variety of local needs--health, education, welfare, smoking cessation \nprograms.\n  Many Governors, through their state-of-the-State speeches or proposed \nlegislation, have already committed publicly to spending these funds \nfor the health and welfare needs of their citizens.\n  The majority of the Governors have already made commitments to create \ntrust funds and escrow accounts that will ensure that the tobacco \nsettlement funds are spent on health care services for children, \nassistance for growers in the States that will be affected, education, \nand smoking cessation.\n  Two major programs--this is really important--in the settlement are \nalready dedicated to reducing teen smoking and educating the public \nabout tobacco-related diseases. Two hundred and fifty million dollars \nwill create a national charitable foundation to support the study of \nprograms to reduce teen smoking and substance abuse and prevent \ndiseases associated with tobacco use. An additional $1.5 billion will \ncreate a National Public Education Fund to counter youth tobacco use \nand educate consumers about tobacco-related diseases.\n  In addition, the settlement agreement has significant restrictions on \nadvertising and promotion--such as bans on advertising and lobbying \nagainst local, State, and Federal laws--which will have an impact on \nyouth smoking. In other words, the tobacco companies can no longer \nlobby against legislation that will deal with cessation of use of \ntobacco.\n  States are already spending State funds on smoking cessation. They \ndon't need the Federal Government to put a mandate in place. There is \nsimply no way that States can spend 20 percent of these funds on \nsmoking cessation programs. These programs cannot absorb this level of \nfunding. As smoking levels decline, as expected under the settlement, \nit will become impossible for States to spend this level of funding \neffectively.\n  This amendment forces States to spend an incredible--listen to this--\n$49 billion on just one objective: Denying them the ability to use \nthese funds to best meet the needs of their citizens. The notion that \nthe compassion and wisdom of Washington exceeds that of our State \ncapitals is not only wrong, it is offensive. The Governors and the \nlocal government officials in this country care as much about smoking \ncessation as the Members of this Congress.\n  I will never forget during welfare reform the people who were telling \nus that we didn't care as much about people as the people in \nWashington. They said it would be a race to the bottom. The fact of the \nmatter is, it is a race to the top.\n  Mr. President, I think we should overwhelmingly defeat this \namendment. It is not appropriate for this piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 7 minutes 37 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield Senator Brownback up to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the author of this amendment from Texas, as \nwell as our colleague from Florida.\n  The idea that we would tell the States how to spend this money from \nthis litigation is absolutely wrong. It is just wrong on its face. The \npeople who are proposing it, I respect their motivation; they are \ntrying to reach out and save lives and to stop these health problems. I \nthink their motivation is appropriate, but the direction and the \napportionment that is taking place on the States is the wrong way to do \nit.\n  In every State in the country that has been a part of this \nlitigation, there is now ongoing a healthy and vigorous debate about \nhow best to spend the tobacco settlement funds. It is happening in \nKansas, my State. I am being contacted by the Kansas Legislature in \nvery strong terms. ``Do you not think that we care about what happens \nto the people here? Do you not have enough problems in Washington to \ndeal with, that you have to tell us what to do with this? We are the \nones who brought this litigation forward.'' They are quite offended \nthat we would try to direct them and tell them what to do with these \nfunds that they pursued in litigation and that they need. They are \noffended as well because they think we don't believe they know what is \nbest for Kansans.\n\n  I agree with them. I laud my colleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, \nin what she is doing. I note, as well, that in Kansas in the debate and \nin the funding proposal that we have, 50 percent of all the funds to \nKansas are going to children's health care program funds for prevention \nand cessation. We are putting in 50 percent which was enacted in the \nlegislature. But we should not require them to go to HCFA after they \nhave appropriated the money and see if they agree or see if they are \ngoing to have to do something different.\n  With almost unprecedented unanimity, every State Governor, Attorney \nGeneral, and State legislature has directly backed the Hutchison-Graham \nlanguage. In fact, in many cases it is the No. 1 Federal issue for the \n106th Congress by a number of these groups. I applaud my colleague. The \ndebate is happening at the right place now. We should not impose a \n``Washington knows best'' approach.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield up to 4 minutes to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Texas for her outstanding \nleadership on this issue. As has been stated by all the speakers, \nbasically this is an amendment to tell the States how to spend money \nthat they achieve through a settlement with the tobacco industry. Not \nonly money, but a huge amount of money--$40 billion--just on\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\ntobacco use reduction advertising and programs.\n  To contrast that with the advertising budgets of private enterprise \nin this country, ``Advertising Age'' said U.S. companies spend a total \nof $208 billion on advertising all of their products last year. The top \n100 advertisers spent a total of $58 billion last year. In California \nand New York, this would mean $5 billion worth of ads to each of those \nStates; in Pennsylvania, $2.25 billion worth of ads; and in my State, \n$700 million worth of ads.\n  Mr. President, this would be one of the most massive advertising \ncampaigns in the history of the country, probably the most massive in \nthe history of the country--public or private. Because advertising \nrates in my home State are not particularly high, that could translate \ninto over 1,000 days of nonstop TV commercials. That is almost 3 years. \nAnd we think political campaigns go on too long.\n  Contrast this with all Federal Government drug control spending of \n$16 billion. Members get the picture. If the Specter amendment were \napproved, we would have the Federal Government spending more money, by \nfar, attacking a legal product than the Clinton administration \ncurrently spends in its war on drugs. There is $40 billion targeted at \ntobacco use, $16 billion against illegal drug use. It makes a person \nwonder if it would be better to simply pay America's 40 million smokers \n$1,000 apiece to quit. Send them $1,000 checks each, to quit. It would \nbe a lot cheaper than what we have before the Senate.\n\n  As has been stated by other speakers, the National Governors' \nAssociation has strongly committed itself to supporting antitobacco \nprograms in the respective States. The States know better how to spend \nthis money and will do so efficiently through existing State \nmechanisms. If the Federal Government dictates how the States should \nspend the money and the mechanisms are not there, the States will have \nto create them--creating even more bureaucracy.\n  The final outrage is that this amendment requires the elected \nGovernors of the States to report to Secretary Shalala on how they are \ngoing to spend their money. This is truly an egregious effort by the \nFederal Government to dictate to the States how they ought to spend \nmoney that they are entirely entitled to under any system of justice.\n  Let me repeat: This calls for a $40 billion advertising campaign \nagainst a legal product, yet the Federal Government currently spends \nonly $16 billion in its illegal drug enforcement effort.\n  The Hutchison proposal is the correct one. This amendment should be \ndefeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 10 minutes \n11 seconds, and the Senator from Texas has 40 seconds.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry. Rather than just waiting here, whose \ntime is being used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrunning. If neither side is yielding time, time will have to be \ndeducted equally between both sides.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unless the Senator gets unanimous consent, \ntime will be deducted equally.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that my 40 seconds be \nreserved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my chairman and friend from \nPennsylvania for his leadership on this issue.\n  Again, let's cut through all the arguments, all the smoke and the \nhaze, if you will. What is this about? It is about public health. It is \nabout cutting down on youth smoking. That is what it is about.\n  Now, my friend from Florida--with whom I wanted to engage in a \ncolloquy, but I understand he had to go to a committee meeting--pointed \nout that a lot of the States sued on different bases--RICO, \nracketeering, prices--but 32 States, including Florida, included \nMedicaid. As any good lawyer can tell you, it is the old ``spaghetti \ntheory'' of suing. You just throw the spaghetti at the wall, and \nwhatever sticks, that is what you go on. They just threw a bunch of \nstuff in there when they sued to recoup from the tobacco companies.\n\n  But it is interesting to note that, in the final settlement, the \nStates waived their rights in the future to sue to reclaim any moneys \nunder Medicaid. Why was that put in there? I will tell you why. Because \nthe tobacco companies wanted it in there, because it not only precluded \nthe States from suing, it precludes the Federal Government from \nrecouping Federal shares of money for the health costs that we pay out \nin Medicaid to take care of people who are sick and dying of tobacco-\nrelated illnesses. That is what this is all about.\n  Some say we should not mandate to the States how to spend their \nmoney. We are not trying to do that. The basis of this is public \nhealth. At least a portion of the Federal moneys--not even all of it--\nought to go to smoking cessation programs and for a variety of other \npublic health programs.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania knows as well as I do--we sit on the \nAppropriations Committee as chairman and ranking member--we have a lot \nof public health needs out there. We are getting shortchanged. I know \nStates have needs for highways, bridges, sports arenas, prisons and \nthings like that; but I daresay they did not bring these suits against \nthe tobacco companies because the tobacco companies weren't building \nenough highways or sports arenas or prisons or anything else. What they \nbrought it on was the health problems that tobacco companies are \ncausing their people.\n  Well, I might also point out that, in the previous settlement with \nthe Liggett tobacco company, some States did give back their portion of \nthat settlement to the Federal Government, covering the Medicaid \nportions of those costs. I don't have the exact figures, but I believe \nFlorida was one of those States--Florida, Louisiana, and Massachusetts \nwere the three States that returned some of that money. So that is \nreally what this is about.\n  I know the Governors have weighed in on this, both Democrats and \nRepublicans. Well, I can understand their point. They are trying to get \nas much money as they can for their States; that is their \nresponsibility. But it seems to me that we have to look at the national \npicture and what this is all about. It is about health care and cutting \ndown on teen smoking. That is what this is really about.\n  To cut through all the smoke and haze, let us do our responsibility \nto the Federal taxpayers, to the Medicaid Program, and give some \nguidance and direction--not explicitly saying how the States have to \nspend it; let them use their wisdom--but give them guidance and \ndirection and say that at least 20 percent has to be used for smoking \ncessation and 30 percent for a broad variety of other public health \nmeasures, including helping tobacco farmers switch from that crop to \nothers. It is the only decent thing to do.\n  I reserve the time I have. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 4 minutes 31 \nseconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield that back to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since all time has been used, except for \nmaybe 5 minutes--40 seconds for the opponents and 4\\1/2\\ minutes or so \nfor the proponents--I would like to use leader time to state my \nposition on this issue.\n  This morning I happened to be listening to one of the Washington, DC, \nall-news radio stations. There was an ad on there done by the \nLieutenant Governor of Maryland, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, speaking \nabout the importance of tobacco cessation campaigns. Now, I wondered \nwho paid for that, how that was being supported. Why was a Lieutenant \nGovernor--a candidate for Governor--being used in this ad? It relates \nto this whole debate. I think probably the State of Maryland is paying \nfor that campaign, or maybe it is a campaign unrelated to all this. But \nthe point there is that there is already a lot being done, and there is \ngoing to be\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\na lot more done in the smoking cessation campaigns by the States.\n  Mr. President, this is a very fundamental argument. It goes to the \nheart of the broader question: Does the Federal Government have the \ngreat wisdom reposing here in the Secretary of HHS, or do States have a \ncertain modicum of wisdom of their own?\n  Frankly, I trust the Governor of Pennsylvania and the legislature in \nPennsylvania. I trust the Governors of Iowa and Illinois, and the \nlegislature in Ohio, and in my own State, to make the best decision for \nthe people in that State. There are those here who think the Federal \nGovernment has to review this, the Federal Government has the answer, \nthe Federal Government must direct how this money is spent. I don't \nagree with that. That is the fundamental argument here on this issue \nand on a lot of others, as well.\n  First, a little history. How did this all begin? Well, whether you \nagree with it or not, or whether I like it or not, it began in my State \nof Mississippi. An attorney general developed this lawsuit and, to \ntheir credit, they did a fantastic job. The Federal Government wasn't \ninvolved. The Federal Government could not find a way to get involved. \nThey did it. It was Mississippi, Florida, Texas, Washington State, all \nacross the Nation. The States, through their attorneys general and \ntheir lawyers, did the job and they got settlements. They got the \nmoney. They won the issue.\n  Now, the Federal Government shows up and says, oh, by the way, give \nme that. The truth of the matter is, there are many people in this city \nwho think all of that money, or somewhere between 50 and 77 percent of \nthat money, should come to Washington, even though the Federal \nGovernment did nothing to win this settlement. They weren't a positive \nforce. But they have the temerity to show up and say the law requires \nthis or that and they want that money. I want to emphasize again that \nyou are talking about a very substantial portion of that money.\n  Now, I want to submit for the Record--I don't know if there are \nalready in the Record--a letter I received from the National Governors' \nAssociation, signed by Governor Carper of Delaware, a Democrat, and \nMichael Leavitt, the Republican Governor of Utah, addressed to Senator \nDaschle and myself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record, \nalong with a letter I received from Secretary Shalala.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                                   March 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader and Senator Daschle: As the Senate \n     moves forward with consideration of the Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations bill, we write to inform you of \n     the nation's Governors' strong support for language now \n     included in the bill that would protect state tobacco \n     settlement funds. In addition, we are adamantly opposed to \n     any amendments that would restrict how states spend their \n     tobacco settlement money. The settlement funds rightfully \n     belong to the states, and states must be given the \n     flexibility to tailor the spending of the tobacco funds to \n     the needs of their citizens.\n       There is a proposal under consideration, the Harkin/Specter \n     amendment, to require states to earmark 20 percent of the \n     settlement funds for smoking cessation programs, and an \n     additional 30 percent for health care programs. Governors are \n     adamantly opposed to any restrictions on the tobacco \n     settlement funds, but even more so to this proposal, because \n     it obligates state tobacco settlement funds to Federal \n     programs or to specific State programs only if approved by \n     the Secretary of HHS.\n       Furthermore, although the Nation's Governors agree with the \n     goal of substantially reducing smoking, we are strongly \n     opposed to earmarks on smoking cessation of the basis that it \n     represents unsound public policy. There are already four \n     major initiatives that are going into effect to reduce \n     smoking.\n       1. The price of tobacco products has already increased \n     between 40 cents and 50 cents per pack. Additional price \n     increases may come over time as companies attempt to hold \n     profit margins and make settlement payments. These price \n     increases will substantially reduce smoking over time.\n       2. The tobacco settlement agreement already contains two \n     major programs funded at $1.7 billion over ten years \n     dedicated to reducing smoking. $250 million over the next ten \n     years will go towards creation of a national charitable \n     foundation that will support the study of programs to reduce \n     teen smoking and substance abuse and the prevention of \n     diseases associated with tobacco use. An additional $1.45 \n     billion over five years will go towards a National Public \n     Education Fund to counter youth tobacco use and educate \n     consumers about tobacco-related diseases. The fund may make \n     grants to states and localities to carry out these purposes.\n       3. The settlement agreement has a significant number of \n     restrictions on advertising and promotion. The settlement \n     prohibits targeting youth in tobacco advertising, including a \n     ban on the use of cartoon or other advertising images that \n     may appeal to children. The settlement also prohibits most \n     outdoor tobacco advertising, tobacco product placement in \n     entertainment or sporting events, and the distribution and \n     sale of apparel and merchandise with tobacco company logos. \n     Further, the settlement places restrictions on industry \n     lobbying against local, state, and federal laws. Over time, \n     these restrictions on tobacco companies' ability to market \n     their products to children and young adults will have a major \n     impact on smoking.\n       4. States are already spending state funds on smoking \n     cessation and will substantially increase funding as the \n     effectiveness of programs becomes established. Many states \n     have already invested years in program design, modification, \n     and evaluation to determine the best ways to prevent youth \n     from taking up cigarette smoking and helping youth and adults \n     quit smoking. Governors and states are highly motivated to \n     implement effective programs. We see the human and economic \n     burdens of tobacco use every day in lost lives, lost wages \n     and worker productivity, and medical expenditures for \n     tobacco-related illnesses.\n       All of these initiatives are likely to substantially reduce \n     tobacco consumption. It would be foolish to require large \n     expenditures over the next 25 years to such programs without \n     a good sense of how these initiatives will reduce the current \n     level of smoking. Any additional expenditures for smoking \n     cessation must be carefully coordinated with these other four \n     major policy initiatives as they will cause smoking behavior \n     to shift dramatically. Furthermore, while there have been \n     some studies on the effectiveness of alternative smoking \n     cessation programs, the ``state of the art'' is such that we \n     just do not know what types of programs are effective. States \n     are still in the process of experimentation with effective \n     methods of preventing and controlling tobacco use; there is \n     no conclusive data that proves the efficacy of any particular \n     approach.\n       Governors feel it would be wasteful, even counterproductive \n     to mandate huge spending requirements on programs that may \n     not be effective. Governors need the flexibility to target \n     settlement funds for state programs that are proven to \n     improve the health, welfare, and education of their citizens \n     to ensure that the money is wisely spent. Furthermore, the \n     federal government must maintain its fiscal commitments to \n     vital health and human services programs, and not reduce \n     funding in anticipation of increased state expenditures.\n       We strongly urge you to vote against the Harkin/Specter \n     amendment and support flexibility for states to tailor the \n     spending of the tobacco funds to the needs of their citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gov. Thomas R. Carper,\n                                      Chairman, State of Delaware.\n     Gov. Michael O. Leavitt,\n     Vice Chairman, State of Utah.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                   March 15, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: I am writing to express the \n     Administration's strong opposition to the provision approved \n     by the Senate Appropriations Committee as part of the FY 1999 \n     supplemental appropriations bill that would prohibit the \n     Federal Government from recouping its share of Medicaid funds \n     included in the states' recent settlement with the tobacco \n     companies. The Administration is eager to work with the \n     Congress and the states on an alternative approach that \n     ensures that these funds are used to reduce youth smoking and \n     for other shared state and national priorities.\n       Under the amendment approved by the committee, states would \n     not have to spend a single penny of tobacco settlement funds \n     to reduce youth smoking. The amendment also would have the \n     practical effect of foreclosing any effort by the Federal \n     Government to recoup tobacco-related Medicaid expenditures in \n     the future, without any significant review and scrutiny of \n     this important matter by the appropriate congressional \n     authorizing committees.\n\n[[Page S2895]]\n\n       Section 1903(d) of the Social Security Act specifically \n     requires that the States reimburse the Federal Government for \n     its pro-rata share of Medicaid-related expenses that are \n     recovered from liability cases involving third parties. The \n     Federal share of Medicaid expenses ranges from 50 percent to \n     77 percent, depending on the State. States routinely report \n     third-party liability recoveries as required by law. In 1998, \n     for example, states recovered some $642 million from third-\n     party claims; the Federal share of these recoveries was $400 \n     million. Over the last five years, Federal taxpayers recouped \n     over $1.5 billion from such third-party recoveries.\n       Despite recent arguments by those who would cede the \n     Federal share, there is considerable evidence that the State \n     suits and their recoveries were very much based in Medicaid. \n     In fact, in 1997, the States of Florida, Louisiana and \n     Massachusetts reported the settlement with the Liggett \n     Corporation as a third-party Medicaid recovery, and a portion \n     of that settlement was recouped as the Federal share.\n       Some also have argued that the States are entitled to reap \n     all the rewards of their litigation against the tobacco \n     industry and that the Federal Government can always sue in \n     the future to recover its share of Medicaid claims. This \n     argument contradicts the law and the terms of the recent \n     State settlement. As a matter of law, the Federal Government \n     is not permitted to act as a plaintiff in Medicaid recoupment \n     cases and was bound by the law to await the States' recovery \n     of both the State and Federal shares of Medicaid claims. \n     Further, by releasing the tobacco companies from all relevant \n     claims that can be made against them subsequently by the \n     States, the settlement effectively precludes the Federal \n     Government from recovering its share of Medicaid claims in \n     the future through the established statutory mechanism. The \n     amendment included in the Senate supplemental appropriations \n     bill will foreclose the one opportunity we have under current \n     law to recover a portion of the billions of dollars that \n     Federal taxpayers have paid to treat tobacco-related illness \n     through the Medicaid program.\n       The President has made very clear the Administration's \n     desire to work with Congress and the States to enact \n     legislation that resolves the Federal claim in exchange for a \n     commitment by the States to use that portion of the \n     settlement for shared priorities which reduce youth smoking, \n     protect tobacco farmers, assist children and promote public \n     health. I would urge you to oppose efforts to relinquish the \n     legitimate Federal claim to settlement funds until this \n     important goal has been achieved.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Donna E. Shalala,\n\n                                           Secretary of Health and\n                                                   Human Services.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. The Governors say:\n\n       . . . we are adamantly opposed to any amendments that would \n     restrict how States spend their tobacco settlement money.\n\n  They point out that 20 percent of the settlement funds, under this \namendment, would have to go for smoking cessation, and then another 30 \npercent for health care programs. But also what the States do has to be \napproved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Why? What do \nthey have at HHS that the various States don't have, and why can't they \ndecide on their own what is best for their people?\n  They say in their letter they are opposed to earmarks on smoking \ncessation on the basis that it represents unsound public policy.\n  They then go on to say that there are many things already being done. \nIn fact, the settlement agreement contains two major programs funded at \n$1.7 billion over 10 years dedicated to reducing smoking, and $250 \nmillion over the next 10 years will go toward the creation of a \nnational charitable foundation that will support the study of programs \nto reduce teen smoking. An additional $1.45 billion over 5 years will \ngo toward the National Public Education Fund to counter youth tobacco \nuse and educate consumers about tobacco-related diseases.\n  So there is a great deal already being done. There is a significant \nnumber of restrictions in the settlement with regard to advertising and \npromotion of smoking. The States are already, on their own, spending \nfunds for the smoking cessation campaign.\n  The Governors need flexibility. That is what they say. In one State, \nperhaps, they need more money for smoking cessation. Fine. Perhaps they \nneed more money for child health care. I think under this amendment \nthat would be fine. But in another State perhaps they need it for HOPE \nscholarships, like Governor Engler in Michigan has been talking about. \nOr perhaps in another State, like my own, they want to use these funds \nfor juvenile detention facilities, which, by the way, would be smoke-\nfree. But there is a real need there. Let the States make those \ndecisions.\n  Again, I want to point out that in the letter from Secretary Shalala \nshe notes that the Federal share of Medicaid expenses ranges from 50 to \n77 percent. And they don't want anything to happen here that would not \nallow them to come back around later and try to get more, or large, \nchunks of this money.\n\n  I think that is typical Federal Government arrogance: ``We have the \nsolutions. We have the greater knowledge.'' I fundamentally reject \nthat. I think the people closer to the problems are closer to the \npeople, whether it is the farmers, or the children, or health care \nneeds of the children in their States. I represent one of the poorest \nStates in the Nation. We have tremendous needs for our children based \non problems of poverty. We have needs across the board. We know what \nthose needs are better than some all-powerful Federal Government.\n  So I just want to urge that this amendment be defeated.\n  I don't think, by the way, that every year for the next 25 years the \nStates should have to submit their plan to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. Maybe the next Department will be headed by a \nRepublican-appointed Secretary of HHS. ``Frankly, I don't care, my \ndear.'' I think the States can do this on their own. The Federal \nGovernment wants the money. Or, if they don't get the money, they want \nto control it.\n  That is one of the reasons I am glad to serve in the Senate today--so \nI can fight just such ideas as this, that the Federal Government has \nthe answers and should have the control. We should reject this \namendment and allow the States to do what is best for their people. \nThey know what the needs are. They will provide the right decision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, Senator Kennedy has been tied up in \ncommittee. He has requested 1 minute. I am anxious to see how the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts will handle the single minute. \nI yield 1 minute to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator, and the Chair.\n  Mr. President, let me just add my voice in support of the Specter-\nHarkin amendment. Basically, as we all know, the States have waived the \nFederal Medicaid rights. So they understand that there are Federal \ninterests. I think it is pretty understandable to all of us, because we \nunderstand how the Medicaid Program was established.\n  The really compelling interest that was successful in the States that \nbrought about the settlement in the first place related to the health \nhazards that individuals were afflicted with. This seems to me to be an \neminently fair and reasonable balance between the Federal interests and \nthe State interests. It seems to be focused in the areas of health \ncare, and also the prevention of smoking. I think that is basically \nwhat the families of this country want. It makes a good deal of common \nsense. It is consistent with what this whole battle has been about, and \nthis is a well targeted, well thought out, and a very compelling \namendment to be able to do so.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects of the Supplemental is the \ninclusion of the Hutchinson Medicaid Amendment. This issue does not \nbelong in an emergency appropriations bill. If approved, the long-term \ncost to Medicaid of this amendment could be as high as $125 billion. No \nserious consideration has been given to the enormous impact that cost \ncould have on national health policy. Instead of being used to deter \nyouth smoking and to improve the nation's health, the language in the \ncommittee bill would permit states to use these federal Medicaid \ndollars to pave roads, to build prisons and stadiums, and to fund state \ntax cuts. Those are not appropriate uses for Medicaid dollars. Congress \nhas a vital interest in how these federal dollars are used.\n  Fifty-seven cents of every Medicaid dollar spent by the states comes \nfrom the federal government. The cost of Medicaid expenditures to treat \npeople suffering from smoking-induced disease was at the core of state \nlawsuits against the tobacco industry. While the\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\nfederal government could legally demand that the states reimburse \nWashington from their settlements, I believe the states should be \nallowed to keep one hundred percent of the money. However, the federal \nshare must be used by the states for programs that will advance the \ngoals of protecting children and enhancing public health which were at \nthe heart of the litigation and are consistent with the purposes of \nMedicaid. That is what the Specter-Harkin amendment would accomplish. I \nam pleased to be an original cosponsor of it. It is a fair and \nreasonable compromise of this contentious issue.\n  While there were a variety of claims made by the states against the \ntobacco industry, the Medicaid dollars used to treat tobacco-related \nillness constituted by far the largest claim monetarily, and it formed \nthe basis for the national settlement. As part of that settlement, \nevery state released the tobacco companies from federal Medicaid \nliability, as well as state Medicaid liability. Medicaid expenditures \nheavily influenced the distribution formula used to divide the national \nsettlement amongst the states. In light of these undeniable facts, the \ndollars obtained by the states from their settlements cannot now be \ndivorced from Medicaid. States are free to use the state share of their \nrecoveries in any way they choose. However, Congress has a clear and \ncompelling interest in how the federal share will be used.\n  In exchange for a waiver of the federal claim, states should be \nrequired to use half of the amount of money they receive from the \ntobacco industry each year to protect children from tobacco and improve \nthe nation's health. If the funds are used in that way, this investment \nwill dramatically reduce future Medicaid expenditures.\n  Under the Specter amendment, at least twenty percent of a state's \nrecovery would be spent on programs to deter youth smoking and to help \nsmokers overcome their addiction. This would include a broad range of \ntobacco control initiatives, including school and community based \ntobacco use prevention programs, counter-advertising to discourage \nsmoking, cessation programs, and enforcement of the ban on sale to \nminors. Three thousand children start smoking every day, and one \nthousand of them will die prematurely as a result of tobacco-induced \ndisease. Prevention of youth smoking should be, without question, our \nhighest priority for the use of these funds. The state settlements \nprovide the resources to dissuade millions of teenagers from smoking, \nto break the cycle of addiction and early death. We must seize that \nopportunity.\n  An additional thirty percent would be used by states to fund health \ncare and public health programs which they select. States could either \nuse the additional resources to supplement existing programs in these \nareas, or to fund creative new state initiatives to improve health \nservices.\n  Smoking has long been America's foremost preventable cause of disease \nand early death. It has consumed an enormous amount of the nation's \nhealth care resources. At long last, resources taken from the tobacco \ncompanies would be used to improve the nation's health. A state could, \nfor example, use a portion of this money to help senior citizens pay \nfor prescription drugs, or to provide expanded health care services to \nthe uninsured. Funds could be used to support community health centers, \nto reduce public health risks, or to make health insurance more \naffordable.\n  For years, the tobacco companies callously targeted children as \nfuture smokers. The financial success of the entire industry was based \nupon addicting kids when they were too young to appreciate the health \nrisks of smoking. It would be particularly appropriate for resources \ntaken from this malignant industry to be used to give our children a \nhealthier start in life.\n  Congress has an overwhelming interest in how the federal share of \nthese dollars is used. They are Medicaid dollars. They should not be \nused for road repair or building maintenance. They should be used by \nthe states to create a healthier future for all our citizens.\n  I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding this time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, in response to the comments by the distinguished \nmajority leader on the obligation under this amendment to submit a \nplan, it is simply not so; States do not have to submit the plan to the \nFederal Government. All the States have to do is submit a ``report'' \nwhich shows how the funds ``have been spent.'' So there is no \nobligation to submit a plan.\n  When the distinguished majority leader talks about the temerity of \nthe Federal Government, there is enough temerity on all sides to go \naround. But that is not the issue here. The States brought the \nlawsuits, because that is what the law requires, and the States have an \nobligation to abide by the decision of the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, who makes the allocation.\n  Here we have litigation which has brought a settlement on tobacco-\nrelated causes. This is a modest approach on spending, indicating broad \nstandards for State compliance, and only 50 percent related to tobacco. \nIf no legislation were enacted on specifics, these funds would \ncertainly be impressed with the trust.\n  When the majority leader talks about spending the funds for juvenile \ndetention, that is very important. But that is simply not related to \ntobacco. When there is talk about using it for debt reduction of the \nStates, that is very important. But it is not related to tobacco \ncauses. These are funds produced from a tobacco settlement, and if the \nStates do not use these funds in this way, my legal judgment is that \nthese funds are impressed with a trust enforceable by any citizen of \nthe State. But this is an accommodation which will allow a reasonable \namount of the moneys to be used for tobacco-related purposes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe that this amendment is the \nworst of all worlds. It would require every State every year for 25 \nyears to submit a plan about how it is going to spend its own money. \nWhat happens if a State legislature is not in session and the Secretary \nof HHS says, ``I don't think your plan meets my standards for tobacco \ncessation or health programs,'' and the State legislature is then in \nthe position of losing Medicaid funds and having to call a special \nsession to either change its programs to meet the requirements of the \nSecretary of HHS, or take the hit, or not serve its own people under \nMedicaid?\n  Mr. President, this is State money, it is not Federal money. There is \nno relationship between Medicaid in many of these State lawsuits.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in conclusion--the most popular words of \nany speech--this proposal is a very modest approach on a multibillion-\ndollar--$200 billion--settlement that has been brought by the chairmen \nand ranking members of the committees in the Senate charged with \nallocating funds for Health and Human Services. There is no plan which \nhas to be submitted by the Governors. That is repeated again and again. \nAll the Governors have to do is say how they will spend the money. I \nagree with the principle of leaving maximum flexibility to the States \nwhen we make allocations. But this is for a generalized purpose, and \nthat is all we are asking for here. In light of the very substantial \nbudgetary shortfalls, this money ought to be used, at least in part, 50 \npercent for the purposes of solving the problems caused by tobacco.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to National \nWomen's History Month. I am proud to have the privilege of being the \nyoungest woman ever elected to serve in this great body. And I want to \nuse the occasion of Women's History Month to recognize just a few women \nfrom Arkansas who are paving roads for others to follow. I want to \nthank the many women who have blazed trails for years before me in \norder to secure a more prominent role for women of all professions, \nrace, or faiths. In my home state of Arkansas, there are many such \nexamples of women who deserve notoriety.\n  Judge Bernice Kizer of Fort Smith was one of the first 5 women to \nenroll in the University of Arkansas Law School. After a brief time in \nprivate practice, she was elected to represent Sebastian County in our \nstate legislature. During her tenure in the Arkansas General \nAssembly, Judge Kizer had the distinction of being appointed the first \nwoman chairman of any legislative committee and the first woman member \nof the Legislative Council. She served in that capacity for 14 years, \nand then returned home to Sebastian County to become the first woman \nelected a judge in my home state of Arkansas. Judge Kizer's \naccomplishments are even more monumental when you understand that over \nthe course of her 33 year career in public service, she was elected by \nArkansans on 10 separate occasions without ever accepting one single \ncampaign contribution. At the age of 83, Judge Kizer still serves as an \nactive member of the Sebastian County Democratic Party. Judge Kizer \npaved the way for so many Arkansas women who are now involved in either \nthe legislative or judicial branches of our government. On the Arkansas \nSupreme Court, Justice Annabelle Clinton Imber holds one of the courts \nseven seats. Secretary of State Sharon Priest and State Treasurer \nJimmie Lou Fisher serve as two of Arkansas' constitutional officers. \nToday, Arkansas has 20 women who serve in our legislature.\n\n  Community service and philanthropy are two vital components of life \nin many of the small rural communities in Arkansas and women have \nhelped lead the way to improve our quality of life. My home State of \nArkansas ranks third in the nation for philanthropic giving. The gifts \ngiven to the people of Arkansas have consisted of civic centers, art \ncenters, and classroom equipment just to name a few by women like Helen \nWalton, Bess Stephens, and Bernice Jones. These gifts have had a \nsignificant impact on the lives of all of the areas residents. Whether \nit be insuring a warm meal to a hungry child in the early morning or \nafter school activities, these women have looked beyond their own world \nand reached out to others in need. My mother has always told me that \nthe kindest thing you can do for someone is to do something nice for \ntheir children. And as a young mother, believing that to be true, I am \ngrateful to these and all community activists who take the time to care \nfor the less fortunate.\n  Numerous Arkansas women have ventured into previously uncharted \nterritories and established themselves as leaders in the business \ncommunities. These women, like Patti Upton, founder of Aromatique, Inc. \nhave served as an inspiration to our state's growing number of young \nwomen who want to pursue business careers. Patti, who began this home \nfragrance endeavor in her kitchen in 1982, has turned a personal hobby \ninto an inspiring professional growth opportunity. As the current \nPresident and CEO of what has become one of the nation's leading home \nfragrance companies, Patti has most recently begun to share her success \nwith the rest of the State. Under her leadership, Aromatique created a \nline of products that include potpourri, candles, soaps and other \nproducts that are appropriately named ``The Natural State.'' All \nproceeds from this product line go to support the Arkansas Nature \nConservancy and recently Aromatique surpassed the million dollar mark \nfor contributions back to this civic organization.\n\n  Arkansas is the home of other women who have had dramatic effects in \nthe business world. Diane Heuter is President and CEO of St. Vincent \nHealth System and Julia Peck Mobley is CEO of Commercial National Bank \nin Texarkana.\n  Mr. President, I am so proud to be able to stand here today in this \nhistoric Chamber and proclaim my full support and participation in \nNational Women's History Month. There is no doubt that women across \nthis Nation have made very significant contributions to our lives. \nSometimes those contributions are subtle and some times they are \nsignificant, but none the less worthy of recognition. Let us celebrate \nthe invention of bullet proof vests, fire escapes, or wind shield \nwipers, all of which can be credited to women in our history, as ways \nto promote and encourage women of future generations to rise to the \nlevel of success that I have spoken of here today. From this great \nChamber, to State legislative chambers, from the boardroom to the \nclassroom, from corporate headquarters to local Head Start, women make \na difference.\n  I am grateful for the opportunity afforded to me by those who have \ngone before me, and I hope in my tenure in the United States Senate to \npave the way for many more young women from the great State of \nArkansas.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 80.\n       Inset on page 43, after line 15:\n\n                      ``PUBLIC AND INDIAN HOUSING\n\n                       ``HOUSING CERTIFICATE FUND\n\n                              ``(DEFERRAL)\n\n       ``Of the funds made available under this heading in Public \n     Law 105-276 for use in connection with expiring or \n     terminating section 8 contracts, $350,000,000 shall not \n     become available until October 1, 1999.''.\n       On page 42, strike beginning with line 10 through the end \n     of line 21.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that deals with the \nprovision in the bill that was reported from the committee that \ndeferred spending from the temporary assistance to needy families \naccount.\n  This will defer, instead, monies from the section 8 fund of HUD. \nThere is approximately $1.2 billion in that account. This will defer \nfor 1 year the use of $350 million in that account. It replaces the \nTANF amendment in the bill. Under that amendment, we deferred until \n2001 the availability of funds which are transferred to the States.\n  Because of the misunderstanding about that fund, I want to explain \nwhy we use that fund in the first place. I am once again alarmed over \nthe misinformation that has been spread by some people in that entity, \nthat agency, to try and make it look like somehow or other we took \nmonies away from States or any specific State.\n  In the first place, these grant awards are made quarterly. Actual \ncash outlays are made, but they are not transferred to the States until \nthe States make expenditures in their TANF programs, the Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families. In other words, the States first make the \npayments, and we pay it back. Some people, in the House in particular, \nhave said this a way that the States can use this money for a piggy \nbank. In no way can they take this money and put it into another bank \naccount and draw interest on it if they comply with the law. That is \none report I have heard--that we are preventing States from taking the \nmoney to put it into their own accounts.\n  We checked and we found that there was between $3 billion and $3.5 \nbillion at the close of fiscal year 1998 in this fund. There are two \nquarters that have not even been distributed yet of this fiscal year \n1999. And it is clear that the States have spent some money, and there \nis plenty of money to meet the States' expenditures and their requests \nfor reimbursement of those expenditures. But this is not a fund that \nthe States can come to willy-nilly and transfer the funds to their \naccounts.\n\n  Secondly, Mr. President, we deferred this money from obligation in \nthis fiscal year--really until 2001, October 1, 2001.\n  The States would not--the bill that was reported from the committee--\nlose any of their funds. We, pursuant to the entitlement that was \nauthorized, agreed that Federal funds, taxpayers' funds, in the amount \nof $16.5 billion, from 1997 through 2002, would be placed in this \naccount, to be available to reimburse States for the expenditures they \nmade for Assistance to Needy Families.\n  Nothing in what the Appropriations Committee did harmed that program \nat all. But because by October 1 another $16.5 billion would have been \nadded to $3 billion to $3.5 billion in that account--and there has \nnever been a drawdown at the rate that would make those funds needed \nwithin that period of time.\n  This is not a rainy day fund. We have been told that some people have \nsaid that States take these monies and put them in a rainy day fund to \nuse at a later date. But the law says they can only get them to \nreimburse expenditures. If the administration is allowing this fund to \nbe used as a rainy day account or a piggy bank account, it is wrong.\n  We have had so many calls from so many States, including my own. And \nI see the Senator from New York is here, and I know that they have been \nbesieged because of their population base. Of course, they are eligible \nfor more money from this account, more than anyone other than \nCalifornia. But it depends on how much they spend before they can get \nit back.\n  We made the decision to offset this bill. This is the first time we \nhave offset totally a supplemental emergency bill. I have said to our \ncommittee, we ought to offset emergency funds with prior appropriated \nemergency funds and nonemergency funds with nonemergency prior \nappropriated funds. I think we are going to have a little discussion \nabout that here on the floor.\n  But clearly what we have done, Mr. President, is we have used this \nbill to reprogram prior appropriated funds. These funds that were \nappropriated to the TANF account are sitting there waiting for the \nStates to spend money and then come and ask for it to be repaid. The \nprocess is so rapid that the administration has not paid the first two \nquarters of this year yet. So this is not something we have interfered \nwith by deferring money until the second fiscal year. Because, as I \nsaid, this account would get $16.5 billion credited to it on October 1.\n  What we have done is, in order to avoid this controversy--and we do \nnot need a controversy on this bill. We need to get it done. This bill, \nin my opinion, is a very important bill. It will provide money for \nassistance because of a great natural disaster in a neighboring country \nin this hemisphere. The President asked us to declare that an \nemergency. We have taken the declaration of emergency through as far as \nthe outlay categories are concerned, because it is very difficult to \nscore under the budget process outlays that come from emergency \naccounts.\n  We have not taken an emergency declaration through on those things \nthat we believe are nonemergency in terms of the authorization process. \nSo by that I mean, I fail to understand how we should extend the \nconcept of emergency appropriations to natural disasters off our \nshores. We should be able to find the money, if we want to be good \nhumanitarian members of this hemisphere, to assist our neighbors.\n\n  I believe we should assist them. But I do not believe we should use \nthe laws that were intended to demand taxpayers' funds immediately to \nmeet natural disasters or declared emergencies by the President of the \nUnited States within the boundaries of our United States.\n  So Mr. President, I offer this amendment in the spirit of compromise, \nto try and take away this battle that I saw coming over the use of TANF \nfunds. No one supports the concepts of this Temporary Assistance to \nNeedy Families. We all know it replaced the old Aid to Families with \nDependent Children, the AFDC program, that assisted so many States, \nincluding mine for so many years.\n  But this now is a block grant program that works in conjunction with \nthe welfare-to-work concepts, and that is very vital for the States. We \nknow that. And I think the fear that was engendered in those States \nthat somehow or other we might not keep the commitment that was made, \nthat if they make those expenditures we would repay them according to \nthe formula under the law that was passed in 1996, the Welfare Reform \nAct, is unfortunate and wrong.\n  I hope that someone in the administration is listening. One of these \ndays I will find some way to tweak the nose of the people who keep \ndoing this, because they did it in the terms of border guards last \nweek, and now they are doing it in terms of the States themselves in \nterms of the comments that have been made that somehow or other we were \ntaking money that the States were entitled to; we were deferring money \nthat they were entitled to,\n\n[[Page S2899]]\n\nwhich they would never get under the process of the law anyway until \nthe time we deferred the expenditures.\n  As a matter of fact, some people on this side of the aisle have \nargued with me to say this is not a full offset because I know that I \nam offsetting the expenditures under this bill against a fund that \nwould never be expended this year. That is partially true. That is why \nwe have declared an emergency, as far as the outlays, and we have \nadmitted that, and we have said that is the only way we can do it. But \nwe need to do it. I hope, in particular, my new friend from New York \nwill understand that we are doing this to meet his objections and \nothers, and we do so in the spirit of compromise.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SCHUMER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I want to, on behalf of Senator Moynihan and myself, thank \nChairman Stevens, as well as Senator Byrd, for their assistance in \nremoving the $350 million offset from the TANF, Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families, account, which would have deferred the funds until \n2002.\n  Mr. President, I and many others in New York feared that this offset \nset us off on the wrong course, that it would run counter to the \nintention of the welfare reform bill which allowed States to set aside \nTANF funds for use at a later date when welfare rolls would rise, such \nas during a future recession.\n  My State, as the chairman knows, was particularly affected. The State \nwas the source of nearly a quarter, about $80 million, of the $350 \nmillion that was offset. So I am pleased that the alternative offset \nwould shift some HUD funds from one fiscal year to the next, funds that \nnever would have been used. We have checked with both the \nadministration as well as our side on Housing and on Banking and on \nAppropriations, and they agree with that.\n  I say to the chairman that I appreciate very much the spirit of \ncompromise in which this was offered. I understand his view and I will \nbring that message back to our State. The people of New York will now \nbe breathing a sigh of relief that this has been replaced.\n  I also thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Santorum, who worked \nwith me on this. He found his State in a similar position as ours. At \nleast for my first foray into the Senate legislative process, it has \nbeen a bipartisan and productive effort. For that, I very much thank \nthe chairman for his understanding of our needs and yield back the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am going to ask for adoption of the \namendment but I will not move to reconsider because there may be some \nwho want to discuss this, too. I will make a motion to reconsider this \nlater today. May I reserve the right to make that later today?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That motion can be made today or any of the \nnext 2 following days.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I shall make it this afternoon, and I ask for the \nadoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am offering this amendment to speed up \nadjudication, by the appeals board of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, of appeals from nursing facilities of civil monetary \npenalties levied by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) for \nviolations of standards established pursuant to the Nursing Home Reform \nAct of 1987. Currently, there is a substantial backlog of some 701 such \ncases. Delay in final adjudication of such cases subverts the purpose \nand effect of civil monetary penalties, delaying corrective action, and \nimprovements in the quality of care offered by nursing facilities. \nDelays in adjudication of these cases also burdens nursing facilities \nthrough additional legal fees and the perpetuation of uncertainty \ncaused by unresolved disputes.\n  The number of such cases filed each year by nursing facilities has \nincreased each year since 1995, the year when regulations for the \nNursing Home Reform Act's enforcement standards went into effect. \nCurrently, as I noted earlier in my statement, there are 701 such cases \npending.\n  Mr. President, the steady increase in appeals of civil monetary \npenalties since 1995 shows the effect of increased use, by the States \nand HCFA, of the enforcement regulations which went into effect in \n1995. Nevertheless, in hearings I held in the Special Committee on \nAging last July, the General Accounting Office reported that nursing \nfacilities providing poor quality of care regularly escaped sanctions \nwhich could cause care to be improved. The pattern seemed to be that a \nfacility would be sanctioned for poor quality of care, be required to \nattest in writing through a plan of correction that steps had been \ntaken to improve care, and then be found deficient on the next visit \nfrom State officials. This pattern often continued for long periods of \ntime. And when sanctions such as civil monetary penalties were levied \nby HCFA, the sanctioned facilities would appeal, causing lengthy delays \nin final resolution of the case.\n  One week before my July hearings, President Clinton launched a \nvariety of new initiatives designed to improve the quality of care in \nnursing facilities. Among those new initiatives was one designed to \neliminate paper compliance with quality standards and to proceed more \nquickly to sanctions for those homes with a history of poor care.\n\n  The upshot of oversight by the Special Committee on Aging and the \nPresidential initiatives is that there has been a substantial increase \nthus far in 1999 of appeals of civil monetary penalties by nursing \nfacilities.\n  Certainly, facilities have the right to appeal sanctions levied by \nHCFA. But it is also important that appeals be heard and resolved in a \nreasonable amount of time. Delay subverts improvement in the quality of \ncare in nursing facilities as real deficiencies go uncorrected. Delay \nalso slows the development of precedents which would clarify \noutstanding issues. Slow development of such precedents encourages \nfacilities and their legal representatives to file appeals because \nguidance as to the worthiness of an appeal is lacking. And, as the body \nof precedents becomes more complete, adjudication of cases becomes \nspeedier.\n  The root problem has been that the departmental appeals board does \nnot have sufficient resources to keep up with the increase in new \ncases, to say nothing of working off the current backlog of cases. I am \ngiven to understand that, at the present time about 25 new cases are \nfiled with the appeals board each week. As will be clear from the table \nI am attaching to my statement, the number of cases decided each year \nhas averaged around 23 for the last 3 years. Clearly, the board is \nswamped and needs help.\n  The President's budget for fiscal year 2000 proposes $2.8 million for \nthe board. Were the Congress to provide those funds, it will certainly \ntake time for the appeals board to gear up and begin to speed up \nadjudication of appeals.We can't wait to begin addressing this problem, \nMr. President. The amendment I offer would provide $1.4 million to be \nmade available through the supplemental appropriation we are now \nconsidering. I have not proposed to provide the full $2.8 million the \nPresident's budget proposes for the next fiscal year because the \nappeals board could not effectively spend that amount in what remains \nof the fiscal year. Therefore, I have essentially prorated that amount \nover the time remaining in this fiscal year.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 84\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert:\n\n[[Page S2901]]\n\n       Sec.   .

(a) Short Title.--\n     This section may be cited as the ``Emergency Steel Loan \n     Guarantee Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Congressional Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States steel industry has been severely \n     harmed by a record surge of more than 40,000,000 tons of \n     steel imports into the United States in 1998, caused by the \n     world financial crisis;\n       (2) this surge in imports resulted in the loss of more than \n     10,000 steel worker jobs in 1998, and was the imminent cause \n     of 3 bankruptcies by medium-sized steel companies, Acme \n     Steel, Laclede Steel, and Geneva Steel;\n       (3) the crisis also forced almost all United States steel \n     companies into--\n       (A) reduced volume, lower prices, and financial losses; and\n       (B) an inability to obtain credit for continued operations \n     and reinvestment in facilities;\n       (4) the crisis also has affected the willingness of private \n     banks and investment institutions to make loans to the U.S. \n     steel industry for continued operation and reinvestment in \n     facilities;\n       (5) these steel bankruptcies, job losses, and financial \n     losses are also having serious negative effects on the tax \n     base of cities, counties, and States, and on the essential \n     health, education, and municipal services that these \n     government entities provide to their citizens;

I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 89.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. __. PRIOR CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL FOR SUPPORTING \n                   ADMISSION OF CHINA INTO THE WTO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the United States may not support the admission of the \n     People's Republic of China as a member of the World Trade \n     Organization unless a provision of law is passed by both \n     Houses of Congress and enacted into law after the enactment \n     of this Act that specifically allows the United States to \n     support such admission.\n       (b) Procedures for Congressional Approval of United States \n     Support for Admission of China Into the WTO.--\n       (1) Notification of congress.--The President shall notify \n     the Congress in writing if the President determines that the \n     United States should support the admission of the People's \n     Republic of China into the World Trade Organization.\n       (2) Support of china's admission into the wto.--The United \n     States may support the admission of the People's Republic of \n     China into the World Trade Organization if a joint resolution \n     is enacted into law under subsection (c) and the Congress \n     adopts and transmits the joint resolution to the President \n     before the end of the 90-day period (excluding any day \n     described in section 154(b) of the Trade Act of 1974), \n     beginning on the date on which the Congress receives the \n     notification referred to in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Joint Resolution.--\n       (1) Joint resolution.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``joint resolution'' means only a joint resolution of \n     the 2 Houses of Congress, the matter after the resolving \n     clause of which is as follows: ``That the Congress approves \n     the support of the United States for the admission of the \n     People's Republic of China into the World Trade \n     Organization.''.\n       (2) Procedures.--\n       (A) In general.--A joint resolution may be introduced at \n     any time on or after the date on which the Congress receives \n     the notification referred to in subsection (b)(1), and before \n     the end of the 90-day period referred to in subsection \n     (b)(2). A joint resolution may be introduced in either House \n     of the Congress by any member of such House.\n       (B) Application of section 152.--Subject to the provisions \n     of this subsection, the provisions of subsections (b), (d), \n     (e), and (f) of section 152 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 \n     U.S.C. 2192(b), (d), (e), and (f)) apply to a joint \n     resolution under this section to the same extent as such \n     provisions apply to resolutions under section 152.\n       (C) Discharge of committee.--If the committee of either \n     House to which a joint resolution has been referred has not \n     reported it by the close of the 45th day after its \n     introduction (excluding any day described in section 154(b) \n     of the Trade Act of 1974), such committee shall be \n     automatically discharged from further consideration of the \n     joint resolution and it shall be placed on the appropriate \n     calendar.\n       (D) Consideration by appropriate committee.--It is not in \n     order for--\n       (i) the Senate to consider any joint resolution unless it \n     has been reported by the Committee on Finance or the \n     committee has been discharged under subparagraph (C); or\n       (ii) the House of Representatives to consider any joint \n     resolution unless it has been reported by the Committee on \n     Ways and Means or the committee has been discharged under \n     subparagraph (C).\n       (E) Consideration in the house.--A motion in the House of \n     Representatives to proceed to the consideration of a joint \n     resolution may only be made on the second legislative day \n     after the calendar day on which the Member making the motion \n     announces to the House his or her intention to do so.\n       (3) Consideration of second resolution not in order.--It \n     shall not be in order in either the House of Representatives \n     or the Senate to consider a joint resolution (other than a \n     joint resolution received from the other House), if that \n     House has previously adopted a joint resolution under this \n     section.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry, if I might.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am just trying to find out from the Senator, is there a \ntime allotment or not?\n  Mr. STEVENS. When the Senator finishes, I will make a motion to \ntable. It should be about 1 o'clock.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just didn't know----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have not asked for a time limitation \non the Senator making his presentation, but he knows that as soon as he \nfinishes, I will make a motion to table.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator is going to table both at 2:30?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will make a motion to table the \namendment of the Senator from Arkansas, and after the Senator from \nIowa, I will make a motion, but I got unanimous consent that those \nvotes occur at 2:30.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is fine with me. I just wanted to make sure.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, who has the floor?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question--for \na parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand the distinguished Senator from Alaska is \nsaying he is going to move to table. I would like to speak on the \namendment, but the Senator is moving to table as soon as the Senator is \nfinished.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would be pleased if the Senator would \nagree to try to reach a time agreement on that, because we have other \nSenators wishing to offer amendments this afternoon also.\n  Mr. President, may I ask the Senator, first, that the Senator yield \nto me? I apologize.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to yield to the distinguished \nchairman.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time would the Senator like to have?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I think for my presentation I probably only need 15 \nminutes. If there are those who speak against the amendment, I would \nlike to yield proportionally then.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if I still have the floor, how much time \ndoes the Senator from Montana seek?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I was thinking of 10, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Could we have an agreement that there be 30 minutes on \nthis amendment? Is the Senator from Montana speaking against the \namendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am speaking against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am seeking a limitation of 30 minutes on the \namendment, that the time following that time to be--I will make a \nmotion to table, only a motion to table be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am informed that Senators Roth and \nMoynihan wish to speak, and I ask unanimous consent that the time be \nexpanded to 40 minutes to be followed only by a motion to table offered \nby me.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Forty-five minutes. The Senator wants to close.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I suspect the others the Senator mentioned are going \nto speak in opposition. There are some who might want to speak in \nfavor. If we are going to extend the time afforded Senators who want to \nspeak against, I think we might have trouble extending the time with \nthat restriction.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do desire to limit the time if \npossible, so we can have a vote when the Senate comes back out of that \nconference.\n  Could we agree to 30 minutes on a side? Is there objection to 30 \nminutes on a side? I renew my request----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The agreement then is 1 hour equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S2903]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair.\n  This is a very straightforward amendment that simply says that before \nChina can be admitted to the World Trade Organization, there will have \nto be a joint resolution passed by the Congress supporting that \naccession of China to the World Trade Organization.\n  It is very simple. It is simply saying we should have a voice in \nthis. We should not have the administration arbitrarily and \nunilaterally making a very, very significant and major decision without \nthe input of the U.S. Congress and this body. It does not prejudge what \nshould happen. It does not say whether China should be in or not. There \nmay be very compelling arguments that could be presented in such a \ndebate. But it does say that before China is admitted to the World \nTrade Organization, every Senator in this body ought to have an \nopportunity to look at the evidence and have a say in the outcome of \nthat debate. That is why we need this amendment, because Congress needs \nto, once again, assert its constitutional responsibility in the area of \nforeign commerce.\n  I believe we must do it now for a couple of reasons. It is the only \nopportunity we are going to have before the recess, and our only \nopportunity before Zhu Rongji visits this Nation next month. He will \ncome during our Easter recess. So, if Congress is going to have any \nkind of statement on this, if we are going to be able to take any kind \nof action on this, we must take it now.\n  I know some of my colleagues will say this should have gone through \ncommittee. In an ideal world I would agree. It is very straightforward. \nI do not think it would require a great deal of debate, as to whether \nsomeone is for it or against it, but ideally that is where it should \nhave gone. But, once again, the stream of negotiations that have taken \nplace in recent weeks between our country and the Chinese Government, \nwith our officials going to China--Deputy Treasury Secretary Larry \nSummers, Secretary of State Albright, U.S. Trade Representative \nCharlene Barshefsky have all been making repeated trips to China--\nnegotiating, obviously; attempting to broker a deal on the World Trade \nOrganization accession of China.\n\n  If we wait for an announcement by the administration that a deal has \nbeen reached, an announcement by the administration that the outlines \nof an agreement have been reached, we will make China's membership in \nthe WTO a fait accompli. Any effort to stop it after the fact, after \nthe negotiations are completed and after an agreement has been \nannounced, I think will be too late for this body to really make a \ndifference.\n  The amendment is, as I said, very straightforward. It would require a \njoint resolution to be passed before the United States could support \nadmission of China into the WTO. Again, it does not preclude our \nsupport for China's entry. It simply sends a clear statement that \nCongress should be involved in the process of deciding U.S. support for \nChina's accession into the WTO. The administration should not make any \nhasty deals with China. We must give careful consideration to the \ntiming as well as to the consequences of Chinese accession. Congress \nmust be thoroughly involved in that debate.\n  We cannot negotiate a trade deal with the most populous nation in the \nworld, and, as we hear so often, the largest market in the world, in a \nvacuum. There are certain facts that we must face; there is a political \nenvironment in which all of these negotiations are occurring. The \nChinese have used espionage to obtain important nuclear secrets from \nthe United States. That is a matter that must be fully investigated. I \nbelieve it will be. I believe the appropriate oversight committees are \nmoving expeditiously to investigate. But it certainly is not going to \nhappen before we go out on the Easter recess. We may have hearings next \nweek, but we will not see the end of this, we will not have all the \nfacts on the table, before the Easter recess and before Zhu Rongji \nvisits this country.\n  Another fact that faces us is our trade deficit with the Chinese is \nat an alarming all-time high of $56.9 billion for 1998. It is rising \nexponentially every year. That reality ought to cause us to pause \nbefore we see the administration rush into a WTO deal. The Chinese \ncontinue to keep many of their markets closed, particularly to our \nagricultural sector, our farmers, who are in such crisis.\n  The Chinese have signed and blatantly disregarded the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and have engaged in a widespread \ncrackdown on prodemocracy activists in China, effectively silencing all \npolitical dissent. We cannot give WTO membership in a vacuum, ignoring \nall other realities that face us. The 1999 State Department report on \nChina, released in the last few weeks, demonstrably proves China's \nignoring of the very covenant on civil and political rights that they \nsigned last year. If we cannot trust them to live up to a human rights \ncovenant that they signed, how can we assume they are going to live \naccording to the rules and the obligations of the World Trade \nOrganization? There is an issue of trust. They have not justified the \ntrust we would show in placing them in the World Trade Organization.\n  Article I of the Constitution gives Congress express power over \nforeign commerce. There is no question but that this is our right. \nThere is no question in this Senator's mind that it is our \nresponsibility to step forward and say: WTO membership for China will \nnot be granted without a debate in the House and Senate and a joint \nresolution.\n  There are serious questions that the House and the Senate need to \naddress. For us to sit back and go off on our Easter vacation, to go \noff on recess, to hold our town meetings or to take our trips around \nthe world, and to have been silent on this issue, I think, at this \ntime, will be indefensible. I suspect there will be some kind of \nannouncement on the U.S. position on China's membership in the WTO \nwhile we are gone. Then we would never have had the opportunity to \ndebate very important questions.\n\n  I do not have all of the answers to these questions, but I know they \nare serious questions and I know the Senator from Montana, the Senator \nfrom Alabama, who was on the floor just a moment ago, and myself ought \nto have a right, before we have the United States taking a position on \nWTO membership, to debate that on the floor of the Senate, to \nthoroughly examine the questions that have not yet been answered.\n  One question I would have is this: Are we lowering the WTO bar for \nChina, to rush them into membership?\n  Since 1995, four countries have completed negotiations on accession \nprotocol: Ecuador, Mongolia, Bulgaria, and Panama. All four of these \nnations were required to eliminate, on the date of accession or with \nvery short transitions, trade practices that were incompatible with WTO \nrules. That has been the standard. Since 1995 the four nations that \nhave sought to enter the WTO have been required to eliminate their \ntrade practices that were incompatible with WTO rules. But China has \nfirmly and continuously and repeatedly said they want a different \nstandard. They want a longer transition period. They do not want to \nmeet those WTO rules at the time of or soon after their accession to \nthe WTO. That is a question I believe this body deserves the \nopportunity to investigate and debate thoroughly before we announce a \nnational position regarding China's admission.\n  Another question I think is a serious question for debate: Are we \nallowing China into the WTO before they have made the kind of market \nreforms to bring them into conformity with WTO standards? The \nadministration argues if we will just let China in, we will have \ngreater influence on China's reform efforts than we do now while they \nare outside of the World Trade Organization. I suppose that is \ndebatable. But we ought to have the opportunity to have that debate.\n  In my estimation, our influence on China would be far greater before \nthey are admitted to the World Trade Organization than afterwards. Our \nability to influence the kind of reforms the World Trade Organization \nwould desire will be far greater if we say you are going to accrue the \nbenefits of trade under the WTO only after these market reforms have \ntaken place, these trade barriers have been lowered. Reforms should \nfirst be enacted, changes should first occur, and then membership \nshould be granted --not vice versa.\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\n  I think this question deserves debate: Can China be trusted on trade \nissues? When we look at our exploding trade deficit with China, can \nthey be trusted on trade issues if admitted to the World Trade \nOrganization, or will we admit them to the World Trade Organization and \nthen find them cavalierly ignoring the standards and the rules of the \nWorld Trade Organization? Our administration's own Trade Representative \nBarshefsky stated in her testimony, a little over 2 years ago, in \nreference to China, that ``China imposes new import barriers to replace \nthose it removed.'' In other words, there can be the appearance of \nreform taking place, but if there are new barriers that are being \nerected while the old ones are being brought down, you really have not \nachieved the reforms necessary for World Trade Organization membership.\n  China has almost one-third of its industrial production controlled by \nthe state. Almost two-thirds of urban workers are employed in state-\nowned enterprises. These state-owned enterprises are notorious for \ntheir ability to destroy wealth. Some economists estimate that it would \nbe cheaper for China to close down their state-owned enterprises and \nkeep paying the workers--close down the enterprises, go ahead and pay \nthem their salaries, they would still come out ahead, than to keep \noperating. But because the state-owned enterprises would be vulnerable \nto foreign competition, the Chinese Government has a strong \ndisincentive to the state-owned enterprises that are heavily subsidized \nthrough China's centralized and insolvent banking system.\n  One of the pledges that the Chinese Government made was that they \nwould rapidly privatize the state-owned enterprises, shutting down \nthose that they had to, privatizing others, allowing them to create \ncapital by selling stock, but because of the recent economic downturn \nin China in which their robust growth rate has dropped appreciably, \nChina now has backed off that pledge and has once again begun a round \nof bank loans to these very unprofitable, state-owned enterprises to \nsubsidize them and to keep them in business.\n  This is backpedaling already on the kinds of reforms that would be \nexpected if China were in fact ready for admission to the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  Another question that this body needs to debate is, Should China be \nadmitted as a developing country with far less stringent expectations \nand longer transition than allowed for other nations? That is what they \ndesire. They say we are a developing Nation; therefore, we should be \ntreated more leniently. They base their claim primarily upon their per \ncapita gross domestic product. By every other measure, China is a major \neconomic power in the world today and they want to be treated as such. \nThey want to be recognized as a major economic power.\n  China will argue that as a developing country, they are entitled to \nuse subsidies. They are entitled to put limits on exports and other \npolicies to promote development of certain key industries such as \nautomobiles and telecommunications and heavy industrial equipment.\n  China maintains that such programs are a part of China's industrial \npolicy and not related to its application to the World Trade \nOrganization. Many trade officials simply disagree with that assertion \nby the Chinese Government. That is a question and that is an issue the \nSenate should have the opportunity to debate, not after the fact but \nbefore China is admitted to the World Trade Organization and before the \nU.S. Government announces its position on Chinese accession.\n\n  A WTO paper, prepared in response to a request from Chinese \nnegotiators, suggested that industrial policies in China and other \ncountries could violate the basic principles of nondiscrimination and \nnational treatment and other WTO rules. They are not in compliance. \nThey are not ready to join the WTO. Political considerations should not \nbe the driving force in rushing China into the WTO before they have \nmade necessary reforms.\n  Another question I believe we should debate is this: Should China be \ngiven membership in WTO before Taiwan, which is simultaneously seeking \nmembership? Will it be the position of the U.S. Government that we \nsupport the admission of People's Republic of China to the World Trade \nOrganization while not yet supporting Taiwan's admission? Which one \nshould be admitted first? I think that is an important issue. I think \nthat is one my colleagues in the Senate deserve to have the opportunity \nto discuss thoroughly.\n  Many believe that once China is admitted, they will work feverishly \nto block Taiwan's entry, even though Taiwan is a much more developed \nNation, has a much more developed economy, and an economy which is much \nmore consistent with WTO rules. Yet without a vote of the Senate or a \nvote of the House, this administration is prepared to support the \nadmission of China to the WTO before Taiwan's admission.\n  I believe this question deserves debate as well: Will a premature \nentry by China into WTO hurt American business interests? I know that \nlarge corporate interests in this country support China's immediate \naccession to WTO, but many business people in this country have serious \nconcerns as to how China's admission to WTO will impact them. U.S. \nbusiness interests often want permanent MFN for China and would like to \nuse an agreement on WTO, I believe, as a means to push for this goal, \nbut many of these business interests are also concerned that China's \nWTO accession, without meeting market access and other requirements, \nwould seriously limit U.S. business access to the Chinese market for a \nlong time to come. The very access that American business wants so \ndesperately, we would be locked out of that access permanently or for a \nlong duration should they be admitted to the World Trade Organization \nbefore they have met market access rules. As a result, many U.S. \ninterests are pushing U.S. negotiators to remain firm, to stand pat, \nand not concede on the conditions of China's entry into the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  I believe another question that this body needs to debate is, How \nwill WTO admission for China affect jobs? Indeed, we should consider \nhow it would affect our jobs here in the United States.\n  I remind my colleagues, contained in this very supplemental \nappropriations bill, which we are soon prepared to vote on, is a \nmeasure to assist the U.S. steel industry and the jobs that go with it. \nSome of those jobs are in my home State of Arkansas, Mississippi \nCounty, Blytheville, AR, the No. 2 ranked county in the Nation in steel \nproduction. According to the Department of Commerce, last year alone \nthe U.S.-China trade deficit in iron and steel was a $161 million loser \nfor the United States. The year before that the U.S. realized a steel \ntrade deficit of $141 million, and in 1996 the deficit was $140 \nmillion. Each year the deficit in iron and steel increases \ndramatically.\n  My point is, this Congress should have a say in whether we allow an \nagreement to be made when our trade imbalance is what we experience, \neven without granting China World Trade Organization status.\n  At the appropriate time, I would like to see China join the World \nTrade Organization and abide by its rules. I do not believe China is \nready at this time to go beyond paying lip service to the fundamental \nchanges necessary for accession, though I know some of my colleagues do \nbelieve that they are ready. However, I believe we can all agree that \nwe ought not make this decision hastily. The consequences are too great \nand long lasting and, just as importantly, we ought not let the \nexecutive branch make this determination unilaterally.\n  Article 1 of the Constitution gives to us, the Congress, the express \npower over foreign commerce. This decision is too important for us to \ncede that power, and this amendment is a means by which we can preserve \nour legitimate role in the legislative branch.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I inquire how \nmuch time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 11 minutes 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas raises obviously \na very important question, and that is, essentially, the terms under \nwhich the\n\n[[Page S2905]]\n\nUnited States should agree to help encourage China to be a member or \naccede to the WTO. It is obviously important because China, \nparticularly in the next century, is going to be a very important \ncountry. It is now the largest country in the world, the most populous, \nthe largest standing army, a nuclear power, one of the fastest growing \n``developing countries,'' thousands of years of history, a very proud \npeople. We in the United States clearly must be very careful and clear \nheaded in our relationship with such a country, particularly when the \nquestion arises as to the terms under which China would accede to the \nWTO.\n  It is also true that under the Constitution, the U.S. Congress \nprovides that the Congress essentially set trade policy. That is true. \nBut the use of power is a very important matter. Sometimes it is \nimportant to use power that is entrusted to one. Sometimes it is \nimportant to forebear the use of power that is entrusted to one.\n  Certainly, Congress has the authority to pass the amendment suggested \nby the Senator from Arkansas. But that is not the question. The real \nquestion is, Should Congress adopt that amendment?\n  In my judgment, it has the ring of simplicity which often sounds \ngood, but when one thinks about it a little bit more deeply and what \nthe consequences of that amendment would be, it, at the very least, \ncauses people to pause and, in my judgment, causes Senators to not \nsupport the amendment.\n  I am reminded of a statement by H.L. Mencken, a famous Baltimore Sun \njournalist: ``For every complicated problem, there is a simple \nsolution, but it is usually wrong.''\n  That is this case. There is a complicated problem--China and our \ntrade relationship--and the simple solution to some degree is, \n``Congress should vote on whether to admit China to the WTO or not.''\n  This would set new precedent, a groundbreaking and very alarming \nprecedent. In each of the previous 110 cases where countries have \nacceded to the GATT, or to the WTO, there has not been a congressional \nvote. Congress has never voted on whether a country should accede to \nthe GATT, currently to the WTO. That is an executive decision.\n  There is a good reason why Congress has not voted in the past. \nEssentially, it is for the reasons suggested already by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas, because if we were to vote on whether China should \naccede to the WTO, that vote would essentially be a vote not on WTO, \nbut it would be a vote on our ``overall China policy.'' It would \ninclude countless other relationships that we have with China.\n  The Senator from Arkansas already mentioned them. Human rights, for \nexample. The Senator is very upset with China's human rights policy. He \nsaid that should be looked into. He implied looking into it in the \ncontext of this debate.\n  I, too, am upset with China's human rights policy. I daresay every \nMember of the Senate is upset with China's human rights policy. But are \nthose issues considered in trade negotiations? Are they considered by \nthe World Trade Organization? The Senator from Arkansas might think \nthat they should be, but they are not considered in trade negotiations \nand in whether or not China is or is not meeting commercially \nacceptable principles under which it would properly be admitted to the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n  The Senator also mentioned the words ``political environment.'' He \nsaid this issue has to be considered in the total political environment \nof our relationship with China. He mentioned espionage. That is a \ncharged issue right now. I daresay that if the Congress were to vote in \nthe next several months presumably on whether China should accede to \nthe WTO, there would be an amendment on espionage, there would be an \namendment on human rights, an amendment on labor relations, an \namendment on the environment. I can think of countless subjects that \nwould be included, by the design of certain Senators, in any decision \nby the Congress whether or not China should be admitted to the WTO.\n  It reminds me very, very much of the debate we already had with \nrespect to China, and that is whether the Congress, when we come up \nwith the annual MFN review--actually a lot of us like to call it normal \ntrade relationship not most-favored-nation status. MFN is a gross \nmisnomer. MFN is not at all what it implies. It is not most favored. In \neffect, it is least favored, because we have so many trade agreements \nwith so many other countries under terms that are more beneficial than \nthe bottom line terms of MFN.\n\n  During the MFN debate, or normal trade relations debate, we have had \nin this Congress, particularly several years ago, the question was \nwhether we should pass in this Congress every June a conditional \nextension of MFN or nonconditional extension of MFN.\n  Those who argued for conditional extension said, ``Well, we will \ncontinue MFN with China for another year if China abides by certain \nhuman right regimes, if China abides by certain nuclear technology \ntransfer provisions, if China signs a comprehensive missile test ban \ntreaty, if China''--all these other things.\n  In a sense, that debate became a debate about China and gave interest \ngroups an opportunity--I use this term loosely--to kind of take off on \nor vent their spleens about a certain policy with which that Senator or \ninterest group had a disagreement.\n  I have no problem with that. In fact, I support it. I support Members \nof the Senate and the House working vigorously to improve upon the \nrelationship with China in each of the specific areas that we engage \nChina, and there are many of them. Trade is one. Even within trade, \nthere are many, many different levels. There are tariffs. There are \ndistribution systems. There is access. There are all kinds of matters \nwith which we have to deal.\n  Let's take national security, not very related to trade--indirectly \nbut not directly. Our administration, other countries' administrations \nengage China on a host of national security issues.\n  Let's take the Taiwan Straits, for example. That is a separate \nmatter. It is an extremely important issue. It is one that has become a \nbit sensitive in the last several days, but the U.S. Defense \nDepartment, the NSC, and our executive branch are working out with \nTaiwan, with China, and with Japan as much as possible the various \ninterrelationships of that issue.\n  The main point is, those issues should be dealt with separately and \non separate tracks. They should not be all subsumed in the one vote on \nwhether China should be a member of the WTO.\n  I think it is also important to remember we have a lot of problems \nwith China, but China has done a lot of good things, too.\n  What are they? Recently in the economic sphere, China, at great cost \nto itself, has not devalued its currency. China, in the last year, has \nbeen under tremendous pressure to devalue its currency so that it could \nsell more products overseas; it would help boost its economy. But China \nhas not.\n  Why has China not devalued its currency? In many respects because the \nAmericans have encouraged them, have asked them not to devalue. Why? \nBecause if they were to devalue their currency, then the other \nsoutheastern countries--the baht in Thailand, the Indonesian \ncurrencies, North Korea--there would be great pressure on them to \ndevalue further, which means that our exports will be that much more \nexpensive, their exports to the United States that much less expensive, \nand the trade deficit we are all so worried about will be even worse.\n  China, at great cost to itself, has so far--that might change--not \ndevalued the currency.\n  China has also signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. They signed \nit. That is a major step. That is good. China has helped provide more \nstability between India and Pakistan, particularly when those countries \nwere starting to test missiles. It has been a very great help to us.\n  They also have begun to downsize their state-owned enterprises. That \nis not something we asked them to do, but at great cost to themselves, \nthey are doing so, and that is a major effort.\n  There is banking reform.\n  The PLA, their army in China, which used to be a major competitor \nwith companies in the United States, was not just an army, it was a \nmanufacturing firm, an industry or a company making all kinds of \nproducts.\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\n  The PLA are going out of business. It is not entirely done yet, but \nthey are going out of business. That is good. Even more fundamentally, \nlet's think of this. What if this were 25 years ago and we were faced \nwith the Asian currency turmoil, which did spread over to Brazil and \nover to Russia and has affected the whole world, as a matter of fact? \nIf this were to have happened 25 years ago, I daresay that China would \nhave used it as an opportunity to further destabilize--they could have \nused it as an opportunity to gain a strategic position in, say, Vietnam \nor in Burma, Thailand, maybe even in Japan, as they did 25 years ago \nwhen they exercised their power, but not in the economic sense.\n  Instead, today, 25 years later, when presented with this crisis, what \nhas China done? It has not been a bad boy; it has been a good boy. \nChina has, instead, downsized its state-owned enterprises as much as it \npossibly can. It is reducing its bureaucracy, cutting a lot of the dead \nwood. It is cutting back on the army dramatically. I was in China about \na year ago talking with a general and all his colleagues who were being \ngiven the boot because the general officers corps, in addition to the \nlower ranks, was being cut back dramatically.\n  They are going through a lot of painful times. I am not going to \nstand here and apologize for China. We are very concerned about China. \nBut instead, China is trying to be a player.\n  Why is WTO good for America and why is it good for China? WTO is good \nfor America only under commercially acceptable principles. I must \nunderline that forcefully. It is good for America because it will help \nencourage a greater rule of law in China, because there are commitments \nthat China would have to agree to. It would help America because we \ncould take China to the WTO.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has a concern whether we could ``trust'' \nChina. I tell you, Mr. President, China will do more of what we wish if \nthey are a member of WTO, at least on trade issues, because we can take \nChina to the WTO.\n  The WTO is now much more impartial and more effective as a dispute \nsettlement mechanism than it was under the old GATT, to be honest about \nit. The WTO as an institution is being tested now, particularly with \nrespect to bananas and beef hormones, and some other issues--whether \ncountries live up to it--but still it is a lot better than the old \nGATT, under which there was virtually no dispute settlement mechanism.\n  WTO is good for China, too. Why? Basically because it gives China \nstatus and more investment in China; it gives China the opportunity to \nbe more of a player in the world economic scene. And that is all good. \nThat is good for China; that is good for America.\n  We are so interrelated today economically, politically, socially that \nwhen one part of the world's economy collapses or goes south, it has \neffects everywhere. It affects the Senator's farmers. They have a \nharder time selling soybeans. It affects farmers in my State. They have \na harder time selling wheat. That is why, when the Asian currency \ncrisis occurred, at least in my State, our agricultural exports fell \n$50 million compared to the preceding year.\n  I must say, I think we have done a pretty good job as a country in \nmanaging, as near as we could, the currency crisis, which we did not \ncause. It was caused by a whole host of factors--essentially greed by a \nlot of creditors who did not look at financial statements closely \nanymore. But we have done a pretty good job managing. Secretary Rubin, \nChairman Greenspan, Secretary Summers have done a good job of helping \nstabilize, as much as they possibly could, this turmoil.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senator also asked, ``Well, gee, who should be \nadmitted first, Taiwan or China?'' That is a political issue. We should \nnot look at this as a political issue. We should look at these \ncountries on their merits. And if China does meet the commercially \nacceptable principles test closely, tightly, we should admit China. If \nthey do not, we should not.\n  There are lots of different areas there that I wish to just briefly \nmention as to the test I think China should meet. I must say, Mr. \nPresident, I do not think this administration is going to send us a \nweak agreement. It would be foolish for them to agree to China's \naccession into the WTO under noncommercially acceptable terms. It would \nnot make any sense. For one thing, it would be an outrage. Second, it \nwould have an effect on MFN, a vote later. It would have an effect on \nfast-track proposals that may or may not come up. It just does not make \nsense. They will not do it.\n  One final point is this. The Senator wants a vote. The Senator is \ngoing to have a vote. It is on MFN extension, because, by definition, \nif the United States agrees, because China has met commercially \nacceptable principles, that China should accede to the GATT, then by \ndefinition this Congress must vote on whether to give China permanent \nMFN status.\n  There will be a vote. And obviously, if the U.S. Senate believes that \nthe terms under which China is admitted are not acceptable, I daresay \nthat this body will not agree to permanently extend MFN to China. So we \nought to have a vote. The Senator wants a vote. By definition, there \nwill be a vote.\n  But to have a second vote--and the second vote would be whether to \nadmit--I say, would essentially be a referendum on China. It would not \njust be trade issues, it would be all the other issues, with all the \nother amendments that would come up, just as they did in the old MFN \nextension debate. Back then, after lots of gnashing of teeth and \nworking ourselves through all this, what did the Congress do? The \nCongress agreed, the President agreed, that it made more sense to have \nunconditional extension of MFN rather than conditional.\n  What the Senator from Arkansas is essentially saying is, he wants \nconditional, he wants to have a vote on accession. And I would guess he \nalso would like to have an opportunity to offer amendments on the \npending bill. If the Senator says no amendments on the pending bill, \nthat is another matter. I would like to hear the Senator's views on \nthat--whether the Senator wants a straight up-or-down vote only on \nwhether China should be a member of the WTO, whether he would oppose \nall amendments, whether he believes, frankly, there should be no \namendments or not. That would be an interesting question.\n  Anyway, Mr. President, I made my main point, which is, let's have the \nvote, let's have the vote on MFN extension, not on the overall policy, \nbecause it has never happened before. In all the trade agreements that \nhave been submitted to the WTO and in all the questions of accession to \nthe WTO in the past--there have been 110 of them--never has a Congress \nvoted, never.\n  And there are reasons. There are executive agreements. If we were to \nvote on it, particularly in this body, as a nonparliamentary form of \ngovernment, it would be filled up with all different types of issues \nwhich are virtually unrelated to trade--very important issues: Human \nrights, national security, missile proliferation, nuclear \nproliferation, labor laws, environmental laws, but not WTO accession.\n  So I say, let's not vote for the Senator's amendment. Let's look at \nWTO when it comes up in the context of MFN. Then let's also work to \nengage China on all of the other issues on which we are dealing with \nChina but on separate tracks, separate ways, because that is going to \nbe a lot more effective. We should not link all this together. We \nshould not link it together, but, rather, deal with these issues \nseparately.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I appreciate the concern of the Senator \nfrom Arkansas regarding the possibility of China's entry into the World \nTrade Organization (WTO). However, I do not believe his amendment is \nwarranted, and urge the Senate to reject it.\n  The issue before us is the accession of China into the WTO. There is \nno question that China's accession into the world trading system \ncarries important ramifications--not only for their economy, but for \nours (and indeed, for those of all other WTO nations). Today, China is \nthe world's third largest economy after the US and Japan, and the \nworld's eleventh largest trading nation. US-China trade alone is more \nthan $80 billion.\n  Clearly, because of these facts, we have much to gain by bringing \nChina\n\n[[Page S2907]]\n\ninto the world trading system and subjecting her to the WTO rules and \nregulations. At the same time, we understand that bringing China into \nthe system also will mean some changes for our own industries. However, \nas long as China is brought in according to appropriate terms and \nconditions, I believe we have far more to gain than to lose.\n  The China WTO accession negotiations have dragged on for 13 years \nnow. Much of the delay is related to the periodic changes of mind by \nthe Chinese government as to whether they really want to join or not. \nAfter all, it will mean enormous changes for them as well. At the \nmoment, the Chinese appear very interested in concluding their \naccession. I believe we should take this opportunity to see what might \nbe accomplished.\n  That said, the United States has said repeatedly that China may enter \nonly--and I stress, only--on ``commercially meaningful'' terms. Despite \nthe current Chinese enthusiasm for the negotiations, if it does not \nlead to a ``commercially meaningful'' agreement, then the \nadministration cannot accept it.\n  That is a crystal clear fact. We in Congress has made clear that an \nagreement that is not ``commercially meaningful'' is unacceptable. \nUSTR, Treasury, the State Department, and USDA know this. They fully \nunderstand that they will have one chance, and one chance only, to \npresent us with an agreement. All the Chinese enthusiasm in the world \ncannot change that fact. Thus, I believe that the administration will \nnot--and indeed cannot--bring home an accession agreement that does not \nmeet those terms.\n  The amendment before us would have Congress vote on the accession of \nChina. Yet that is not the process that we follow for accession of new \nWTO members. Since 1995, 12 countries have joined the WTO. Congress has \nnot voted on any of them. This would be a bad precedent to send. It \nwould open a whole hornet's nest of votes on China's policies, trade or \notherwise. And, given that the administration knows that a bad deal \nwill not pass muster here, I would argue that it's just not necessary.\n  I say to my colleagues: let's let the experts do their job. They have \ntheir guidance from Congress. The USTR team, led by our experienced and \ntough Special Representative Charlene Barshefsky, have been working on \nChina accession for years, and know the issues inside out. I am \nconfident that they won't--indeed, can't--let us down.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join with the distinguished chairman \nof the Finance Committee in opposing the pending amendment. I do agree \nwith the senator from Arkansas that the Congress ought to take a close \nlook at the terms of any agreement that is reached with China regarding \nits accession to the WTO. But that is already provided for in the law. \nUnder section 122 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act, the \nadministration must consult with the appropriate committees with regard \nto the accession of any country to the WTO. Those consultations are now \ntaking place. I am assured that Ambassador Barshefsky will meet with \neach and every Senator who has an interest in this matter.\n  Moreover, as a participant in the WTO's Working Party on the \nAccession of China, the United States already has an effective veto \nover China's admission if we determine that the protocol of accession \nand China's market access commitments are inadequate. Since the Working \nParty operates by consensus, we could simply block the approval of the \nWorking Party report and that would be the end of the matter.\n  It is clear that bringing China within the WTO framework--and subject \nto the WTO's rules--would be in the United States' interest. China is \nranked as one of the top ten exporting countries in the world (WTO \nreport, 1997 ranking) and ranks as the 12th largest importer. It must \ncertainly be to the benefit of the world trading system to have China \nabide by the same rules as others.\n  American farmers and businesses also have an interest in securing \nimproved access to China's market, and the WTO accession negotiations \nmay provide the best opportunity that we will have in a very long time.\n  Certainly the United States should not accept an agreement that would \nbend the rules for China. Nor should we settle for a minimal market \naccess package. And we will not. But neither should we cut off the \nnegotiations at this point, which I fear this amendment would do. In \nessence, it signals, at a minimum, great skepticism on the part of the \nUnited States Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, whatever frustrations many of us may have \nright now regarding our bilateral relations with China, including \nallegations of Chinese espionage against our national labs, the \ndeteriorating human rights situation in that country, the ballooning \ntrade deficit, and more, we need to be careful about micro-managing the \nExecutive as it conducts comprehensive negotiations over the terms of \nChina's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO).\n  Congress' voice ought to be heard on this subject, and it will be. \nThe Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 precludes granting \nunconditional MFN (permanent normal trade relations status) without a \nCongressional vote. By law, we will have the opportunity to carefully \nreview and pass judgment on whatever agreement the Administration \nreaches with China, whenever that may occur: during Premier Zhu \nRongji's visit next month, later this year, or perhaps years from now.\n  Ambassador Barshefsky and the other USTR officials negotiating \ndirectly with the Chinese deserve credit for appropriately consulting \nwith Congress. Just yesterday lead negotiator Bob Cassidy reviewed in \ngreat detail with our staffs all aspects of the negotiations. Active \nconsultations at this stage make sense, but the Senate directly \nintervening in the process by requiring a congressional vote on a WTO \nagreement with China--on the front and back ends of the protocol \nnegotiations--is redundant, unnecessary, and tramples on Executive \nbranch prerogatives. On those grounds, I support the tabling motion.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs, I rise in opposition to the Hutchinson \namendment and urge my colleagues to vote to table it.\n  I support China's accession to the WTO. I believe that it is in our \nown best interests to draw China further into the world community \nthrough fora such as the WTO. It will benefit the United States by \ncreating a more-equal trade relationship between us, and will work to \npromote the rule of law in China. I also believe that it will benefit \nthe United States by taking bilateral trade disputes which may pop up \nbetween us and making them multilateral, thereby minimizing the \nopportunity for those disputes to spill over and infect the rest of our \nrelationship.\n  Of course, my support has an important caveat. China must accede on \nwhat are called ``commercially acceptable principles.'' China cannot \naccede as a developing country in some areas, and a developed country \nin others, leaving it to China to determine which are which. If the \ntime comes for China's accession, Mr. President, you can be sure that \nif I am not convinced that the terms of China's accession are \ncommercially acceptable, I will be the first Member to rush to this \nfloor to oppose accession.\n  This amendment though, Mr. President, is not about the mechanics of \naccession to the WTO. Rather, it is yet another thinly-veiled attempt \nby its author--one in a long series of attempts--to single China out \nand punish it for offenses--real or imagined--committed in other \nspheres. Let me be clear: there is no argument that there aren't \nproblems in our relationship with China, serious problems that we need \nto address. But there are more appropriate ways to address those \nproblems. WTO accession is a trade issue. It is not a human rights \nissue. It is not a military issue. It is not a technology or nuclear \ntransfer issue. It is not an issue about how China treats Taiwan or \nHong Kong or Tibet. The issue should not be linked under the guise of a \nWTO debate; we should not turn a decision on WTO into a referendum on \nthe immediate state of our overall bilateral relationship.\n  In addition, the sponsor makes a great deal of only wanting to pass \nthis amendment in order to afford the Senate the opportunity to debate \nand then\n\n[[Page S2908]]\n\nvote on all the merits of China's accession should that time come. But \nMr. President, we already have that opportunity. If and when China \naccedes to the WTO, that is not the end of the process. Congress still \nhas to vote on extending permanent most-favored nation status to China. \nThat debate will give the Senate, and the sponsor, ample opportunity to \naddress all of the myriad issues surrounding China that he rightly \nfeels are so important. It will give us a chance to raise concerns \nabout human rights, military buildup, trade deficits, and all the rest. \nThere is no need to afford ourselves the same opportunity twice.\n  In addition, Mr. President, requiring this second vote has no \nprecedent. One hundred and ten countries have acceded to the WTO since \n1948, and not once has the Senate required that we be afforded a \nseparate vote on one of those accessions. But the Senator from Arkansas \nwould like to single China out and set a different standard for that \ncountry's accession, to treat it differently than any other country \nthat has come before it, or--presumably--would come after. I don't \nbelieve he can make a compelling case for doing so. Moreover, I am not \nconvinced that giving ourselves veto authority in this manner over a \ntrade agreement reached by the Executive Branch could pass \nconstitutional muster.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose \nthe amendment and support the motion to table of the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment offered by my \ndistinguished colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson. Like him, I \nam deeply concerned about the issues he is attempting to address with \nthis legislation--human rights violations and security concerns \ninvolving China, particularly the theft of scientific information from \nLos Alamos. I am concerned about China's military build-up, its \ncontinuing threats of force against Taiwan, and what is taking place in \nTibet. I believe that appropriately addressing these issues is vitally \nimportant and I look forward to working with Senator Hutchinson and \nothers to do so.\n  However, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I must oppose both the \nmethod and timing of this approach. It not only fails to allow the \nSenate to raise and address the sensitive issue of trade relations with \nChina in the appropriate forum of the Finance Committee--a forum where \nthe merits of such an amendment can be carefully studied and weighed \nagainst the best interests of our nation--but this approach also has \ntremendous foreign policy implications that need careful scrutiny.\n  Let me address the first concern. Trade negotiations and trade \nagreements go to the core of the Finance Committee's jurisdiction over \ntrade matters. Together with Senator Moynihan, I as Chair, and he as \nranking member, are responsible, not only for the Committee's \nsubstantive role in the trade policy process, but also are the \nguardians of its prerogatives. The Committee was the first formed in \nthe United States Congress when tariffs were the central source of \nrevenue to a still new republic. Trade and tariff policy remain central \nto the Committee's role in the legislative process.\n  For example, the Finance Committee reported out a trade bill the \nfirst day of the 106th Congress. In addition, at my instigation, the \nCommittee has launched a comprehensive review of America's trade \npolicy, including the role that China's accession to the WTO would play \nin our trade policy.\n  Unfortunately, there has been no attempt to offer this legislation \nand lay it before the Finance Committee for its review. Nor has there \nbeen any attempt by its supporters to engage with the Committee in the \nprocess of our review of America's trade policy.\n  Instead, this amendment seems to be driven by the emotions of the \nmoment toward a form of legislative anarchy. It has gone around the \nFinance Committee in a way that provides no time for the deliberations \nfor which the Senate is designed. It attempts to move legislation of \nmonumental importance to our trade and foreign policies on the back of \na supplemental appropriations measure principally designed to help \nimpoverished countries in Central America and to support the \nconstructive role Jordan has played in the Middle East peace process.\n  Beyond these procedural concerns, I am deeply concerned about the \nunderlying intent of this amendment. Is this bill being raised at this \ntime out of a concern that our trade negotiators will not strike a deal \nthat serves our commercial interests in China? Or is this bill being \noffered simply to hinder those negotiations in response to recent \nallegations of spying or the theft of secrets from Los Alamos?\n  I ask those questions because there seems to be a rush to pass this \nmeasure in advance of the visit of Zhu Rongji to the United States. It \nrests on the assumption that the United States will reach an agreement \non WTO accession and that, by virtue of that deal, China will enter the \nWTO the day after Zhu leaves.\n  That is simply wrong. Everything we hear of the negotiations is that \nit will be difficult even to reach an agreement on U.S. access to \nChina's market. I want to emphasize to my colleagues that a deal on \nmarket access, even if it is reached in time for the summit, is only \none step along the road to China's accession to the WTO. The more \ndifficult negotiations on when and how China will agree to be bound by \nthe basic rules of the WTO remain. No protocol of accession will be \napproved until those negotiations are complete.\n  In other words, there is no reason to act precipitously on this \nmeasure. There is no reason to subvert the normal legislative processes \nto secure passage of this amendment at this time. Indeed, the Finance \nCommittee is actively at work on trade matters as part of the trade \npolicy review I have initiated. That is the appropriate venue for the \ninitial discussion of this measure and any necessary refinements to my \ncolleague's approach.\n  China has been the subject of intense concern to the Finance \nCommittee. We have made it clear at every stage that constructive trade \nrelations with China must offer concrete assurances of U.S. market \naccess consistent with our national interest. We have also made it \nclear that there must be no rush to judgment or attempt to offer a \npolitically-motivated deal to the Chinese simply because the White \nHouse wants a foreign policy ``deliverable'' to cap the upcoming summit \nmeeting.\n  My impression from our discussion with Ambassador Barshefsky is that, \nwhile there has been considerable progress in recent days, there is \nstill a considerable distance to go even before the United States could \nagree to a package on market access, much less the more difficult \nprocess of negotiating the actual protocols of accession.\n  Beyond these reasons, Mr. President, I oppose Senator Hutchinson's \namendment on China's accession to the World Trade Organization because \nof the damaging precedent it would set for all future WTO accessions. \nIt would dramatically undercut the United States' consistent position--\nunder both Republican and Democrat presidents--that accession to the \nWTO and its predecessor organization, the GATT, is not a political \ndecision, but is one we as Americans base simply on another country's \nwillingness to be bound by the same rules that govern our other trading \npartners in the world trading system. It is quintessentially a \ncommercial agreement that should be judged on its merits as such.\n  I also oppose this amendment as a matter of Senate procedure. I have \nalways objected to attempts to legislate on appropriations measures. \nOffering substantive amendments to appropriations bills subverts the \nnormal process of the Senate by which legislation is introduced, moved \nthrough the committee of jurisdiction with expertise on the matter, and \nmoved to the floor.\n  Attempts to modify substantive law on the back of appropriations \nbills often results in the delay of the appropriations themselves. \nWhether my colleagues support the current supplemental or not, I think \nwe would all agree that the bill deserves to rise or fall on its own \nmerits, not as a result of extraneous and unrelated matters.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against Senator \nHutchinson's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, might I inquire as to how much time \neach side has remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 11 minutes 15\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\nseconds. The Senator from Montana has 9 minutes 52 seconds.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  If I might just briefly respond to a few of the points that my good \nfriend from Montana made in his excellent statement.\n  It seems to me to be a difficult proposition to come to the floor of \nthe Senate and argue that we should not have a debate and to argue we \nshould not have a vote on the admission of China to the World Trade \nOrganization. Yet that is the posture which the opponents of this \namendment must be.\n  The Senator from Montana has said it would be an ``alarming \nprecedent''--I believe those are the exact words--that has never \nhappened before. In many ways, China is unprecedented. They are \nunprecedented in their size, their population, and their impact upon \nworld events. And in many ways the abuses that are currently going on \nby their government to their own people are unprecedented. It is \nunprecedented to have a nation in the World Trade Organization with 40 \npercent of the economy controlled by the state. That is unprecedented.\n  Perhaps that is a good reason to have a debate on this issue and have \na vote on who should be admitted to the World Trade Organization, since \nit would be unprecedented for a nation of this size, with such a mixed \neconomic system, to be admitted to the World Trade Organization. It is \nunprecedented to admit to this trade organization a nation that views \nus as a hostile power and, as evidence indicates, has aggressively \nspied on the United States and stolen nuclear secrets from the United \nStates.\n  To say it is an ``alarming precedent,'' I think is a great \noverstatement. In fact, if there was ever a reason to change the \nprecedent, it would be because of China's behavior.\n  The Senator from Montana said amendments would certainly be messy. \nThat is what democracy is about. That is what happens; that is what \ndebates are about; that is what freedom is about. It might be messy; it \nmight be unpleasant to vote on amendments that might be offered. But to \nrespond to the question of the Senator from Montana, I am more than \ndelighted to have a straight up-or-down vote with no amendments. If we \nwere in the House of Representatives, we could have the Rules Committee \nprovide such an order; we would have no amendments, and we would vote \nup or down on whether China ought to go into the World Trade \nOrganization. I am delighted to have such an opportunity, and I make a \ncommitment to that right now. If we have a unanimous consent, at the \nappropriate time, I support having a clean vote on China's accession to \nthe World Trade Organization.\n\n  I was somewhat surprised to hear my colleague from Montana say China \nhas not been a bad boy, they have been a good boy; a number of things \nthey helped us with--Pakistan and India. They had signed international \nagreements. They had shown restraint.\n  They have been adjudged one of the greatest proliferators of weapons \nof mass destruction in the world today. In fact, they were a great \ncontributor to the problems and the arms race that has developed \nbetween Pakistan and India.\n  Signed international agreements--indeed, they have signed \ninternational agreements. Last year, they signed the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, and since they signed that \ninternational agreement our State Department has adjudged their \nbehavior on civil and political rights abysmal. They have a new and \nvicious and brutal crackdown upon the rights of their own people. That \nis the international agreement.\n  My colleague said they have shown restraint, not like the \nadventuresome nature of their politics 25 years ago; they have shown \nrestraint. Well, I don't believe it is restraint for them to vigorously \nmodernize their weapon systems and to vigorously seek American \ntechnology through legal and illegal means.\n  All of that aside, some of the questions were answered, but many of \nthe questions I raised were not addressed at all and have nothing to do \nwith anything other than trade and the economy. But they are questions \nthat need to be debated, questions that need to be answered. Are we \nlowering the WTO bar for access to the Chinese? To say that we can deny \nthem permanent MFN after the fact, after they have been admitted to the \nWTO, and that will be our vote, I think begs the question. There will \nbe such international pressure for permanent MFN if we have already \nsupported their admission to the WTO that it will be inexorable. It \nwill be a fait accompli. But the evidence clearly is that we are \nsetting a different standard for China.\n  In my discussions with the State Department over a year ago, they \nmade it very clear to me that they were debating within the State \nDepartment whether we would have greater influence on China with them \nin at a lower standard, or out waiting for them to change and to make \nthe necessary reforms. It is very clear that the administration has \npursued the idea of lowering the standards so that China could be \nbrought in prematurely. Admitting them as a developing country is \nchanging the standards for China. These are issues which have not been \naddressed today in our debate but need to be addressed by the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I will not go through all of those questions again, but they are \nimportant questions. The Senate and the Congress should not keep \n``punting'' on trade issues. We have a constitutional role. We are a \ncoequal power with the executive branch. This is an opportunity for us \nto regain our voice on those very, very important issues that affect \nthe lives of every American. The issue today is not do we want China in \nthe WTO; the issue is do we want to have an opportunity to debate that \nand to vote on that. That is the issue.\n\n  I have said, and I will say again, I want China in the World Trade \nOrganization at the right time and under the right circumstances. But I \ndo not believe that we should allow the administration to make a \nunilateral decision coopting the constitutional right of the House and \nSenate to express itself on this very, very important issue.\n  I hope that this amendment will be passed, that we will have the \nopportunity at the appropriate time to vote yes or no on China's \nadmission to the World Trade Organization. I hope that the reforms are \nmade in China so that I could vote yes on that. I would like to see \nthat, but I believe that we have the greatest leverage we will ever \nhave in bringing about reforms before we concede ahead of time that \nthey should go into the WTO.\n  I believe this is an eminently reasonable amendment because we are \nnot prejudging what the outcome should be. We are simply saying we \nshould have the right to vote. We should say yes or no--not trade \nnegotiators in a vacuum apart from those who were elected by the people \nto represent.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has a little under 4 \nminutes, and the Senator from Montana has a little under 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will take just 2 or 3 minutes before I yield back my \ntime. We are getting into the repetitious stage.\n  Let me say that it is important to think about the precedent. \nCongress has never voted on this issue before. There are a lot of other \ncountries that are going to be seeking membership in the WTO. They are \nbasically former Soviet Union republics. Russia--name them. They all \nare going to be looking for membership in the WTO. If we start voting \nnow on membership, I think we have to do the same for all the others, \nand they will get caught up in the other issues, too, that have already \nbeen discussed.\n  Frankly, the Senator from Arkansas made my case when he said that at \nthis time we have the greatest leverage. It sounds to me as if the \nleverage he is talking about is on human rights. It is on lots of \nissues. I just think that we do not want to get to a debate on China \npolicy if and when the U.S. executive branch seeks to have China become \na member of the WTO.\n  I also suggest to my good friend from Arkansas it is a good \nopportunity for the Senator and all of us who are concerned about the \nterms of China's infamous WTO, the economic terms, to make our case \nvery strenuously now with the administration, with Ambassador \nBarshefsky, with others in the administration, so that they do come\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\nup with terms that we would more likely agree with than not.\n  Now is the time. There are intense negotiations going on now. Premier \nZhu Rongji is about to visit this country. I think it is Premier Zhu \nRongji's visit to the United States which gives us ``leverage,'' \nbecause he will want to come with an agreement. We should make use of \nthat leverage by vigorously talking with the administration.\n  It has been a good debate and I think we should deal with all these \nissues of China separately, not in the context of WTO. I hope that the \nSenators would agree with the Senator from Alaska when he moves to \ntable the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I will take a moment, and then I will \nyield my remaining time.\n  I say that the leverage of which I speak--I think the Senator from \nMontana knows and agrees that the leverage is greater now before China \ngoes into the World Trade Organization. The issues of which I speak \ndeal primarily with trade issues. I hope we will use that leverage for \nhuman rights and nuclear nonproliferation across the board. But \ncertainly there are trade issues that are critically important.\n  We have almost a $60 billion deficit with China. They have great \nbarriers there, and we cannot lower the standards just so we can have a \npolitical announcement and have a gift that we are providing the \nChinese by saying we are going to support your accession to the World \nTrade Organization.\n  I didn't want to offer this amendment today. I would much rather that \nthis had gone through the committee. I would rather we had a different \nvehicle. But we are going out on Easter recess and the Premier is \ncoming to this country. The negotiations are coming to a head. This is \nthe only opportunity we have to ensure that we will have a voice on \nwhether or not they should go into the WTO.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment--not to table it but \npass the amendment and let the administration know how seriously we \ntake this issue, and that as a coequal branch of Government we should \nbe able to approve or disapprove whether China goes into the WTO.\n  There are serious issues that were not raised in this debate. We have \nhad a good debate, but there needs to be a much more thorough debate, \nwith many more Members involved. That will take place at the \nappropriate time if this amendment is passed. I ask colleagues to \nsupport it at the appropriate time.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is all time yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am constrained to make a motion to \ntable because I believe that this amendment, if not tabled, would take \na considerable amount of time. I served in China in World War II. I \nwould like to be involved at length in this debate, but this is not the \ntime or the place for that debate.\n  I hope all Senators will understand that I make this motion merely to \ntry to control this supplemental and get it ready for a conference at \nthe earliest possible moment.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that will be postponed until 2:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the only \namendment that would be in order between this time and 2:30 would be \nthe Torricelli-Harkin amendment, that there be no second-degree \namendments, and that if the Senators finish the use of their time prior \nto that time, the Senate stand in recess until 2:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 92\n\n(Purpose: To terminate the funding and investigation of any independent \ncounsel in existence more than 3 years, 6 months after the termination \n                  of the independent counsel statute)\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli], for himself, \n     Mr. Harkin, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Reid, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 92.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 45, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITATION OF FUNDING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Effective December 31, 1999, funding \n     authorized pursuant to the third and fourth provisos under \n     the heading ``salaries and expenses, general legal \n     activities'' under the heading ``Legal activities'' under the \n     heading ``GENERAL ADMINISTRATION'' in title II of Public Law \n     100-202 (101 Stat. 1329-9; 28 U.S.C. 591 note) shall not be \n     available to an independent counsel, appointed before June \n     30, 1996, pursuant to chapter 40 of title 28, United States \n     Code.\n       (b) Pending Investigations.--Any investigation or \n     prosecution of a matter being conducted by an independent \n     counsel, appointed before June 30, 1996, pursuant to chapter \n     40 of title 28, United States Code, and the jurisdiction over \n     that matter, shall be transferred to the Attorney General by \n     December 31, 1999.\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nIowa, Senator Harkin, and on behalf of Senator Durbin, Senator \nFeinstein, and Senator Reid of Nevada, to offer an amendment to bring \nsome rational conclusion and fair determination to the issue of \nindependent counsels in the U.S. Government.\n  I begin with a simple admission. In 1994, as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, I voted for and argued for the enactment of an \nindependent counsel statute. I was not mindful then, as I am now, of \nthe complete record and statements as to the likely outcome of the \nindependent counsel statute.\n  Howard Baker, then a Member of this institution, argued that the \nindependent counsel statute would ``establish a virtual fourth branch \nof Government, and would substantially diminish the accountability of \nlaw enforcement to the President, the Congress, and the American \npeople.''\n  Acting Attorney General Robert Bork, warned: ``What you are doing \n[with the independent counsel statute] is building an office whose sole \nfunction is to attack the executive branch throughout its tenure. It is \nan institutionalized wolf hanging on the flank of the elk.''\n  Mr. President, I take no delight in admitting it, but it is \ninescapable. Mr. Baker, Mr. Bork, and other Members of this institution \nwere right. And many of us in my party, and, indeed, President Clinton, \nwho ultimately signed the law, were wrong.\n  It is now clear--I think unmistakably clear--that the independent \ncounsel law, when it expires on June 30, 1999, will not be \nreauthorized. There is not only not the votes in this Senate or in the \nother body, but there is not a rationale based on the historic \nexperience to allow this law to continue.\n  It brings me no pleasure to bring to the floor of the Senate the \nweight of the evidence that supports the conclusion that the law should \nexpire. But it is overwhelming, and it isn't only Kenneth Starr. \nIndependent counsels, from Walsh to Smaltz, have given us no choice but \nto close this unfortunate chapter. The list of abuses by independent \ncounsels are daunting, and they are dangerous. Mr. Starr has no \nmonopoly in his violations of law, ethics, or common sense. But the \ninvestigation that is now underway in the Justice Department of Judge \nStarr is still instructive. It teaches us a lot about the basic \nfailings of this law, how it can be abused, and why the amendment that \nI offer today, along with Senator Harkin, is of such value.\n  First, Mr. Starr apparently may have failed to inform the Attorney \nGeneral about his contacts with Paula Jones' attorneys. Indeed, he may \nhave misled the Attorney General on this issue.\n  Second, it is overwhelmingly clear that Mr. Starr, or his \nsubordinates, leaked confidential grand jury information in direct \nviolation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures.\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\n  Third, it is possible that Mr. Starr may have used questionable \nprosecutorial tactics by making an offer of immunity to Ms. Lewinsky \ncontingent on her not contacting her attorney.\n  These may not be the only violations of procedure or law, but they \ntell us something about the fact that there is something \ninstitutionally wrong with how the independent counsel statute has \nfunctioned.\n  I do not raise these things out of any vendetta against Mr. Starr, or \nhis tactics, or his office, because this is an institutional problem. \nIndeed, in the last few years, Donald Smaltz has spent $7 million \ninvestigating former Secretary of Agriculture Michael Espy. Last year, \nafter a 2-month trial, in which the defense never found it necessary to \ncall a single witness, that $7 million investigation resulted in a jury \nacquitting Mr. Espy on each and every one of the 30 counts in the \nindictment.\n\n  C. David Barrett spent $7 million investigating former HUD Secretary \nCisneros on allegations that he lied about payments to a former \nmistress. Mr. Barrett went so far as to indict the former mistress over \nmisstatements on a mortgage application form. Nor is it limited to this \nadministration.\n  In the previous administration, after a 6-year investigation, \nLawrence Walsh indicted Casper Weinberger only 5 months before the 1992 \nPresidential election in either a moment of political convenience, or \nworse. Mr. Walsh had spent $40 million over 7 years in his \ninvestigation.\n  I believe it is now clear that, despite the best of intentions and \nour frustration with the Watergate experience, we now know the \nindependent counsel statute is deeply flawed. It has created a \nprosecutor that is accountable to no one. It is a contradiction with \nthe most basic lessons of our Founding Fathers in the Constitutional \nConvention. Indeed, in Federalist 51, Madison sums up the need for \nchecks and balances of every office, every center of power in the \nFederal Government, with a simple phrase ``Ambition must be made to \ncounteract ambition.''\n  Mr. Walsh, Mr. Barrett, Mr. Starr, and Mr. Smaltz are ambitious men, \nbut their ambition is met with no countervailing power.\n  There is, in theory, in the Office of the Attorney General the \nopportunity to dismiss for cause, to hold accountable, but in the \npolitical realities of our time no Attorney General could exercise that \nauthority against an independent counsel investigating an \nadministration in which he or she is a component part.\n  The Congress does not even control the ability of oversight of \nexpenditures. As a Member of the Senate, and as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee with oversight responsibilities for the Judiciary, \nfor the operation of the Attorney General, I wrote to Mr. Starr and to \nthe Justice Department asking about how this $50 million had been spent \nand received nothing but a vague reply with broad categories. Mr. \nStarr's office remains the only functioning office in the entire U.S. \nGovernment where the people's representatives cannot inform on behalf \nof the people how millions upon millions of dollars are spent. But \nmostly, I suppose, if the money were wasted and power were exercised \nresponsibly but the net result was still a rising level of public \nconfidence in public integrity, it might be worth the abuse or the \nexpenditure. But this isn't the case either.\n  The independent counsel statute has not succeeded in removing \npolitics from prosecution. It has brought a new element to politics, \nthe hijacking of these offices, the use of them for their own political \npurposes, only now without oversight. Public confidence in the \nadministration of justice has not only not improved but it has \ncompletely failed.\n  Now it is being argued that the law will expire and there will never \nbe independent counsels again. I believe that is an accurate portrayal \nof the situation, but the current five independent counsels should \nsimply be allowed to continue in their work. The question remains, how \nlong and for how much?\n  Mr. Starr has suggested his investigation may go to the year 2001. He \nhas the power for it to continue until the year 2010, 2020. When will \nMr. Barrett complete his case, in this decade or the next? And, if $50 \nmillion was an outrage by the public for the expenditures of Mr. Starr, \nthere is nothing between here and his expenditure of $100 million, $200 \nmillion. Is he the only person in the Federal Government who will \nretain the power to unilaterally spend unlimited sums of funds with no \noversight for any purpose?\n\n  That is what brings me to the floor today with Senator Harkin, to \noffer an amendment that allows Mr. Starr, Mr. Barrett, and the other \nthree remaining independent counsels to continue with their \ninvestigation for 6 months after the expiration of the independent \ncounsel statute on June 30. For the remainder of this year, they retain \ntheir authority, their budget appropriations, and they should complete \ntheir files and prepare their cases. During that 6 months, they should \nwork with professional prosecutors in the Justice Department, the \nPublic Integrity Section, as applicable, and prepare the transfer of \ntheir cases. The cases will continue. They will be in able hands with \nprofessional prosecutors, with ample resources.\n  This law is not intended to end any investigation. It will not end \nany investigation, but it will allow for the orderly transfer of these \ninvestigations and prosecutions within the Justice Department. Those \ntwo investigations which have not had independent counsels appointed \nfor 3 years, involving Secretary Herman and Secretary Babbitt, are not \naffected by this amendment. It is our belief those independent counsels \nhave not had at least 3 years to prepare their cases. We will give them \nevery benefit: Take the time as independent counsels after the law has \nexpired, prepare your cases, continue the prosecution if you have a \ncase, or dismiss it if you do not. This amendment is reserved only for \nthose cases where more than 3 years has expired and where, after the \nexpiration of the independent counsel statute, there is a need to then \nproceed.\n  I believe this amendment is fair. It will help restore public \nconfidence and allow the Congress to know the taxpayers' money is being \nspent properly. It will transition the Federal Government into the \npost-independent counsel statute method of dealing with these important \nquestions.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Durbin for joining with Senator \nHarkin and with me in offering this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with respect to my colleague from New \nJersey and the other cosponsors of this amendment, I rise to oppose the \namendment. I understand some of what has moved them to have the strong \nfeelings they do that lead to this amendment, but I think it is \ncertainly ill timed and ultimately ill advised.\n  I say it is ill timed because the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \non which I am honored to serve as the ranking Democratic member, is in \nthe middle of an inquiry, holding hearings on the fundamental question \nof whether to reauthorize the independent counsel statute, hearings \nwhich will continue for at least a month more. I think it is worth \nletting that process work what we hope will be its thoughtful and \nconstructive way.\n  I know many of my colleagues oppose reauthorizing the statute, and \nthat is true of Members on both sides of the political aisle, just as I \nam heartened by the fact that Members on both sides of the political \naisle support the retention of the independent counsel statute or some \nversion of it. I hope we can work together to develop a law that \nestablishes the principles of independence of investigation when the \nhighest officials of our Government are suspected of criminal behavior. \nIt may take some time and some convincing. Most people believe this \nwill not happen by the June 30 expiration date of the current statute. \nThe statute, therefore, may lapse for a time while we work on this. But \nthat would not be a catastrophe, because under existing law the \nindependent counsel who are in effect now would continue to do their \nwork.\n  Regardless of how the underlying question of whether we have an \nindependent counsel--inside the Justice Department, outside the Justice \nDepartment--or not, is resolved, I believe it would be a serious \nmistake to single out, as this amendment does, what I\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\ngather to be four of the independent counsels for termination while \ntheir investigations are ongoing. In that sense, this amendment is not \njust a preemptive attack on the statute while we are still considering \nas a committee and as a body whether to reauthorize it, it is what \nmight be called a personal attack on the most controversial independent \ncounsels. In that sense, it actually cuts against the purpose of the \nstatute in the first place, which was to provide for independence of \ninvestigation and prosecution. The fear was, when the statute was \ndrafted and adopted in 1978 after Watergate, that prosecution--\ninvestigation of high-ranking officials of our Government would be \ninterfered with by people in the executive branch who would be affected \nby those investigations.\n  There is a way in which this amendment puts Congress in a position of \ncompromising the independence of these investigations. Under the \namendment, all the independent counsel investigations besides the ones \ncovered still operating after the law expires on June 30, would \ncontinue. It is not until they reach the 3-year deadline in the \namendment, but until their work had been completed and their offices \nwere terminated pursuant to the statutory provisions which are \ncurrently in effect.\n  There are two other ongoing independent counsel investigations begun \nin 1998 which, as my friend and colleague from New Jersey, I believe, \njust indicated, would never be affected--in fact, would never be \naffected by this amendment. Similarly, there may be other independent \ncounsel currently operating under court seal, which we would therefore \nnot know about, who would not be affected. And the Attorney General may \nappoint additional independent counsel before the statute expires on \nJune 30. All of these would not be affected. This amendment as I \nunderstand it and read it, affects only four independent counsel: \nKenneth Starr, David Barrett, Donald Smaltz, and Larry Thompson.\n\n  I am not rising to oppose this amendment because I want to defend the \ninvestigations that these four men have carried out. I do not want to. \nI don't need to. Some of the criticisms of their work may be valid; \nsome may not be. But that is not the point, as I see it. The point is, \nand the question is: Do we in Congress want to set the precedent of \nterminating an ongoing separate branch investigation and prosecution \nfor whatever the reason that it has aroused our opposition? I think \nthis would be a bad precedent which smacks of violation of the \nseparation of powers doctrine and values.\n  I know we maintain the power of the purse, and it is an important \npower, but it has to be exercised with great discretion and \nsensitivity, particularly when we are affecting one of the other \nbranches of Government and particularly when we are affecting a branch \nof Government whose particular participants here are involved in \ncontroversial independent investigations. It was no accident that the \nframers of the Constitution went out of their way in a whole series of \ncases, including in the impeachment provisions in the Constitution \nwhich we have just come through, to make it very clear that Congress \ndoes not have the power to prosecute. That was one of the lessons the \nframers learned from their own history. So, as we remember in the \nimpeachment provisions, and it was central to the decision that many of \nus made, that impeachment existed not to prosecute the President in \nthat case.\n  That was something that the Constitution tells us could be done after \nan individual left office by the appropriate branch of government. I \nworry very much about the effect of the precedent that will be set \nhere, understanding some of the concerns that motivate the amendment, \nbut thinking beyond the current situation. A precedent would be set for \nCongress to intervene and terminate independent criminal investigations \nand/or prosecutions. We do not have to do it. The law makes clear that \nthere are others who can take these steps. The independent counsel \nstatute itself contains a mechanism by which the Attorney General can \nremove any independent counsel, including these four, for cause. So far \nshe has declined to use that authority. I think to some extent what is \ninvolved here is our respect for her right, as the Nation's chief law \nenforcement officer, to make the decision as to whether to use the \npower we have given her in statute to decide whether or not to remove \nthese four independent counsel.\n  Why should we presume to replace our judgment for hers? The statute \nalso contains a provision by which either the Attorney General, the \nindependent counsel, or the special panel of three appellate judges can \nmove to terminate an investigation, if its work has been substantially \ncompleted, whether or not the independent counsel himself thinks that \nis the case. This amendment makes an exception to those ongoing \nstatutory provisions for four independent counsel. It is not the proper \nrole of Congress, in my belief, to decide that certain prosecutors \nshould be fired in the midst of their work. We should apply the same \nprovisions of the law to those independent counsel whose investigations \nhave displeased us, either because of the content or the length of the \ninvestigations, as we do for those that have not displeased us.\n  Even if this amendment's 3-year cutoff applied equally to all of the \nindependent counsel, it may well constitute an unjustifiable \ninterference in ongoing criminal investigations.\n  The independent counsel statute, as it exists today and as I \nmentioned earlier, grandfathers existing investigations, if the statute \nis not renewed, for a number of very good reasons. Among them are that \nafter a prosecutor has spent time on a lengthy and complex \ninvestigation, he has built up a store of information, institutional \nmemory, ongoing leads and relationships. Much of that would be lost if \nthese cases were turned over to the Department of Justice midstream. \nAgain and again, I have heard critics of the independent counsel \nstatute complain of the inefficiencies involved in requiring newly \nappointed independent counsel to find office space and assemble staff \nbefore they begin their work, but we need to weigh carefully whether \nthere are greater inefficiencies and greater harms involved in tearing \napart these offices before they have finished their work. The \ninefficiencies, I think, would be compounded if we in Congress \nultimately pass a statute to replace the current law.\n  The legislative process has barely begun on the question of whether \nor not to renew in its current form or some revised form the \nIndependent Counsel statute. None of us, certainly not I, can say where \nthis will lead. Perhaps a new independent counsel would have to be \nappointed and attempt to reconstruct the work that had been done. \nBefore a new law is passed, it is not clear to me how the Attorney \nGeneral would be expected to handle the investigations that would be \nreturned to the Department at the end of the year.\n  Yesterday, in testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nthe Attorney General promised to continue appointing independent \ncounsel where necessary, pursuant to regulations, if the current \nstatute expires.\n  The amendment before us may have the ironic effect of requiring the \nAttorney General to immediately appoint a new independent counsel to \nresume investigations and prosecutions that were already well underway \ntowards completion, which I fear might mean not only a bad precedent \nand principle, but additional expenses as well.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the Attorney General declared yesterday that \nshe is opposed to reauthorizing the independent counsel statute, but I \nthink it is fair to say that she nonetheless saw dangers, problems \nimplicit in the pursuit and purpose of the amendment before us now. I \nthought she urged us to reject it. At least she said it didn't make \nsense to her. I admire her forthrightness on both counts, though I \ndisagree with her on one. Whether or not you support the independent \ncounsel statute, I hope my colleagues will think twice before going on \nrecord and supporting the precedent of premature termination by \nCongress of prosecutors who are appointed to be independent guardians \nof justice, independent from the executive branch and independent from \nthe legislative branch as well.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  I want to make certain that the record is complete and accurate. The\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\nSenator has suggested that it would be interfering with an ongoing \ncriminal investigation. The Senator understands that in these 6 months, \nthe independent counsel would have time to take their cases, as they \nare now prepared, and their relatively small offices and give them to \nprofessional prosecutors in the Justice Department who have been \npursuing similar or more important cases for years. There is no \ndiminution in resources, quality of personnel, or ability to pursue the \ncase. Ironically, this is probably bad news for the potential \ndefendants, because they are going to be facing much more experienced \nprosecutors.\n  I just wanted to make certain that was clear on the record and the \nSenator understood that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Jersey. I do \nunderstand it. My reaction to it is that we are still taking from these \noffices that have been working on these cases and establishing a \nprecedent for various reasons. It is a precedent that can be misused, \nas time goes on, of terminating an ongoing independent counsel \nprosecution by the individual, firing the individual who is doing it, \nturning it over to the Justice Department, which, of course, has many, \nmany capable and experienced lawyers, but who have not been working on \nthis case. Therefore, I think that it would suffer not only from \nredundancy and inefficiency, but most of all, I worry, no matter what \nwe think about these four or the independent counsel statute, it would \nset a bad precedent of legislative intervention into independent \ninvestigation and prosecution.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, will the Senator continue to yield for \none more inquiry?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. The point was made, as well, as to whether or not \nthis is an unconstitutional interference. The right of the Congress to \nreassign responsibilities, to reassign appropriations, of course, is an \ninnate part of the function of Congress. The Senator from Connecticut, \nas did the Senator from New Jersey, I am sure, voted, for example, for \nthe State Department reauthorization, the Department of Energy \nreauthorization, where we simply reassigned executive responsibilities \nas part of our constitutional power.\n\n  Finally, I, too, was there for the Attorney General yesterday. The \nSenator from Connecticut may remember, I asked her, in my concluding \nquestions, whether or not the Justice Department had the resources to \ndeal with these cases. She was confident they would and could deal with \nthese cases so that justice was done and there was no diminution of \neffort in the pursuit of justice in these cases.\n  I simply want the Record to reflect that her answer was affirmative. \nI thank the Senator from Connecticut for yielding and apologize to the \nSenator from Iowa for taking the time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend from New Jersey. I will speak for a \nmoment more and then yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  I think the Attorney General yesterday was asked two different \nquestions, quite different, and didn't give inconsistent answers, but I \nthink my interpretation was, she said that an amendment of this kind \nwould be unwise. She did say that if it was agreed to, the Department, \nas the Senator from New Jersey has indicated, would be capable of \npicking up these cases.\n  Secondly, I want to indicate that I am not reaching a constitutional \njudgment that this is a violation of separation of powers. I have tried \nto be careful in my comments to state that. I do think it evokes \nseparation of powers concerns and values. Taking the example that the \nSenator from New Jersey gives of reauthorization of State Department or \nEnergy Department Offices, to me this would be a little bit like \nabolishing an assistant secretaryship in one of those Departments \nbecause we didn't like the work that the particular Assistant Secretary \nwas doing and saying, turn it over to the Secretary of State or \nSecretary of Energy and let them do it the way they want to do it. \nWhile we have the power to do that and we have the power of the purse, \nit would set a precedent that could come back to haunt us.\n\n  I thank my colleagues, I thank my friend from New Jersey, and I yield \nto the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to the \narguments made by the author of the amendment, Senator Torricelli--of \ncourse, I am a cosponsor of the amendment--and the very lucid and well \nthought out arguments of my friend from Connecticut.\n  First I will respond to my friend from Connecticut by saying that he \nused the word ``ill-timed'' on a number of occasions in his argument. I \nquite disagree with my friend on that. I believe this is perfect \ntiming.\n  What are we talking about here? We are on a supplemental \nappropriations bill. We are making some cuts someplace. We are spending \nmoney. We are trying to reach some emergency spending moneys that we \nneed, and we are all looking for places to save money. Here is one \nplace we can save some money. That is what this is about, too.\n  If there is one thing I continually hear from my constituents in Iowa \nand from people around the country, it is, ``How much more money are \nyou going to pour down that rat hole?'' How much more money are we \ngoing to spend on these special prosecutors that go on and on and on? I \nthink the timing is very appropriate right now, when we are on an \nappropriations bill talking about how much money we are spending and \nhow much money we can save to meet critical needs in this country. I \nthink it is very appropriately timed on this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the Starr investigation has been traumatic for this \ncountry, it has been divisive for our national fabric, and these gaping \nwounds need to be healed. The focus so far has been on allowing the \nindependent counsel statute to lapse on the assumption that it will put \nan end to the episode. In reality, that is far from the case.\n  The independent counsel statute will lapse on June 30, but it does \nnot put an end to the ongoing investigations. Keep in mind that the \namendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey and others, of which I \nam a cosponsor, basically goes just to those investigations that have \nbeen ongoing for over 3 years. There are a couple that are less than 3 \nyears. Our amendment does not touch them.\n  We are only answering the three--actually there are four. The Senator \nfrom Connecticut mentioned the fourth one. It caught me by surprise and \nI had to look it up. It turns out the fourth one is an ongoing \ninvestigation into Secretary of HUD Samuel R. Pierce. If I am not \nmistaken, he was Secretary of HUD under Ronald Reagan. They still have \nan investigation going on him. It just goes to show you, these things \njust go on year after year after year.\n  What we are saying is, if we have an independent counsel who has been \noperating for more than 3 years, in 6 months--by the end of this year--\nthey have to close up shop and turn it over to the Justice Department.\n  We are not saying that no one will be let off. No appeal is going to \nbe dropped. No valid investigative lead will be abandoned. The cases \nwill be pursued in keeping with Justice Department rules by some of the \nmost experienced prosecutors in the country.\n\n  Again, I point out there is little doubt that these cases will be \nunder scrutiny internally at the Justice Department, certainly by the \nmedia and by the Congress.\n  We have a President, an Executive, of one party, Congress run by \nanother party. I daresay there are going to be some checks and balances \nhere. Anyone who thinks this can be smothered by the Justice Department \ndoes not recognize how this town works. What it will do is save us a \nlot of money, and that is what I keep hearing about from my \nconstituents.\n  Until I started looking at this independent counsel law during the \nimpeachment trial we had in the Senate, I had not paid all that much \nattention to it. In fact, I admit freely, when the extension passed in \n1993, I was one of those who voted to extend it. I wish now I had not, \nbecause I think it has run amok. That is why I will be in favor of \nletting it expire on June 30.\n  In looking at this, I was trying to find out how Ken Starr could rack \nup a bill between $40 million and $50 million in less than 3 years. How \ncould that be possible?\n  I began trying to find the line items where he was spending the \nmoney. Guess what I found out. We cannot get\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\nthat information. I can go to the Department of Agriculture and I can \nfind out where every last nickel they spend goes. I can go to the \nDefense Department and find out exactly where every nickel they spend \ngoes. They have to line item everything. That is true of any branch of \nGovernment but not of the independent counsel. Believe it or not, you \ncannot find out where he is spending the money. All they have to put it \nunder is general broad categories, summaries.\n  For example, here is a bill, and this came from the Los Angeles \nTimes. They said they paid $30,517 for psychological analysis of \nevidence in the suicide of former White House lawyer Vincent Foster by \nthe same Washington group that looked into the untimely death of rock \nmusician Kurt Cobain. What is that all about?\n  Then there is $370 a month in parking. We do not know who for or what \nfor, but it is there, $370 a month. Here is $729,000 on five private \ninvestigators who were hired to supplement dozens of FBI agents. What \ndid it go for? Where did that money go? We do not know. Here is a \nreport that Mr. Starr paid $19,000 a month in rent at a luxury \napartment building for staff members--19,000 bucks a month? I would \nlike to know what he was renting. Again, we do not know because we \ncannot get into the line items.\n  That is just another glaring deficiency in this huge loophole that we \nopened with the independent counsel law. It is, in fact, a fourth \nbranch of Government with no checks and balances and no accountability \nto Congress.\n  Despite the fact that Mr. Starr made his referral to Congress, it was \nconsidered and dispensed with through a long, tortuous episode in the \nHouse and long, tortuous episode in the Senate with the impeachment \ntrial. According to newspaper accounts, Mr. Starr has no plans to wind \nthings down. In fact, there are indications he may keep the \ninvestigation going not for 1 year, not for 2 years, but for 3 more \nyears. That is why we are offering our amendment; cut funding in 6 \nmonths for any independent counsel investigation that has been ongoing \nfor 3 years or more. That is enough time.\n  The Starr investigation has been going now for almost 5 years, and I \nthink we are pretty darn close to $50 million, maybe more by now. We \nare just saying, during these 6 months, to Mr. Starr and these other \nindependent counsel, even the one who is investigating Samuel Pierce \nfrom the Reagan administration, it is time to put their books together \nand make any referrals for any additional action or investigations to \nthe Attorney General.\n  This deadline gives plenty of time to the independent counsel to \nfinish their work. And, again, if there is any problem, the American \npeople can rest assured that these cases will be handled by a \nspecialized office of the Justice Department that has been doing this \nfor over 20 years.\n  I think we have all concluded that the independent counsel law is \nfatally flawed. Under these circumstances, it would be a mistake to let \nthe Starr investigation continue on indefinitely without any end date, \nwithout any oversight, without any rein on prosecutorial excess, \nwithout any rein on money.\n  I think we ought to listen to people and let the country move on. Mr. \nStarr has had long enough to investigate Whitewater and Monica \nLewinsky. The Senate considered the charges against the President. We \ndispensed with them. I think 6 months is long enough to wrap things up. \nMake the referrals he deems necessary so we can put this behind us.\n  Again, I just point out, Mr. President, that Mr. Starr is sort of \nlike a gold-plated energizer bunny--his investigation keeps going on \nand on, and the money just keeps going up and up and up.\n  Twenty independent counsel investigations have been initiated since \n1978, at a cost estimated at nearly $150 million. Here is one. Donald \nSmaltz began his $17 million investigation of former Ag Secretary Espy \nin November 1994. He filed 30 counts. The jury threw them all out. The \njury threw them all out. He spent $17 million. What happened? Well, it \nsure ruined Agriculture Secretary Espy, I can tell you that; but the \njury found him innocent--$17 million.\n  David Barrett began his investigation, which I understand is now \naround $7 million, of former Housing Secretary Cisneros in May of 1995.\n\n  So the bills just keep getting racked up. The independent counsel \nkeep going, and the people of this country are wondering, What in the \nheck are we doing? Here we are on an appropriations bill, we are trying \nto scrounge every nickel, every penny we need to meet the critical \nneeds of people in this country. We have it in the farm sector. We have \na lot of critical needs in rural America, I can tell you that right \nnow, with the devastating crop prices and livestock prices. And we are \nlooking for money for some assistance for farmers. We can't find it. \nYet we have millions for Ken Starr and for all these other \ninvestigators to just keep living in luxury apartments and running up \nthe bills to the taxpayers with no accountability.\n  So that is why I think we have to do this. Six months is long enough. \nI do not know what the Governmental Affairs Committee will report out, \nwhen they report it out. It is my own observation that when this law \nexpires on June 30 there are not the votes here to extend it. Some \npeople may want to extend it, but I do not think there will be the 60-\nplus votes necessary to extend that law. But that does not make any \ndifference; the ones that are going on now can just keep right on \ngoing. I just think it is time to heed the common wisdom of the people \nof this country and shut the spigot off and turn it over to the Justice \nDepartment by the end of the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we at the Governmental Affairs Committee \nare, indeed, conducting hearings with regard to the independent \ncounsel. The criticisms of the Independent Counsel Act have been many \nand well known for many, many years. The Act was passed in 1978. I was \none of the ones who was critical of the idea that you could set \nsomebody up totally separate and outside the process and not \naccountable in the very beginning.\n  A lot of my friends now who criticize the Act, of course, thought it \nwas a very good idea back when the independent counsel were \ninvestigating the other party. All of the criticisms about Mr. Starr, \nof course, were applicable to Mr. Walsh's investigation, which went on \nlonger, cost more than Mr. Starr's investigation back during previous \nadministrations.\n  We should not look at this in terms of who is investigating whom. As \nI say, I have been critical of it all along. I still am. But the \nquestion is, Where is the power going to reside if you have a real \nconflict of interest? If you have a President of the United States who \nhas been accused of serious misconduct, can his appointee, the Attorney \nGeneral, investigate that with any credibility? I think for most of the \nAttorneys General we have had throughout our history, the answer is, \nyes, they have been people of great integrity. But what about the \nperception? Is that a good idea?\n  So if we do not have an independent counsel, we give it back to the \nemployee of the President to investigate the President? That is an \ninherent conflict of interest. Attorney General Reno herself, the \nDepartment, the administration back in 1993, all agreed that was a bad \nidea, and they were for the independent counsel. Now, recent events, \nand Mr. Starr's criticism, has caused them to reverse on a dime and say \nthat they have discovered structural defects in the statute.\n  The statute has been basically the same since 1978. They are just now \ndiscovering those structural defects in the statute. It looks an awful \nlot like the question of, Whose ox is being gored? But we are trying to \nstay away from too much of that.\n  I have been critical, of course, of this Justice Department in not \nappointing an independent counsel in the case that I feel calls out for \nit the most. We have a classic case with regard to the campaign \nfinancing scandal--one of the largest scandals we have ever had in this \ncountry--a classic case for why the independent counsel law was passed. \nYet all these others have been appointed, but when it comes to the big \nguy, we do not have an appointment in that particular case.\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\n  But, that aside, we are trying to examine all sides of this: Should \nwe continue the law? Should we not continue the law? And if we continue \nthe law, should we modify it? All those are possibilities. All those \nare on the table. And we do not know what the result is going to be \nyet.\n  So along comes this amendment that is on the floor now--a terribly \nbad idea. Regardless of whether you are for the independent counsel \nstatute or against the independent counsel statute, the idea that \nCongress should step in, either now, 3 months from now, or 6 months \nfrom now, and call to a halt investigations that have been going on for \na year--not just Mr. Starr's investigations but other independent \ncounsel--and say, ``Congress knows best; we're going to get into the \nmiddle of these criminal investigations, and although we set up the \nindependent counsel law that was passed in this U.S. Congress--they \nwere duly appointed--we're going to call a halt to them because we \ndon't like the people who are being investigated; we don't like the \namount of money that you're spending,'' or all those newfound \ncriticisms that we have been silent on up until now since 1978, is an \nextraordinarily bad idea.\n  The Congress has already determined that even if the independent \ncounsel law lapses, these investigations that are ongoing should \ncontinue.\n  The Attorney General can ask the three-judge panel to call a halt to \nan investigation if she believes that it is justified. She has not done \nthat. In fact, the Attorney General does not support this amendment. \nThis amendment would say: Let's call a halt to all of it and give it \nback to the Attorney General.\n  I asked the Attorney General yesterday, in Governmental Affairs, just \none question: ``As a matter of policy, do you think it would be wise \nfor Congress to terminate current ongoing investigations, regardless of \nwhat happens after that?'' Attorney General Reno's response: ``I think \nsince these investigations are underway, they should probably be \nconcluded under the current framework.'' So she doesn't support this \namendment, an extraordinarily bad idea.\n  So it goes back to the Attorney General under this amendment, as I \nsay, not just Mr. Starr's investigation, but the investigation with \nregard to Mr. Cisneros, for example, others, the Webb Hubbell \ninvestigation. All of that would be brought to an end and sent back to \nthe Attorney General.\n  And she has two choices: She can either keep it and dispose of it \nherself, at a time when that Department probably has less credibility \nthan it has had in many, many years; or she can launch a new \ninvestigation and call for a new special counsel to come in--\nextraordinarily expensive, wasteful, nonsensical, Mr. President; a \nvery, very bad idea, whether or not you are for or against the \nextension of the Independent Counsel Act.\n  Congress should not be interjecting itself to terminate \ninvestigations at midstream when there is also a mechanism, if it is \njustified, for that to be done. So I sincerely hope that my colleagues \nwill join me in opposing this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I intend to move to table this amendment. \nIt is a very serious subject and we have had extensive hearings before \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee, which Senator Thompson chairs. I do \nbelieve we will have to address this subject at a later time in the \nSenate, but this is not the time to do it.\n  Therefore, I move to table that amendment and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided for explanation of the second amendment prior to the vote on \nthe second amendment, that is, this amendment I have just moved to \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes \nbetween the two votes to explain the process that will occur after that \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                        Vote on Amendment No. 89\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, may we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nAlaska.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 92\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, under the agreement we have, there will \nbe 1 minute on each side to explain the next amendment. Senator \nTorricelli will be first with that minute. Following that, I have 2 \nminutes to explain to the Senate what we have to do after this vote.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered, Mr. President. I did order the \nyeas and nays.\n  But before that vote, Senator Torricelli is to be recognized for 1 \nminute. It is only 1 minute. I hope we could have order so the Senate \ncan hear these Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, before the Senate is the question of \nwhen the independent counsel statute expires. There is still the issue \nof the appropriations, and whether the poor continuing independent \ncounsel will be able to spend, not just this year, but on into the \nfuture, $10 million, $20 million, $100 million.\n  We begin the orderly process, on 6-month notice, of moving those \ncases into the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department where \nthe Attorney General has assured us she is prepared to receive the \ncases. They will be pursued professionally and prosecuted to the full \nextent of the law. All we have provided for is the orderly transfer of \nthose cases. Justice will be done. Every case will be pursued. It will \nbe done within the Justice Department, and at long last there will be \naccountability of how much we spend.\n  If you have been asked by constituents: Isn't $50 million too much? \nWill it be $100 million? Will it be $200 million? This is the answer to \nyour constituents' inquiry. It is control, but it also assures justice \nwithin the Department.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The time of the Senator has \nexpired. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, the Senate has previously determined if, \nin fact, the Independent Counsel Act is allowed to expire, \ninvestigations that are currently underway will be ongoing. Why did the \nSenate decide that? The obvious reason is it is a bad idea for the \nCongress to be terminating investigations in midstream and sending them \nback to Justice.\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\n  This amendment would reverse that previous determination that this \nbody has made. They would send it back to Justice with choices: They \nwould either have to shut down the investigation, make the \ndetermination themselves, which would be terrible in terms of \nappearance, or they would have to continue the investigation and bring \nsomebody else in to do it, which would be terrible in terms of \nefficiency.\n  I asked Attorney General Reno in the Governmental Affairs Committee \nwhat she thought about it. She said, ``I think, since these \ninvestigations are underway, they should probably be concluded under \nthe current framework.''\n  I suggest this is a very bad idea and should be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask for 2 minutes here to inform the \nSenate what procedure I hope we will follow at this time. We have a \nlist of amendments here, some 70 amendments, but I do not expect them \nall to be offered. Particularly, I do not expect them all to be offered \nwhen you see what is going to happen to this amendment. I say that \nadvisedly, after being advised by the proponents.\n\n  But, Mr. President, it is going to be my policy as the majority \nmanager of this bill to move to table every amendment that is not \ncleared on both sides. This is an emergency measure. We are going home \na week from Friday. Next week is all taken up with the budget. We \neither get this done now so we can go to conference with the House on \nMonday or Tuesday and bring it back before Friday, or we might as well \nforget about it.\n  So I respectfully inform the Senate I shall move, as the manager, to \ntable every amendment that does not have bipartisan support. So, if you \nhave an amendment on that list and you do not want to lose on it, now \nis the time to take it off.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the yeas and nays \nthat have been ordered be vitiated, and we take a voice vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, may I pose a question to \nthe Senator?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. This is a motion to table the amendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. The Senator will see we are going to voice vote it \nand it will carry.\n  Mr. GRAMM. With that assurance from the manager of the bill, I do not \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 92) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are prepared to go through any \namendment that is going to be offered and give our advice as quickly as \npossible as to whether or not we will support that amendment. I urge \nSenators to bring the amendments to us. Senator Byrd and I will go over \nthem immediately, and we can determine how many of these amendments we \nmight have to vote on. As soon as the leader has made his request for a \ntime agreement, we will go further into the operation here of the \nSenate before we finish this bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am curious to know what amendments might \nbe coming up. Is there a list available we can look at? Obviously, they \nare not all going to be approved. It is my understanding, from what the \nmanager said, if any amendment is objected to, then he will include \nthat amendment in those to be tabled by voice vote?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't know about the voice votes, Mr. President, if \nthe Senator will yield. I do know we will have a list here very soon. \nThe leader will present it. That is what we are waiting for now. I do \nsay we have a tentative list. We are trying to winnow that down, but if \nwe can get agreement on that list, I think then we can proceed. I don't \nknow whether we can get agreement on the list and that is what we are \nwaiting for. But we will show you the list as soon as possible.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Should we wait around here?\n  Mr. STEVENS. We should have that list within about 20 or 30 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. I ask unanimous consent the privilege of the floor be \ngranted to Ernie Coggins, a legislative fellow, during the pendency of \nthe emergency supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Amendments Nos. 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am going to send to the desk a package \nof amendments.\n  The first is an amendment by Senators Helms and McConnell directing \nthe Office of Inspector General, Agency for International Development, \nto audit expenditures for emergency relief activities.\n  The second is an amendment by Senator Reid to provide an additional \n$500,000 for technical assistance related to shoreline erosion at Lake \nTahoe, NV.\n  The next is an amendment by Senator Kyl to provide an additional $5 \nmillion for emergency repairs to Headgate Rock hydroelectric project in \nArizona.\n  Next is an amendment by Senators Domenici and Reid making a \nrescission of $5.5 million to funds available to the Corps of Engineers \nto offset additional funds provided in the previous two amendments.\n  Next is an amendment by Senators Jeffords and Bingaman directing the \nAgency for International Development to undertake efforts to promote \nreforestation and other environmental activities.\n  Last is an amendment by Senator Levin allowing the President to \ndispose of certain material in the National Defense Stockpile.\n  These have all been cleared on both sides, and they are all fully \noffset.\n  I send the package to the desk and ask unanimous consent that they be \nconsidered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the amendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska (Mr. Stevens), for Mr. Helms, Mr. \n     McConnell, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n     Bingaman, and Mr. Levin), proposes amendments Nos. 93 through \n     98, en bloc.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 93\n\n (Purpose: Relating to activities funded by the appropriations to the \n  Central America and the Caribbean Emergency Disaster Recovery Fund)\n\n       On page 8, line 22, insert before the proviso the \n     following: ``Provided further, That up to $1,500,000 of the \n     funds appropriated by this heading may be transferred to \n     `Operating Expenses of the Agency for International \n     Development, Office of Inspector General', to remain \n     available until expended, to be used for costs of audits, \n     inspections, and other activities associated with the \n     expenditure of funds appropriated by this heading: Provided \n     further, That $500,000 of the funds appropriated by this \n     heading shall be made available to the Comptroller General \n     for purposes\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\n     of monitoring the provision of assistance using funds \n     appropriated by this heading: Provided further, That any \n     funds appropriated by this heading that are made available \n     for nonproject assistance shall be obligated and expended \n     subject to the regular notification procedures of the \n     Committees on Appropriations and to the notification \n     procedures relating to the reprogramming of funds under \n     section 634A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2394-1):''.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 94\n\n       Insert in the appropriate place:\n\n                      DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE--CIVIL\n\n                         Department of the Army\n\n                       Corps of Engineers--Civil\n\n\n                         CONSTRUCTION, GENERAL\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Construction, General,'' \n     $500,000 shall be available for technical assistance related \n     to shoreline erosion at Lake Tahoe, NV caused by high lake \n     levels pursuant to Section 219 of the Water Resources \n     Development Act of 1992.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 95\n\n       Insert in the appropriate place:\n\n                       DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\n\n                         Bureau of Reclamation\n\n                      Water and Related Resources\n\n       For an additional amount for ``Water and Related \n     Resources'' for emergency repairs to the Headgate Rock \n     Hydroelectric Project, $5,000,000 is appropriated pursuant to \n     the Snyder Act (25 U.S.C.), to be expended by the Bureau of \n     Reclamation, to remain available until expended.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 96\n\n       Insert in the appropriate place:\n\n                      DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE--CIVIL\n\n                         Department of the Army\n\n                       Corps of Engineers--Civil\n\n\n                         CONSTRUCTION, GENERAL\n\n       Of the amounts made available under this heading in P.L. \n     105-245 for the Lackawanna River, Scranton, Pennsylvania, \n     $5,500,000 are rescinded.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 97\n\n       On page 9, line 10 after the word ``amended'' insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That the Agency for \n     International Development should undertake efforts to promote \n     reforestation, with careful attention to the choice, \n     placement, and management of species of trees consistent with \n     watershed management objectives designed to minimize future \n     storm damage, and to promote energy conservation through the \n     use of renewable energy and energy-efficient services and \n     technologies: Provided further, That reforestation and energy \n     initiatives under this heading should be integrated with \n     other sustainable development efforts''.\n\n\n                            AMENDMENT NO. 98\n\n    (Purpose: To authorize the disposal of the zirconium ore in the \n                      National Defense Stockpile)\n\n       On page 58, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n                         TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n       Sec. 5001.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot, I will just describe the list for our colleagues to indicate that \nthere are approximately 45 Republican amendments and approximately 35 \nDemocratic amendments on the list just submitted, but I do not object. \nI support the request made by the majority leader.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure I \nunderstand what the majority leader has put forward. The amendments \nwould be amendable with relevant second-degrees; is that correct? Would \nsubstitutes also be allowed on amendments?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in answering the question of the Senator \nfrom Texas, all first-degree amendments that are listed would be \nsubject to relevant second-degree amendments, but if they are not on \nthat list, then they would not be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments. I guess that a second-degree amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute would be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If it is relevant, it would be in order.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Did we get agreement to that request? I will go ahead and \ncomplete the entire request. Let me say on the list of amendments, \nSenator Daschle is correct. There are apparently 80-something \namendments on that list. I assume that a lot of them are defensive in \nnature and some of them can very likely be accepted. We have the two \nbest managers, probably, in the Senate handling this bill--the Senator \nfrom Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. \nI am sure they will go through that list like a knife through hot \nbutter. But there are some on that list that certainly will have to be \ndealt with in the regular order. We will work on our side to get that \nlist worked down, just as I am sure Senator Daschle will.\n  Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that following the \ndisposition of the above-listed amendments, the bill be advanced to \nthird reading and passage occur, all without any intervening action or \ndebate. I further ask that the bill remain at the desk, and when the \nSenate receives the House companion bill, the Chair automatically \nstrike all after the enacting clause, insert the text of S. 544, as \namended, the House bill be advanced to third reading and the bill be \npassed, all without intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask that the Senate insist on its amendments, request a \nconference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate.\n  For the information of those who might be wondering about that, the \nHouse has not yet acted on this supplemental. It is anticipated they \nwill not act until Tuesday or Wednesday of next week. Therefore, we do \nnot want to run this to final completion. This will allow us to stop at \na critical point and wait for the House action and then go straight to \nconference.\n  Finally, I ask that the Senate bill be placed back on the Calendar \nand final passage occur no later than 11 a.m. on Friday, March 19, and \nthat paragraph 4 of rule XII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have just noted that there are \napproximately 90 amendments. I agree with the characterization of the \nmajority leader that we have the two finest managers the Senate could \nput forth as we work through this bill, and I am sure that they will \ncut through those amendments like a knife through hot butter. As \neternal an optimist as I am, I am still not optimistic at this point \nthat we can complete work on all 90 amendments prior to 11 o'clock, so \nI will object.\n\n  I do ask for the cooperation of our colleagues in the hopes that we \ncan finish this bill. Obviously, there is a great deal of work that yet \nneeds to be done. If we work this afternoon and work hard, perhaps as \nearly as this evening we might be able to finish, but let's give it our \nbest effort and revisit the question of when we can go to final \npassage. So I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I revise my unanimous consent request. It is \nthe same as earlier stated, but I will delete the last phrase with \nregard to these words: ``And final passage occur no later than 11 a.m. \non Friday, March 19, and that paragraph 4, rule XII, be waived.'' \nTherefore, it will conclude with these words: ``Finally, I ask that the \nSenate bill be placed back on the Calendar.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is likely there will be an \namendment offered relating to Kosovo. I would like to speak briefly on \nthat subject, if I may, in the absence of any other Senator on the \nfloor.\n  I note the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee has \njust come to the floor. Does the chairman wish to take the floor?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Kosovo amendment has been set aside \ntemporarily. The meeting is going on in the leader's office. I wonder \nif the Senator knows that is going on and should participate in that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the chairman. I will participate. I want to make \njust a couple of comments.\n  Mr. President, the Kosovo matter again raises the issue about the \nrespective power of Congress under the Constitution, the sole authority \nto declare war, and the authority of the President as Commander in \nChief. This is a recurrent theme of consideration.\n  Within the course of the past year, we faced the issue of airstrikes, \nwhich were anticipated against Iraq in February of 1998. At that time, \nI wrote the President, and spoke on the floor of the Senate calling on \nthe President to seek congressional authority, if action was \ncontemplated there, because an airstrike was an act of war and only the \nCongress of the United States has the authority to involve the Nation \nin war.\n  There are circumstances where the President has to act in emergency \nsituations, where as Commander in Chief he must act in the absence of \nan opportunity for congressional consideration. At that time, there was \nadequate opportunity for congressional consideration. However, it was \nnot undertaken, and that incident passed without any military action. \nWe then had the events of this past mid-December where airstrikes were \nlaunched on Iraq. Again, on that occasion, I had written to the \nPresident of the United States urging that he make a presentation to \nthe Congress as to what he wanted to do. Again, airstrikes constitute \nan act of war, and we have learned from the bitter experience of \nVietnam that we cannot successfully undertake a war without the support \nof the American people. And the first action to obtain that support is \nfrom the Congress of the United States.\n  We have now been in Bosnia for a protracted period of time. \nOriginally, this was supposed to be a limited engagement. That has been \nextended. Congress enacted legislation to cut off funds under certain \ncontingencies. That has all lapsed, and we remain in Bosnia with very \nsubstantial expenditures. Fortunately, there has not been military \naction. So although there have been some casualties, it has not been as \na result of a conflict.\n  We are looking at a situation in Kosovo which is enormously serious. \nI, again, urge the President of the United States to make a \npresentation to the Congress as to what he would like to undertake. The \nHouse of Representatives, by a fairly narrow vote, authorized some \nlimited use of force in Kosovo. The headline featured was ``President \nGets Support That He Had Not Asked For''. Presidents are very reluctant \nto come to the Congress with a request for authorization, because that \nmay be interpreted to dilute their authority to act as Commander in \nChief unilaterally without congressional authority.\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\n  I had filed a resolution on the use of force with missile and \nairstrikes, which would involve minimal risk and strike where there are \nno U.S. personnel placed in harm's way. I did that really to stimulate \ndebate by Congress on what authorization there should be. But it is \nmore than a matter of notification. The administration talks of \nnotification, and very frequently even notification is a virtual \nnullity coming at a time when Congress has no opportunity to really be \ninvolved in the decision making process.\n  I can recall back in mid-April of 1986 when President Reagan ordered \nthe airstrike on Libya. The consultation was had--really notification, \nnot consultation, the difference being that if you notify, you are \nsimply telling Congress what has happened. If you consult, that has the \nimplication that there may be some response from the administration \ndepending on the congressional reaction. Both are vastly short of \nauthorization, which is what the Constitution requires on a declaration \nof war.\n  But, in any event, in mid-April of 1986, congressional leaders were \nsummoned to be told that the planes were in flight. There was a meeting \nwith many Senators shortly after the attack occurred, there was quite \nan interesting debate between the Senator from West Virginia, Senator \nByrd, and Secretary of State Schultz as to whether Congress could have \nhad any effect, or whether congressional leaders could have had any \neffect, if they wanted to have an impact on that situation.\n  But when we take a look at what is happening now in Kosovo with a \nmassing of forces, and we take a look at the terrain, we take a look at \nthe air defense, we may be involved in more than missile strikes. And \nit is one thing to support missile strikes. It is quite another thing \nto support airstrikes. It all depends upon the facts and the \ncircumstances in situations where the Congress needs to know more, and \nthe American people need to know a great deal more.\n  So it is my hope that the President will address this issue, will \ntell the Congress of the United States what he would like to do in \nKosovo, seek authorization from the Congress, and tell the American \npeople what he has in mind.\n  I know from my contacts in my State of 12 million people that \nPennsylvanians do not have much of an idea about what is involved in \nKosovo. And there are very, very serious ramifications and questions as \nto what our posture would be with NATO, if we do not join NATO forces \non something which is agreed to there. But, when nations of NATO act, \nthey do not have our Constitution. They are aware of our Constitution. \nThey are aware of the provisions of our Constitution, that only the \nCongress can declare war.\n  So if there is not congressional support, if there is not \ncongressional action, they are on notice that they do not have a \ncommitment in the Congress of the United States, a Constitutional \ncommitment in the United States, to act. What the President may do \nunilaterally, of course, is a matter which has always been a little \nahead of the process. It is a fact that frequently Congress sits by and \nawaits Presidential action.\n  If it is a success, fine. If it is a failure, then there may be \nsomeone to blame--the President, not the Congress.\n  But it is my hope the President will come to the Congress, tell the \nCongress what it is he wants, tell the American people what it is the \nPresident thinks ought to be done so we can have an understanding as to \nwhat is involved here. So we can have an understanding as to what the \nrisks are, what the objectives are, what the end game is, and what the \nexit strategy is. Then we can make a rational decision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a progress report for the Senate. \nOur chief of staff, Mr. Cortese, has just informed me that we have \napproximately 20 of the 70 amendments that were listed on the agreement \nalmost ready for presentation for approval on a bipartisan basis.\n  I am making this statement to appeal to Senators who have amendments \non the list to bring them to our staff so we can review them now, and I \nhope that when we explain to them why we cannot take them, they will \nwithdraw their amendments.\n  I am hopeful we can pursue a process and find a way to complete \naction on this bill by noon tomorrow. I do hope that will happen.\n  I will be able to present those other amendments to the Senate for \napproval on a bipartisan basis probably within an hour or so. \nMeanwhile, we cannot proceed all the way through the amendments unless \nthe Senators give us their amendments to review. I know there are two \ncommittee meetings at this time, Mr. President. They are slowing down \nthis process, and they are both trying to get bills out in order that \nthey may be considered next week. We will just have to bear with the \nsituation for a few more hours.\n  We intend to keep going on this bill, and that may mean late tonight, \nif necessary. If we had the cooperation of the Senate in presenting \nthese amendments, I think we could tell the Senate by 6 or 6:30 the \nnumber of votes we will have to have and when they will occur.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2919-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2919-S2923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Once again, they are amendments that have been cleared on \nboth sides with the legislative committees as well as the subcommittees \nof appropriations with respect to the various jurisdictions.\n  The first amendment is by Senator Domenici to expand the jurisdiction \nof the State of New Mexico's portion of the Southwest Border High-\nIntensity Drug Trafficking Area.\n  Next is an amendment by Senator Roberts to provide relief from unfair \ninterest and penalties on refunds retroactively ordered by the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission.\n  Next is an amendment for myself to exempt non-Indian Health Service \nand\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nnon-Bureau of Indian Affairs funds from section 328 of the Interior \nDepartment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year \n1999.\n  The next amendment is offered by Senator Grams to provide funding for \nannual contributions to public housing agencies for operating low-\nincome housing projects.\n  Next is an amendment by Senator Lincoln to provide for watershed and \nflood prevention debris removal.\n  Next is an amendment by Senator Gorton regarding loan deficiency \npayments for club wheat producers.\n  Next is an amendment for myself dealing with commercial fishing and \ncompensation eligibility in Glacier Bay.\n  The next amendment is by Senator Gorton providing clarification for \nsection 2002 of the bill regarding hardrock mining regulations.\n  Next is an amendment by Senator Gorton to expand the eligibility of \nemergency funding for replacement and repair of power generation \nequipment.\n  Next is an amendment by Senators Landrieu and Domenici to support \nhomebuilding for the homeless in Central America.\n  Next is an amendment by Senator Daschle providing relief to the White \nRiver School District No. 4.\n  Finally, there is a second Daschle amendment to provide for equal pay \ntreatment for certain Federal firefighters under section 545(b) of \ntitle V of the United States Code and other provisions of law.\n  Mr. President, I send these amendments to the desk and ask unanimous \nconsent that they be considered en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 100\n\n(Purpose: To expand the jurisdiction of the State of New Mexico portion \nof the Southwest Border High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) to \ninclude Rio Arriba County, Santa Fe County, and San Juan County and to \n           provide specific funding for these three counties)\n\n       On page 30, after line 10 insert:\n\n                               Chapter 7\n\n    EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE \n                               PRESIDENT\n\n                     Federal Drug Control Programs\n\n\n             high intensity drug trafficking areas program\n\n                     (including transfer of funds)\n\n       For necessary expenses of the Office of National Drug \n     Control Policy's High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \n     Program, an additional $750,000 is appropriated for drug \n     control activities which shall be used specifically to expand \n     the Southwest Border High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area for \n     the State of New Mexico to include Rio Arriba County, Santa \n     Fe County, and San Juan County, New Mexico, which are hereby \n     designated as part of the Southwest Border High Intensity \n     Drug Trafficking Area for the State of New Mexico, and an \n     additional $500,000 is appropriated for national efforts \n     related to methamphetamine reduction efforts.\n       On page 44, after line 7 insert:\n\n                               Chapter 9\n\n    EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT AND FUNDS APPROPRIATED TO THE \n                               PRESIDENT\n\n                     Federal Drug Control Programs\n\n\n                        special forfeiture fund\n\n                              (rescission)\n\n       Of the funds made available under this heading in Division \n     A of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations, 1999 (Public Law 105-277) $1,250,000 are \n     rescinded.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to expand \nthe State of New Mexico High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) to \ninclude three counties in the north that are under siege from ``black \ntar'' heroin. This amendment designates Rio Arriba County, Santa Fe \nCounty, and San Juan County as part of the New Mexico HIDTA and \nprovides $750,000 for the remainder of fiscal year 1999 to these \ncounties to combat this serious drug problem. This amendment is fully \noffset for both budget authority and outlays according to the \nCongressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. President, this is part of an overall effort to combat the \nserious drug epidemic in northern New Mexico. Rio Arriba County leads \nthe nation in per capita drug-induced deaths. The rate of heroin \noverdoses is reportedly three times the national average.\n  Last month, I held meetings with State and local officials and \ncommunity representatives to assess the overall illegal drug situation \nin northern New Mexico. I am pleased to say that the State and the \ncommunities have been aggressive in trying to address this problem. Our \ntask now is to marshal additional resources to the problem so that \nthere is a comprehensive strategy to get this drug problem under \ncontrol. This comprehensive strategy will include law enforcement, such \nas this HIDTA designation and the additional, targeted resources in my \namendment, as well as programs for prevention, education, after school \nactivities for our children, and treatment. It will take all of these \nsteps, with prosecution and jail time for drug traffickers, to combat \nthis drug epidemic in New Mexico.\n  I have also enlisted the assistance of Federal agencies in this \nbattle. The Department of Justice law enforcement agencies can assist \nwith the illegal trafficking of ``black tar'' heroin and other drugs, \nsome of which are smuggled into the United States by illegal Mexican \nnationals. The Department of Health and Human Services is also a \nvaluable ally in this fight through the National Institute on Drug \nAbuse and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration. I am committed to marshaling both federal and state and \nlocal resources to tackle this serious problem.\n  This amendment also provides additional resources for a national \nprogram to crack down on illegal methamphetamine laboratories and \ntrafficking. This is another serious drug problem for the nation, but \nmy own home State of New Mexico, has seen a marked increase in these \nillegal activities. As a largely rural State, and so close to the \nborder with Mexico, New Mexico has been inundated with methamphetamine. \nMany States are in this same predicament, and I applaud the \nsubcommittee for boosting the resources for this important national \neffort.\n  Mr. President, illegal drug trafficking and use is a serious problem \nfor our nation. In spite of the significant federal and state and local \nresources targeted to these illegal activities, the problem remains \noverwhelming in some of our communities and states. I urge the adoption \nof my amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 101\n\n   (Purpose: To provide relief from unfair interest and penalties on \n    refunds retroactively ordered by the Federal Energy Regulatory \n                              Commission)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.   . LIABILITY OF CERTAIN NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS.\n\n       The Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (15 U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 603. LIABILITY OF CERTAIN NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS.\n\n  ``If the Commission orders any refund of any rate or charge made, \ndemanded, or received for reimbursement of State ad valorem taxes in \nconnection with the sale of natural gas before 1989, the refund shall \nbe ordered to be made without interest or penalty of any kind.''.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment \noffered by myself and Senator Roberts which will seek to provide fair \nand equitable treatment for Kansas gas producers. At a time when the \noil and gas industry is suffering, the Federal Government has taken \nunnecessary action against gas producers in Kansas.\n  For almost two decades the Commission allowed gas producers to obtain \nreimbursement for payment of Kansas ad valorem taxes on natural gas. In \na series of orders the Commission repeatedly approved the collection of \nthe Kansas ad valorem tax, despite challenges by various pipelines and \ndistributors. However, in 1993 the Commission changed its mind and \ndecided that the Kansas ad valorem tax did not qualify for \nreimbursement to the producer, and in 1996 the D.C. Circuit Court \ndetermined that a refund was to be made retroactively.\n  This is another example of Federal preemption of State rights and of \na regulatory agency that is out of control. Kansas gas producers are \nbeing\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\npenalized more than $300 million for abiding by regulations that the \nCommission had previously approved.\n  The Commission's decision will likely force small producers out of \nbusiness, causing a slowdown in the production of natural gas which \ncould have a tremendously negative impact on the Kansas economy.\n  This amendment that Senator Roberts and I have cosponsored will \nessentially relieve all gas producers from interest owed on the ad \nvalorem tax. This amendment will save jobs, businesses, and loss of \nState revenue. I am hopeful that my colleagues will support this \namendment and provide fair and equitable treatment for Kansas gas \nproducers.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 102\n\n(Purpose: to exempt non-Indian Health Service and non-Bureau of Indian \n Affairs funds from section 328 of the Interior Department and Related \n           Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1999)\n\n       At the end of Title II insert the following:\n       ``Sec.   .

Mr. President, on Monday, my friend and colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch, came to the floor to respond to a \nstatement that I gave a week or so earlier on the Justice Department's \nmisguided antitrust case against Microsoft.\n  Mr. President, this has become something of a habit for the Senator \nfrom Utah and myself. We have debated that lawsuit since well before it \nwas commenced, more than a year ago.\n  I am happy to state that I want to start these brief remarks with two \npoints on which I find myself in complete agreement with Senator Hatch. \nFirst, during a speech on Monday, he joined with me in asking that the \nVice President of the United States, Mr. Gore, state his position on \nwhether or not this form of antitrust action is appropriate. I centered \nmy own speech on the frequent visits the Vice President has made to the \nState of Washington and his refusal to take any such position. The \nSenator from Utah said:\n\n       Government should not exert unwarranted control over the \n     Internet, even if Vice President Gore thinks that he created \n     it.\n\n  I am delighted that the Senator from Utah has joined me in that \nsentiment. Now there are at least two of us who believe that the Vice \nPresident of the United States should make his views known on the \nsubject.\n  Secondly, the Senator from Utah, in dealing with the request by the \nDepartment of Justice that it receive a substantial additional \nappropriation for fiscal year 2000 for antitrust enforcement, stated \nthat he is concerned about the value thresholds in what is called the \nHart-Scott-Rodino legislation relating to mergers and feels that the \nminimum size of those mergers should be moved upward to reflect \ninflation in the couple of decades since that bill was passed, \ntherefore, questions at least some portion of the request for \nadditional appropriations on the part of the Antitrust Division.\n  As I have said before, I believe that it deserves no increase at all, \nthat the philosophy that it is following harasses the business \ncommunity unduly, and inhibits the continuation of the economic success \nstories all across our American economy but particularly in computer \nsoftware.\n  Having said that, the Senator from Utah and I continue to disagree, \nthough I wish to emphasize that my primary disagreement is with the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice of the United States \nand this particular lawsuit.\n  The disagreement really fundamentally comes down to one point: \nAntitrust law enforcement should be followed for the benefit of \nconsumers. The Government of the United States has no business \nfinancing what is essentially a private antitrust case. If there are \ncompetitors of Microsoft who think they have been unsuccessful and wish \nto finance their own antitrust lawsuits, they are entitled to do so. \nThe taxpayers of the United States, on the other hand, should not be \nrequired to pay their money for what is a private dispute, primarily \nbetween Netscape and Microsoft.\n  That remains essentially the gravamen of the antitrust action that \nthe Justice Department in 19 States is prosecuting at the present time.\n  There is only the slightest lip service given in the course of that \nlawsuit or by the senior Senator from Utah to consumer benefit. This is \nnot surprising, Mr. President, because there is no discernible consumer \nbenefit in the demands of this lawsuit.\n  Consumers have been benefited by the highly competitive nature of the \nsoftware market. They are benefited by having the kind of platform that \nMicrosoft provides for thousands of different applications and uses on \nthe part of hundreds of different companies all through the United \nStates.\n  This is not a consumer protection lawsuit. I may say, not entirely in \npassing, that I know a consumer protection lawsuit when I see one. I \nwas attorney general of the State of Washington for 12 years. I \nprosecuted a wide range of antitrust and consumer protection lawsuits. \nBut every one of those antitrust cases was based on the proposition \nthat consumers were being disadvantaged by some form of price fixing or \nother violation of the law. I did not regard it as my business to \nrepresent essentially one business unhappy and harmed by competition \nfor a more effective competitor.\n  The basis of my objection to this lawsuit is that it is not designed \nfor consumer protection. It is designed to benefit competitors. Some of \nthe proposals that have appeared in the newspapers for remedies in case \nof success, including taking away the intellectual properties of the \nMicrosoft Corporation, perhaps even breaking it up, requiring advance \npermission on the part of lawyers in the Justice Department for \nimprovements in Windows or in any other product of the Microsoft \nCorporation, are clearly anticonsumer in nature.\n\n  The lawsuit is no better now than the day on which it was brought. It \nis not designed to benefit consumers. It ought to be dropped.\n  I am delighted that at least on two peripheral areas of sometime \ncontroversy, the Senator from Utah and I now find ourselves in \nagreement. Regrettably, we still find ourselves disagreeing on the \nfundamental basis of the lawsuit. I am sorry he is on the apparent side \nof the Vice President of the United States and the clear side of the \nDepartment of Justice of the United States.\n  I expect this debate to continue, but I expect it to continue to be \non the same basis. Do we have a software system, a computer system in \nthe United States which is the wonder of the world that has caused more \nprofound and more progressive changes in our society than that caused \nin a comparable period of time by any other industry, or somehow or \nanother do we have an industry that needs Government regulation? I \nthink that question answers itself, Mr. President, and I intend to \ncontinue to speak out on the subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2923-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2923-S2929]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nEXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE HUMAN RIGHTS SITUATION \n                                IN CUBA\n\n  Mr. MACK.

Fidel \nCastro continues to run Cuba with absolute power, based upon the failed \nideals of the Marxist revolution that he led 40 years ago. He is a \ntyrant, a dictator, and an enemy of freedom, democracy, and respect for \nbasic human dignity.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have been reflecting on my Senate \ncareer lately as I weighed my decision on seeking another term. Let me \nshare one of those memories with you right now.\n  It was October 19, 1987, when I announced my candidacy for the \nSenate. I traveled to Key West, the southern most point in the \nContinental United States, to make my announcement. I chose this \nlocation for one simple reason. I knew my passion for foreign policy \narose from a deeply held conviction that America's freedom could not be \ntaken for granted, that our freedom was not complete so long as others \nsuffered under the yoke of tyranny. Only 90 miles from where I declared \nmy aspiration to be a U.S. Senator in order to take part in the fight \nagainst the enemies of freedom, Fidel Castro ruled with a failed \nideology and a cruel iron fist.\n  It seems that I have been in the Senate for a long time--10 years--\nbut if I were to travel to Key West today, I am sad to say, I could \nstill point toward Cuba and ask the same questions I did on October 19, \n1987: What does it mean to live in peace if there is no freedom to \nworship God, no freedom to choose our livelihood, no freedom to read or \nspeak the truth or to live for the dream of handing over a better life \nto our children and our grandchildren? Peace without freedom is false. \nThe Cuban people are only free to serve their masters in war and in \npoverty.\n  Mr. President, I have many good friends in the Senate, and I have \ngreat respect for my colleagues. We share so much of our lives with \neach other each day. And even though we are divided on many issues, in \nour hearts there can be no division on our feelings for the suffering \npeople of Cuba. The island so close to our shores serves as a tragic \nreminder of the human cost of tyranny and oppression and that freedom \nis not free.\n\n  Let me propose today that Fidel Castro has not changed in 10 years; \nin fact, he has not changed in 40 years. In the history books, 40 years \ncan be covered in a single sentence. But in Cuba, it can also be an \neternity.\n  I think about the 12 years since I made that speech. How many people \nhave suffered and died needlessly in 12 years? How many screams of \nagony have reached for the heavens from Havana in 12 years? How many \ntears of sorrow and anguish have fallen in 12 years? I fear we will \nnever know the true scale of suffering, even though it takes place so \nclose to our shores.\n  Some of us have served in the Senate for a few years, some of us for \n10 or 12, and some of us have been here for 30 years or more. Think \nwhat it must be like serving instead in one of Fidel Castro's prisons \nfor all that time. In Cuba you could be imprisoned simply for doing \nwhat we do each day, and that is engage in the debate of ideas. Think \nabout how different our lives would be if we lived in a similar \nenvironment.\n  I assure you, Mr. President, that the human spirit is a powerful \nthing. We know that throughout the world and throughout history mankind \nhas struggled for freedom against the greatest of obstacles. That \nstruggle lives, breathes, sweats, and thrives in Cuba today. But it \ndoes so at a great cost.\n  I have two short stories I want to share to demonstrate the price \nbeing paid in Cuba today.\n  There is a famous man known as Antunez. He began supporting freedom \nin Cuba in 1980. He has been in and out of prison for much of his adult \nlife. As of February 1999, reports out of the prisons have him in poor \nhealth.\n  I want to read a quote from a letter he wrote and successfully \nsmuggled out of Cuba 2 years ago. I quote:\n\n       On March 15 [1997], it will be seven years that I have been \n     imprisoned but I have yet to lose my faith and confidence in \n     the final triumph of our struggle. I am proud and satisfied \n     that they will have been unable to--and will never be able \n     to--bend my will, because I am defending a just and noble \n     cause, the rights of man and the freedom of my country.\n\n  A second story: I have recently seen a March 10, 1999, statement of \nDr. Omar del Pozo, which I want to share with you today. He was a \nprisoner of conscience, sentenced to 15 years in prison for promoting \ndemocracy and civil society in Cuba. Through the intercession of Pope \nJohn Paul II, Dr. Pozo was released and exiled to Canada after serving \n6 years of the sentence.\n  It is interesting to note the comments of a man who owes his freedom \nfrom Cuba's prisons to the Pope's visit to Cuba. Listen to what he has \nto say about the so-called changes taking place within the Cuban \nGovernment. And I am now quoting:\n\n       In Castro's man-eating prisons, lives are swallowed, \n     mangled, and spit out in what can only be described as his \n     revolving-door of infamy. Some may claim that the fact that I \n     am able to stand before you here today is because I am a \n     product of engagement with Castro. While I am certainly \n     grateful for the international outcry that created pressure \n     on Castro to release me, it would be negligent of me not to \n     recognize that as long as the dictator remains in power, \n     there will continue to be political prisoners who are \n     destined to become pawns to be handed over as tokens \n     depending on the occasion . . . . my release in no way \n     benefited the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men and \n     women who were left behind.\n\n  Dr. Pozo's statement certainly rings true--that the visit of the Pope \nand his personal release and exile from his home do not, counter to \npopular belief, indicate a new day in Cuba.\n  He continues on in his statement. Again, I quote:\n\n       Forty years have passed, and a new millennium dawns, and \n     still political prisoners exist in a country only 90 miles \n     from the shores of the freest nation on earth. . . . In the \n     confusion of cliches Cuba has become in the mass media: \n     Castro and cigars, Castro and tourism, Castro and baseball, \n     the terrible tragedy of Cubans and their legitimate needs and \n     desires takes a backseat to the priorities set by the \n     Comandante en Jefe and his regime. The truly tragic part is \n     that there are some who, in the name of profit, are willing \n     to compromise justice and play by his rules, with no regard \n     for the welfare of the Cuban people.\n\n  Just as actions indicate no improvement in the Government of Cuba, \none could argue that things are not really getting worse. In fact, the \nrecent crackdown in Cuba is only a manifestation of the nature of the \nruling regime. Again, let me quote from Dr. Pozo:\n\n       These past days, I have heard even experienced Cuba \n     observers question why Castro has raised the level of \n     repression at this point in time, considering the many \n     gestures of goodwill he has received internationally prior to \n     and following the Papal visit. The only possible answer is \n     that it is the nature of the beast. Castro can not help it \n     any more than he can help being a totalitarian dictator. It \n     is who he is and will always be. It is because he is \n     motivated by one thing and one thing alone: [and that is] \n     absolute power. He wants to continue to stand on the backs of \n     the Cuban people and he will persecute, torture and kill in \n     order to accomplish his goal of being Cuba's ``dictator for \n     life.'' By now, everyone knows who Castro is and what he is \n     capable of. From this point on, the field can only be divided \n     between those who are willing to overlook his crimes and \n     those who are not.\n\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\n\n  Again, I just point out, those were not my words. These are the words \nof an individual who was released from Castro's prison because of the \npressure brought on by the international community and by the Pope's \nvisit. What he is saying here is that nothing has changed as a result \nof the Pope's visit to Cuba. He is saying nothing has changed. And he \nis saying to us--not me saying, but he is saying to us--that ``the \nfield can only be divided [now] between those who are willing to \noverlook [Castro's] crimes and those who are not.''\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, let me once again say freedom is not \nfree, but it is the most valuable thing that we know; it is, in fact, \nthe core of all human progress. Freedom has everything to do with our \nspiritual, physical, and political lives. Without it--without freedom--\nwhat would we do? It is important to think about this in order to \nappreciate the words of the brave men and women in Cuba fighting for \nfreedom, because they are, after all, fighting for everything and \npaying a large price indeed.\n  I want to reach out to my colleagues today. We loathe tyranny and \noppression. So let us stand united behind our delegation in Geneva; let \nus proclaim our views at the United Nations Human Rights Commission. \nLet us stand tall and speak with unity, conviction, and strength. Let \nus proclaim: ``The United States of America abhors tyranny and loves \nfreedom. We oppose the enemies of liberty and we support those \nstruggling for LIBERTAD.''\n\n  That, Mr. President, represents the meaning of this resolution in its \nentirety. I hope my colleagues will join me today in making this most \nimportant statement.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I understand that we have 1 hour equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, my friend and colleague, a friend and \ncolleague who, unfortunately, has recently announced that his next \nphase of life is going to be someplace other than the Senate, started \nwith the story of where he commenced his campaign to come to the \nSenate--in the beautiful, unique community of Key West. In addition to \nKey West's physical proximity to Cuba, Key West also has a history \nwhich is very intertwined with the long efforts of the people of Cuba \nto achieve freedom.\n  It was during the period of the Cuban civil war in the 1870s, 1880s \nand into the 1890s that many exiles left Cuba and came to Key West to \nfind freedom and a place from which they could relaunch their efforts \nto achieve freedom in their homeland.\n  Jose Marti spoke many times in Key West to the exiled community of \nhis dreams for a Cuba of independence and freedom. It is in Key West \nthat there is the memorial for the USS Maine, the Tomb of the Unknown \nSailor, for over 200 American sailors who were killed in Havana Harbor \nearly in 1898--an event which contributed to the United States eventual \ndeclaration of war and involvement in what we refer to as the Spanish-\nAmerican War. In Key West we find remnants of that long history of the \nyearning of the people of Cuba to live in freedom and independence.\n  After having won their independence in 1898, 60 years later, it was \ntaken away from them. For four decades, they have lived under the \noppressive rule of the dictator, Fidel Castro.\n  Last month, we recognized another dictatorship in this world, one \nthat is not near to us but half a world away. The Senate passed a \nresolution calling for a condemnation of the human rights situation in \nChina. We urged the United Nations Human Rights Commission to have that \non their agenda at their soon-to-be-held meeting in Geneva. With this \nresolution, Senate Resolution 57, we take a similar position condemning \nthe human rights situation in Cuba which, unfortunately, is \nconsiderably worse today than the situation in China.\n  This resolution calls on the President to make every effort to pass a \nresolution at the upcoming meeting of the United Nations Human Rights \nCommission condemning Cuba for its abysmal record on human rights. It \nalso calls for the reappointment of a special rapporteur to investigate \nthe human rights situation in Cuba.\n\n  Last year, for the first time in many years, no resolution on human \nrights in Cuba was passed by the United Nations Human Rights \nCommission. Perhaps this hiatus in U.N. condemnation of Cuba was due to \nthe hopes that were raised as a result of the Pope's visit in January \nof 1998. Unfortunately, if that were the case, there has, in fact, been \na significant worsening of the human rights situation in Cuba since the \nPope's visit.\n  According to the independent group, Human Rights Watch,\n\n       As 1998 drew to a close, Cuba's stepped up persecutions and \n     harassments of dissidents, along with its refusal to grant \n     amnesty to hundreds of remaining political prisoners or [to] \n     reform its criminal code, marked a disheartening return to \n     heavy-handed repression.\n\n  The Cuban Government also recently passed a measure known as Law 80 \nwhich criminalizes peaceful, prodemocratic activities and independent \njournalism, with penalties of up to 20 years in jail.\n  The State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices in \nCuba for 1998 notes that the government continues to systematically \nviolate the fundamental civil and political rights of its citizens. \nHuman rights advocates and members of independent professional \nassociations, including journalists, economists, doctors, and lawyers \nare routinely harassed, threatened, arrested, detained, imprisoned and \ndefamed by the government. All fundamental freedoms are denied to \ncitizens. In addition, the Cuban Government severely restricts worker \nrights, including the right to form independent trade unions, and \nemploys forced labor, including child labor.\n  The most recent example of this horrible repression in Cuba is the \ntrial of four prominent dissidents--Vladimiro Roca, Marta Beatriz \nRoque, Felix Bonne and Rene Gomez Manzano. They were all charged with \nsedition. After being detained for over 19 months for peacefully \nvoicing their opinion, the trial of these four brave patriots has drawn \ninternational condemnation. To demonstrate the hideous nature of the \nCastro regime, Marta Beatriz Roque has been ill, believed to be \nsuffering from cancer, and has been denied medical attention during her \nlong period of detention.\n  During the trial, authorities have rounded up scores of other \nindividuals, including journalists and dissidents, and jailed them for \nthe duration of the trial. The trial was conducted in complete secrecy \nwith photographers prevented from even photographing the streets around \nthe courthouse. This trial reminds me of the worst days of Stalinist \nrepression in the Soviet Union.\n  This week, Castro's dictatorship found the four dissidents guilty and \nsentenced them to terms ranging from 3\\1/2\\ to 5 years--5 years in \nprison for simply making a statement about democracy. This action has \noutraged the world.\n  This outrageous spectacle has caused even Castro's closest friends to \nrethink their relationship with Cuba. Canadian Prime Minister Chretien \nhas indicated that Canada will review its entire relationship with \nCastro. The European Union issued a strong statement condemning this \nrepression.\n  This is not the type of conduct that we have come to expect in our \nhemisphere, where Cuba remains the only nondemocratic government. This \nlevel of repression and complete disregard for international norms \ncannot be ignored. I hope that all of our colleagues will join my \ncolleague, Senator Mack, and myself, in condemning the human rights \nsituation in Cuba and calling for action at the United Nations Human \nRights Commission.\n  Last month, we voted unanimously to support a resolution condemning \nhuman rights in China. Unfortunately, we have within 100 miles of our \nshores a situation in Cuba that is worse than that halfway around the \nworld in China--a situation that deserves the full effort of our \ngovernment to assure that it is not ignored by the international \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a series of \nnewspaper items from the press in this country as well as in Europe, \nLatin America and in Canada, condemning the human rights abuses in \nCuba.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Mar. 18, 1999]\n\n                Free Four Dissidents, Europe Tells Cuba\n\n                        (By Andres Oppenheimer)\n\n       The 15-country European Union issued a strong statement \n     Wednesday calling for the release of four Cuban dissidents \n     who received harsh sentences in Havana this week, while \n     European and Latin American officials said they are \n     rethinking their recent overtures to the island.\n       In a statement issued in Brussels, the EU said the Cuban \n     dissidents, who received prison terms of between 3\\1/2\\ and 5 \n     years for publishing a pamphlet criticizing the government, \n     had been exercising the universally recognized right to \n     freedom of expression. ``The European Union cannot accept \n     that citizens who do so be criminalized by state \n     authorities,'' the statement said.\n       The four dissidents--Vladimiro Roca, Felix Bonne, Rene \n     Gomez Manzano and Marta Beatriz Roque--are well known \n     intellectuals who were arrested after publishing a manifesto \n     titled The Homeland belongs to all.\n       The French news agency AFP reported Wednesday that Cuba's \n     failure to release the four could lead to Cuba's exclusion \n     from upcoming talks between the EU and African, Caribbean and \n     Pacific Rim developing countries. EU officials were not \n     available late Wednesday to comment on the report.\n       The EU recalled that it had expected the four dissidents to \n     be released last year when it agreed to Cuba's request for \n     observer status in its discussions with developing countries \n     who are beneficiaries of Europe's Lome economic cooperation \n     agreement.\n       ``The EU therefore repeats its calls for the prompt release \n     of the four and will continue to evaluate the development of \n     this matter,'' the statement said.\n       ``In addition, the EU wants to convey its disappointment at \n     the fact that neither diplomats nor foreign news media were \n     allowed to attend the trial of the dissidents, despite the \n     fact that their relatives had been told that the trial would \n     be open to the public,'' it said.\n       The EU also said it was concerned about the temporary \n     detention and house arrest of several dozens people connected \n     to the imprisoned dissidents and by new Cuban laws that \n     ``curtail the exercise of citizen's rights.''\n       Although Cuba customarily rejects such denunciations as \n     intervention in its internal affairs, the EU statement is \n     considered significant because the European group has \n     steadfastly maintained friendly diplomatic and trade \n     relations with Cuba in the face of threats of retaliation \n     from powerful critics of Cuba in the U.S. Congress.\n       The Helms-Burton Act, which imposes sanctions on countries \n     investing in Cuban property confiscated from U.S. citizens, \n     was aimed at some European investors but their governments \n     have challenged the law and refused to back down.\n       In a telephone interview hours before the statement was \n     released, Sweden's international cooperation minister, Pierre \n     Shori, told The Herald that the recent developments in Cuba \n     are ``alarming.'' Shori said that ``the toughening of the \n     laws against dissidents goes against what the Cuban \n     authorities have said in their dialogue with the European \n     Union.''\n       The EU statement came a day after Canada said it was \n     reconsidering its support for Cuba's return to the \n     Organization of American States (OAS) after Monday's \n     sentencing of the four dissidents. Cuba's OAS membership was \n     suspended in 1962.\n       The EU statement did not mention the possibility of \n     excluding Cuba from the first European-Latin American summit, \n     to be held June 28-29 in Rio de Janeiro. Fifteen European and \n     33 Latin American and Caribbean presidents, including Cuba's \n     Fidel Castro, are expected to attend.\n       The EU condemnation of Cuba's latest crackdown against \n     peaceful opponents, however, marks a possible reversal of the \n     island's ties with the European Union, which had been warming \n     up since 1996 and appeared ready for a significant \n     improvement since Pope John Paul II's visit to the island \n     last year.\n       Meanwhile, top officials from several Latin American \n     countries--including Chile, Uruguay, Argentina and El \n     Salvador--said their governments were rethinking whether to \n     attend a summit of Ibero-American countries in Havana in \n     November. Nicaragua has already announced it will not attend.\n       Latin American foreign ministers are to discuss \n     participation at the Havana summit at a meeting in Veracruz, \n     Mexico, on Friday. But a senior Mexican official said \n     Mexico--which presides over the Veracruz meeting--will oppose \n     any effort to organize a boycott of the Cuba summit and that \n     such a move ``is not on the agenda.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Financial Times, Mar. 17, 1999]\n\n                     Cuba: Trading Partners Protest\n\n                          (By Pascal Fletcher)\n\n       Cuba has jailed our well-known political dissidents accused \n     of sedition, drawing condemnation from the U.S. and criticism \n     from leading trade and investment partners Canada and Spain.\n       The jail sentences announced on Monday ranged from 3\\1/2\\ \n     to five years and were less than those sought by the \n     prosecution. But foreign diplomats said they still sent a \n     strong message from Cuba's one-party Communist government \n     that it would not tolerate opposition, even when it is \n     peaceful.\n       Jean Chretien, Canada's prime minister, who had asked Fidel \n     Castro, Cuba's president, to release the four, described the \n     sentences as ``disappointing'' and added his government would \n     be reviewing the range of its bilateral activities with \n     Havana. Jose Maria Aznar, Spanish premier, said the jail \n     terms were a ``step backwards'' for human rights in Cuba.\n       The four--Vladimiro Roca, Felix Bonne, Rene Gomez and \n     Martha Beatriz Roque--were convicted of inciting sedition \n     after they criticised one-party communist rule, called for a \n     boycott of elections and urged foreign investors to think \n     twice about investing in Cuba.\n       Mr. Roca, the son of Cuban Communist party founder Blas \n     Roca, was jailed for five years.\n       Mr. Bonne and Mr. Gomez each received four-year sentences \n     and Ms. Roque three-and-a-half years. All had already been \n     held for 20 months.\n       U.S. President Bill Clinton called for their immediate \n     release, saying they had not received a fair trial.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 2, 1999]\n\n                            The Havana Four\n\n       Vladimiro Roca, Martha Beatriz Roque, Felix Bonne, Rene \n     Gomez: Note those names. They are dissidents in Communist-\n     ruled Cuba who went to trial in Havana yesterday. These brave \n     people were jailed a year and a half ago for holding news \n     conferences for foreign journalists and diplomats, urging \n     voters to boycott Cuba's one-party elections, warning \n     foreigners that their investments would contribute to Cuban \n     suffering and critizing President Fidel Castro's grip on \n     power. For these ``offenses'' the four face prison sentences \n     of five, or six years.\n       Castro Cuba has typically Communist notions of justice. By \n     official doctrine, there are no political prisoners, only \n     common criminals. President Castro rejects the designation of \n     the four, in the international appeals for their freedom, as \n     ``prisoners of conscience.'' Their trial is closed to the \n     foreign press. Some of their colleagues were reportedly \n     arrested to keep them from demonstrating during the trial.\n       Fidel Castro is now making an energetic effort to recruit \n     foreign businessmen to help him compensate for the trade and \n     investment lost by the continuing American embargo and by \n     withdrawal of the old Soviet subsidies. He is scoring some \n     success: British Airways, for instance, says it is opening a \n     Havana service. Many of the countries engaged in these \n     contacts with Cuba do so on the basis that by their policy of \n     ``constructive engagement'' they are opening up the regime \n     more effectively to democratic and free-market currents than \n     is the United States by its harder-line policy.\n       The trial of the four provides a good test of this \n     proposition. The four are in the vanguard of Cuba's small \n     nonviolent political opposition. Acquittal would indicate \n     that in this case anyway the authorities are listening to the \n     international appeals for greater political freedom. But if \n     the four are convicted and sentenced, it will show that the \n     regime won't permit any opposition at all. What then will be \n     international crowd have to say about the society-\n     transforming power of their investment?\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Mar. 11, 1999]\n\n            ``The Sadness I Feel for Cuba Stays on my Mind''\n\n                            (By Raul Rivero)\n\n       Havana.--From my cell I could see Tania Quintero, Cuba \n     Press correspondent, her face shadowed by the cell's iron \n     lines. From her cell, she could hear the hoarse voice of \n     Odalys Cubelo, another Cuba Press correspondent. And one \n     could feel the presence of Dulce Maria de Quesada, dissident, \n     quiet and silent, sitting on the edge of the gray cement bed.\n       Not too far from this dark basement, where we were being \n     held, the trial of the four members of the Working Group of \n     Internal Dissidence was taking place.\n       Tania wanted to be present at the trial because she is a \n     first cousin of Vladimiro Roca, one of the accused. Odalys \n     wanted to cover the trial as a journalist, and Dulce Maria, a \n     retired librarian and dissident, wanted to be there because \n     she felt that she had the right to show a gesture of \n     solidarity with the accused.\n       I also wanted to follow the trial as a journalist, as a \n     Cuban citizen and as a friend of the four intellectuals being \n     tried. Yet I was jailed with eight common prisoners accused \n     of violence, assault, armed robbery and pimping.\n       Of course, many ideas crossed my mind, and I experienced \n     many feelings during those 30 hours in jail. As days go by, \n     however, it is the shame and sadness I feel for Cuba that \n     stays on my mind.\n       I ask myself, what are these professional and decent women \n     doing in a police-station cell? What is going on in Cuba that \n     honorable daughters of this country, belonging to three \n     different generations and from different political origins \n     and upbringings, may be arrested on the streets and placed in \n     a cell\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\n     with women accused of prostitution and armed robbery?\n       I felt more pain for the imprisonment of those three \n     friends than for my own jailing. This is because I perceived \n     their punishment as a symbol anticipating a sacrificial pyre.\n       Tania and Odalys--like Marvin Hernandez, who had been \n     imprisoned for 48 hours and began a hunger strike in \n     Cienfuegos--have demonstrated professionalism, integrity and \n     discipline while going through this exercise of independent \n     journalism in Cuba.\n       A few hours after being relatively free to go home, I was \n     to have a unique ``meeting'' with Marta Beatriz Roque Cabello \n     [one of the dissidents being tried]. There she was in my \n     living room, the brilliant economist who loves poetry and \n     good music, wearing her prisoner's uniform--on my TV screen. \n     A state broadcaster was insulting her, calling her a \n     stateless person and a ``marionette of imperialism.''\n       Since Marta's ``visit'' was so peculiar, I almost commented \n     aloud to her about a note that she sent me from the Manto \n     Negro [Black Cloak] prison at the end of 1998. ``Here we \n     are,'' she had written, ``without any apparent solution but \n     with a lot of faith in God, because there is nothing \n     impossible for Him.''\n       Marta asked me to put together for her ``some material on \n     neoliberal business globalization and the financial crisis in \n     Asia. I want to state my opinions on the subject.'' A strange \n     request from a woman in prison, it's true. Marta's presence \n     in the kind of Cuba that we have can be disquieting and odd.\n       Her note concluded: ``Say `hello' to Blanca and tell her I \n     recall her great coffee. I hope God allows me to drink some \n     of it soon, sitting in your living room.''\n       There I had been with Tania, Odalys and Dulce Maria in the \n     jail, and Marta later ``came'' to my home, and I couldn't \n     even offer her coffee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the London Economist, Mar. 6, 1999]\n\n                            Cosy Old Castro?\n\n       Like any old trouper, Fidel Castro has a neat sense of \n     timing, and surefooted ability to confirm both his friends \n     and his critics in their views. It is three years since his \n     air force cruelly shot down two unarmed planes sent \n     provocatively towards Cuba by an exile group. The result was \n     Bill Clinton's signature on the Helms-Burton act, tightening \n     still further the American embargo against the island. Helms-\n     Burton is not, in fact, the most damaging piece of such \n     American law, but the regime hates it. It was no coincidence \n     that last month Mr. Castro proposed, and his rubber-stamp \n     legislature at once approved, fierce penalties for all who \n     ``collaborate'' with the American government--or, \n     specifically, with foreign media--in the effort to strangle \n     Cuba's economy or upset its socialist system. The few brave \n     Cubans who dare to criticise the regime, and even to publish \n     their views abroad, said this was aimed at them. And, as if \n     to confirm it, the regime chose this week to put on trial--\n     for just one day, and almost out of public view--four of the \n     best-known dissidents.\n       Their offense, among others, is to have published in mid-\n     1997 a document entitled ``La Patria es de Todos'', ``The \n     Fatherland Belongs to All''--a claim deeply offensive to Mr. \n     Castro's Communist Party, which likes to claim Cuba, its \n     anti-colonial past and its present alike as exclusive party \n     property. The four heretics were promptly arrested. Even \n     though the new law was not applied to their case, they now \n     risk sentences of years in prison, for the crime of telling \n     the truth.\n       Mr. Castro has thus confirmed his admirers' unwavering \n     belief in his unwavering addiction, after 40 years of power, \n     to the basics of Stalinism. Cuba's official media, of course, \n     approve; and even abroad the sort of lickspittles who 40-50 \n     years ago swallowed the show-trials of Eastern Europe can be \n     found to defend this fresh attack on those whom they smear as \n     ``so-called'' dissidents (if not common criminals, nut-cases \n     or both). More important, Mr. Castro has comprehensively \n     thumbed his nose at outsiders who thought that, while \n     reluctantly opening chinks of free-marketry into Cuba's \n     economy he might also open chinks for free thought and free \n     speech. These hopefuls included Pope John Paul, who came \n     visiting 14 months ago, and whose visit did indeed win \n     freedom (albeit mostly in exile) for some dissidents, and \n     greater freedom for his church. Its inter-American bishops' \n     conference was held last month in Cuba, for the first time. \n     But even as the bishops met, the new gagging law was going \n     through.\n       This renewed assault on free thought must worry those \n     governments--in Latin America, in Canada and Europe--which \n     argue that constructive engagement may get Mr. Castro to \n     loosen his grip. An Ibero-American summit is due to be held \n     in Cuba this year. Spain has talked of a royal visit, though \n     the trials have already led it to rethink. Even Mr. Clinton \n     has recently made some gestures towards Cuba's citizenry, if \n     only to have its regime spit them back in his face.\n       The stick plainly does not work: the American embargo no \n     more promotes freedom in Cuba today than for decades past. \n     But neither, on current form, do dialogue, trade and \n     investment, and the carrot of more if only Mr. Castro would \n     let go a little. His successors may soften, hoping to \n     preserve his achievements (yes, they exist) and their own \n     power, while loosening the handcuffs of Marxist economics and \n     thought-control. But the old ham himself, it seems, aims to \n     hoof on.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Globe and Mail, Mar. 3, 1999]\n\n                         Cuba's Favourite Patsy\n\n                            (By Marcus Gee)\n\n       Last April, Jean Chretien flew down to meet Cuba's Fidel \n     Castro, becoming the first Canadian prime minister to do so \n     since 1976. By all accounts they got along famously. Mr. \n     Chretien praised Cuban-Canadian friendship and told a few \n     jokes. Mr. Castro praised Cuban-Canadian friendship and told \n     a few jokes. Mr. Chretien had just one thing to ask of his \n     host: Could Cuba please release four Cubans who had been \n     jailed for criticizing the government.\n       On Monday, 10 months later, Mr. Castro gave his answer. He \n     put the four on trial for sedition. Marta Beatriz Roque, \n     Felix Bonne, Rene Gomez Manzano and Vladimiro Roca--the so-\n     called Group of Four--face jail terms of up to six years for \n     ``subverting the order of our socialist state.'' Their crime: \n     urging voters to boycott Cuba's rigged one-party elections \n     and scolding foreign investors for propping up the Castro \n     regime.\n       The decision to press on with the trial despite protests \n     from Canada and others is yet another example of Mr. Castro's \n     determination to crush all opposition to his ragged \n     dictatorship. It is also final, definitive proof that \n     Canada's Cuba policy has failed. With the opening of this \n     caricature of justice, that policy lies gutted like a trout \n     on a pier.\n       Ottawa calls its policy ``constructive engagement.'' When \n     it took office in 1993, Mr. Chretien's government decided to \n     step up contacts with Cuba. More high-level visits, more \n     trade and investment, more development aid.\n       The idea was to set Canada apart from the United States, \n     which has tried for years to bring down Mr. Castro with a \n     trade embargo and other pressure tactics. The U.S. strategy \n     had clearly failed; so Ottawa would try a gentler, more \n     Canadian approach. By ``engaging'' Mr. Castro, we would win \n     his confidence and persuade him of the error of his ways, \n     meanwhile tweaking Uncle Sam's nose and winning a new market \n     for Canadian exporters.\n       In a visit to Cuba in 1997, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy \n     persuaded Mr. Castro to let Canada help Cuba build a ``civil \n     society''--a favourite Lloydism. Canadian MPs would visit \n     Cuba to impart their wisdom about parliamentary democracy. \n     Canadian lawyers and judges would tell their Cuban \n     counterparts how an independent justice system works. \n     Canadians would even help Cuba strengthen its citizens' \n     complaint process, a kind of national suggestion box.\n       All this came to pass. The practical effect on human rights \n     in Cuba: zero. Mr. Castro's human-rights record remains the \n     worst in the Americas. Cuba is still a one-party state where \n     elections are a sham, the judiciary is still a tool of state \n     oppression, independent newspapers and free trade unions \n     don't exist, and more than 300 Cubans still languish in jail \n     for ``counter-revolutionary crimes.''\n       Far from allowing a civil society to flourish, Mr. Castro \n     has been cracking down. Just two weeks before the trial of \n     the Group of Four, the rubber-stamp National Assembly passed \n     a new anti-subversion law that sets penalties of up to 20 \n     years in jail for anyone ``collaborating'' with the tough \n     U.S. policy on Cuba. Clearly aimed at Cuba's tiny group of \n     independent journalists, the law would make it a crime, for \n     example, to talk to the U.S.-funded Cuban-language Radio \n     Marti. Cuba's fear of bad press is so intense that it jailed \n     a Cuban doctor for eight years after he talked to the foreign \n     press about a dengue fever epidemic in the city of Santiago.\n       Mr. Castro's one concession to Canada, if it can be called \n     that, has been to release a dozen or so political prisoners \n     and let them come to Canada--in other words, to send them \n     into exile. When Mr. Chretien came tuque in hand to Havana \n     last April, bleating about the value of ``dialogue over \n     confrontation,'' his host used him as a backdrop for a rant \n     against the U.S. embargo, which he compared to genocide.\n       Yet his gains from the cozy relationship with Canada have \n     been huge. His strategy for many years has been to drive a \n     wedge between the United States and its allies on the Cuba \n     issue. Helped by the stupid Helms-Burton law, which seeks to \n     penalize foreign companies that do business with Cuba, he has \n     been making new friendships in Europe, the Caribbean and \n     Latin America. The friendship of Canada, a country renowned \n     for championing human rights, is by far his biggest coup. And \n     he didn't even have to ask.\n       In its summary of Canada's Cuba policy, the Department of \n     Foreign Affairs explains why Cuba has been so keen on \n     Canada's friendship. ``Given our longstanding relations, \n     Canada's status as a technologically advanced North American \n     nation, and the lack of a heavily politicized agenda, Canada \n     has been seen as a trusted interlocutor with a balanced \n     perspective.'' Down at the pub, they call that a dupe.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record a letter from the President of the AFL-CIO, John J. Sweeney, \ndirected to Fidel Castro, dated March 5, 1999, condemning the human \nrights conditions in Cuba.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1999.\n     Dr. Fidel Castro,\n     President, Republic of Cuba, Plaza de la Revolucion, Havana, \n         Cuba.\n       Dear Mr. President: The AFL-CIO, representing over 13 \n     million working men and women in the United States, \n     vigorously objects to your government's recent measures to \n     silence all opposition in your country, including the passage \n     of laws proscribing freedom of expression with the penalty of \n     death, and increasingly violent physical attacks, arrests, \n     and other forms of harassment perpetrated against pro-\n     democracy activists.\n       Despite Pope John Paul's historic visit to your country, \n     during which he asked the world to open itself to Cuba and \n     for Cuba to open itself to the world, and the subsequent \n     release of several political prisoners, these most recent \n     measures promulgated and implemented by your government make \n     for a giant step backward. A number of victims of this most \n     recent wave of repression were independent trade union \n     activists.\n       Some human rights activists have termed the recent campaign \n     of repression as the most significant operation since the \n     1996 break-up of the Concilio Cubano. On March 1, security \n     forces detained dozens of local activists and blocked foreign \n     observers, including the chief U.S. Envoy to Havana, from \n     attending the trial of the so-called ``Group of Four.'' \n     Vladimir Roca the son of the deceased Cuban Communist hero \n     Blas Roca, Marta Beatrize Roque, an economist, Felix Bonne, \n     an academic, and Rene Gomez, an attorney, have been jailed \n     for the past 19 months for holding news conferences for \n     foreign journalists and diplomats, for urging voters to \n     boycott your country's one-party elections, for warning \n     foreigners that their investments would contribute to Cuban \n     suffering and for openly criticizing the Communist Party. \n     Such actions would be considered a normal exercise of freedom \n     of expression in any democratic society. We also understand \n     that the defendants are jointly accused of ``other acts \n     against the security of the state in relation with a crime of \n     sedition.'' For these ``offenses'', the four defendants face \n     prison sentences of five to six years. Although your \n     government denies holding prisoners of conscience, it labels \n     the four, as it does other opposition figures, as ``counter-\n     revolutionary'' criminals.\n       The unwarranted arrests, threats and physical intimidation \n     are in direct violation of the rights defined and protected \n     by the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \n     to which Cuba is a signatory.\n       The AFL-CIO respectfully requests that your government \n     rescind these most recent measures of repression, as well as \n     freeing the scores of prisoners of conscience who still \n     inhabit your country's jails. The AFL-CIO also wishes to \n     acknowledge and condemn the recent campaign of government-\n     sponsored repression which victimized the individuals \n     mentioned in the list which is enclosed. Although a number of \n     these individuals have been released from state detention, \n     they should never have been arrested in the first place.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John J. Sweeney,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I commend our distinguished colleagues from \nFlorida, Senators Bob Graham and Connie Mack, for their leadership in \nthe bipartisan effort to defend the rights of the Cuban people.\n  Their Senate Resolution No. 57--of which I am a proud cosponsor--is a \ntimely reminder to the administration that the United States must speak \nout clearly in behalf of those whose own voices are choked by communist \nrepression--be they in China or Cuba. Our principled, consistent \ndefense of human rights must be heard at the upcoming meeting of the \nU.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.\n  In recent weeks, Fidel Castro has executed a brutal crackdown on \ncourageous Cubans and independent journalists who seek freedom from the \nheavy-handed treatment imposed on them by the Castro government.\n  Just this week, he sentenced four prominent, peaceful dissidents to \nup to 5 years in prison for daring to criticize Castro's failed \ncommunist experiment.\n  There's nothing new about Castro's brutality. But the latest Castro \ncrackdown is significant because it violates Castro's commitments to \nthe Pope. The Pope asked Castro to ``open up to the world'' and to \nrespect human rights. Castro's reply has now been heard: He gave a \nbloody thumbs-down to the Pope's plea.\n  The latest crackdown also comes despite years of Canadian coddling \nand European investment in Cuba. The Canadians' self-described ``policy \nof engagement'' has served to prop-up the Castro regime but has done \nnothing to advance human rights or democracy.\n  Thos who have urged unilateral concessions from the United States in \norder to nudge Castro toward change surely will now acknowledge that \nappeasement has failed--as it always does.\n  The U.S. response to this latest wave of repression must be resolute \nand energetic. We must invigorate our policy to maintain the embargo on \nCastro, while undermining Castro's embargo on the Cuban people.\n  We should make no secret of our goal: I myself have declared publicly \nand repeatedly that, for the sake of the people of Cuba, Fidel must go. \nAnd, whether he goes vertically or horizontally is up to him.\n  Since the Pope's visit to Cuba, I have urged the administration to \nincrease United States support for Cuban dissidents and independent \ngroups, which include the Catholic Church. Once again, I call on the \nClinton administration to increase U.S. support for dissidents, to \nrespect the codification of the embargo, and to work with us on this \nbipartisan policy.\n  Castro's recent measures make clear that he is feeling the heat from \nour efforts to reach out to the Cuban people. That is why Castro is \ntrying to crush dissidents and independent journalists, who are daring \nto tell the truth about his regime. That is why he has made it a \ncriminal offense for Cubans to engage in friendly contact with \nAmericans.\n  Castro's cowardly brutality--when one pauses to think about it--shows \nthat he is a weak and frightened despot. His cruelty should make us \nmore determined than ever to sweep Castro-ism onto the ash heap of \nhistory.\n  Senate Resolution 57 calls upon the administration to use its voice \nand vote at the upcoming meeting of the U.N. Human Rights Commission to \nsupport a strong resolution that will condemn Castro's systematic \nrepression and appoint a special rapporteur to document the regime's \nwillful violations of universally recognized human rights.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. Res. 57, \nexpressing the sense of the Senate regarding the human rights situation \nin Cuba.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Graham, Mack and my other colleagues in \nsupport of this resolution. This is a timely resolution. As the U.N. \nHuman Rights Commission is preparing to meet in Geneva later this \nmonth, we are witnessing a new crackdown on human rights in Cuba.\n  This week, four prominent dissidents were sentenced to jail terms \nranging from three and a half to five years by the Cuban government. \nTheir crime--exercising their right to speak and support a peaceful \ntransition to democracy.\n  These courageous people, Vladimiro Roca, Rene Manzano, Felix Bonne, \nand Marta Beatriz Roque, were arrested for their peaceful criticism of \nthe Communist Party platform. They were held over one year without \nbeing charged. They were tried in a closed door proceeding that \nviolated all standards of due process. Scores of human rights activists \nand journalists were arrested before and during their trial to prevent \ndemonstrations of support for the accused. Fidel Castro ignored calls \nfrom the Vatican and the Canadian government for their release. \nYesterday, the European Union issued a strong statement calling for \ntheir release.\n  The trial prompted international outrage, but came as little surprise \nfor those who have followed Castro's policy of eliminating peaceful \ndissent. The government regularly pursues a policy of using detention \nand intimidation to force human rights activists to leave Cuba or \nabandon their efforts. The four dissidents bravely rejected the Cuban \ngovernment's offers to go into exile rather than face trial.\n  One year after the Papal visit, an event which many hoped would bring \ngreater openness to Cuba, Fidel Castro has slammed the door closed on \nthe world and on the Cuban people. 1999 has brought about no change in \nCastro's unyielding policy of stifling human rights. To the contrary, \nCastro is tightening his iron grip on the Cuban people.\n  First, he began the year by rejecting the Administration's expanded \nhumanitarian measures. Among other initiatives, the measures establish \ndirect mail service between the U.S. and Cuba, and expand remittances \nto individual Cuban families and charitable organizations. These \nmeasures, designed to ease the suffering of the Cuban people caused by \n40 years of\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\ncommunism, were called acts of ``aggression'' by the Cuban government.\n  Second, a new security law for the ``Protection of National \nIndependence and Economy'' was passed by the Cuban government in \nFebruary. The law criminalizes any form of cooperation or participation \nin pro-democracy efforts. It imposes penalties ranging from 20 to 30 \nyears, for those found to be cooperating with the U.S. government. \nGovernment officials have already warned human rights activists that \nviolations are punishable under the new law.\n  And third, the State Department Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices details the same human rights abuses as last year and the \nyear before. One is hard-pressed to find any improvements. The Report \nrepeats last year's finding that the Cuban government's human rights \nrecord remains poor. It reiterates the finding that the government \ncontinues to ``systematically violate fundamental civil and political \nrights of its citizens.'' Security forces ``committed serious human \nrights abuses.''\n  The examples of human rights violations in the Report are numerous, \nand startling. Human rights activists are beaten in their homes and \noutside churches. People are arbitrarily detained and arrested. \nPolitical prisoners are denied food and medicine brought by their \nfamilies. Even children are made to stand in the rain chanting slogans \nagainst pro-democracy activists.\n  I would, therefore, say to those countries seeking increased ties \nwith Cuba--take a look at this record. Do not lend any credibility or \nlegitimacy to a government that denies its people basic human rights, \nand punishes those seeking a peaceful transition to democracy.\n  While the Western Hemisphere gradually moves towards greater respect \nfor human rights, Cuba remains mired in its communist past. Once again, \nit is the Cuban people who suffer.\n  This resolution demonstrates that the United States' Senate stands \nunited, not divided, in condemning human rights abuses in Cuba. It also \nsends a strong message to not only the U.N. Human Rights Commission, \nbut also to the Cuban people. We will stand with you and support you \nuntil the day that you are free.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.\n  Mr. MACK. There are no further speakers on my side, so I am prepared \nto yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There are no other speakers on our side of the aisle, so \nI also yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. MACK.

Mr. President, today, along with Senators Harkin and \nDurbin, I introduce an amendment to add $28 million this fiscal year to \nthe Conservation Reserve Program CRP, run\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\nby the Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS of USDA. The \namendment is fully offset and acceptable to Senator Cochran and my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  One of the benefits of my job is having an opportunity to travel many \nof the highways and backroads of the State of Wisconsin. And, I like so \nmany other residents of my State, never tire of the landscape of \nrolling hills, grazing dairy cows, and handsome farms. In the last few \nyears, dotted among these lovely farms, is a new sight--or, perhaps \nmore accurately, a sight so old that not many of us have had a chance \nto experience it. There are patches of land where the native trees, \ngrasses and flowers are growing again; where white tail deer and \npheasant walk among wood violets and sugar maples the way they did 150 \nyears ago. These pieces of land, restored to their original natural \nbeauty, are living museums--reminders to ourselves and our children of \nthe magnificence of Wisconsin's native landscape.\n  Much of this land restoration is due to the Conservation Reserve \nProgram, a federal program that, in effect, rents land from farmers and \nrestores it to its natural state. Wisconsin farmers have \nenthusiastically embraced this effort enrolling 72,000 acres of land in \nthe CRP this year along. Altogether, the CRP has restored 600,000 acres \nof land in Wisconsin.\n  Despite this program's great success--in Wisconsin and rural areas \nacross the country--a provision of the 1996 farm bill has inadvertently \nput the CRP in jeopardy. Section 11 of the farm bill capped the \nadministrative costs that the USDA can pay out on any program. The \nprovision was an attempt to slow some over-enthusiastic compute \npurchasing at the USDA. Unfortunately, it also capped the technical \nassistance allowed under the CRP in a way that will make it illegal for \nthe CRP to identify or enroll new acres after May of this year. Our \namendment today, by adding $28 million for these necessary \nadministrative functions, will allow the CRP to continue its work.\n  Our offset today is from the food stamp reserve fund, and I want to \nsay a word about that. Every year, we put aside more money than we \nanticipate we will need to cover our food stamps obligations. We do so \nin order to make sure that that very vital anti-hunger program is \navailable even if demand increases because of an unexpected economic \ndownturn. As the year progresses without such a downturn, it is \nappropriate and responsible budgeting to move some of those funds, \nwhich will not be needed, into areas where there is pressing needs.\n  That said, we still must keep a reasonable balance in reserve for \nfood stamps, and in no way should this fund be viewed by others with \namendments as a piggy bank.\n  The CRP is an example of an environmental program that successfully \nmarries the interests of farmers, conservationists, and nature lovers. \nIt is voluntary, it is local in direction, it is effective. I am glad \nwe were able to agree to keep such a worthy program alive this year, \nand I thank my colleagues who have helped clear this amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 116\n\n (Purpose: To appropriate additional funds to the fund maintained for \n funds made available under section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935, \n and to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to waive the limitation \non the amount of such funds that may be devoted during fiscal year 1999 \n    to 1 agricultural commodity or product thereof, with an offset)\n\n       On page 2, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n\n\n          funds for strengthening markets, income, and supply\n\n                              (section 32)\n\n       For an additional amount for the fund maintained for funds \n     made available under section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935 \n     (7 U.S.C. 612c), $150,000,000: Provided, That the entire \n     amount shall be available only to the extent an official \n     budget request for $150,000,000, that includes designation of \n     the entire amount of the request as an emergency requirement \n     as defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985, as amended, is transmitted by the \n     President to Congress: Provided further, That the entire \n     amount is designated by Congress as an emergency requirement \n     under section 251(b)(2)(A) of such Act.\n       On page 7, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n                    GENERAL PROVISION, THIS CHAPTER\n\n       Sec. __.

Mr. President, I rise today to join the senior senator \nfrom Missouri, Senator Bond, in offering an amendment to help the \nplight of the hog farmers in the state of Missouri. Hog farmers in our \nhome state, and across the nation, are experiencing a disaster outside \nof their control, much like a flood, drought, or disease. It was \nprojected that 25 to 40 percent of Missouri's pork producers would lose \ntheir family farms if we do not take immediate and substantial action. \nThat is why we have offered this amendment.\n  The statistics are devastating. Since June 1998, pork farmers \nexperienced a roughly 70 percent decline in pork prices, from $40 per \nhundredweight to $9 per hundredweight. The 1998 average price was an \nastounding 30 percent below the average price in 1932. In 1933, market \nhogs brought $3.53 a hundredweight, which is $47.29 in today's dollars.\n  There was a $2.6 billion equity meltdown on hog farms across America, \nand Economist Glen Grimes, at the University of Missouri, projects that \nhog farmers will suffer another one billion loss in 1999.\n  Some hog farmers have told me that they would have been better off \nfinancially if their hogs had simply been destroyed by a natural \ndisaster. At one point, the feed the hogs were eating was worth more \nthan the hogs themselves. And not long ago, consumers were paying more \nfor a canned ham than the 260-pound hog it came from.\n  To address this disaster on hog farms across America, the \nAdministration committed $50 million to their plight. While this amount \nsends a message of support to hog farmers, it is inadequate in light of \nthe severity of the crisis to our family farms.\n  The Missouri Farm Bureau and the Missouri Pork Producers requested \nour assistance, and we have responded. Today, Senator Bond and I are \noffering this amendment, which makes $250 million available for farmers \nstruggling to survive the severe drop in pork prices. Under the \namendment, the U.S. Department of Agriculture would be provided with \n$150 million new funds and would be given the authority to use another \n$100 million, that the USDA already has, to help hog farmers.\n  The amendment sends a clear and resounding message of support to \nMissouri's hog farmers. In my recent trips to Missouri, I met with \nnumerous hog farmers and was alarmed to hear them say that many of them \nwould have to sell the family farm if we do not act expediently. This \nsituation demands action, and I have taken immediate action at the \nrequest of Missouri's family farmers.\n  It is the understanding of those of us that have offered this \namendment today that the majority of the funds available to the \nSecretary of Agriculture will be used on behalf of our nation's pork \nfarmers. Last year, all of the major commodity groups received disaster \nassistance, but the hog farmers received nothing.\n  In current law (Section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935) the \nDepartment of Agriculture has broad authority to re-establish farmers' \npurchasing power by making payments, to encourage domestic consumption \nby diverting surpluses to low-income groups, and to encourage the \nexport of farm products through producer payments or other means. \nHowever, the amount devoted to any one commodity shall not exceed 25 \npercent of the Section 32 funds. Most recently, the USDA recently used \nits Section 32 authority to make a $50 million direct cash payment to \npork producers.\n\n  Our amendment adds $150 million to the USDA Section 32 Fund, to be \nused for hog farmers, and it waives the 25 percent cap on the USDA \nSection 32 Fund for the remainder of fiscal year 1999. These funds \nwould be made available to help the current emergency situation in the \npork industry.\n  In addition to today's amendment, I would also like to mention some \nof the initiatives that I have worked on with the Missouri Farm Bureau \nand the Missouri Pork Producers in order to address the pork crisis:\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\n  Initiated a request, with Senator Bob Kerrey (D-NE), to U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Charlene Barshefsky successfully urging her to add \nEuropean Union pork to the U.S. trade retaliation list against the EU's \nunfair trade practices.\n  Requested that the U.S. Government buy excess hogs from farmers and \nship U.S. pork as emergency assistance to Central America.\n  Wrote to the Prime Minister of Canada urging him to resolve work \nstoppage in the Ontario pork packers plant so that Canada can slaughter \nits hogs instead of flooding our slaughter houses with Canadian hogs.\n  Wrote to the President and the Secretary of Agriculture requesting \nthat they use all their authority to ensure that no unfair competition \nor antitrust practices exist in domestic pork markets. It concerns me \nthat farmer's prices for hogs at the farm gate have plummeted while \nprices at the cash register have not dropped equally for the consumer.\n  Requested of the Administration an immediate moratorium on burdensome \nnew federal regulations affecting hog producers, and wrote to the \nPresident to ease paperwork requirements placed on farmers and banks so \nthat the money can quickly get to those who need it.\n  Introduced a congressional resolution (S. Con. Res. 4) with Senator \nMax Baucus which demands that South Korea end its unfair trade \npractices and subsidies that hurt American pork producers. The \nresolution also urges the U.S. Trade Representative, the Secretary of \nTreasury, and the Secretary of Agriculture to take immediate action \nagainst such harmful Korean subsidies.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 117\n\n      (Purpose: To provide funding for rural water infrastructure)\n\n       On page 37, line 9 strike ``$313,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$343,000,000''.\n       On page 5, after line 20 insert the following:\n\n\n                  rural community advancement program\n\n       For an additional amount for the costs of direct loans and \n     grants of the rural utilities programs described in section \n     381E(d)(2) of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act \n     (7 U.S.C. 2009f), as provided in 7 U.S.C. 1926(a) and 7 \n     U.S.C. 1926C for distribution through the national reserve, \n     $30,000,000, of which $25,000,000 shall be for grants under \n     such program: Provided, That the entire amount shall be \n     available only to the extent an official budget request for \n     $30,000,000, that includes designation of the entire amount \n     of the request as an emergency requirement as defined in the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as \n     amended, is transmitted by the President to the Congress: \n     Provided further, That the entire amount is designated by \n     Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of such Act.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 118\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill insert the following \n     new section:\n       Sec.   .

Such state shall disburse the funds to individuals with \n     family incomes below the federal poverty level who have been \n     adversely affected by the commercial fishery failure or \n     failures. Provided, That the entire amount shall be available \n     only to the extent an official budget request for such \n     amount, that includes designation of the entire amount of the \n     request as an emergency requirement as defined in the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as \n     amended, is transmitted by the President to Congress. \n     Provided further, That the entire amount is designated by \n     Congress as an emergency requirement under section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of such Act.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 119\n\n       On page 2, line 11, strike $20,000,000 and insert \n     $25,000,000.\n       On page 2, line 13, strike $20,000,000 and insert \n     $25,000,000.\n       On page 37, line 9, increase the amount by $5,000,000.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment increases funding for \nUSDA's Emergency Grants to Assistance Low-Income Migrant and Seasonal \nFarmworkers program by $5 million. The increase in funding is provided \nto cover additional needs, including a possible increase in WIC \ncaseload as a result of the devastating citrus freeze which impacted \nCalifornia last December.\n  I understand the amendment has been agreed to on both sides, and I \nurge its adoption.\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Illinois \ngrieves with you.\n  I would also like to recognize the dedication of the local and State \nofficials and citizens who have prevented this tragedy from becoming \neven worse. Local citizens worked through the night and into the early \nmorning to locate victims, free them from the wreckage, and treat their \ninjuries. Public safety officials from Bourbonnais, and from the \ncommunities and counties surrounding it, worked above and beyond the \ncall of duty to save lives, rescue survivors, and prevent further harm \nfrom occurring.\n  Additionally, Federal officials from the Department of \nTransportation, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Highway \nAdministration, the Railroad Administration, and Health and Human \nServices have traveled to Illinois to lend their expertise in the \naftermath of this horrible accident.\n  And finally, nonprofit organizations like the American Red Cross have \nalso served the victims, families, and friends associated with this \naccident. At times like this we remember the fragility of human life, \nand recognize the magnanimity of the human spirit. We commend the many \nvolunteers and officials involved with the city of New Orleans \naccident. Their dedication to the welfare of those injured will be \nremembered in perpetuity.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, we were all saddened by the accident \ninvolving the City of New Orleans Amtrak train in Illinois on Monday \nnight.\n  Several Mississippians lost their lives in the accident including \nJune Bonnin of Nesbit, and Raney and Lacey Lipscomb of Lake Cormorant. \nI know my colleagues join me in extending our sympathy to their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, as is so often the case, tragedies such as this can \nbring out the best in individuals. Based on information provided to my \noffice, it appears that three of the students from Covenant Christian \nHigh School in Clinton, Mississippi, who were on the train, became \nheroes.\n  These students were part of a group of 15 students returning from a \nspring break trip to Canada. According to persons on the scene, Michael \nFreeman, Caleb McNair, and Jeffrey Sartor, all 17-year-old Clinton \nresidents, quickly reacted to the situation.\n  With fire quickly approaching from a nearby car, Michael and Caleb \nopened a window and began rescuing people trapped inside the train. \nJeffrey and Mrs. Phyllis Hurley, a chaperone who was injured herself, \nbegan helping people get out of the train too.\n  Caleb also assisted firefighters in getting elderly people to safety \nand getting a young girl freed from the wreckage. When firefighters and \nother help arrived, Michael was still on top of a car helping people \nfrom other cars over to the closest ladder and down from the train. \nEven after the young men were escorted to the side, they continued to \nhelp carry stretchers of wounded to safety.\n  Mr. President, I extend my sympathy to all the victims and their \nfamilies affected by the tragedy, and I commend the efforts of these \nyoung people and the many firefighters and emergency personnel who \nacted to save lives and assist the victims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2932-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2932-S2934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CERTIFIED NONSENSE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, here we go again. It seems that around \nthis time every year we launch into certification follies. The occasion \nis the annual requirement that the administration report to Congress on \nthe progress or lack of progress that countries are making in \ncooperating on combating drugs. This debate more recently gets \npersonalized around the issue of the certification of Mexico.\n  There seems to be two basic elements in this affair: The acceptance \nby some in Congress that the administration only lies on certification \ntherefore we should do away with the process and quit the pretense. And \nthose who argue that it is unfair to judge the behavior of others and \nto force the President to make such judgments.\n  I do not think that either of these views is accurate or does justice \nto the seriousness of the issues we are dealing with. They are also not \nconsonant with the actual requirements in certification.\n\n[[Page S2933]]\n\n  On the first point. The annual certification process does not require \nthe administration to lie. If an administration chooses to do so, it is \nnot the fault of the certification process. And the fix is not to \nchange the law to enable a lie. The fix is to insist on greater honesty \nin the process and compliance with the legal requirements.\n  Now, the Congress is no stranger to elaborate misrepresentations from \nadministrations. Given that fact, this does mean that differences in \njudgment necessarily mean that one party to the difference is lying. In \nthe past, I have not accepted all the arguments by the administration \nin certifying Mexico.\n  Indeed, self-evident facts make such an acceptance impossible and the \nadministration's insistence upon obvious daydreams embarrassing. But I \nhave, despite this, supported the overall decision on Mexico. I have \ndone this for several reasons.\n  Before I explain, let me summarize several passages from the law that \nrequires the President to report to Congress. There seems to be some \nconsiderable misunderstanding about what it says. The requirement is \nneither unusual nor burdensome. The President must inform Congress if \nduring the previous year any given major drug producing or transit \ncountry cooperated fully with the United States or international \nefforts to stop production or transit. These efforts can be part of a \nbilateral agreement with the United States. They can be unilateral \nefforts. Or they can be efforts undertaken in cooperation with other \ncountries, or in conformity with international law.\n  In making this determination, the President is asked to consider \nseveral things: the extent to which the country has met the goals and \nobjectives of the 1988 U.N. Convention on illicit drugs; the extent to \nwhich similar efforts are being made to combat money laundering and the \nflow of precursor chemicals; and the efforts being made to combat \ncorruption.\n  The purpose for these requirements is also quite simple. It is a \nrecognition by Congress, in response to public demand, that the U.S. \nGovernment take international illegal drug production and trafficking \nseriously. That it make this concern a matter of national interest. And \nthat, in conjunction with our efforts here and abroad, other countries \ndo their part in stopping production and transit. Imagine that. A \nrequirement that we and others should take illicit drug production and \ntransit seriously. That we should do something concrete about it. And \nthat, from time to time, we should get an accounting of what was done \nand whether it was effective.\n  I do not read in this requirement the problem that many seem to see. \nThis requirement is in keeping with the reality of the threat that \nillegal drugs pose to the domestic well-being of U.S. citizens. Illegal \ndrugs smuggled into this country by criminal gangs resident overseas \nkill more Americans annually than all the terrorist attacks on U.S. \ncitizens in the past 10 years. It is consistent with international law. \nAnd it is not unusually burdensome on the administration--apart from \nholding it to some realistic standard of accountability.\n  I know that administrations, here and abroad, are uncomfortable with \nsuch standards. But that shilly shally should not be our guide. \nCongress has a constitutional foreign policy responsibility every bit \nas fundamental as the President's. Part of that responsibility is to \nexpect accountability. The certification process is a key element in \nthat with respect to drugs.\n  To seek to retreat from the responsibility because an administration \ndoes not like to be accountable is hardly sufficient ground for a \nchange. To do so because another country does not like explaining how \nit is doing in cooperating to deal with a serious threat to U.S. \nnational interests is equally unacceptable. To argue that we should \ncease judging others because we have yet to do enough at home is a \nlogic that borders on the absurd. To believe that claims of sovereignty \nby some country trumps external judgment on its behavior is to argue \nfor a dangerous standard in international law. To argue that we should \nbury our independent judgment on this matter of national interest in \nsome vague multilateralized process is a confidence trick.\n  Try putting this argument into a different context. Imagine for a \nmoment making these arguments with respect to terrorism. Think about \nthe consequences of ignoring violations of human rights because a \ncountry claims it is unfair to meddle in internal matters.\n  When it comes to drugs, however, some seem prepared to carve out an \nexception. It offends Mexico, so let's not hold them accountable. The \nadministration will not be honest, so let's stop making the judgment.\n  The administration, we are informed, does not want to offend an \nimportant ally. Really? Well, it seems the administration likes to pick \nand choose. At the moment, the administration is considering and \nthreatening sanctions against the whole European Union--that is some of \nour oldest allies. And over what issue? Bananas. To my knowledge, not a \nsingle banana has killed an American. However serious the trade issue \nis that is involved, major international criminal gangs are not \ntargeting Americans with banana peels. They are not smuggling tons of \nbananas into this country illegally. They are not corrupting whole \ngovernments.\n  So, what we are being asked to accept is that sanctions are an \nimportant national interest when it comes to bananas but not for drugs. \nThat it is okay to judge allies on cooperation on tropical fruit but \nnot on dangerous drugs. This strikes me as odd. Do not get me wrong. I \nam not against bananas. I believe there are serious trade issues \ninvolved in this dispute over bananas. What strikes me as odd is that \nthe administration is prepared to deploy serious actions against allies \nover this issue but finds it unacceptable to defend U.S. interests when \nit comes to drugs with similar dedication and seriousness.\n  But let me come back to Mexico and certification. I have two \nobservations. The first concerns the requirements for certification. I \nrefer again to the law. That is a good place to start. The requirement \nin the law is to determine whether a country is fully cooperating. It \nis not to judge whether a country is fully successful.\n  Frankly, that is an impossible standard to meet. One that we would \nfail. I agree, that deciding what full cooperation looks like is a \nmatter of judgment. But to those who argue that certification limits \nthe President's flexibility, on the contrary, it gives scope to just \nthat in reaching such a decision. It is a judgment call. Sometimes a \nvery vexed judgment.\n  Nevertheless, one can meet a standard of cooperation that is not \nbringing success. In such a case, an over-reliance upon purely material \nstandards of evaluation cannot be our only guide. How many \nextraditions, how many new laws, how many arrests, how many drugs \nseized are not our only measures for judgment. There are others. And in \nthe case of Mexico there is a major question that must be part of our \nthinking.\n  Unless the United States can and is prepared unilaterally to stop \ndrug production and trafficking in Mexico, then we have two choices. To \nseek some level of cooperation with legitimate authority in Mexico to \ngive us some chance of addressing the problem. Or, to decide no \ncooperation is possible and to seal the border. The latter course, \nwould involve an immense undertaking and is uncertain of success. It \nwould also mean abandoning Mexico at a time of crisis to the very \ncriminal gangs that threaten both countries. In my view, we cannot \ndecertify Mexico until we can honestly and dispassionately answer this \nquestion: Is what we are getting in the way of cooperation from Mexico \nso unacceptable on this single issue that our only option is to tear up \nour rich and varied bilateral relationship altogether?\n  However frustrating our level of cooperation may be, I continue to \nthink that we have not reached the point of hopelessness. And there are \nencouraging signs along with the disappointments. Having said this, I \ndo not believe that we can or should forego judgment on the continuing \nnature of cooperation. With Mexico or with any country. To those who \nwould change the certification process I would say, let's give the \nprocess a chance not a change. Let's actually apply it. This does not \nmean in some rote way. But wisely. With understanding. With due regard \nto both the nuance of particular situations and a sense of \nresponsibility.\n\n[[Page S2934]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2932-4", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2932-S2934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CERTIFIED NONSENSE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe availability of medical savings accounts, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT EXPANSION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe Medical Savings Account Expansion Act of 1999. There has been much \nsaid recently regarding the need to reform health care. I agree with \nmany of my colleagues that health care is indeed in need of serious \nreform. However, the nature and the scope of reforms are open to \ndebate.\n  During the health care debate of 1996, the Congress focused its \nefforts on attempting to provide the uninsured with insurance. Included \nin the legislation, Congress created a demonstration project in order \nto test the effectiveness of Medical Savings Accounts. However, in \nestablishing the demonstration project, the Congress created numerous \nlegislative roadblocks to the success of Medical Savings Accounts.\n  As we are all aware, Medical Savings Accounts combine a high \ndeductible insurance policy and tax exempt accounts for the purpose of \nproviding health care. MSA holders use these accounts to purchase \nroutine health care services. When account holders spend all of the \nfunds in their account and reach their annual deductible, their health \ninsurance policy kicks in. If they don't spend all the money in the \naccount, they get to keep what's left, plus interest for the following \nyear.\n  The creation of Medical Savings Accounts was the result of a \nbipartisan coalition that many in the Senate worked long and hard to \nachieve. Medical Savings Accounts are really based on a simple \nprinciple that should be at the heart of the health care reform, that \nbeing, empowering people to take control of their own health care \nimproves the system for everyone. Expanding MSAs is one small, but \nimportant, step in that regard. Providing individuals with an incentive \nto save money on their health care costs encourages them to be better \nconsumers. The result is much needed cost control and consumer \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, I think as the Congress begins to discuss health care \nreform this year, we must move away from the debate on the regulation \nand rationing of health care and focus our energies on providing health \ncare to the uninsured. Instead of concentrating our efforts on reforms \nthat will likely result in less health care, we should be trying to \nexpand the opportunity for health care. At the same time, we must do so \nin a cost effective and market oriented way. MSAs meet that goal.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, more than 37% of the \npeople who have opted to buy an MSA under the 1996 law were previously \nuninsured. That bears repeating; people who have previously been \nuninsured, are now buying health insurance. We need to make it possible \nfor more people to obtain health care insurance. Now, compare those 37% \nof previously uninsured who now have health insurance with the \nprojected 400,000 people who would lose their current health insurance \nif the Congress does something that would raise current health \ninsurance premiums by just one percentage point and the argument \nbecomes even stronger to expand the use of MSAs.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today does just that, \nit makes Medical Savings Accounts more readily available to more people \nby eliminating many of the legislative and regulatory roadblocks to \ntheir continued success. The GAO report referred to earlier, points out \nthat one of the key reasons why MSAs have not been as successful as \noriginally thought is the complexity of the law.\n\n  Let me touch on a just few of the problems my legislation addresses. \nFirst is the scope of the demonstration project. Mr. President, I \nbelieve we should drop the 750,000 cap and extend the life of the \nproject indefinitely. The 750,000 cap is merely an arbitrary number \nnegotiated by the Congress. By lifting the cap and making MSAs \npermanent, we will be allowing the market to decide whether MSAs are a \nviable alternative in health insurance. The cap\n\n[[Page S2936]]\n\nand the limited time constraint create a disincentive for insurance \ncompanies to provide MSAs as an option. The GAO study I cited earlier \nsupports this conclusion. The majority of companies who offered MSA \nplans did so in order to preserve a share of the market. The result, \nfew, if any, are aggressively marketing MSAs. If Congress is serious \nabout testing the effectiveness of MSAs in the marketplace, we must \nfree them from unnecessary and arbitrarily imposed restraints.\n  Second, under current law, either an employer or an employee can \ncontribute directly to an MSA, but not both. The legislation I am \nintroducing would allow both employers and employees to contribute to a \nMedical Savings Account. This just makes sense. By limiting who can \ncontribute to an individual MSA, the government has predetermined the \nlimits of contributions. I think many employers would prefer to \ncontribute to an individual's health care account, rather than continue \nthe costly, third-party payer system. By allowing both employers and \nemployees to contribute to MSAs, we will be giving more flexibility to \nMedical Savings Accounts. That flexibility will allow more people to \nobtain MSAs and undoubtedly contribute to their success.\n  One of the arguments frequently made against MSAs is that they are \nfor the rich. Certainly that is an understandable conclusion, given the \nfact that we limit who can contribute to MSAs. By lifting the \ncontribution restrictions, individuals of all income levels will find \nMSAs a viable health care alternative.\n  As I travel throughout Oklahoma, a common complaint is the access to \nquality health care and the rising cost of health care. In my state, \nmanaged care is not always an option for many people in rural areas. \nHowever, Medical Savings Accounts are an option for many families \nbecause MSAs give them the choice to pursue individualized health care \nthat fits their needs. These are the sorts of solutions that our \nconstituents have sent us to Washington to find. They are not \ninterested in more government. In fact, many want less. Yet, all we \noffer them is differing degrees of government intrusion in their lives.\n  Mr. President, the debate in the 105th Congress clearly demonstrated \nwe are all concerned about access to health care, doctor choice, cost, \nand security. As the debate moves forward in the 106th Congress, I want \nto urge my colleagues to consider alternatives to further big-\ngovernment and to be bold enough to pursue them.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 657\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the United States \nCustoms Service for fiscal years 2000 and 2001; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                       protection of u.s. borders\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Hutchison, Bingaman, \nDomenici, Kyl, McCain, Boxer, Feinstein, and Gorton, I am introducing \nlegislation today which will authorize the United States Customs \nService to acquire the necessary personnel and technology to reduce \ndelays at our border crossings with Mexico and Canada to no more than \n20 minutes, while strengthening our commitment to interdict illegal \nnarcotics and other contraband.\n  This bill represents the progress that we made in this regard in the \nlast Congress, and it builds on efforts that we initiated last year. \nThis legislation passed the Senate unanimously on October 8, 1998, and \na similar companion bill passed the House of Representatives on May 19, \n1998 by a vote of 320-86. In addition to the resources dedicated to our \nnation's land borders, this bill also incorporates the efforts of \nSenators Grassley and Graham in adding resources for interdiction \nefforts in the air and along our coastline, provisions that were passed \nby the Senate in last year's bill.\n  I am very concerned about the impact of narcotics trafficking on \nTexas and the nation and have worked closely with federal and state law \nenforcement officials to identify and secure the necessary resources to \nbattle the onslaught of illegal drugs. At the same time, however, our \ncurrent enforcement strategy is burdened by insufficient staffing, a \ngross underuse of vital interdiction technology, and is effectively \nclosing the door to legitimate trade.\n  At a time when NAFTA and the expanding world marketplace are making \nit possible for us to create more commerce, freedom and opportunity for \npeople on both sides of the border, it is important that we eliminate \nthe border crossing delays that are stifling these goals. In order for \nall Americans to fully enjoy the benefits of growing trade with Mexico \nand Canada, we must ensure that the Customs Service has the resources \nnecessary to accomplish its mission. Customs inspections should not be \nobstacles to legitimate trade and commerce. Customs staffing needs to \nbe increased significantly to facilitate the flow of substantially \nincreased traffic on both the Southwestern and Northern borders, and \nthese additional personnel need the modern technology that will allow \nthem to inspect more cargo, more efficiently. The practical effect of \nthese increases will be to open all the existing primary inspection \nlanes where congestion is a problem during peak hours and to enhance \ninvestigative capabilities on the Southwest border.\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\n  Long traffic lines at our international crossings are \ncounterproductive to improving our trade relationship with Mexico and \nCanada. This bill is designed to shorten those lines and promote \nlegitimate commerce, while providing the Customs Service with the means \nnecessary to tackle the drug trafficking operations that are now \nrampant along the 1,200-mile border that my State shares with Mexico.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require \npension plans to provide adequate notice to individuals whose future \nbenefit accruals are being significantly reduced, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the pension right to know act of 1999\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide greater disclosure to employees about the impact on their \nretirement benefits of pension plan conversions.\n  Recent media accounts have reported that many large companies in \nAmerica are converting their traditional defined benefit pension plans \nto something called ``cash balance plans.'' A cash balance plan is a \nhybrid arrangement combining certain features of ``defined \ncontribution'' and ``defined benefit'' plans. Like defined contribution \nplans, they provide each employee with an account in which his or her \nbenefits accrue. But cash balance plans are actually defined benefit \nplans, and therefore provide a benefit for life which is insured by the \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.\n  Cash balance plans, however, differ from other defined benefit plans \nin the calculation of benefits. Whereas the value of an employee's \nretirement benefit in a traditional defined benefit plan grows slowly \nin the early years and more rapidly as one approaches retirement, cash \nbalance plans decrease this later-year growth and increase the early-\nyear growth. Consequently, younger employees tend to do better under \ncash balance plans than under traditional plans, while older employees \ntypically do worse. In some cases, upon conversion to a cash balance \naccount an older worker's account balance may remain static for years--\ntypically referred to as the ``wear away'' period.\n  It appears that very few workers who have experienced the conversion \nof their company retirement plan to a cash balance arrangement \nunderstand the differences between the old and new plans. Those who do \noften complain that the new plans treat older workers unfairly. One 49-\nyear-old engineer profiled by the Wall Street Journal--a rare employee \nwho knows how to calculate pension benefits--determined that his \npension value dropped by $56,000 the day his company converted to a \ncash balance plan.\n  Even more disturbing are complaints from some employees that their \nemployers obscured the adverse effects of plan amendments. When an \nemployer changes the pension plan, the employees have a right to know \nthe consequences. There should be no surprises when it is time to \nretire. Unfortunately, current law requires little in the way of \ndisclosure when a company changes its pension plan. Section 204(h) of \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) requires employers \nto inform employees of a change to a pension plan resulting in a \nreduction in future benefit accruals. But that is all. It does not \nrequire specifics. The 204(h) disclosure can be, and often is, \nsatisfied with a brief statement buried deep in a company communication \nto employees. It is imperative that we increase these disclosure \nrequirements regarding reductions in pension benefits.\n  The bill I am introducing today would require employers with 1,000 or \nmore employees to provide a ``statement of benefit change'' when \nadopting plan amendments which significantly reduce benefits. The \nstatement of benefit change would provide a comparison, under the old \nand new versions of the plan, of the following benefit measures; the \nemployee's accrued benefit and present value of accrued benefit at the \ntime of conversion; and the projected accrued benefit and projected \npresent value of accrued benefit three years, five years, and ten years \nafter conversion and at normal retirement age.\n  These benefit measures are standard concepts which will be well \nunderstood by pension administrators, actuaries and others who work \nwith pensions. They will give the employee a clear picture of the \ndifference between the old and new plans immediately, periodically over \na ten-year period, and at retirement. The purpose of the three, five \nand ten-year comparisons is to disclose any ``wear away'' period, in \nwhich an employee would work without gaining any new benefits. Using \nthese comparisons, employees can get a clear picture of the relative \nmerits of the two plans.\n\n  In preparing this bill, my staff has consulted a number of actuaries \nand pension attorneys. I believe it is a good approach to resolving the \nproblems I have discussed, and I am happy to work with others to \nincorporate suggestions to further improve the bill.\n  Of course, many call this measure as intrusive or unnecessary. Some \nemployer groups have criticized the idea of requiring individualized \nbenefits calculations for every employee, saying that this requires \nreviewing each employee's salary history. But that seems a strange \ncomplaint given that we are talking about cash balance plans, which \nalready require highly individualized calculations. If an employer can \nprovide personalized account balances under a cash balance arrangement, \nthen the employer can provide such information for the old plan.\n  Moreover, recently completed regulations appear already to \ncontemplate individualized comparisons. Regulation 1.411(d)-6, just \nfinalized by the Internal Revenue Service, requires that in order\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\nto determine if a reduction in future benefit accrual is \n``significant,'' employers must compare the annual benefit at \nretirement age under the amended plan with the same benefit under the \nplan prior to amendment. Therefore, the concept of benefit comparisons \nis not a new one.\n  And indeed, some companies are proving by their actions that benefit \ncomparisons are not unduly burdensome. Kodak, the prominent employer \nheadquartered in Rochester, New York, recently announced that it will \nconvert to a cash balance plan, and that it will give its 35,000 \nparticipants in the company-sponsored pension plan the choice between \nthe old plan and the new. To help employees make an informed decision, \nKodak will provide every plan participant with an individualized \ncomparison of his or her benefits under the old and new versions of the \nplan. The company is also providing computer software that will allow \nemployees to make the comparisons themselves. That is the difference \nbetween corporate behavior that is responsible and corporate behavior \nthat is unscrupulous. As usual, Kodak sets a fine example.\n  I believe that such disclosure not only is in the best interest of \nemployees, but also of the employer. Several class action lawsuits have \nbeen filed in the last three years challenging conversions to cash \nbalance plans. These suits will likely cost hundreds of thousands, if \nnot millions, of dollars in attorneys' fees. But with proper \ndisclosure, they might not have occurred.\n  In closing, let me be clear about one thing. I take no position on \nthe underlying merit of cash balance plans. Ours is a voluntary pension \nsystem, and companies must do what is right for them and their \nemployees. But I feel strongly that companies must fully and \ncomprehensibly inform their employees regarding whatever pension \nbenefits the company offers. Companies have no right to misrepresent \nthe projected benefit employees will receive under a cash balance plan \nor any other pension arrangement.\n  It is time to let the sun shine on pension plan conversions. I urge \nthe Senate to support this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 659\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medical \nNutrition Therapy Act of 1999 on behalf of myself, my friend and \ncolleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, and a bipartisan group of \nadditional Senators.\n  This bipartisan measure provides for coverage under Part B of the \nMedicare program for medical nutrition therapy services by a registered \ndietician. Medical nutrition therapy is generally defined as the \nassessment of patient nutritional status followed by therapy, ranging \nfrom diet modification to administration of specialized nutrition \ntherapies such as intravenous or tube feedings. It has proven to be a \nmedically necessary and cost-effective way of treating and controlling \nmany disease entities such as diabetes, renal disease, cardiovascular \ndisease and severe burns.\n  Currently there is no consistent Part B coverage policy for medical \nnutrition and this legislation will bring needed uniformity to the \ndelivery of this important care, as well as save taxpayer money. \nCoverage for medical nutrition therapy can save money by reducing \nhospital admissions, shortening hospital stays, decreasing the number \nof complications, and reducing the need for physician follow-up visits.\n  The treatment of patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease \naccounts for a full 60% of Medicare expenditures. I want to use \ndiabetes as an example for the need for this legislation. There are \nvery few families who are not touched by diabetes. The burden of \ndiabetes is disproportionately high among ethnic minorities in the \nUnited States. According to the American Journal of Epidemiology, \nmortality due to diabetes is higher nationwide among blacks than \nwhites. It is higher among American Indians than among any other ethnic \ngroup.\n  In my state of New Mexico, Native Americans are experiencing an \nepidemic of Type II diabetes. Medical nutrition therapy is integral to \ntheir diabetes care. In fact, information from the Indian Health \nService shows that medical nutrition therapy provided by professional \ndieticians results in significant improvements in medical outcomes in \npeople with Type II diabetes. For example, complications of diabetes \nsuch as end stage renal failure that leads to dialysis can be prevented \nwith adequate intervention. Currently, the number of dialysis patients \nin the Navajo population is doubling every five years. Mr, President, \nwe must place our dollars in the effective, preventive treatment of \nmedical nutrition therapy rather than face the grim reality of having \nto continue to build new dialysis units.\n  Ensuring the solvency of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund is one of our \nmost difficult challenges and one that calls for creative, effective \nsolutions. Coverage for medical nutrition therapy is one important way \nto help address that challenge. It is exactly the type of cost \neffective care we should encourage. It will satisfy two of our most \nimportant priorities in Medicare: providing program savings while \nmaintaining a high level of quality care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 660\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare \n     Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1999''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Medical nutrition therapy is a medically necessary and \n     cost-effective way of treating and controlling many diseases \n     and medical conditions affecting the elderly, including HIV, \n     AIDS, cancer, kidney disease, diabetes, heart disease, \n     pressure ulcers, severe burns, and surgical wounds.\n       (2) Medical nutrition therapy saves health care costs by \n     speeding recovery and reducing the incidence of \n     complications, resulting in fewer hospitalizations, shorter \n     hospital stays, and reduced drug, surgery, and treatment \n     needs.\n       (3) A study conducted by The Lewin Group shows that, after \n     the third year of coverage, savings would be greater than \n     costs for coverage of medical nutrition therapy for all \n     medicare beneficiaries, with savings projected to grow \n     steadily in following years.\n       (4) The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research has \n     indicated in its practice guidelines that nutrition is key to \n     both the prevention and the treatment of pressure ulcers \n     (also called bed sores) which annually cost the health care \n     system an estimated $1,300,000,000 for treatment.\n       (5) Almost 17,000,000 patients each year are treated for \n     illnesses or injuries that stem from or place them at risk of \n     malnutrition.\n       (6) Because medical nutrition therapy is not covered under \n     part B of the medicare program and because more and more \n     health care is delivered on an outpatient basis, many \n     patients are denied access to the effective, low-tech \n     treatment they need, resulting in an increased incidence of \n     complications and a need for higher cost treatments.\n\n     SEC. 2. MEDICARE COVERAGE OF MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY \n                   SERVICES.\n\n       (a) Coverage.--Section 1861(s)(2) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(s)(2)) is amended--\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (S);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (T) \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(U) medical nutrition therapy services (as defined in \n     subsection (uu)(1));''.\n       (b) Services Described.--Section 1861 of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395x) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subsection:\n\n``Medical Nutrition Therapy Services; Registered Dietitian or Nutrition \n                              Professional\n\n       ``(uu)(1) The term `medical nutrition therapy services' \n     means nutritional diagnostic, therapy, and counseling \n     services for the purpose of disease management which are \n     furnished by a registered dietitian or nutrition professional \n     (as defined in paragraph (2)) pursuant to a referral by a \n     physician (as defined in subsection (r)(1)).\n       ``(2) Subject to paragraph (3), the term `registered \n     dietitian or nutrition professional' means an individual \n     who--\n       ``(A) holds a baccalaureate or higher degree granted by a \n     regionally accredited college or university in the United \n     States (or an equivalent foreign degree) with completion of \n     the academic requirements of a program in nutrition or \n     dietetics, as accredited by an appropriate national \n     accreditation organization recognized by the Secretary for \n     this purpose;\n       ``(B) has completed at least 900 hours of supervised \n     dietetics practice under the supervision of a registered \n     dietitian or nutrition professional; and\n       ``(C)(i) is licensed or certified as a dietitian or \n     nutrition professional by the State in which the services are \n     performed, or\n       ``(ii) in the case of an individual in a State that does \n     not provide for such licensure or certification, meets such \n     other criteria as the Secretary establishes.\n       ``(3) Subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) shall not \n     apply in the case of an individual who, as of the date of \n     enactment of this subsection, is licensed or certified as a \n     dietitian or nutrition professional by the State in which \n     medical nutrition therapy services are performed.''.\n       (c) Payment.--Section 1833(a)(1) of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395l(a)(1)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' before ``(S)'', and\n       (2) by inserting before the semicolon at the end the \n     following: ``, and (T) with respect to medical nutrition \n     therapy services (as defined in section 1861(uu)), the amount \n     paid shall be 80 percent of the lesser of the actual charge \n     for the services or the amount determined under the fee \n     schedule established under section 1848(b) for the same \n     services if furnished by a physician''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     apply to services furnished on or after January 1, 2000.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today Senator Bingaman and I join to \nintroduce a very important piece of legislation, the Medical Nutrition \nTherapy Act. I'm pleased to have the support of a number of Senators in \nintroducing this legislation: Senators Mack, Thurmond, Mikulski, Snowe, \nDaschle, Collins, Johnson, Crapo, Dorgan, Hollings, Reed, and Conrad. \nThis bill simply expands Medicare Part B coverage to give seniors \naccess to medical nutrition therapy services by registered dietitians \nand other nutrition professionals. Currently there is no direct \ncoverage for services provided by registered dietitians, and, because \nthey are uniquely qualified to provide medical nutrition therapy, \nbeneficiaries are essentially denied access to this cost effective and \nefficacious form of care.\n  Nutrition is one of the most basic elements of life. From the moment \nwe are born to the moment we die, nutrition plays a critical role. It \ninfluences how we grow, how our brain develops, how we feel, and how \nour bodies prevent and fight disease. For decades we have known that \nnutrition can influence the most serious life threatening diseases, \nsuch as cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and high blood \ncholesterol.\n  Experts have proven that proper nutrition may not only help prevent \ndisease, but also is central to controlling and treating disease.\n  Medical nutrition therapy plays a major role in treating some of the \nmost threatening illnesses. It significantly improves the quality of \nlife of seriously ill patients. It also saves health care costs by \nspeeding recovery and reducing the incidence of complications, \nresulting in fewer hospitalizations, shorter hospital stays, and \nreduced drug, surgery, and treatment needs.\n  Because medical nutrition therapy is not currently covered by \nMedicare Part B and because more and more health care is delivered on \nan outpatient basis, many patients are denied access to the effective, \nlow-tech treatment they need, resulting in an increased incidence of \ncomplications and a need for higher cost treatments.\n  Medical nutritional therapy is an integral part of cost effective \nhealth care.\n  Our legislation would remedy this defect in Medicare Part B, \nimproving health care and lowering costs. I invite all our colleagues \nto join Senator Bingaman and myself in working for this important \nreform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Lott, Mr. Sessions, \n        Mr. Nickles, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Craig, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        McCain, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Inhofe, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Helms, Mr. Grassley, \n        and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 661. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ntaking minors across State lines in circumvention of laws requiring the \ninvolvement of parents in abortion decisions; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                      CHILD CUSTODY PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I along with 19 of my colleagues \nwill be re-introducing the Child Custody Protection Act. This \nlegislation will make it a federal offense to transport a minor across \nstate lines to obtain an abortion if this action circumvents a state \nparental involvement law.\n  Last year, this bill received a majority of votes but fell short of \nthe sixty votes needed for cloture. It is my hope that this year the \nSenate will listen to the 74 percent of Americans who favor parental \nconsent prior to a minor girl receiving an abortion. This Baseline & \nAssociates poll, conducted last summer, reveals that the American \npublic favors parental consent laws and when asked specifically about \nthis legislation, the American public is even more supportive. Eighty \nfive percent of those who participated in the poll believed that minor \ngirls should not be taken across state lines to obtain an abortion \nwithout their parents' knowledge.\n  These poll numbers reinforce what common sense already tells us: \nparents need to be involved with the major medical and emotional \ndecisions of their children. When they are not involved, the health and \nemotional well being of their child is in jeopardy.\n  Last year, we heard from Joyce Farley, whose 13 year old daughter was \nraped, taken across state lines for a secret abortion by the rapist's \nmother, and dropped off 30 miles from home suffering from complications \nfrom an incomplete abortion. Mrs. Farley told of the trauma to her \ndaughter from this stranger's actions. Luckily, Mrs. Farley found out \nabout the abortion and could obtain appropriate medical care for her \ndaughter. If this abortion had remained secret, Mrs. Farley's \ndaughter's life could have been in danger.\n  Whatever one's position on abortion, every American should recognize \nthe crucial role of parents in their minor child's decision whether or \nnot to undergo this procedure. Parental notification and consent laws \nexist for a reason. While most such laws provide for possible judicial \nbypass, they by nature intend to protect the rights and integrity of \nthe family. More than 20 states have recognized the need to protect \nboth the minor and the integrity of the family and have parental \ninvolvement laws in effect. My legislation adds no new provisions to \nstate-enacted parental involvement laws. It does not impose parental \ninvolvement requirements on states that have not passed such laws. The \nChild Custody Protection Act simply prevents the undermining of \nparental involvement laws in states that have them.\n  I hope my colleagues will support me in working to quickly pass this \ncommon sense legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill and section by section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 661\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Custody Protection \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRANSPORTATION OF MINORS IN CIRCUMVENTION OF CERTAIN \n                   LAWS RELATING TO ABORTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title 18, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting after chapter 117 the following:\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\n ``CHAPTER 117A--TRANSPORTATION OF MINORS IN CIRCUMVENTION OF CERTAIN \n                       LAWS RELATING TO ABORTION\n\n``Sec.\n``2431.

Short title\n       This section states that the short title of this bill is \n     the ``Child Custody Protection Act.''\n     Section 2. Transportation of minors to avoid certain laws \n         relating to abortion\n       Section 2(a) amends title 18 of the United States Code by \n     inserting after chapter 117 a proposed new chapter 117A \n     titled ``Transportation of minors to avoid certain laws \n     relating to abortion,'' within which would be included a new \n     section 2431 on this subject.\n       Subsection (a) of proposed section 2431 outlaws the knowing \n     transportation across a State line of a person under 18 years \n     of age with the intent that she obtain an abortion, in \n     abridgement of a parent's right of involvement according to \n     State law. This subsection requires only knowledge by the \n     defendant that he or she was transporting the person across \n     State lines with the intent that she obtain an abortion. It \n     does not require that the transporter know the requirement of \n     the home State law, know that they have not been complied \n     with, or indeed know anything about the existence of the \n     State law. By the same token, it does not require that the \n     defendant know that his or her actions violate Federal law, \n     or indeed know anything about the Federal law. A reasonable \n     belief that parental notice or consent, or judicial \n     authorization, has been given, is an affirmative defense \n     whose terms are set out in subsection (c).\n       Subsection (a), paragraph (1), imposes a maximum of 1 year \n     imprisonment or a fine, or both.\n       Subsection (a), paragraph (2), specifies the criteria for a \n     violation of the parental right under this statute as \n     follows: an abortion must be performed on a minor in a State \n     other than the minor's residence and without the parental \n     consent or notification, or the judicial authorization, that \n     would have been required had the abortion been performed in \n     the minor's State or residence.\n       Subsection (b), paragraph (1) specifies that subsection (a) \n     does not apply if the abortion is necessary to save the life \n     of the minor. This subsection is not intended to preempt any \n     other exceptions that a State parental involvement law that \n     meets the definitions set out in subsection (e)(1) and (e)(2) \n     may recognize.\n       Subsection (b), paragraph (2), clarifies that neither the \n     minor being transported nor her parents may be prosecuted or \n     sued for a violation of this bill.\n       Subsection (c) provides an affirmative defense to \n     prosecution or civil action based on violation of the act \n     where the defendant reasonably believed, based on information \n     obtained directly from the girl's parent or other compelling \n     factors, that the requirements of the girl's State of \n     residence regarding parental involvement or judicial \n     authorization in abortions had been satisfied. A minor's own \n     assertion to a defendant that her parents knew or had \n     consented would not, by itself, constitute sufficient basis \n     to make out this affirmative defense.\n       Subsection (d) establishes a civil cause of action for a \n     parent who suffers legal harm from a violation of subsection \n     (a).\n       Subsection (e) sets forth definitions of certain terms in \n     this bill.\n       Subsection (e)(1)(A) defines ``a law requiring parental \n     involvement in a minor's abortion decision'' to be a law \n     requiring either ``the notification to, or consent of, a \n     parent of that minor or proceedings in a State court.''\n       Subsection (e)(1)(B) stipulates that a law conforming to \n     the definition in (e)(1)(A) cannot provide notification to or \n     consent of any person or entity other than a ``parent'' as \n     defined in the subsequent section.\n       Subsection (e)(2) defines ``parent'' to mean a parent or \n     guardian, or a legal custodian, or a person standing in loco \n     parentis (if that person has ``care and control'' of the \n     minor and is a person with whom the minor ``regularly \n     resides'') and who is designated by the applicable State \n     parental involvement law as the person to whom notification, \n     or from whom consent, is required. In this context, a person \n     in loco parentis has the meaning it has at common law: a \n     person who effectively functions as a child's guardian, but \n     without the legal formalities of guardianship having been \n     met. It would not include individuals who are not truly \n     exercising the responsibilities of parents, such as an adult \n     boyfriend with whom the minor may be living.\n       Subsection (e)(3) defines ``minor'' to mean a person not \n     older than the maximum age requiring parental notification or \n     consent, or proceedings in a State court, under the parental \n     involvement law of the State, where the minor resides.\n       Subsection (E)(4) defines ``State'' to include the District \n     of Columbia ``and any commonwealth, possession, or other \n     territory of the United States.''\n       Section 2(b) is a clerical amendment to insert the new \n     chapter in the table of chapters for part I of title 18.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Moynihan, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \n        Hollings, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Robb, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 662. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide medical assistance for certain women screened and found to have \nbreast or cervical cancer under a federally funded screening program; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          the breast and cervical cancer treatment act of 1999\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation that will provide life-saving treatment to women who have \nbeen diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer. I am very proud of this \nlegislation and want to thank everyone who worked so hard to put this \nbill together.\n  I want to take just a few minutes to explain what this legislation \ndoes. In\n\n[[Page S2944]]\n\n1990 Congress created a program, run by the Centers for Disease \nControl, to provide breast and cervical cancer screening for low-\nincome, uninsured women. This program is run in all 50 states and is \ntremendously successful. The CDC screens more than 500,000 women ever \nyear, detecting more than 3,000 cases of breast cancer and 350 cases of \ncervical cancer.\n  The problem comes about when these women try to get treatment for the \ncancer. They are uninsured, and are not eligible for either Medicaid or \nMedicare. They must rely on volunteers and charitable providers to find \ntreatment services. Treatment for many is delayed, and many do not \nreceive the crucial follow-up care. Some never receive treatment and \nothers are left with huge medical bills they cannot pay.\n  The legislation we are introducing today provides a simple solution \nto this problem. It gives states the option to provide those women, \nmany of whom are mothers of young children, who are diagnosed with \nbreast or cervical cancer under the CDC's screening program to obtain \ntreatment through the medicaid program. The coverage would continue \nuntil the treatment and follow-up visits are completed.\n  This is a modest, low-cost solution to a life or death problem.

Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished \ncolleagues Senators Chafee, Moynihan, Snowe, and to introduce \nlegislation providing breast and cervical cancer treatment services to \nwomen who were diagnosed\n\n[[Page S2945]]\n\nwith these cancers through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer \nEarly Detection Program (NBCCEDP). This bill would give states the \noption to provide Medicaid coverage for the duration of breast and \ncervical cancer treatment to eligible women who were screened through \nthe CDC program and found to have these cancers. This is a bill whose \ntime has come.\n  In 1990, I was proud to be the chief Senate sponsor of the Breast and \nCervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act which created the National \nBreast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) at the \nCDC. The time was right for us to create that program. Since its \ninception, the CDC screening program has provided more than 721,000 \nmammograms and 851,000 Pap tests to more than 1.2 million women. Among \nthe women screened, over 3,600 cases of breast cancer and over 400 \ncases of invasive cervical cancer have been diagnosed since the \nbeginning of the program. In Maryland alone, the state had provided \nmore than 54,000 mammograms and 35,000 Pap tests, and diagnosed over \n450 women with breast cancer and 15 women with invasive cervical \ncancer.\n  Now as we prepare to enter the 21st century, it is time for us to \nfinish what we started and provide treatment services for breast and \ncervical cancer for women who are screened through this program. We \nmade the down payment in 1990 and we've been making payments ever \nsince, but it's time for the final payment. It is time to do the right \nthing. We screen the women in this program for breast and cervical \ncancer. But we don't provide the federal follow-up to ensure that these \nwomen are treated.\n  The CDC screening program does not pay for breast and cervical cancer \ntreatment services, but it does require participating states to provide \ntreatment services. A study of the program done for the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention found that while treatment was \neventually found for almost all of the women screened, some women did \nnot get treated at all, some refused treatment, and some experienced \ndelays. While states and localities have been diligent and creative in \nfinding treatment services for these women, the reality is that the \nsystem is overloaded. The CDC study found that when it came to \ntreatment services, state efforts to obtain these services were short-\nterm, labor-intensive solutions that diverted resources away from \nscreening activities.\n  Of those women diagnosed with cancer in the United States, nearly \n3,000 women have no way to afford treatment--they have no health care \ninsurance coverage or are underinsured. One woman in Massachusetts \nreported that she cashed in her life insurance policy to cover the \ncosts of her treatment. These women depend on the time of staff and \nvolunteers who help them find free or more affordable treatment; they \ndepend on the generosity of doctors, nurses, hospitals and clinics who \nprovide them with free or reduced-cost treatment. In the end, thousands \nof women who run local screening programs are spending countless hours \nfinding treatment services for women diagnosed with breast cancer. I \nsalute the efforts of these individuals who spend their time and \nresources to help these women.\n  But we must not force these women to rely on the goodwill of others. \nThese treatment efforts will become even more difficult as more women \nare screened by the NBCCEDP, which currently services only 12-15% of \nall women who are eligible nationally. The lack of coverage for \ndiagnostic and treatment services has also had a very negative impact \non the program's ability to recruit providers, further restricting the \nnumber of women screened. The CDC study also shows there are already \nadditional stresses on the program as increasing numbers of physicians \ndo not have the autonomy in today's ever increasing managed care system \nto offer free or reduced-fee services. While CDC has expanded its case \nmanagement services to help more women get treatment, even CDC admits \nthat ``more formalized and sustained mechanisms need to be instituted \nto ensure that all women screened have ready access to appropriate \ntreatment and follow-up.'' It is an outrage that women with cancer must \ngo begging for treatment, especially if the federal government has held \nout the promise of early detection. We should follow through on our \nresponsibility to treat the cancer that these women were diagnosed with \nthrough the CDC program.\n  That's why I've introduced this important legislation with my \ncolleagues. This bill gives states the option to provide Medicaid \ncoverage for the duration of breast and cervical cancer treatment to \neligible women who were screened through the CDC program and found to \nhave these cancers. This is not a mandate for states; it is the federal \ngovernment saying to the states ``we will help you provide treatment \nservices to these women, if you decide to do so.'' By choosing this \noption, states would in effect, extend the federal-state partnership \nthat exists for the screening services in the CDC program to treatment \nservices.\n  I'm proud that my own state of Maryland realized the importance of \nproviding treatment services to women who were screened through the CDC \nscreening program. Maryland appropriated over $6 million in state funds \nto establish a Breast and Cervical Cancer Diagnostic and Treatment \nProgram for uninsured, low income women. The breast cancer mortality \nrate in Maryland has started to decline, in part because of programs \nlike the CDC program. But not all states have the resources to do what \nMaryland has done. That's why this bill is needed. It provides a long-\nterm solution. Screening alone does not prevent cancer deaths; but \ntreatment can. It's a cruel and heart-breaking irony for the federal \ngovernment to promise to screen low-income women for breast and \ncervical cancer, but not to establish a program to treat those women \nwho have been diagnosed with cancer through a federal program.\n  It is clear that the short-term, ad-hoc strategies of providing \ntreatment have broken down: for the women who are screened; for the \nlocal programs that fund the screening program; and for the states that \nface increasing burdens. Because there is not coverage for treatment, \nstate programs are having a hard time recruiting providers, volunteers \nare spending a disproportionate amount of time finding treatment for \nwomen, and fewer women are receiving treatment. We can't grow the \nprogram to serve the other 78% of eligible women if we can't promise \ntreatment to those we already screen.\n  This bill is the best long-term solution. It is strongly supported by \nthe National Breast Cancer Coalition representing over 400 \norganizations and 100,000's of women across the nation; the American \nCancer Society, the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health \nSystems, the National Partnership for Women and Families, YWCA, \nNational Women's Health Network, Oncology Nursing Society, Association \nof Women's Health, Obstetric, and Neonatal Nurses, the Rhode Island \nBreast Cancer Coalition, Y-ME, and Arm in Arm. I urge my colleagues to \ncosponsor and support this critical piece of legislation and make good \non the promise of early detection.\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today, I join with my colleagues \nSenators Chafee, Mikulski, and Snowe in introducing legislation to \nensure that women with breast or cervical cancer will receive coverage \nfor their treatment. The Federal Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC) has a successful nationwide program--National Breast \nand Cervical Cancer Early Detection program--that provides funding for \nstates to screen low-income uninsured women for breast and cervical \ncancer. However, the CDC program is not designed and does not have \nfunding to treat these women after they are diagnosed.\n  The women eligible for cancer screening under the CDC program are \nlow-income individuals, yet are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid \ncoverage. They do not have health insurance coverage for these \nscreenings and for subsequent cancer treatment.\n  From July of 1991 to September of 1997, the CDC program provided \nmammography screening to 722,000 women and diagnosed 3,600 cases of \nbreast cancer. During this same period, the program also provided over \n852,000 pap smears and found more than 400 cases of invasive cervical \ncancer.\n  The CDC screening program has had to divert a significant amount of \nits resources from screenings in order to find treatment for the women \nfound to have\n\n[[Page S2946]]\n\nbreast and cervical cancer. The lack of subsequent funding for \ntreatment has, therefore, jeopardized the programs' primary function: \nto screen low-income uninsured women for breast and cervical cancer. \nCurrently, the program screens only about 12 to 15 percent of all \neligible women.\n  A study conducted at Battelle Centers for Public Health Research and \nEvaluation and the University of Michigan School of Public Health on \ntreatment funding for women screened by the CDC program found that, \nalthough funding for treatment services were found for most of these \nwomen, treatment was not always available when needed. In addition, \nduring the search for treatment funding, the CDC program lost contact \nwith several women. The study also found that the sources of treatment \nfunding are uncertain, tenuous and fragmented. The burden of funding \ntreatment often fell upon providers themselves. Seeking charity care \nfrom public hospitals adds to hospitals' uncompensated care costs. It \nis no surprise that the National Association of Public Hospitals \nsupports our bill to provide coverage for these women.\n  The legislation would allow states to provide treatment coverage for \nlow-income women who are screened and diagnosed through the CDC program \nand who are uninsured. States will have the option to provide this \ncoverage through its Medicaid program. States choosing this option \nwould receive an enhanced match for the treatment coverage, similar to \nthe federal match provided to the state for the CDC screening program. \nWith this legislation, the Federal Government will follow through on \nits intent to assist low-income women with breast and cervical cancer.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has approved this proposal in the past. A \nsimilar provision was included in the Senate version of the Balanced \nBudget bill. I urge the Senate to again support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 663. A bill to impose certain limitations on the receipt of out-\nof-State municipal solid waste, to authorize State and local controls \nover the flow of municipal solid waste, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n the solid waste interstate transportation and local authority act of \n                                  1999\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to \nintroduce a bill that would allow states to pass laws limiting the \nimport of waste from other states. Addressing the interstate shipment \nof solid waste is a top environmental priority for millions of \nAmericans, millions of Pennsylvanians and for me. As you are aware, \nCongress came very close to enacting legislation to address this issue \nin 1994, and the Senate passed interstate waste and flow control \nlegislation in May, 1995 by an overwhelming 94-6 margin, only to see it \ndie in the House of Representatives. I am confident that with the \nstrong leadership of my colleagues Chairman Chafee and Senator Smith, \nwe can get quick action on a strong waste bill and pressure the House \nto conclude this effort once and for all.\n  As you are aware, the Supreme Court has put us in the position of \nhaving to intervene in the issue of trash shipments. In recent years, \nthe Court has struck down State laws restricting the importation of \nsolid waste from other jurisdictions under the Interstate Commerce \nClause of the U.S. Constitution. The only solution is for Congress to \nenact legislation conferring such authority on the States, which would \nthen be Constitutional.\n  It is time that the largest trash exporting States bite the bullet \nand take substantial steps towards self-sufficiency for waste disposal. \nThe legislation passed by the Senate in the 103rd and 104th Congresses \nwould have provided much-needed relief to Pennsylvania, which is by far \nthe largest importer of out-of-State waste in the nation. According to \nthe Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, 3.9 million \ntons of out-of-State municipal solid waste entered Pennsylvania in \n1993, rising to 4.3 million tons in 1994, 5.2 million in 1995, and a \nrecord 6.3 million tons from out-of-State in 1996 and 1997, which are \nthe most recent statistics available. Most of this trash came from New \nYork and New Jersey, with New York responsible for 2.7 million tons and \nNew Jersey responsible for 2.4 million tons in 1997, representing 82 \npercent of the municipal solid waste imported into Pennsylvania.\n  This is not a problem limited to one small corner of my State. \nMillions of tons of trash generated in other States find their final \nresting place in more than 50 landfills throughout Pennsylvania.\n  Now, more than ever, we need legislation which will go a long way \ntoward resolving the landfill problems facing Pennsylvania, Indiana, \nand similar waste importing States. I am particularly concerned by the \ndevelopments in New York, where Governor Pataki and Mayor Giuliani have \nannounced the closure of the City's one remaining landfill, Fresh \nKills, in 2001. I am advised that 13,200 tons per day of New York City \ntrash are sent there and that Pennsylvania is a likely destination once \nFresh Kills begins its shut-down.\n  On several occasions, I have met with country officials, \nenvironmental groups, and other Pennsylvanians to discuss the solid \nwaste issue specifically, and it often comes up in the public open \nhouse town meetings I conduct in all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties. I \ncame away from those meetings impressed by the deep concerns expressed \nby the residents of communities which host a landfill rapidly filing up \nwith the refuse of millions of New Yorkers and New Jerseyans whose \nStates have failed to adequately manage the waste they generate.\n  Recognizing the recurrent problem of landfill capacity in \nPennsylvania, since 1989 I have pushed to resolve the interstate waste \ncrisis. I have introduced legislation with my late colleague, Senator \nJohn Heinz, and then with former Senator Dan Coats along with \ncosponsors from both sides of the aisle which would have authorized \nStates to restrict the disposal of out-of-State municipal waste in any \nlandfill or incinerator within its jurisdiction. I was pleased \nwhen many of the concepts in our legislation were incorporated in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee's reported bills in the 103rd \nand 104th Congresses, and I supported these measures during floor \nconsideration.\n\n  During the 103rd Congress, we encountered a new issue with respect to \nmunicipal solid waste--the issue of waste flow control authority. On \nMay 16, 1994, the Supreme Court held (6-3) in Carbone versus Clarkstown \nthat a flow control ordinance, which requires all solid waste to be \nprocessed at a designated waste management facility, violates the \nCommerce Clause of the United States Constitution. In striking down the \nClarkstown ordinance, the Court stated that the ordinance discriminated \nagainst interstate commerce by allowing only the favored operator to \nprocess waste that is within the town's limits. As a result of the \nCourt's decision, flow control ordinances in Pennsylvania and other \nStates are considered unconstitutional.\n  I have met with county commissioners who have made clear that this \nissue is vitally important to the local governments in Pennsylvania and \nmy office has, over the past years received numerous phone calls and \nletters from individual Pennsylvania counties and municipal solid waste \nauthorities that support waste flow control legislation. Since 1988, \nflow control has been the primary tool used by Pennsylvania counties to \nenforce solid waste plans and meet waste reduction and recycling goals \nor mandates. Many Pennsylvania jurisdictions have spent a considerable \namount of public funds on disposal facilities, including upgraded \nsanitary landfills, state-of-the-art resource recovery facilities, and \nco-composting facilities. In the absence of flow control authority, I \nam advised that many of these worthwhile projects could be jeopardized \nand that there has been a fiscal impact on some communities where there \nare debt service obligations.\n  In order to fix these problems, my legislation would provide a \npresumptive ban on all out-of-state municipal solid waste, including \nconstruction and demolition debris, unless a landfill obtains the \nagreement of the local government to allow for the importation of \nwaste. It would provide a freeze authority to allow a State to place a \nlimit on the amount of out-of-state waste received annually at each \nfacility. It would also provide a ratchet authority to allow a State to \ngradually\n\n[[Page S2947]]\n\nreduce the amount of out-of-state municipal waste that may be received \nat facilities. These provisions will provide a concrete incentive for \nthe largest states to get a handle on their solid waste management \nimmediately. To address the problem of flow control my bill would \nprovide authority to allow local governments to designate where \nprivately collected waste must be disposed. This would be a narrow fix \nfor only those localities that constructed facilities before the 1994 \nSupreme Court ruling and who relied on their ability to regulate the \nflow of garbage to pay for their municipal bonds.\n  This is an issue that affects numerous states, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this very important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. \n        Breaux):\n  S. 664. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit against income tax to individuals who rehabilitate historic \nhomes or who are the first purchasers of rehabilitated historic homes \nfor use as a principal residence; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               the historic homeownership assistance act\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, all across America, in the small \ntowns and great cities of this country, our heritage as a nation--the \nphysical evidence of our past--is at risk. In virtually every corner of \nthis land, homes in which grandparents and parents grew up, communities \nand neighborhoods that nurtured vibrant families, schools that were \ngood places to learn and churches and synagogues that were filled on \ndays of prayer, have suffered the ravages of abandonment and decay.\n  In the decade from 1980 to 1990, Chicago lost 41,000 housing units \nthrough abandonment, Philadelphia 10,000 and St. Louis 7,000. The story \nin our older small communities has been the same, and the trend \ncontinues. It is important to understand that it is not just buildings \nthat we are losing. It is the sense of our past, the vitality of our \ncommunities and the shared values of those precious places.\n  We need not stand hopelessly by as passive witnesses to the loss of \nthese irreplaceable historic resources. We can act, and to that end I \nam introducing today the Historic Homeownership Assistance Act along \nwith my distinguished colleagues, Senator Graham of Florida, Senator \nJeffords, and Senator Breaux.\n  This legislation is patterned after the existing Historic \nRehabilitation Investment Tax Credit. That legislation has been \nenormously successful in stimulating private investment in the \nrehabilitation of buildings of historic importance all across the \ncountry. Through its use we have been able to save and re-use a rich \nand diverse array of historic buildings: landmarks such as Union \nStation right here in Washington, DC, the Fox River Mills, a mixed use \nproject that was once a derelict paper mill in Appleton, WI, and the \nRosa True School, an eight-unit low and moderate income rental project \nin an historic school building in Portland, ME.\n  In my own state of Rhode Island, federal tax incentives stimulated \nthe rehabilitation and commercial reuse of more than three hundred \nhistoric properties. The properties saved include the Hotel Manisses on \nBlock Island, the former Valley Falls Mills complex in Central Falls, \nand the Honan Block in Woonsocket.\n  The legislation that I am introducing builds on the familiar \nstructure of the existing tax credit, but with a different focus and \na more modest scope and cost. It is designed to empower the one major \nconstituency that has been barred from using the existing credit--\nhomeowners. Only those persons who rehabilitate or purchase a newly \nrehabilitated home and occupy it as their principal residence would be \nentitled to this new credit. There would be no passive losses, no tax \nshelters and no syndications under this bill.\n\n  Like the existing investment credit, the bill would provide a credit \nto homeowners equal to 20 percent of the qualified rehabilitation \nexpenditures made on an eligible building which is used as a principal \nresidence by the owner. Eligible buildings are those individually \nlisted on the National Register of Historic Places or on a nationally \ncertified state or local historic register, or are contributing \nbuildings in national, state or local historic districts. As is the \ncase with the existing credit, the rehabilitation work would have to be \nperformed in compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards \nfor Rehabilitation, although the bill clarifies that such Standards \nshould be interpreted in a manner that takes into consideration \neconomic and technical feasibility.\n  The bill also allows lower income homebuyers, who may not have \nsufficient federal income tax liability to use a tax credit, to convert \nthe credit to mortgage assistance. The legislation would permit such \npersons to receive an Historic Rehabilitation Mortgage Credit \nCertificate which they can use with their work bank to obtain a lower \ninterest rate on their mortgage or to lower the amount of their \ndownpayment.\n  The credit would be available for condominiums and coops, as well as \nsingle-family buildings. If a building is rehabilitated by a developer \nfor resale, the credit would pass through to the homeowner.\n  One goal of the bill is to provide incentives for middle- and upper-\nincome families to return to older towns and cities. Therefore, the \nbill does not limit the tax benefits on the basis of income. However, \nit does impose a cap of $40,000 on the amount of credit which may be \ntaken for a principal residence.\n  The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will make ownership of a \nrehabilitated older home more affordable for homebuyers of modest \nincomes. It will encourage more affluent families to claim a stake in \nolder towns and neighborhoods. It affords fiscally stressed cities and \ntowns a way to put abandoned buildings back on the tax rolls, while \nstrengthening their income and sales tax bases. It offers developers, \nrealtors, and homebuilders a new realm of economic opportunity in \nrevitalizing decaying buildings.\n\n  In addition to preserving our heritage, extending this credit will \nprovide an important supplemental benefit--it will boost the economy. \nEvery dollar of federal investment in historic rehabilitation leverages \nmany more from the private sector. Rhode Island, for example, has used \nthe credit to leverage $252 million in private investment. This \ninvestment has created more than 10,000 jobs and $187 million in wages.\n  An increasing concern to many mayors, country executives and \ngovernors is the issue of urban sprawl. Wherein new housing is \nconstructed on nearby farmland, older housing stock is abandoned. This \nlegislation encourages the rehabilitation of that housing stock and \nwill help curb urban sprawl.\n  The American dream of owning one's own home is a powerful force. This \nbill can help it come true for those who are prepared to make a \npersonal commitment to join in the rescue of our priceless heritage. By \ntheir actions they can help to revitalize decaying resources of \nhistoric importance, create jobs and stimulate economic development, \nand restore to our older towns and cities a lost sense of purpose and \ncommunity. I ask that a summary of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  The summary follows:\n\n           The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act--Summary\n\n       Purpose. To provide homeownership incentives and \n     opportunities through the rehabilitation of older buildings \n     in historic districts.\n       Rate of Credit. 20% credit for expenditures to rehabilitate \n     or purchase a newly-rehabilitated eligible home and occupy it \n     as a principal residence.\n       Eligible Buildings. Eligible buildings would be buildings \n     individually listed on the National Register of Historic \n     Places or a nationally certified state or local register, and \n     contributing buildings in national, state or local historic \n     districts.\n       Maximum Credit: Minimum Expenditures. The amount of the \n     credit would be limited to $40,000 for each principal \n     residence. The amount of qualified rehabilitation \n     expenditures would be required to exceed the greater of \n     $5,000 or the adjusted tax basis of the building (excluding \n     the land). At least five percent of the qualified \n     rehabilitation expenditures would have to be spent on the \n     exterior of the building.\n       Carry-Forward: Recapture. Any unused amounts of credit \n     would be carried forward until fully exhausted. In the event \n     the taxpayer failed to maintain his or her principal \n     residence in the building for five years, the credit would be \n     subject to ratable recapture.\n       Historic Rehabilitation Mortgage Credit Certificates. Lower \n     income taxpayers, who may not have sufficient Federal Income \n     Tax liability to make effective use of a homeownership credit \n     would be able to convert the credit into a mortgage credit \n     certificate\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\n     which can be used to obtain an interest rate reduction on his \n     or her home mortgage loan. For homes purchased in distressed \n     areas, the credit certificate could be used to lower an \n     individual's downpayment.\n       In many distressed neighborhoods, the cost of \n     rehabilitating a home and bringing it to market significantly \n     exceeds the value at which the property is appraised by the \n     mortgage lender. This gap imposes a significant burden on a \n     potential homeowner because the required downpayment exceeds \n     his or her means. The legislation permits the mortgage credit \n     certificate to be used to reduce the buyer's down payment, \n     rather than to reduce the interest rate, in order to close \n     this gap. This provision is limited to historic districts \n     which qualify as targeted under the existing Mortgage Revenue \n     Bond program or are located in enterprise or empowerment \n     zones.\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I join my good friend and \ncolleague Senator Chafee in support of the Historic Homeownership \nAssistance Act. This bill will spur growth and preservation of historic \nneighborhoods across the country by providing a limited tax credit for \nqualified rehabilitation expenditures to historic homes.\n  In virtually every corner of this land, homes in which our \ngrandparents and parents grew up, communities and neighborhoods that \nnurtured vibrant families, schools that were good places to learn and \nchurches and synagogues that were filled on days of prayer, have \nsuffered the ravages of decay. Every year we lose thousands of historic \nhousing units that are either demolished or abandoned. We are losing \nboth physical structures and the historic past that these physical \nstructures represent.\n  The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will stimulate \nrehabilitation of historic homes while contributing to the \nrevitalization of urban communities. The Federal tax credit provided in \nthe legislation is modeled after the existing Federal commercial \nhistoric rehabilitation tax credit. Since 1981, this commercial tax \ncredit has facilitated the preservation of many historic structures \nsuch as Union Station in Washington, DC. In my home state of Florida, \nthe existing Historic Rehabilitation Investment tax credit has resulted \nin over 300 rehabilitation projects since 1974. These projects range \nfrom the restoration of art deco hotels in Miami Beach, to the \npreservation of Ybor City in Tampa and the Springfield Historic \nDistrict in Jacksonville.\n  The tax credit, however, has never applied to personal residences. \nThis legislation that Senator Chafee and I are cosponsoring is designed \nto empower the one major constituency that has been barred from using \nthe existing credit--homeowners. It is time we provide this incentive \nto homeowners to restore and preserve homes in America's historic \ncommunities.\n  Like the existing investment credit, this bill would provide a credit \nto homeowners equal to 20 percent of a qualified rehabilitation \nexpenditures made on an eligible building that is used as a principle \nresidence by the owner. The amount of the credit would be limited to \n$40,000 for each principal residence. Eligible buildings would be those \nthat are listed individually on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces, or a nationally certified state or local register, and \ncontributing buildings in national, state or local historic districts. \nRecognizing that the states can best administer laws affecting unique \ncommunities, the act gives power to the Secretary of the Interior to \nwork with states to implement a number of provisions.\n\n  The bill also targets Americans at all economic levels. It provides \nlower income Americans with the option to elect a Mortgage Credit \nCertificate in lieu of the tax credit. This certificate allows \nAmericans who cannot take advantage of the tax credit to reduce the \ninterest rate on the mortgage that secures the purchase and \nrehabilitation of a historic home.\n  The credit would also be available for condominiums and co-ops, as \nwell as single-family buildings. If a building were to be rehabilitated \nby a developer for sale to a homeowner, the credit would pass through \nto the homeowner. Since one purpose of the bill is to provide \nincentives for middle-income and more affluent families to return to \nolder towns and cities, the bill does not discriminate among taxpayers \non the basis of income.\n  Mr. President, the time has come for Congress to get serious about \nurban renewal. For too long, we have sat on the sidelines watching idly \nas our citizens slowly abandoned entire homes and neighborhoods in \nurban settings, leaving cities like Miami in Florida and others around \nthe nation in financial jeopardy. This legislation affords fiscally \nstressed cities and towns a way to put abandoned buildings back on the \ntax rolls, while strengthening their income and sales tax base. It will \nencourage more affluent families to claim a stake in older towns and \nneighborhoods. It offers developers, realtors, and homebuilders a new \nrealm of economic opportunity in revitalizing decaying buildings.\n  The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act does not reinvent the \nwheel. In addition to the existing commercial historic rehabilitation \ncredit, the proposed bill incorporates features from several tax \nincentives for the preservation of historic homes. Colorado, Maryland, \nNew Mexico, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, and Utah have pioneered their own \nsuccessful versions of the historic preservation tax incentive for \nhomeownership.\n  At the federal level, this legislation would promote historic home \npreservation nationwide, allowing future generations of Americans to \nvisit and reside in homes that tell the unique history of our \ncommunities. The Historic Homeownership Assistance Act will offer \nenormous potential for saving historic homes and bringing entire \nneighborhoods back to life. I urge all my colleagues to support this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \n        Kyl, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 665. A bill to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974 to prohibit the consideration of retroactive tax \nincreases; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, \nthat if one Committee reports, the other Committee has 30 days to \nreport or be discharged.\n\n\n                 coverdell RETROACTIVE TAX BAN PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I rise to offer a tax reform \npackage to provide greater tax fairness and to protect citizens from \nretroactive taxation. This package includes three initiatives: a \nconstitutional amendment called the retroactive tax ban amendment, a \nbill to establish a new budget point of order against retroactive \ntaxation, and a proposed Senate Rule change.\n  The first, the retroactive tax ban amendment, is a constitutional \namendment to prevent the Federal Government from imposing any tax \nincrease retroactively. The amendment states simply ``No Federal tax \nshall be imposed for the period before the date of enactment.'' We have \nheard directly from the taxpayers, and looking backward for extra taxes \nis unacceptable. It is not a fair way to deal with taxpayers.\n  In addition, I am introducing a bill that would create a point of \norder under the Budget Act against retroactive tax rate increases. \nBecause amending the Constitution can be a very long prospect--just \nlook at the decades-long effort on behalf of a balanced budget \namendment--I believe this legislation is necessary to provide needed \nprotection for American families from the destabilizing effects of \nretroactive taxation.\n  Finally, I am proposing a Senate Rule change making it out of order \nfor the Senate to consider retroactive tax rate increases.\n  Both proposals, the point of order under the Budget Act and the \nSenate Rule change, are modeled after the existing House Rules \npreventing that body from considering retroactive taxation. In other \nwords, by virtue of the fact that the House cannot consider legislation \nso too has the Senate been de facto unable to consider retroactive tax \nrate increases. Now is the time for the Senate to come forward and \nincorporate this fact in its proceedings.\n  It was clear to Thomas Jefferson that the only way to preserve \nfreedom was to protect its citizens from oppressive taxation. Even the \nRussian Constitution does not allow you to tax retroactively. \nRetroactive taxation is wrong, and it is morally incorrect.\n  Families and businesses and communities must know what the rules of \nthe road are and that those rules will not change. They have to be able \nto plan their lives, plan their families, and\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\nplan their tax burdens in advance. They cannot come to the end of a \nyear and have a Congress of the United States and a President come \nforward and say, ``All your planning was for naught, and we don't \ncare.''\n  I encourage my Colleagues to join me in protecting taxpayers from \nretroactive tax rate increases.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Gramm, Mr. McCain, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Hagel, Mr. Grams, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 666. A bill to authorize a new trade and investment policy for \nsub-Saharan Africa; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               african growth and opportunity act (agoa)\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the African \nGrowth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). I'm pleased to be joined by Senators \nMcCain, Gramm, Hagel, DeWine and Grams as original cosponsors. Our bill \nis designed to provide a broad U.S. policy framework towards the nearly \nfifty countries in sub-Sahara Africa. Specifically, the bill seeks to \ndevelop active partnerships with African countries through a set of \ntrade and investment initiatives and incentives in exchange for a \ncommitment from those countries to make the transition to market \neconomies.\n  For decades U.S. policy towards Africa was based largely on a series \nof bilateral aid relationships. Our involvement in Africa was \ninfluenced by strategic considerations inherent in the cold war. Our \nassistance programs targeted humanitarian crises and natural disasters \nand they helped nurture a variety of health, nutritional, educational \nand agricultural programs. As important as these programs have been, \nthey have not promoted much economic development, fostered much self-\nreliance or promoted political stability for the vast majority of the \npeople of sub-Sahara Africa. Nor have they particularly benefitted the \nAmerican economy. For these reasons, it is long past due that the \nUnited States re-evaluate this policy. That is the purpose of our bill.\n  Last year, a similar bill was introduced and passed in the House of \nRepresentatives but did not reach the floor of the Senate. The bill has \nbeen introduced last month in the House and the House committees have \nbeen active. Already, the bill is scheduled to be reported by both the \nWays and Means and International Relations Committees very soon. I \nunderstand that it is scheduled for a floor vote in the House in the \nnext several weeks.\n  The Administration supports this legislation because it mirrors its \nown initiatives on Africa. Indeed, President Clinton cited the \ninitiative and the bill in his last two State of the Union addresses \nbefore the Congress. Virtually all African Ambassadors have endorsed \nthis bill and are committed to working to pass and enact it this year. \nOur bill enjoys support within the American business community and \namong many non-governmental organizations involved in Africa.\n  Mr. President, the AGOA is intended to promote greater economic self-\nreliance in Africa through enhanced private sector activity and trade \nincentives for those countries meeting eligibility requirements and \nwishing to participate. The bill authorizes the President to grant \nduty-free treatment to certain products currently excluded from the GSP \nprogram, subject to the sensitivity analysis of the International Trade \nCommission. It extends the GSP program for Africa for 10 years, a \nprovision which is important for long-term business planning.\n  The bill also would increase access to U.S. markets for African \ntextiles and other products. It would remove U.S. quotas on African \ntextile imports which now amount to less than one percent of our \nworldwide textile imports. The bill includes unusually strong \ntransshipment language that is the toughest ever proposed. The U.S. \nInternational Trade Commission estimated last year that reducing \ntariffs on textiles from Africa would have a negligible effect on our \neconomy but would give a high boost to Africa's fledgling manufacturing \nbase. The jobs and foreign exchange earnings that would be gained in \nAfrica under this initiative will enable Africans to purchase more \nproducts from the United States.\n  In my judgement, the AGOA is a modest bill which, if adopted, could \nhave immodest results in Africa. It takes a long-term view and provides \na policy road map for achieving economic growth and opportunity. It \nwill take some time for the initiatives embedded in this legislation to \nhave a measurable impact on economic growth in Africa. Nonetheless, we \nneed to look ahead over the next decades and to assist wherever \npossible in the development of those areas that have not been \nsuccessfully or fully integrated into the world economy. Much of Africa \nfalls into this category. My bill is intended to help facilitate that \ntransition. Strategic planning now will help create a better, more \nproductive and prosperous future.\n\n  Mr. President, our bill includes a number of other attractive \nprovisions. It includes two new private sector financed funds--an \nequity fund and an infrastructure fund both of which would be backed by \nthe Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC). If successful, \nthese funds will lead to improvements in such areas as African roads, \ntelecommunications and power plants each of which can accelerate \neconomic activity in Africa. It includes provisions for enhanced \nvisibility for Africa in our international deliberations on trade and \nfinance and increased technical assistance for economic management. It \nestablishes a Forum to facilitate high level discussions on trade and \ninvestment policies between the U.S. and Africa.\n  Most importantly, our bill signals the start of a new era in U.S.-\nAfrican relations based less on bilateral aid ties and more business \nrelationships, less on paternalism and more on partnerships, and one \nthat builds upon the long term prospects of African societies rather \nthan on short-term, reactive policies.\n  Many African societies have been undergoing impressive political and \neconomic transformations. Africa's economic potential is substantial. \nThere are more than 600 million people in sub-Sahara Africa, but \nAfrica's share of foreign annual direct investment commands less than \ntwo percent of global direct investment flows. Much of that capital \ncomes from Europe which has an established market and investment \npresence in Africa. Nonetheless, several African countries enjoy \nsustained economic growth at or above 6%, despite the strains in the \nglobal economy that began in Southeast Asia and spread to other parts \nof the world. Indeed, U.S. Trade with sub-Sahara Africa exceeds our \ntrade with all the states of the former Soviet Union combined and the \npotential for expansion will grow as these economies expand and mature.\n  The enhanced trade and private investment benefits in the bill will \nbe available to all African societies but especially to those countries \nwhich undertake sustained economic reform, maintain acceptable human \nrights practices and make progress towards good governance. These \nstandards are similar to those applied in other parts of the world. \nIndeed, without these standards the private sector would be unlikely to \ninvest in Africa.\n  The United States can play a significant role in helping promote \nAfrica development. We have a historic opportunity to help integrate \nAfrican countries into the global economy, to re-think dependency on \nforeign assistance and to help strengthen civil society and economic \nand political institutions. No one believes this bill is a panacea for \nAfrica, but it is very much in our interests to play a constructive \nrole in the evolving economic transition in Africa. If the United \nStates has the vision to be a major player in Africa's economic and \npolitical improvement, we will also be a major beneficiary. If we are \nsuccessful, Africa will provide new trade and investment opportunities \nfor the United States. It will also improve the quality of life for a \nbroader segment of the people of Africa, a goal we must all support and \napplaud.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the proposed African Growth and Opportunity \nAct (AGOA) section-by-section description be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                 S. 666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that it is in the mutual economic \n     interest of the United States and sub-Saharan Africa to \n     promote stable and sustainable economic growth and \n     development in sub-Saharan Africa and that sustained economic \n     growth in sub-Saharan Africa depends in large measure upon \n     the development of a receptive environment for trade and \n     investment. To that end, the United States seeks to \n     facilitate market-led economic growth in, and thereby the \n     social and economic development of, the countries of sub-\n     Saharan Africa. In particular, the United States seeks to \n     assist sub-Saharan African countries, and the private sector \n     in those countries, to achieve economic self-reliance by--\n       (1) strengthening and expanding the private sector in sub-\n     Saharan Africa, especially women-owned businesses;\n       (2) encouraging increased trade and investment between the \n     United States and sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) reducing tariff and nontariff barriers and other trade \n     obstacles;\n       (4) expanding United States assistance to sub-Saharan \n     Africa's regional integration efforts;\n       (5) negotiating free trade areas;\n       (6) establishing a United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Trade \n     and Investment Partnership;\n       (7) focusing on countries committed to accountable \n     government, economic reform, and the eradication of poverty;\n       (8) establishing a United States-Sub-Saharan Africa \n     Economic Cooperation Forum; and\n       (9) continuing to support development assistance for those \n     countries in sub-Saharan Africa attempting to build civil \n     societies.\n\n     SEC. 3.

UNITED STATES-SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA FREE TRADE AREA.\n\n       (a) Declaration of Policy.--The Congress declares that a \n     United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Free Trade Area should be \n     established, or free trade agreements should be entered into, \n     in order to serve as the catalyst for increasing trade \n     between the United States and sub-Saharan Africa and \n     increasing private sector development in sub-Saharan Africa.\n       (b) Plan Requirement.--\n       (1) In general.--The President, taking into account the \n     provisions of the treaty establishing the African Economic \n     Community and the willingness of the governments of sub-\n     Saharan African countries to engage in negotiations to enter \n     into free trade agreements, shall develop a plan for the \n     purpose of entering into one or more trade agreements with \n     sub-Saharan African countries eligible under section 4 in \n     order to establish a United States-Sub-Saharan Africa Free \n     Trade Area (in this section referred to as the ``Free Trade \n     Area'').\n       (2) Elements of plan.--The plan shall include the \n     following:\n       (A) The specific objectives of the United States with \n     respect to the establishment of the Free Trade Area and a \n     suggested timetable for achieving those objectives.\n       (B) The benefits to both the United States and sub-Saharan \n     Africa with respect to the Free Trade Area.\n       (C) A mutually agreed-upon timetable for establishing the \n     Free Trade Area.\n       (D) The implications for and the role of regional and sub-\n     regional organizations in sub-Saharan Africa with respect to \n     the Free Trade Area.\n       (E) Subject matter anticipated to be covered by the \n     agreement for establishing the Free Trade Area and United \n     States laws, programs, and policies, as well as the laws of \n     participating eligible African countries and existing \n     bilateral and multilateral and economic cooperation and trade \n     agreements, that may be affected by the agreement or \n     agreements.\n       (F) Procedures to ensure the following:\n       (i) Adequate consultation with the Congress and the private \n     sector during the negotiation of the agreement or agreements \n     for establishing the Free Trade Area.\n       (ii) Consultation with the Congress regarding all matters \n     relating to implementation of the agreement or agreements.\n       (iii) Approval by the Congress of the agreement or \n     agreements.\n       (iv) Adequate consultations with the relevant African \n     governments and African regional and subregional \n     intergovernmental organizations during the negotiations of \n     the agreement or agreements.\n       (c) Reporting Requirement.--Not later than 12 months after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall \n     prepare and transmit to the Congress a report containing the \n     plan developed pursuant to subsection (b).\n\n     SEC. 103. ELIMINATING TRADE BARRIERS AND ENCOURAGING EXPORTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The lack of competitiveness of sub-Saharan Africa in \n     the global market, especially in the manufacturing sector, \n     make it a limited threat to market disruption and no threat \n     to United States jobs.\n       (2) Annual textile and apparel exports to the United States \n     from sub-Saharan Africa represent less than 1 percent of all \n     textile and apparel exports to the United States, which \n     totaled $54,001,863,000 in 1997.\n       (3) Sub-Saharan Africa has limited textile manufacturing \n     capacity. During 1999 and the succeeding 4 years, this \n     limited capacity to manufacture textiles and apparel is \n     projected to grow at a modest rate. Given this limited \n     capacity to export textiles and apparel, it will be very \n     difficult for these exports from sub-Saharan Africa, during \n     1999 and the succeeding 9 years, to exceed 3 percent annually \n     of total imports of textile and apparel to the United States. \n     If these exports from sub-Saharan Africa remain around 3 \n     percent of total imports, they will not represent a threat to \n     United States workers, consumers, or manufacturers.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) it would be to the mutual benefit of the countries in \n     sub-Saharan Africa and the United States to ensure that the \n     commitments of the World Trade Organization and associated \n     agreements are faithfully implemented in each of the member \n     countries, so as to lay the groundwork for sustained growth \n     in textile and apparel exports and trade under agreed rules \n     and disciplines;\n       (2) reform of trade policies in sub-Saharan Africa with the \n     objective of removing structural impediments to trade, \n     consistent with obligations under the World Trade \n     Organization, can assist the countries of the region in \n     achieving greater and greater diversification of textile and \n     apparel export commodities and products and export markets; \n     and\n       (3) the President should support textile and apparel trade \n     reform in sub-Saharan Africa by, among other measures, \n     providing technical assistance, sharing of information to \n     expand basic knowledge of how to trade with the United \n     States, and encouraging business-to-business contacts with \n     the region.\n       (c) Treatment of Quotas.--\n       (1) Kenya and mauritius.--Pursuant to the Agreement on \n     Textiles and Clothing, the United States shall eliminate the \n     existing quotas on textile and apparel exports to the United \n     States--\n       (A) from Kenya within 30 days after that country adopts an \n     efficient visa system to guard against unlawful transshipment \n     of textile and apparel goods and the use of counterfeit \n     documents; and\n       (B) from Mauritius within 30 days after that country adopts \n     such a visa system.\n\n     The Customs Service shall provide the necessary technical \n     assistance to Kenya and Mauritius in the development and \n     implementation of those visa systems.\n       (2) Other sub-saharan countries.--The President shall \n     continue the existing no quota policy for countries in sub-\n     Saharan Africa. The President shall submit to the Congress, \n     not later than March 31 of each year, a report on the growth \n     in textiles and apparel exports to the United States from \n     countries in sub-Saharan Africa in order to protect United \n     States consumers, workers, and textile manufacturers from \n     economic injury on account of the no quota policy.\n       (d) Customs Procedures and Enforcement.--\n       (1) Actions by countries against transshipment and \n     circumvention.--The President should ensure that any country \n     in sub-Saharan Africa that intends to export textile and \n     apparel goods to the United States--\n       (A) has in place a functioning and effective visa system \n     and domestic laws and enforcement procedures to guard against \n     unlawful transshipment of textile and apparel goods and the \n     use of counterfeit documents; and\n       (B) will cooperate fully with the United States to address \n     and take action necessary to prevent circumvention, as \n     provided in Article 5 of the Agreement on Textiles and \n     Clothing.\n       (2) Penalties against exporters.--If the President \n     determines, based on sufficient evidence, that an exporter \n     has willfully falsified information regarding the country of \n     origin, manufacture, processing, or assembly of a textile or \n     apparel article for which duty-free treatment under section \n     503(a)(1)(C) of the Trade Act of 1974 is claimed, then the \n     President shall deny to such exporter, and any successors of \n     such exporter, for a period\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\n     of 2 years, duty-free treatment under such section for \n     textile and apparel articles.\n       (3) Applicability of united states laws and procedures.--\n     All provisions of the laws, regulations, and procedures of \n     the United States relating to the denial of entry of articles \n     or penalties against individuals or entities for engaging in \n     illegal transshipment, fraud, or other violations of the \n     customs laws shall apply to imports from Sub-Saharan \n     countries.\n       (4) Monitoring and reports to congress.--The Customs \n     Service shall monitor and the Commissioner of Customs shall \n     submit to the Congress, not later than March 31 of each year, \n     a report on the effectiveness of the visa systems described \n     in subsection (c)(1) and paragraph (1) of this subsection and \n     on measures taken by countries in Sub-Saharan Africa which \n     export textiles or apparel to the United States to prevent \n     circumvention as described in Article 5 of the Agreement on \n     Textiles and Clothing.\n       (e) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``Agreement on Textiles and Clothing'' means the Agreement on \n     Textiles and Clothing referred to in section 101(d)(4) of the \n     Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(4)).\n\n     SEC. 104.

This \n     subparagraph shall not affect the designation of eligible \n     articles under subparagraph (B).''.\n       (b) Rules of Origin.--Section 503(a)(2) of the Trade Act of \n     1974 (19 U.S.C. 2463(a)(2)) is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(C) Eligible countries in sub-saharan africa.--For \n     purposes of determining the percentage referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) in the case of an article of an eligible \n     country in sub-Saharan Africa that is a beneficiary \n     developing country--\n       ``(i) if the cost or value of materials produced in the \n     customs territory of the United States is included with \n     respect to that article, an amount not to exceed 15 percent \n     of the appraised value of the article at the time it is \n     entered that is attributed to such United States cost or \n     value may be applied toward determining the percentage \n     referred to in subparagraph (A); and\n       ``(ii) the cost or value of the materials included with \n     respect to that article that are produced in any beneficiary \n     developing country that is an eligible country in sub-\n     Saharan Africa shall be applied in determining such \n     percentage.''.\n       (c) Waiver of Competitive Need Limitation.--Section \n     503(c)(2)(D) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n     2463(c)(2)(D)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(D) Least-developed beneficiary developing countries and \n     eligible countries in sub-saharan africa.--Subparagraph (A) \n     shall not apply to any least-developed beneficiary developing \n     country or any eligible country in sub-Saharan Africa.''.\n       (d) Extension of Program.--Section 505 of the Trade Act of \n     1974 (19 U.S.C. 2465) is amended to read as follows:\n\n     ``SEC. 505.

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND DEBT \n                   REDUCTION.\n\n       (a) Better Mechanisms To Further Goals for Sub-Saharan \n     Africa.--It is the sense of the Congress that the Secretary \n     of the Treasury should instruct the United States Executive \n     Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the International Monetary Fund, and the African \n     Development Bank to use the voice and votes of the Executive \n     Directors to encourage vigorously their respective \n     institutions to develop enhanced mechanisms which further the \n     following goals in eligible countries in sub-Saharan Africa:\n       (1) Strengthening and expanding the private sector, \n     especially among women-owned businesses.\n       (2) Reducing tariffs, nontariff barriers, and other trade \n     obstacles, and increasing economic integration.\n       (3) Supporting countries committed to accountable \n     government, economic reform, the eradication of poverty, and \n     the building of civil societies.\n       (4) Supporting deep debt reduction at the earliest possible \n     date with the greatest amount of relief for eligible poorest \n     countries under the ``Heavily Indebted Poor Countries'' \n     (HIPC) debt initiative.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that relief provided to countries in sub-Saharan Africa which \n     qualify for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries debt \n     initiative should primarily be made through grants rather \n     than through extended-term debt, and that interim relief or \n     interim financing should be provided for eligible countries \n     that establish a strong record of macroeconomic reform.\n\n     SEC. 202. EXECUTIVE BRANCH INITIATIVES.\n\n       (a) Statement of Congress.--The Congress recognizes that \n     the stated policy of the executive branch in 1997, the \n     ``Partnership for Growth and Opportunity in Africa'' \n     initiative, is a step toward the establishment of a \n     comprehensive trade and development policy for sub-Saharan \n     Africa. It is the sense of the Congress that this Partnership \n     is a companion to the policy goals set forth in this Act.\n       (b) Technical Assistance To Promote Economic Reforms and \n     Development.--In addition to continuing bilateral and \n     multilateral economic and development assistance, the \n     President shall target technical assistance toward--\n       (1) developing relationships between United States firms \n     and firms in sub-Saharan Africa through a variety of business \n     associations and networks;\n       (2) providing assistance to the governments of sub-Saharan \n     African countries to--\n       (A) liberalize trade and promote exports;\n       (B) bring their legal regimes into compliance with the \n     standards of the World Trade Organization in conjunction with \n     membership in that Organization;\n       (C) make financial and fiscal reforms; and\n       (D) promote greater agribusiness linkages;\n       (3) addressing such critical agricultural policy issues as \n     market liberalization, agricultural export development, and \n     agribusiness investment in processing and transporting \n     agricultural commodities;\n       (4) increasing the number of reverse trade missions to \n     growth-oriented countries in sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (5) increasing trade in services; and\n       (6) encouraging greater sub-Saharan participation in future \n     negotiations in the World Trade Organization on services and \n     making further commitments in their schedules to the General \n     Agreement on Trade in Services in order to encourage the \n     removal of tariff and nontariff barriers.\n\n     SEC. 203. SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA INFRASTRUCTURE FUND.\n\n       (a) Initiation of Funds.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation should \n     exercise the authorities it has to initiate an equity fund or \n     equity funds in support of projects in the countries in sub-\n     Saharan Africa, in addition to the existing equity fund for \n     sub-Saharan Africa created by the Corporation.\n       (b) Structure and Types of Funds.--\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\n       (1) Structure.--Each fund initiated under subsection (a) \n     should be structured as a partnership managed by professional \n     private sector fund managers and monitored on a continuing \n     basis by the Corporation.\n       (2) Capitalization.--Each fund should be capitalized with a \n     combination of private equity capital, which is not \n     guaranteed by the Corporation, and debt for which the \n     Corporation provides guaranties.\n       (3) Infrastructure fund.--One or more of the funds, with \n     combined assets of up to $500,000,000, should be used in \n     support of infrastructure projects in countries of sub-\n     Saharan Africa.\n       (4) Emphasis.--The Corporation shall ensure that the funds \n     are used to provide support in particular to women \n     entrepreneurs and to innovative investments that expand \n     opportunities for women and maximize employment opportunities \n     for poor individuals.\n\n     SEC. 204. OVERSEAS PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION AND EXPORT-\n                   IMPORT BANK INITIATIVES.\n\n       (a) Overseas Private Investment Corporation.--\n       (1) Advisory committee.--Section 233 of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2193) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following:\n       ``(e) Advisory Committee.--The Board shall take prompt \n     measures to increase the loan, guarantee, and insurance \n     programs, and financial commitments, of the Corporation in \n     sub-Saharan Africa, including through the use of an advisory \n     committee to assist the Board in developing and implementing \n     policies, programs, and financial instruments with respect to \n     sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, the advisory committee shall \n     make recommendations to the Board on how the Corporation can \n     facilitate greater support by the United States for trade and \n     investment with and in sub-Saharan Africa. The advisory \n     committee shall terminate 4 years after the date of the \n     enactment of this subsection.''.\n       (2) Reports to the congress.--Within 6 months after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and annually for each of \n     the 4 years thereafter, the Board of Directors of the \n     Overseas Private Investment Corporation shall submit to the \n     Congress a report on the steps that the Board has taken to \n     implement section 233(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act of \n     1961 (as added by paragraph (1)) and any recommendations of \n     the advisory board established pursuant to such section.\n       (b) Export-Import Bank.--\n       (1) Advisory committee for sub-saharan africa.--Section \n     2(b) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945 (12 U.S.C. 635(b)) \n     is amended by inserting after paragraph (12) the following:\n       ``(13)(A) The Board of Directors of the Bank shall take \n     prompt measures, consistent with the credit standards \n     otherwise required by law, to promote the expansion of the \n     Bank's financial commitments in sub-Saharan Africa under the \n     loan, guarantee, and insurance programs of the Bank.\n       ``(B)(i) The Board of Directors shall establish and use an \n     advisory committee to advise the Board of Directors on the \n     development and implementation of policies and programs \n     designed to support the expansion described in subparagraph \n     (A).\n       ``(ii) The advisory committee shall make recommendations to \n     the Board of Directors on how the Bank can facilitate greater \n     support by United States commercial banks for trade with sub-\n     Saharan Africa.\n       ``(iii) The advisory committee shall terminate 4 years \n     after the date of the enactment of this subparagraph.''.\n       (2) Reports to the congress.--Within 6 months after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and annually for each of \n     the 4 years thereafter, the Board of Directors of the Export-\n     Import Bank of the United States shall submit to the Congress \n     a report on the steps that the Board has taken to \n     implement section 2(b)(13)(B) of the Export-Import Bank \n     Act of 1945 (as added by paragraph (1)) and any \n     recommendations of the advisory committee established \n     pursuant to such section.\n\n     SEC. 205. EXPANSION OF THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN \n                   COMMERCIAL SERVICE IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States and Foreign Commercial Service \n     (hereafter in this section referred to as the ``Commercial \n     Service'') plays an important role in helping United States \n     businesses identify export opportunities and develop reliable \n     sources of information on commercial prospects in foreign \n     countries.\n       (2) During the 1980s, the presence of the Commercial \n     Service in sub-Saharan Africa consisted of 14 professionals \n     providing services in eight countries. By early 1997, that \n     presence had been reduced by half to seven, in only four \n     countries.\n       (3) Since 1997, the Department of Commerce has slowly begun \n     to increase the presence of the Commercial Service in sub-\n     Saharan Africa, adding five full-time officers to established \n     posts.\n       (4) Although the Commercial Service Officers in these \n     countries have regional responsibilities, this kind of \n     coverage does not adequately service the needs of United \n     States businesses attempting to do business in sub-Saharan \n     Africa.\n       (5) The Congress has, on several occasions, encouraged the \n     Commercial Service to focus its resources and efforts in \n     countries or regions in Europe or Asia to promote greater \n     United States export activity in those markets.\n       (6) Because market information is not widely available in \n     many sub-Saharan African countries, the presence of \n     additional Commercial Service Officers and resources can play \n     a significant role in assisting United States businesses in \n     markets in those countries.\n       (b) Appointments.--Subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, by not later than December 31, 2000, the \n     Secretary of Commerce, acting through the Assistant Secretary \n     of Commerce and Director General of the United States and \n     Foreign Commercial Service, shall take steps to ensure that--\n       (1) at least 20 full-time Commercial Service employees are \n     stationed in sub-Saharan Africa; and\n       (2) full-time Commercial Service employees are stationed in \n     not less than ten different sub-Saharan African countries.\n       (c) Commercial Service Initiative for Sub-Saharan Africa.--\n     In order to encourage the export of United States goods and \n     services to sub-Saharan African countries, the Commercial \n     Service shall make a special effort to--\n       (1) identify United States goods and services which are not \n     being exported to sub-Saharan African countries but which are \n     being exported to those countries by competitor nations;\n       (2) identify, where appropriate, trade barriers and \n     noncompetitive actions, including violations of intellectual \n     property rights, that are preventing or hindering sales of \n     United States goods and services to, or the operation of \n     United States companies in, sub-Saharan Africa;\n       (3) present, periodically, a list of the goods and services \n     identified under paragraph (1), and any trade barriers or \n     noncompetitive actions identified under paragraph (2), to \n     appropriate authorities in sub-Saharan African countries with \n     a view to securing increased market access for United States \n     exporters of goods and services;\n       (4) facilitate the entrance by United States businesses \n     into the markets identified under paragraphs (1) and (2); and\n       (5) monitor and evaluate the results of efforts to increase \n     the sales of goods and services in such markets.\n       (d) Reports to Congress.--Not later than one year after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, and each year thereafter \n     for five years, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation \n     with the Secretary of State, shall report to the Congress on \n     actions taken to carry out subsections (b) and (c). Each \n     report shall specify--\n       (1) in what countries full-time Commercial Service Officers \n     are stationed, and the number of such officers placed in each \n     such country;\n       (2) the effectiveness of the presence of the additional \n     Commercial Service Officers in increasing United States \n     exports to sub-Saharan African countries; and\n       (3) the specific actions taken by Commercial Service \n     Officers, both in sub-Saharan African countries and in the \n     United States, to carry out subsection (c), including \n     identifying a list of targeted export sectors and countries.\n\n     SEC. 206. DONATION OF AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL EQUIPMENT TO \n                   ELIGIBLE SUB-SAHARAN AFRICAN COUNTRIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that, to the extent \n     appropriate, the United States Government should make every \n     effort to donate to governments of sub-Saharan African \n     countries (determined to be eligible under section 4 of this \n     Act) air traffic control equipment that is no longer in use, \n     including appropriate related reimbursable technical \n     assistance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA)--Section-by-Section Summary\n\n       Policy. The AGOA establishes as U.S. policy the creation of \n     a transition path from development assistance to economic \n     self-reliance for those sub-Sahara countries committed to \n     economic and political reform, market incentives and private \n     sector growth. Eligibility requirements are established for \n     participation in the programs and benefits of the bill. The \n     bill will not require any cuts or increases in the USAID \n     budget. The bill includes separate Trade and Foreign Policy \n     Titles.\n       Free Trade Area. The AGOA directs the President to develop \n     a plan for trade agreements to establish a U.S.-Sub Sahara \n     Africa Free Trade Area to provide an incentive for increasing \n     trade between the U.S. and Africa and to stimulate private \n     sector development in the region.\n       Trade Initiative. The AGOA would eliminate quotas on \n     textiles and apparel from Kenya and Mauritius after these \n     countries adopt a visa system to guard against transshipment. \n     It continues the existing no-quota policy in Africa through \n     2005. Further, it authorizes the President to grant duty-free \n     treatment for certain products from Africa currently excluded \n     from the GSP program, subject to an import sensitivity \n     analysis by the ITC, and extends the GSP program for Africa \n     for 10 years.\n       U.S.-Africa Economic Forum. The AGOA would establish a \n     U.S.-Africa Economic Forum to facilitate annual high level \n     discussions of bilateral and multilateral trade and \n     investment policies and initiatives. The Forum would work \n     with the private sector to develop a long term trade and \n     investment agenda.\n       Equity and Investment Funds. The AGOA directs OPIC to \n     create a privately-funded $150 million equity fund and \n     privately-funded $500\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\n     Million infrastructure fund for Africa. Both funds would \n     support innovative investment policies to expand \n     opportunities for women and to maximize employment \n     opportunities for the poor.\n       Greater Attention to Africa. The AGOA calls for at least \n     one member of the board of directors of the EX-IM Bank and \n     the OPIC to have extensive private sector experience in \n     Africa. Both the Bank and OPIC would establish private sector \n     advisory committees with experience in Africa and both would \n     report periodically to the Congress on their loan, guarantee \n     and insurance programs in Africa.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support legislation \nintroduced by my esteemed colleague, Senator Lugar. The African Growth \nand Opportunity Act will create an historic new U.S. trade and \ninvestment policy for Africa.\n  It is regrettable that the public perception of Sub-Saharan Africa \nremains a region which is underdeveloped, poor, ravaged by famine and \nwars, and ruled by authoritarian leaders. This is not an accurate \npicture of today's Africa.\n  The Africa of the late 1990s is a continent struggling on the road to \neconomic and political reform. Some 30 Sub-Saharan African countries \nare implementing economic reforms, including liberalizing trade and \ninvestment regimes, rationalizing tariff and exchange rates, and \nreducing barriers to investment and stock market development. In \naddition, more than 30 Sub-Saharan African countries are also in \nvarious stages of democratic transformation that will allow their \ncitizens to have the same type of participation in their governments \nthat, as Americans, we hold dear. Nigeria's recent election, despite \nits flaws, is a concrete example of the movement toward democracy in \nAfrica.\n  The African Growth and Opportunity Act is an important piece of \nlegislation designed to promote continued reform in Africa. The main \nstrength of the bill is its reliance on trade incentives, not financial \naid. These trade incentives are intended to result in the political and \neconomic well-being of African citizens. American companies are given \nincentives to invest in these countries, and help them learn how to \nbecome members of the world marketplace. For many years, we have poured \nour financial resources into foreign aid programs that have met with \nlimited success. This bill is based on the commonsense principle that \nif you give a nation a handout, you feed it for a day, but if you teach \nit to grow and trade, you assist it to reach permanent independence and \nself-reliance.\n  There is also a benefit for the United States in this legislation. \nCurrently, United States' exports to Sub-Saharan Africa are $6 billion, \nwhich support 100,000 American jobs. However, the U.S. has only a 7% \nshare in the African market, while Europe has a 40% share. More U.S. \ntrade and investment in Sub-Saharan Africa will increase U.S. market \nshare, and create more jobs here in the U.S.\n  More important, it should be pointed out that this legislation will \nfoster interdependence and economic growth between countries that have \nbeen torn apart by war, disease, and harmful economic policies. By \ntrading with the United States and each other, these nations will see \nthe benefits of peace and stability to economic growth. An \ninterdependent and democratic Africa will be less likely to suffer from \ncivil strife.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join us in supporting this legislation \nthat will open up a new chapter in U.S.-African relations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCain:\n  S. 667. A bill to improve and reform elementary and secondary \neducation; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           Educating America's Children for Tomorrow (ED-ACT)\n\n  Mr. McCain. President, centuries ago, Aristotle wrote, ``All who have \nmeditated in the art of governing mankind have been convinced that the \nfate of empires depends on the education of the youth.'' His words \nstill hold true today. Educating our children is a critical component \nin their quest for personal success and fulfillment, but it also plays \na pivotal role in the success of our nation economically, \nintellectually, civically and morally.\n  Like many Americans, I have grave concerns about the current \ncondition of our nation's education system. If a report card on our \neducational system were sent home today, it would be full of \nunsatisfactory and incomplete marks. In fact, it would be full of \n``D's'' and ``F's.'' These abominable grades demonstrate our failure to \nmeet the needs of our nation's students in kindergarten through twelfth \ngrade.\n  Failure is clearly evident throughout the educational system. One \nprominent illustration of our nation's failure is seen in the results \nof the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS.) Over \nforty countries participated in the 1996 study which tested science and \nmathematical abilities of students in the fourth, eighth and twelfth \ngrades. Tragically, American students scored lower than students in \nother countries. According to this study, our twelfth graders scored \nnear the bottom, placing 19th out of 21 nations in math and 16th in \nscience, while scoring at the absolutely bottom in physics.\n  Meanwhile, students in countries which are struggling economically, \nsocially and politically, such as Russia, outscored U.S. children in \nmath and scored far above them in advanced math and physics. Clearly, \nwe must make significant changes in our children's academic performance \nin order to remain a viable force in the world economy.\n  We can also see our failure when we look at the federal government's \nefforts to combat illiteracy. We spend over $8 billion a year on \nprograms to eradicate illiteracy across the country. Yet, we have not \nseen any significant improvement in literacy in any segment of our \npopulation. Today, more than 40 million Americans cannot read a menu, \ninstructions, medicine labels or a newspaper. And, tragically, four out \nof ten children in third grade cannot read.\n  For too long, Washington has been creating new educational programs \nwhich provide good sound-bites for politicians, make great campaign \nslogans, or serve the specific needs of select interests groups, but \ncompletely ignore the fundamental academic needs of our children. The \ntime has come for us to free our schools from the shackles of the \nfederal government and give them the freedom and the tools to educate \nchildren.\n  The first step is putting parents back in charge. Federal education \ndollars should be spent where they do the most good. The ED-ACT would \nfunnel millions of dollars directly into our classrooms, rather than \nwasting education dollars on federal red tape. By sending federal \nelementary and secondary education funds directly to local education \nagencies (LEAs), schools will be able to utilize the funds for the \nunique needs of their students rather than wasting their time jumping \nthrough hoops for government bureaucrats. Giving the money directly to \nthe LEAs with strong accountability requirements for the academic \nperformance and improvement of our children is the right thing to do.\n  We must have higher learning expectations for our children, but we \ncannot and should not have these standards controlled at the national \nlevel. States and local communities must control the development, \nimplementation and assessment of academic standards. This bill would \nprohibit federal funds from being used to develop or implement national \neducation tests. National tests and standards only result in new \nbureaucracies, depriving parents of the opportunity to manage the \neducation of their children.\n  ED-ACT strengthens and reauthorizes the successful Troops to Teachers \nprogram. As many of my colleagues know, the Troops to Teachers program \nwas initially created in 1993 to assist military personnel affected by \ndefense downsizing who were interested in utilizing their knowledge, \nprofessional skills and expertise as teachers. Unfortunately, the \nauthorization for this program is set to expire at the end of this \nfiscal year.\n  Local school districts across the city are facing a shortage of two \nmillion teachers over the next decade, and the Troops to Teachers \nprogram is an important resource to help schools address this shortfall \nby recruiting, funding and retaining new teachers to make America's \nchildren ready for tomorrow, particularly in the areas of math, reading \nand science.\n  ED-ACT would also encourage states to ensure that all Americans are \nfluent in English, while helping develop innovative initiatives to \npromote the importance of foreign language skills.\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\nThe ability to speak one or more languages, in addition to English, is \na tremendous resource to the U.S. because it enhances our \ncompetitiveness in global markets. Multilingualism also enhances our \nnation's diplomatic efforts and leadership role on the international \nfront by fostering greater communication and understanding between \npeople of all nations and cultures.\n  ED-ACT provides educational opportunities for disadvantaged children \nby providing parents and students the freedom to choose the best school \nfor their unique academic needs, while encouraging schools to be \ncreative and responsive to the needs of all students. This three-year \ndemonstration would allow up to ten states or localities to implement a \nvoucher program empowering low-income parents with more options for \ntheir child's education. Parents should be allowed to use their tax \ndollars to send their children to the school of their choice, public or \nprivate. Tuition vouchers would give low- income families the same \nchoice.\n\n  ED-ACT also creates additional financial opportunities for parents, \nguardians and communities to plan for the educational expenses of their \nchildren. First, it would increase the amount allowed to be contributed \nto a higher education IRA from $500 to $1,000 annually. Under current \nlaw, the maximum amount which could be saved for a child throughout \ntheir lifetime is $9,000, which would not cover the basic costs of \ntuition at a private institution, let alone books, foods and living \nexpenses for a student. This amount barely covers the tuition at a \npublic four-year institution, but that is before factoring in \ninflation, expenses, room and board. In my home state of Arizona, a \nfour-year degree from one of the three state colleges costs about \n$8,800--and that is just for tuition, not books, food, room and board. \nIn addition, ED-ACT allows a $500 tax credit for taxpayers who make a \nvoluntary contribution to public or private schools.\n  This bill would also help develop better educational tools for our \nchildren by gathering and analyzing pertinent data regarding some of \nour most vulnerable students, while collecting information about how we \ncan ensure the best teachers are in our classrooms.\n  Finally, the last section of the ED-ACT reduces the bureaucratic \ncosts at the Department of Education by thirty-five percent no later \nthan October 1, 2004. Far too many resources are spent on funding \nbureaucrats in Washington, D.C., rather than teaching our children.\n  Thomas Jefferson said, ``The purpose of education is to create young \ncitizens with knowing heads and loving hearts.'' If we fail to give our \nchildren the education they need to nurture their heads and hearts, \nthen we threaten their futures and the future of our nation. The bill I \nam introducing today is an important step towards ensuring that our \nchildren have both the love in their hearts and the knowledge in their \nheads to not only dream, but to make their dreams a reality.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered printed in the Record, \nas follows:\n\n                                 S. 667\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

ENGLISH PLUS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Immigrants to the United States have powerful \n     incentives to learn English in order to fully participate in \n     American society and the Nation's economy, and 90 percent of \n     all immigrant families become fluent in English within the \n     second generation.\n       (2) A common language promotes unity among citizens, and \n     fosters greater communication.\n       (3) The reality of a global economy is an ever-present \n     international development that is fostered by trade.\n       (4) The United States is well postured for the global \n     economy and international development with its diverse \n     population and rich heritage of cultures and languages from \n     around the world.\n       (5) Foreign language skills are a tremendous resource to \n     the United States and enhance American competitiveness in the \n     global economy.\n       (6) It is clearly in the interest of the United States to \n     encourage educational opportunities for all citizens and to \n     take steps to realize the opportunities.\n       (7) Many American Indian languages are preserved, \n     encouraged, and utilized, as the languages were during World \n     War II when the Navajo Code Talkers created a code that could \n     not be broken by the Japanese or the Germans, for example.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) our Nation must support literacy programs, including \n     programs designed to teach English, as well as those \n     dedicated to helping Americans learn and maintain languages \n     in addition to English;\n       (2) our Nation must recognize the importance of English as \n     the unifying language of the United States;\n       (3) as a Nation we must support and encourage Americans of \n     every age to master English in order to succeed in American \n     society and ensure a productive workforce;\n       (4) our Nation must recognize that a skilled labor force is \n     crucial to United States competitiveness in a global economy, \n     and the ability to speak languages in addition to English is \n     a significant skill; and\n       (5) our Nation must recognize the benefits, both on an \n     individual and a national basis, of developing the Nation's \n     linguistic resources.\n\n     SEC. 402. MULTILINGUALISM STUDY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) even though all residents of the United States should \n     be proficient in English, without regard to their country of \n     birth, it is also of vital importance to the competitiveness \n     of the United States that those residents be encouraged to \n     learn other languages; and\n       (2) education is the primary responsibility of State and \n     local governments and communities, and the governments and \n     communities are responsible for developing policies in the \n     area of education.\n       (b) Resident of the United States Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``resident of the United States'' means an \n     individual who resides in the United States, other than an \n     alien who is not lawfully present in the United States.\n       (c) Study.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall conduct \n     a study of multilingualism in the United States in accordance \n     with this section.\n       (2) Requirements.--\n       (A) In general.--The study conducted under this section \n     shall determine--\n       (i) the percentage of residents in the United States who \n     are proficient in English and at least 1 other language;\n       (ii) the predominant language other than English in which \n     residents referred to in clause (i) are proficient;\n       (iii) the percentage of the residents described in clause \n     (i) who were born in a foreign country;\n       (iv) the percentage of the residents described in clause \n     (i) who were born in the United States;\n       (v) the percentage of the residents described in clause \n     (iv) who are second-generation residents of the United \n     States; and\n       (vi) the percentage of the residents described in clause \n     (iv) who are third-generation residents of the United States.\n       (B) Age-specific categories.--The study under this section \n     shall, with respect to the residents described in \n     subparagraph (A)(i), determine the number of those residents \n     in each of the following categories:\n       (i) Residents who have not attained the age of 12.\n       (ii) Residents who have attained the age of 12, but have \n     not attained the age of 18.\n       (iii) Residents who have attained the age of 18, but have \n     not attained the age of 50.\n       (iv) Residents who have attained the age of 50.\n       (C) Federal programs.--In conducting the study under this \n     section, the Comptroller General shall establish a list of \n     each Federal program that encourages multilingualism with \n     respect to any category of residents described in \n     subparagraph (B).\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\n       (D) Comparisons.--In conducting the study under this \n     section, the Comptroller General shall compare the \n     multilingual population described in subparagraph (A) with \n     the multilingual populations of foreign countries--\n       (i) in the Western Hemisphere; and\n       (ii) in Asia.\n       (d) Report.--Upon completion of the study under this \n     section, the Comptroller General shall prepare, and submit to \n     Congress, a report that contains the results of the study \n     conducted under this section, and such findings and \n     recommendations as the Comptroller General determines to be \n     appropriate.\n\n     TITLE V--EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN\n\n     SEC. 501.

and\n       (B) an inability to obtain credit for continued operations \n     and reinvestment in facilities;\n       (4) the crisis also has affected the willingness of private \n     banks and investment institutions to make loans to the U.S. \n     steel industry for continued operation and reinvestment in \n     facilities;\n       (5) these steel bankruptcies, job losses, and financial \n     losses are also having serious negative effects on the tax \n     base of cities, counties, and States, and on the essential \n     health, education, and municipal services that these \n     government entities provide to their citizens; and\n       (6) a strong steel industry is necessary to the adequate \n     defense preparedness of the United States in order to have \n     sufficient steel available to build the ships, tanks, planes, \n     and armaments necessary for the national defense.\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section--\n       (1) the term ``Board'' means the Loan Guarantee Board \n     established under subsection (e);\n       (2) the term ``Program'' means the Emergency Steel \n     Guaranteed Loan Program established under subsection (d);

and\n       (C) has experienced layoffs, production losses, or \n     financial losses since the beginning of the steel import \n     crisis, after January 1, 1998.\n       (d) Establishment of Emergency Steel Guaranteed Loan \n     Program.--There is established the Emergency Steel Guaranteed \n     Loan Program, to be administered by the Board, the purpose of \n     which is to provide loan guarantees to qualified steel \n     companies in accordance with this section.\n       (e) Loan Guarantee Board Membership.--There is established \n     a Loan Guarantee Board, which shall be composed of--\n       (1) the Secretary of Commerce, who shall serve as Chairman \n     of the Board;\n       (2) the Secretary of Labor;

PRIOR CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL FOR SUPPORTING \n                   ADMISSION OF CHINA INTO THE WTO.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the United States may not support the admission of the \n     People's Republic of China as a member of the World Trade \n     Organization unless a provision of law is passed by both \n     Houses of Congress and enacted into law after the enactment \n     of this Act that specifically allows the United States to \n     support such admission.\n       (b) Procedures for Congressional Approval of United States \n     Support for Admission of China Into the WTO.--\n       (1) Notification of congress.--The President shall notify \n     the Congress in writing if the President determines that the \n     United States should support the admission of the People's \n     Republic of China into the World Trade Organization.\n       (2) Support of china's admission into the wto.--The United \n     States may support the admission of the People's Republic of \n     China into the World Trade Organization if a joint resolution \n     is enacted into law under subsection (c) and the Congress \n     adopts and transmits the joint resolution to the President \n     before the end of the 90-day period (excluding any day \n     described in section 154(b) of the Trade Act of 1974), \n     beginning on the date on which the Congress receives the \n     notification referred to in paragraph (1).\n       (c) Joint Resolution.--\n       (1) Joint resolution.--For purposes of this section, the \n     term ``joint resolution'' means only a joint resolution of \n     the 2 Houses of Congress, the matter after the resolving \n     clause of which is as follows: ``That the Congress approves \n     the support of the United States for the admission of the \n     People's Republic of China into the World Trade \n     Organization.''.\n       (2) Procedures.--\n       (A) In general.--A joint resolution may be introduced at \n     any time on or after the date on which the Congress receives \n     the notification referred to in subsection (b)(1), and before \n     the end of the 90-day period referred to in subsection \n     (b)(2). A joint resolution may be introduced in either House \n     of the Congress by any member of such House.\n       (B) Application of section 152.--Subject to the provisions \n     of this subsection, the provisions of subsections (b), (d), \n     (e), and (f) of section 152 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 \n     U.S.C. 2192(b), (d), (e), and (f)) apply to a joint \n     resolution under this section to the same extent as such \n     provisions apply to resolutions under section 152.\n       (C) Discharge of committee.--If the committee of either \n     House to which a joint resolution has been referred has not \n     reported it by the close of the 45th day after its \n     introduction (excluding any day described in section 154(b) \n     of the Trade Act of 1974), such committee shall be \n     automatically discharged from further consideration of the \n     joint resolution and it shall be placed on the appropriate \n     calendar.\n       (D) Consideration by appropriate committee.--It is not in \n     order for--\n       (i) the Senate to consider any joint resolution unless it \n     has been reported by the Committee on Finance or the \n     committee has been discharged under subparagraph (C); or\n       (ii) the House of Representatives to consider any joint \n     resolution unless it has been reported by the Committee on \n     Ways and Means or the committee has been discharged under \n     subparagraph (C).\n       (E) Consideration in the house.--A motion in the House of \n     Representatives to proceed to the consideration of a joint \n     resolution may only be made on the second legislative day \n     after the calendar day on which the Member making the motion \n     announces to the House his or her intention to do so.\n\n[[Page S2965]]\n\n       (3) Consideration of second resolution not in order.--It \n     shall not be in order in either the House of Representatives \n     or the Senate to consider a joint resolution (other than a \n     joint resolution received from the other House), if that \n     House has previously adopted a joint resolution under this \n     section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       GRASSLEY AMENDMENT NO. 90\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S. 544, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 29, insert after line 10:\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n                        OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY\n\n                    GENERAL DEPARTMENTAL MANAGEMENT\n\n       For an additional amount for ``general departmental \n     management'', $1,400,000, to reduce the backlog of pending \n     nursing home appeals before the Departmental Appeals Board.\n       On page 42, line 8, strike $3,116,076,000 and insert \n     $3,114,676,000.\n       On page 42, line 9, strike $164,933,000 and insert \n     $163,533,000.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Explanation and Justification\n\n       This amendment provides an additional $1,400,000 for the \n     Department of Health and Human Services Appeals Board. The \n     amendment would require that this sum be used by the Appeals \n     Board to reduce a backlog of appeals by nursing facilities of \n     civil monetary penalties levied by the Health Care Financing \n     Administration for infractions of the Nursing Home Reform Act \n     of 1987.\n       The Department of Health and Human Services Departmental \n     Appeals Board hears and decides cases on appeal from program \n     units of the Department. Lack of sufficient resources to \n     handle a rapidly increasing case load has lead to a large \n     backlog of pending cases. The major contributor to this \n     backlog is a substantial increase in appeals of civil \n     monetary penalties levied by HCFA on nursing facilities. \n     Appeals of CMPs have increased at an accelerating rate each \n     year since 1995. The rate of increase has accelerated further \n     since January, 1999, reflecting the enhanced oversight and \n     enforcement of nursing facilities undertaken by HCFA \n     following a Presidential initiative and hearings by the \n     Special Committee on Aging. The backlog of appeals subverts \n     the purpose and effect of civil monetary penalties, delaying \n     corrective action and improvements in the quality of care by \n     nursing facilities. Delay in adjudication of appeals is also \n     a burden to nursing facilities.\n\n\n               administration budget proposal for fy 2000\n\n       The Clinton Administration proposed an increase of $2.8 \n     million for FY 2000 for the Departmental Appeals Board. This \n     amendment would speed up provision of those funds the Appeals \n     Board could effectively use before the end of this fiscal \n     year and thus and permit the Appeals Board to begin \n     immediately to take steps to reduce the backlog of appeals by \n     nursing facilities.\n\n\n      details for departmental appeals board nursing home caseload\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      Closed\n            Year                Cases    Closed no     with     Pending\n                               received   decision   decision\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1996........................        335        101         22        212\n1997........................        441        160         25        468\n1998........................        483        303         22        626\n1999 \\1\\....................        196        117          4       701\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ As of January 22, 1999.\n\n       Note that, although the number of new cases received each \n     year has increased, the number of cases decided has not, \n     indicating lack of resources sufficient to keep up with the \n     increasing annual number of new cases.

Mr. President, I rise today as one of the proud \ncosponsors of S. 629, the Crop Insurance Improvement Act of 1999, \nsponsored by Senator Craig. The issue of crop insurance reform is and \nwill continue to be a primary issue for agriculture this session.\n  The language offered today brings important changes to crop \ninsurance, especially for specialty crops. This bill drastically \nimproves procedures for determining yields and improves the noninsured \ncrop assistance programs. This bill, S. 629, also improves the safety \nnet to producers through cost of production crop insurance coverage.\n  This is another important tool to reform the current crop insurance \nprogram into a risk management program, which will return more of the \neconomic dollar back to the producer. It is vital to find a solution to \nprovide a way for farmers and ranchers to stay in agriculture. They \nmust ultimately regain the responsibility for risk management the \nFederal Government withdrew.\n  To help agricultural producers do that, the Federal Government must \nfix the current crop insurance program and make it one the producer can \nuse as an effective risk management tool. Eventually, I envision a crop \ninsurance program that puts the control in the hands of agricultural \nproducers. It is the Federal Government's role to facilitate a program \nto unite the producer and the private insurance company.\n  It is of utmost importance that we get the producers of this country \nback on track. Crop insurance reform is one sure way to do that. I urge \nmy colleagues here today to consider the positive effect crop insurance \nwill and must have on the farm economy.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator Craig on crop \ninsurance reform. I will have some amendments forthcoming, that I \nbelieve will make this bill even more effective. I also plan to \nintroduce a bill this session that I believe will make even larger \nstrides in the area of crop insurance reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2969-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2969-S2972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DOMESTIC HUNGER\n\n   Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to briefly \ntalk about the problem of hunger in our nation. I would also like to \nplace into the Congressional Record two recent front-page articles from \nthe New York Times, written by Andrew Revkin. These articles provide \nvaluable insight into the growing demand for emergency food assistance \nthat food banks around the country have been facing over the last \ncouple of years.\n  Mr. President, as we approach the beginning of the next century, we \nhave much to be proud of as a nation. The stock market has reached an \nhistoric 10,000 mark. We are in the midst of one of the greatest \neconomic expansions in our nation's history. More Americans own their \nown homes than at any time, and we have the lowest unemployment and \nwelfare caseloads in a generation. Not to mention the fact that for the \nfirst time in three decades, there is a surplus in the federal budget.\n  Yet, there are millions of Americans who go hungry every day. This is \nmorally unacceptable. We must resolve to put an end to the pernicious \noccurrence of hunger in our nation. Hunger is not a Democrat or \nRepublican issue. Hunger is a problem that all Americans should agree \nmust be ended in our nation.\n  While it is true that food stamp and welfare program caseloads are \ndropping, hunger is not. As families try to make the transition from \nwelfare to work, too many are falling out and being left behind. And \ntoo often, it is our youth who is feeling the brunt of this, as one out \nof every five people lining up at soup kitchens is a child.\n  Second Harvest, the nation's largest hunger relief charity, \ndistributed more than one billion pounds of food to an estimated 26 \nmillion low-income Americans last year through their network of \nregional food banks. These food banks provide food and grocery products \nto nearly fifty thousand local charitable feeding programs--food \nshelves, pantries, soup kitchens and emergency shelters.\n  Just as demand is rising at local hunger relief agencies, too many \npantries and soup kitchens are being forced to turn needy people away \nbecause the request for their services exceeds available food. Today I \nenter into the record stories detailing some of the problems that these \nlocal hunger relief agencies, as chronicled in the New York Times.\n  Last December, Peter Clavelle, Mayor of Burlington, Vermont, released \nthe U.S. Conference of Mayors Annual Survey of Hunger and Homelessness. \nThe Mayors reported that demand for hunger relief services grew 14 \npercent last year. Additionally, 21 percent of requests for emergency \nfood are estimated to have gone unmet. This is the highest rate of \nunmet need by\n\n[[Page S2970]]\n\nemergency food providers since the recession of the early 1990s. And \nthis is not just a problem of the inner cities. According to the Census \nBureau, hunger and poverty are growing faster in the suburbs than \nanywhere else in America. In my own state of Vermont, one in ten people \nis ``food insecure,'' according to government statistics. That is, of \ncourse, just a clinical way to say they are hungry or at risk of \nhunger.\n\n  Under the leadership of Deborah Flateman, the Vermont Food Bank in \nSouth Barre distributes food to approximately 240 private social \nservice agencies throughout the state to help hungry and needy \nVermonters. Just last week, the thousands of Vermonters who receive \nfood from the Food Bank came perilously close to finding out what life \nwould be like without its support, when the roof of the Food Bank's \nmain warehouse collapsed. Though the warehouse was destroyed, the need \nfor food was not, and the Vermont Food Bank is continuing its operation \nwhile being temporarily housed in a former nursing home. I applaud the \nefforts of Deborah and all of the workers and volunteers of the Food \nBank who are persevering over this huge obstacle and are keeping food \non the table for many hungry Vermonters.\n  The local food shelves and emergency kitchens which receive food from \nthe Vermont Food Bank clearly are on the front-line against hunger. And \nwhat they are seeing is very disturbing--one in four seeking hunger \nrelief is a child under the age of 17. Elderly people make up more than \na third of all emergency food recipients. We cannot continue to allow \nso many of our youngest and oldest citizens face the prospect of hunger \non a daily basis.\n  Perhaps the most troubling statistic about hunger in Vermont is that \nin 45 percent of the households that receive charitable food \nassistance, one or more adults are working. Nationwide, working poor \nhouseholds represent more than one-third of all emergency food \nrecipients. These are people in Vermont and across the U.S. who are \nworking, paying taxes and contributing to the economic growth of our \nnation, but are reaping few of the rewards.\n  Of the many problems that we face as a nation, hunger is one that is \nentirely solvable. It is my hope that my colleagues will read these \narticles, and that this body can then begin to take serious action \nduring the 106th Congress, especially as we embark upon the fiscal year \n2000 budget process, to end domestic hunger.\n  I ask that the two articles from the New York Times, dated February \n26, and February 27, 1999 be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 27, 1999]\n\n     As Demand for Food Donations Grows, Supplies Steadily Dwindle\n\n                         (By Andrew C. Revkin)\n\n       Ron Taritas was sitting in his office on the lake front in \n     Chicago, phone in hand, dialing for donations. He was not \n     having a very good day.\n       As one of four full-time brokers at Second Harvest, the \n     country's largest nonprofit clearinghouse for donations to \n     soup kitchens and food pantries, Taritas has the job of \n     reeling in the grocery industry's castoffs--the mislabeled \n     cans, outdated cartons and unpopular brands that will never \n     make it to supermarket shelves.\n       But eight hours into this day, his best catch was 4,000 \n     cases of Puffed Wheat, Raisin Bran, Honey Smacks and other \n     cereals. Beyond that, all he had to show for his work was 32 \n     cases of chocolate-crunch energy bars from a warehouse in \n     Honolulu, 500 cases of bottled spring water from Tucson, \n     Ariz., and 5,000 cases of Cremora from Columbus, Ohio.\n       ``Some days,'' Taritas said, ``it's like catching smoke.''\n       These are anxious times at Second Harvest, the hub of \n     America's sprawling system of church-basement soup kitchens \n     and food pantries.\n       Over nearly two decades, that network has expanded to serve \n     more than $1 billion worth of food each year to 20 million \n     Americans. But now, as changes in welfare policy push many \n     people away from the public dole, private charity is lagging \n     even further behind in its efforts to feed the lengthening \n     lines.\n       Part of the problem, by the charities' account, is rising \n     demand on a system that was never really able to keep up in \n     the first place. Last year, Second Harvest calculated that it \n     would have to double the flow of food to supply everyone \n     seeking help.\n       But the supply side has begun to hit hard times, too. Most \n     troubling to the charities is the cooling of their \n     traditional symbiotic relationship with America's food-making \n     giants, in which millions of tons of surplus food products \n     has flowed to people in need.\n       From the first, the key to that relationship was the \n     industry's propensity for waste--and the charities' eagerness \n     to make it go away, gracefully. But in the streamlining \n     spirit of business in the late 1990's, the food makers are \n     simply making fewer errors. And so there is less surplus food \n     to pass along.\n       These days, a mantra of grocery manufacturers is ``zero \n     defects.'' Chicken not good enough for cutlets is pressed \n     into nuggets; scraps not good enough for nuggets are \n     pulverized into pet food. Sales figures from checkout \n     scanners are fed daily to manufacturers, allowing factories \n     to fine-tune their output to match demand.\n       And in the last few years, heaps of dented or out-of-date \n     cans and cartons have become the basis for an estimated $2 \n     billion-a-year market in ``unsalable'' food. Instead of being \n     donated, damaged goods are exported to developing countries \n     or resold at sharp discounts in suburban flea markets, \n     unlicensed stores in rural areas or warehouse-style outlets.\n       Certainly, the grocery makers still turn out a lot of \n     surplus food. But over the last three years, after rising \n     steadily for more than 15 years, the donations that are the \n     core of Second Harvest's business have fallen 10 percent. And \n     while a glut of pork and the Asian economic crisis allowed \n     the Federal Government to kick in an unexpected burst of \n     unsold meat and produce last year, demand is increasingly \n     outstripping supply.\n       Although the drop is not enormous, it has already begun to \n     reverberate across the far-flung charity network. From Second \n     Harvest to the regional food banks and then down to the local \n     outlets, the charities have been forced to devise all manner \n     of new strategies to keep the food coming. They are cutting \n     new deals with the grocery makers. They are reaching out to \n     farmers and fishermen. Mainly, they are spending more of \n     their time and scant money chasing additional, but smaller, \n     donations from local sources instead of big corporations.\n       Some food pantries and soup kitchens remain relatively \n     flush. But across the country, thousands of others are \n     cutting hours, limiting the size and frequency of handouts, \n     rationing coveted items like hot dogs and peanut butter and \n     seeking unorthodox supplements like road-killed deer, \n     according to state and local surveys and Second Harvest \n     reports. Some are even having to turn people away.\n       Last year, half the food charities in New York City cut the \n     size of handouts at least part of the year, according to a \n     survey by the New York City Coalition Against Hunger, a \n     private group. Largely for lack of food, the coalition has \n     begun counseling churches and synagogues against setting up \n     new pantries and soup kitchens.\n       At the end of the emergency-food chain--the men, women and \n     children standing in line at the church-basement door--that \n     faltering flow of donations is calling into question the \n     notion that private charity should, and can, soften the sting \n     of losing public entitlements. These days, a lot of people in \n     the food-banking business are worrying that a system created \n     as a supplement to public aid is turning out to be an \n     increasingly ineffective substitute for it.\n\n\n       the charity network: source in a crisis is now a mainstay\n\n       Twenty-five years ago, the only food bank in New Jersey was \n     Kathleen DiChiara, a homemaker from Summit who carted canned \n     goods in her station wagon from food drives at churches to \n     people in need. Around the country, food pantries and soup \n     kitchens were almost unknown beyond Skid Row.\n       But as the deep recession of the early 1980's took hold, \n     followed by the budget cuts of the Reagan era, growing \n     numbers of people found themselves without adequate food. \n     Dozens, and then hundreds, of soup kitchens and food pantries \n     sprouted where none had been seen since the Depression.\n       Even so, Ms. DiChiara recalled, there was always a feeling \n     that the crisis would pass: Congress would restore money for \n     social programs; the economy would revive.\n       But while the economy rebounded and Congress provided \n     relief for the poor, the demand for food handouts grew, along \n     with the charity network. And by the late 1980's, people in \n     the food-banking business had begun to realize that they were \n     becoming a fixture on the American landscape--more a \n     secondary safety net than an emergency source of food.\n       Today, Ms. DiChiara runs one of the biggest food-banking \n     operations in the country, the Community Food Bank of New \n     Jersey, with a fleet of trucks that each month distributes a \n     million pounds of food out of a 280,000-square-foot \n     warehouse. New York City, which had only three dozen pantries \n     and soup kitchens in 1980, had 600 in 1992 and now has about \n     1,100. Across the nation, the food network is more than \n     40,000 soup kitchens and food pantries strong, with more than \n     3,000 paid employees and 900,000 volunteers.\n       Almost from the beginning, the food network formed a tight \n     alliance with grocery manufacturers. The charities offered a \n     perfect outlet, allowing manufacturers and stores to dispose \n     of damaged or unsold goods, cut dumping costs, gain tax \n     breaks and get some good publicity along the way.\n       Soon, the relationship was institutionalized in formal \n     agreements, and food company executives joined the boards of \n     Second Harvest and its regional food banks.\n       But all along, there was a queasy feeling that this cozy, \n     co-dependent relationship could not last. Sooner or later, \n     the food\n\n[[Page S2971]]\n\n     bankers knew, they would begin to pay for their reliance on \n     the industry's prodigal past.\n       Soon after Thomas Debrowski became head of operations for \n     the Pillsbury Company in 1991, the community relations people \n     walked into his office in Minneapolis and presented him with \n     records of the regular annual donation of several million \n     pounds of flawed or unsold food to Second Harvest.\n       ``They wanted to know if we wanted to increase it,'' \n     Debrowski recalls. ``I said, `Increase? My objective is to \n     give them nothing next year.' ''\n       To an executive charged with burnishing the bottom line, in \n     a business climate where everyone was on the prowl for \n     greater efficiencies, the idea that millions of pounds of \n     food was either failing inspection or going stale in \n     warehouses was not acceptable. And before long, like most of \n     the big food companies, Pillsbury instituted economies up and \n     down the production line.\n       On the line for Green Giant Niblets brand corn, where \n     workers once picked out discolored kernels by hand, \n     electronic eyes now detect the rejects, and a puff of air \n     blasts the offending kernel from the conveyer belt.\n       Shipping containers that tended to be crushed have been \n     redesigned.\n       At a Minute Maid Hi-C fruit punch plant in Wharton, N.J., \n     the process has been streamlined so that the raw ingredients \n     arrive just 6 to 10 hours before a batch of juice is \n     packaged, maintaining freshness and reducing the chance of a \n     bad run. Where previously juice was not tested for quality \n     until it had been canned, continual checks are now made for \n     factors like sweetness, flavor, color and vitamin content \n     right on the assembly line.\n       Improvements in marketing have paralleled those in \n     manufacturing.\n       In the wasteful old days, new products were tested \n     according to the Darwinian laws of the marketplace: A company \n     would blanket the nation with the various new snack foods, \n     for example, knowing that some were sure to fail. Only the \n     fittest survived. The rest ended up in somebody's food bank.\n       Now, instead of ``pushing'' products out into the market, \n     as industry argot would have it, the focus is on having them \n     ``pulled'' into stores.\n       That means doing research to gauge consumer interests, \n     testing products in carefully dissected markets before \n     distributing them widely and tailoring production to sales. \n     The result is far fewer stacks of failed experiments and \n     formerly fashionable foods, like the oat bran cookies and \n     muffins that became a staple at the nation's food banks after \n     the fad faded in the early 90's.\n       Over all, what this means is that after rising steadily \n     until 1995, when they reached 285 million pounds, annual \n     donations from the big national food companies dropped to 259 \n     million pounds in 1998.\n       To a certain extent, the food charities had become their \n     own worst enemy by making waste so identifiable, said Janet \n     E. Poppendieck, a Hunter College sociologist and author of a \n     new book, ``Sweet Charity: Emergency Food and the End of \n     Entitlement'' (Viking Press, 1998).\n       ``No firm is going to continue to put labels on jars upside \n     down so that there will be peanut butter at the food bank,'' \n     she said.\n\n\n          `banana box deals': new competition for flawed goods\n\n       At the supermarket, the can or carton of soup or cereal \n     that still fails to sell, or is dented after falling off a \n     truck or store shelf, remains the biggest single source of \n     food for the charity pipeline.\n       Now, in a shift that has the companies and the charities \n     alarmed, more and more of these products are finding their \n     way back out to paying customers.\n       Over the last decade, a host of ``reclamation centers'' \n     have evolved as a way for supermarket chains to tally damage \n     and charge manufacturers for losses. At the centers, leaky \n     packages are thrown out, and any usable products are repacked \n     in the rectangular cartons in which bananas are shipped. Some \n     are donated to Second Harvest, particularly if the \n     manufacturer requested that option. But, more and more, the \n     cans and cartons are sold, at pennies on the dollar, to \n     wholesalers who sell them yet again.\n       One recent posting on a Web site for salvaged goods, by a \n     Massachusetts company called I-ADA Merchandise Marketing, \n     made this offer: ``Eight trailer loads of food from one of \n     the leading department store chains in the U.S.A. All food is \n     in date and has been gone through to discard any unmarketable \n     merchandise. This is super clean merchandise. Packed in \n     banana boxes. All boxes are full. You will not find a \n     better banana box deal!!!!!''\n       In this trade, Second Harvest sees competition for a scarce \n     resource. Companies like Lipton, Campbell Soup and Quaker \n     Oats find themselves in a tug of war with their retailers \n     over control of this damaged merchandise. With brand names \n     they have nurtured for decades, the manufacturers fear \n     liability and loss of consumer loyalty if a flea market \n     shopper becomes ill after eating one of their products on \n     this largely unregulated market. For their part, the \n     retailers say the goods are their property to dispose of as \n     they wish.\n       So far, this emerging market has not significantly slowed \n     the flow of donated damaged goods to charities, but staff \n     members at several large food charities project that it will. \n     Indeed, clearly threatened by this booming trade, Second \n     Harvest this year said it would enter the salvage business \n     itself, offering to provide a secure final resting spot of \n     damaged goods, distributing usable items only through its \n     charity network and destroying anything that cannot be used.\n\n\n           reinventing the deal: factory runs for the hungry\n\n       Second Harvest and smaller food charities are trying a host \n     of other strategies as they scurry to keep goods on charity \n     shelves.\n       ``Everyone knew the charities were going to be expected to \n     do more now,'' Ms. DiChiara said. ``What I'm finding is that \n     we're expected to do more with less.''\n       Until two years ago, Golden Grain, a pasta maker, donated \n     thousands of pounds of noodles each month to the Greater \n     Chicago Food Depository, the second largest food bank in the \n     Second Harvest network. But donations fell after the company \n     figured out how to grind up substandard pasta and feed it \n     back through its machines, said the food bank's executive \n     director, Michael P. Mulqueen.\n       Ultimately, the food bank and the pasta maker came up with \n     a way to compensate for lost donations by running the factory \n     at times of low market demand to create noodles just for the \n     food bank, Mulqueen said. Pillsbury's Thomas Debrowski \n     instituted a similar practice several years ago, and Minute \n     Maid has begun making juice for Second Harvest. Some other \n     companies, like Kraft, have shifted to cash donations.\n       Charities are also approaching farmers to scavenge leftover \n     crops, conducting the Biblical ``second harvest'' for which \n     the national group is named. The Clinton Administration last \n     year announced plans for an ambitious campaign to glean some \n     of the mountains of imperfect produce that now go to waste \n     each year.\n       And last year, Second Harvest began distributing tons of \n     Pacific Northwest fish that is caught in nets but cannot be \n     sold because of Federal regulations controlling some fish \n     stocks. The program, created with Northwest Food Strategies, \n     a nonprofit group in Seattle, now sends frozen salmon, \n     halibut and other fish around the country.\n       As always, canned-food drives by scouting groups and \n     religious congregations are being employed, but they provide \n     a fraction of the total flow, and the assortment of goods \n     often does not contain the foods that are most needed--stew \n     or cereal and the like.\n       At the Neighbor to Neighbor food pantry in Greenwich, \n     Conn., there is a ``gourmet section,'' which recently \n     contained goose liver pate, lemon curd and bamboo shoots.\n       Over all, experience has produced a discouraging sense at \n     Second Harvest and other food banks that whenever they \n     identify a new source of food, it seems to dry up.\n       ``You peck away,'' said James Barone, who is in charge of \n     procuring supplies for Food for Survival, the main New York \n     city food bank. ``And it's a constant battle.''\n       For several years, trucks and crews from Food for Survival \n     have toured the Hunt's Point produce market in the Bronx each \n     morning after the supermarkets or other retailers have bought \n     their supply for the day, seeking donations of overripe \n     tomatoes or wilted lettuce or whatever else is left.\n       But the city's greengrocers appear to have noticed, and \n     they often now wait until the end of the morning sales \n     period, then offer cash, at a lower-than-usual price, for \n     goods that might once have found their way into the charity \n     system.\n\n\n            limits on Charity: Bare Cupboards and Saying No\n\n       At the food pantry in the basement of St. Raymond's Roman \n     Catholic Church in the Parkchester section of the Bronx, the \n     impact of the irregular flow of goods is apparent as soon as \n     you walk in the door.\n       There is the large sign on a bulletin board: ``Alert. This \n     food pantry is experiencing shortages. We reserve the right \n     to limit quantities, limit the number of visits, extend the \n     time between visits at any time and without prior notice.''\n       And there are the plastic bags of canned goods, rice and \n     cereal handed out to a steady stream of old people, young \n     women and a few young men. These days, the volunteers making \n     up the grocery bags have less to choose from, because of a \n     backlog of orders at Food for Survival.\n       Even basics like bread and juice are lacking lately, said \n     Priscilla DiNapoli, the program's paid coordinator. When the \n     Kellogg's Corn Flakes run out, as they inevitably do, the \n     workers hand out Department of Agriculture crisp rice cereal \n     printed with a message encouraging users to extend their \n     other meals with cereal.\n       The flow of food was not coming close to keeping pace with \n     rising demand, as many as 1,500 clients a month, Ms. DiNapoli \n     said. So last spring, instead of letting people return every \n     two weeks, the agency began limiting them to one visit a \n     month, she said. ``We just don't have the food.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 25, 1999]\n\n              Plunge in Use of Food Stamps Causes Concern\n\n                         (By Andrew C. Revkin)\n\n       The nation's food stamp rolls have dropped by one-third in \n     four years, leading to a growing concern that the decline is \n     caused partly by needy people's hesitance to apply for \n     benefits.\n       A vibrant economy is clearly a major reason that the number \n     of people using food stamps fell to fewer than 19 million \n     last November, from nearly 28 million people four years \n     earlier. But some in Congress, at the Agriculture Department, \n     which administer\n\n[[Page S2972]]\n\n     the food stamp program, and at private poverty groups say \n     they feel that a significant number of people are not seeking \n     help even though they still lack food and are eligible.\n       Some officials say they believe that stringent rules \n     intended to put welfare recipients to work and reduce the \n     welfare rolls may have also discourage people from seeking \n     food stamps.\n       Some states and cities seeking to cut welfare rolls \n     aggressively, for example, require applicants to search a \n     month or more for a job before they can get benefits of any \n     kind. Often, official say, people in need of emergency food \n     aid simply walk out the door.\n       ``The goal was to get people off welfare programs, but \n     people may have failed to understand that the food stamp \n     program is not a welfare program,'' said Shirley R. Watkins, \n     the Under Secretary of Agriculture for food, nutrition and \n     consumer service. ``It's nutritional assistance.''\n       In other cases, Ms. Watkins and other officials say, it may \n     simply be the rising stigma surrounding public aid of all \n     sorts that is keeping people from applying for food aid, the \n     officials say.\n       The notion that too many people have abandoned food stamps \n     has caused a flurry of activity at the Agriculture \n     Department.\n       The department recently commissioned a study to understand \n     a simultaneous rise in the demand on private food charities \n     like church-basement food pantries and soup kitchens. The \n     goal is to determine if some of these charity seekers are \n     asking for handouts at private charities because they have \n     lost access to public food aid, agriculture officials said.\n       Obtaining food stamps requires a simple showing of \n     financial need, unlike other Federal benefits with more \n     stringent regulations and requirements.\n       Medicaid has similar broad eligibility, and it too has \n     recorded a similar unexplained drop in its rolls. Some \n     officials have said that while this drop, too, can be \n     attributed partly to the economy, some may also be the result \n     of recipients believing, inaccurately, that once they are \n     removed from welfare rolls, they are also ineligible for \n     Medicaid.\n       Ms. Watkins said there were indications from states like \n     Wisconsin that some people leaving welfare for low-wage work \n     are not continuing to seek food stamps that could help them \n     make it through the month.\n       Her misgivings are shared by some members of Congress from \n     both sides of the aisle.\n       It is becoming apparent that the welfare reforms of 1996 \n     did not anticipate how tightly access to food stamps was \n     linked to access to welfare, said Representative Nancy L. \n     Johnson, Republican of Connecticut and chairwoman of the \n     House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources.\n       ``We do think there's a problem here,'' Mrs. Johnson said. \n     ``We need to see why state systems don't seem to capture the \n     food-stamp eligible population very well.\n       ``When you make a big change in one system it's going to \n     have ramifications for other systems,'' Mrs. Johnson said. \n     ``Some are positive. If people aren't getting food stamps \n     because they're making more money, that's a good thing.''\n       She said her committee was planning to hold hearings on the \n     matter this year.\n       So far analysts have been able to gauge only roughly how \n     many eligible people have left the food stamp program even \n     though they need the aid. Last year, for example, the \n     Congressional Budget Office calculated that 2.9 million such \n     people left the food stamp rolls from 1994 to 1997. The \n     budget office report, a projection of economic conditions \n     through 2008, proposed that the rising stigma and barriers \n     surrounding welfare offices could be driving eligible people \n     away.\n       Whatever the reasons, no one disputes how drastically the \n     program has shrunk, both in the number of people enrolled and \n     in the cost of providing the aid. Since 1994, the cost of the \n     food stamp program has fallen to $18.9 billion from $24.5 \n     billion, according to the Agriculture Department.\n       But some conservative poverty analysts say the drop in food \n     stamp rolls does not indicate a problem. Robert Rector, who \n     studies welfare for the Heritage Foundation, a private group \n     in Washington, said the drop was simply a recovery from a \n     period through the early 1990's when access to food stamps \n     and other assistance became too easy.\n       ``In the late 80's and early 90's you had this notion of \n     one-stop shopping, getting people on as many benefits as you \n     could,'' Mr. Rector said.``A lot of the decline now is \n     hyped.''\n       He said that Congress would do well to make food stamps \n     less readily available, by instituting work requirements and \n     other rules similar to those already imposed on other forms \n     of assistance.\n       But Agriculture Department officials are pushing the states \n     to be sure their welfare offices are in line with Federal \n     rules, which require prompt processing of food stamp \n     applications.\n       On Jan. 29, the administrator of the food stamp program, \n     Samuel Chambers Jr., sent a letter to the commissioners of \n     welfare and food stamp program in every state urging them to \n     review their policies to make sure they do not violate \n     Federal law.\n       Federal officials had been particularly concerned with the \n     situation in New York City, where newly revamped welfare \n     offices, now called job centers, were delaying food stamp \n     applications and often directing applicants to private food \n     pantries instead.\n       After a Federal judge last month ruled that the city food \n     stamp process violated Federal law, the city promised to \n     change its practices.\n       In recent days, the city made another, unrelated policy \n     change that city officials say will trim several thousand \n     people from food stamp rolls. Under the 1996 package of \n     Federal welfare changes, single able-bodied adults can be cut \n     off from food stamps after three months if they do not work \n     at least 20 hours a week or participate in a workfare \n     program.\n       Counties can seek waivers to the work requirement if they \n     have high unemployment rates, and for two years the counties \n     in New York City had all sought the waivers, preserving the \n     food aid.\n       This year, though, the city has chosen not to seek the \n     waivers, so that city residents who are single and able to \n     work must find work or lose their food stamps, said Deborah \n     Sproles, a spokeswoman for the city Human Resources \n     Administration.\n       Yesterday, private groups focused on poverty issues \n     criticized the city's decision, saying it could put as many \n     as 25,000 people at risk of hunger. But, Ms. Sproles said, \n     ``this is part of the city's overall effort to start helping \n     people gain self reliance.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2972-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO MRS.

Throughout her career, Mrs. Kirk \nhas served with distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize her \nmany accomplishments and to commend her for the superb service she has \nprovided the United States Navy and our nation.\n  Mrs. Kirk's retirement on 3 May 1999 will bring to a close almost \nfour decades of dedicated service to the United States Navy. From 1960 \nto 1966, Mrs. Kirk was assigned to the Navy's Personal Affairs \nDivision. From 1966-1968, she was assigned to the Navy's Casualty \nBranch. For the next 31 years of her service, Mrs. Kirk was a member of \nthe Navy Awards Branch, starting as the Assistant Branch Head in 1968 \nand becoming the Branch Head in 1978. Throughout her tenure, she has \nbecome a well-known and beloved figure among the fleet, from seamen to \nadmirals, among veteran organizations, such as the Congressional Medal \nof Honor Society, and individuals, such as survivors of the Pearl \nHarbor attack. She has assisted countless individuals in tracking, \nreinstating or garnering appropriate awards and recognition for their \nservice to their country, during wartime and during peace. The letters \nof gratitude and appreciation she has received over the years for her \ntireless and dogged research on behalf of thousands of sailors and \ntheir families and friends would fill many cabinet drawers. Congressmen \nand women have benefitted from her briefings on the specific details of \nawards for their constituents and heeded her advice. Her opinion on \nNavy awards is honored as golden--decisive and accurate--in the halls \nof Congress as well as the Pentagon.\n  She is a recognized authority on the topic of Navy awards from the \nfirst Congressional Medal of Honor to the most recent new awards, such \nas the NATO medal, which honors the service of more than 45,000 \npersonnel as peacekeepers in Bosnia. As the Executive Agent for the \nDepartment of Defense, she was responsible for inaugurating the Pearl \nHarbor Commemorative Medal to recognize the 50th Anniversary of the \nattack on Pearl Harbor.\n  Mrs. Kirk has been awarded the Superior Civilian Service and \nDistinguished Civilian Service Awards. She is a native of Rectortown, \nVirginia, and currently resides in Middleburg, Virginia.\n  Mrs. Kirk will retire from the Department of the Navy on May 3, 1999, \nafter thirty-eight years of dedicated service.

Mr. President, this bill calls upon the United \nStates to take a momentous step--the deployment of a National Missile \nDefense system--on the basis of one, and only one criterion: \ntechnological feasibility. This bill gives no consideration to the \nramifications of deploying such a system on U.S. security, political \nand diplomatic interests.\n  It is true that missile technology is proliferating more rapidly than \nwe\n\n[[Page S2973]]\n\ncould have predicted. And this is of grave concern to us all. \nCertainly, the proliferation of ballistic missile technology \nconstitutes a serious threat to U.S. national security. The question \nbefore us is, Will deciding today to deploy a National Missile Defense \nsystem--as yet untested, unproven and un-paid for--advance our national \nsecurity interests? The answer, in my view, is that it will not.\n  First, I believe this bill will undermine long-term U.S. national \nsecurity interests, by placing too much emphasis on just one of the \nmany threats we face today.\n  While the United States is enjoying a period of relative safety and \nsecurity in world affairs, we must prepare to face a multitude of \ndiverse challenges in the international security environment in coming \nyears. These include: transnational threats, such as terrorism and drug \ntrafficking; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and the \nchaos of failed states, as we have seen in Somalia and the former \nYugoslavia--just to name a few. The threat from ballistic missiles is \none of many.\n  Ballistic missiles are a threat, because they are capable of \ndelivering weapons of mass destruction to American soil. The United \nStates has faced this threat for decades, posed by the nuclear arsenals \nof the Soviet Union and China. Russia and China maintain their ability \nto strike American soil. But even though both nations are today \nstruggling through a period of great uncertainty, the threat to the \nUnited States of a ballistic missile attack from either nation is low.\n  The threat of a missile attack from a rogue state, such as North \nKorea or Iran, is obviously growing. Last fall, North Korea tested its \nnew Taepo-Dong One missile, with a range of up to 3000 km. We also know \nthe North Koreans are developing a Taepo-Dong Two missile, which could \nhave a range two to three times greater. Pakistan has tested a 1500 km \nrange missile. Iran is expected to have one of similar range in the \nnear future.\n  But ballistic missiles are only one means of delivering weapons of \nmass destruction. Nuclear weapons can be delivered in trucks, ships, \nand suitcases; chemical and biological weapons can be delivered through \nthe mail, dispersed in a crowded subway, or inserted into our water \nsupply. These methods of delivery are far simpler, less costly, and far \nless detectable than ballistic missiles, and they pose a much more \nimmediate threat to U.S. security. A National Missile Defense won't \nprotect us from these threats.\n  The proposed NMD system would only allow us to defend ourselves \nagainst an unsophisticated long-range missile threat with a single \nwarhead. We would not be able to defend against a missile that carried \ndecoys along with the warhead. Multiple objects would readily defeat \nthe proposed system. We would have no defense against a warhead \ncontaining chemical or biological agents divided into many small \n``bomblets'' for better dispersion. This would simply overwhelm the NMD \nsystem. The NMD system would be ineffective against cruise missiles or \nmissiles launched from air or sea platforms.\n  An NMD system also has very limited use as a deterrent to the threats \nwe currently face. In the case of a ballistic missile attack, the \nperpetrator is readily identified, and U.S. retaliation could be swift \nand devastating. That alone is a serious deterrent, a much greater \ndeterrent than a deployed NMD system. Deploying an NMD system would \nsimply encourage potential adversaries to develop appropriate \ncountermeasures or to pursue other, more effective means of attack. It \nis exactly this logic--that an NMD system would be more destabilizing \nthan deterrent--that underpins our commitment to the ABM Treaty.\n  Which brings me to my second point. I oppose this bill because it \nwill undermine decades of U.S. leadership in international efforts to \nreduce the nuclear danger.\n  A unilateral decision by the United States to proceed with a National \nMissile Defense would sound the death knell for the ABM Treaty, a \ndevelopment that is apparently quite welcome to many of my colleagues \nacross the aisle. This is puzzling to me, because a U.S. signal that we \nintend to circumvent, violate or withdraw from the ABM Treaty would \nalmost certainly kill prospects for Russian ratification of START II. \nThis would delay any further reductions in the large remaining Russian \nnuclear force, a goal we have worked for decades to achieve.\n  I would remind my colleagues that, in 1991, the United States--under \nthe leadership of President George Bush--reached agreement with Russia \nthat it would legally succeed to all international treaties of the \nformer Soviet Union. These include the UN Charter, the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty, SALT/START, and others, as well as the ABM \nTreaty. If we refuse to recognize the validity of the ABM Treaty, we \nnot only undermine the credibility of our past commitments to \ninternational arms control agreements--such as the Nuclear Non \nProliferation Treaty--we also weaken U.S. leadership in future \ninternational efforts to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  If we proceed with this legislation and deal a blow to international \narms control efforts, we will have succeeded in fostering precisely the \nthreats we intend to reduce. And furthermore, we can encourage this \nthreat without ever deploying an NMD system, simply by establishing our \nintention to deploy an NMD system.\n  Finally, I have deep concerns about the technical feasibility, \noperational effectiveness and costs of the proposed NMD system.\n  I have consistently supported development of effective missile \ndefense technology, and continue to do so. In particular, I have \nsupported the development and deployment of effective theater missile \ndefense systems, to protect our forces and our regional allies. But we \nhave encountered tremendous technological challenges in trying to build \ndefenses against these theater missile systems. We have spent billions \nof dollars and experienced many failures in our efforts to ``hit a \nbullet with a bullet.'' The THAAD system has experienced five \nsuccessive failures. Yet, THAAD is much simpler to develop than NMD.\n  On cost, the Administration's FY 2000 budget request calls for an \nadditional $6.6 billion in new funding for National Missile Defense. \nThis would bring total FY 1999 - 2005 funding for NMD to $10.5 billion. \nBut the Defense Department does not anticipate that we will be able to \ntest key components of the proposed system until 2003. If we encounter \nproblems with this system that are the least bit similar to those we \nhave seen in testing THAAD, we can expect delays well beyond the \nprojected deployment date of 2005--and costs far above the $10.5 \nbillion we are currently contemplating. And, while I have every \nconfidence that American technological know-how will eventually produce \na feasible system, I wonder: At what cost, and with how much real \nbenefit to our national security, will this technological marvel be \nachieved?\n  In addition to the financial costs of deploying a feasible NMD \nsystem, we must also acknowledge the opportunity costs that pursuing \nthis project will entail. America's leadership in world affairs relies \non ready military forces. And the fact is, if we dedicate tens of \nbillions of dollars to developing a National Missile Defense system, we \nwill not be able to devote the resources and energy we should to \nensuring the long-term readiness of America's fighting forces. At a \ntime when the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff have publicly and repeatedly expressed their concerns over our \nability to attract and keep bright young men and women in the U.S. \narmed forces, I am not convinced that we should move NMD to the top of \nour list of defense priorities.\n  With so much at stake, it would be irresponsible for us today to \ncommit to the deployment of a National Missile Defense system, without \nfurther consideration of the implications and potential consequences of \nthat commitment. We must not devote these resources to defending \nagainst the wrong threat with the wrong system. We must not create a \nworld where weapons of mass destruction proliferate because arms \ncontrol agreements are no longer credible. And we must not become so \nfocused on this one defense issue that we leave our nation defenseless \nagainst other, more imminent threats.\n  Mr. President, this legislation poses tremendous risks to our long-\nterm national security interests.\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2972-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2972-S2974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n Mr. KERRY.

LUTHER'S 3RD GRADE CLASS AT BEACHWOOD ELEMENTARY\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a truly \noutstanding feat by a 3rd grade class in Fort Lewis, Washington. Mr. \nChris Luther's 3rd grade class at Beachwood Elementary School has not \nmissed a spelling word on their weekly spelling tests for 25 weeks. \nNearly a month ago, as my colleagues may remember, I announced an \n``Innovation in Education Award'' program to recognize the important \nrole individuals and communities play in the education of America's \nstudents. This class and their teacher, Mr. Luther, are perfect \nexamples of this principle in action.\n  This is a classroom of average kids, all with different backgrounds \nand abilities. Yet, Mr. Luther has found a way to encourage and tutor \nthese students so they are all accomplishing equally praiseworthy work. \nThe key has not been some magical formula rather, the success of these \nstudents comes from a concerted effort by Mr. Luther to boost their \nself-esteem, to enhance their memory skills, and to impress upon every \nchild in the classroom that learning is important. Those strategies \ncombined with the individual effort of each of his students has clearly \npaid off.\n  Mr. Luther's creativity to engage his students in learning extends \nfar beyond spelling. Each year, he produces a ``Math Relay'' that \ninvolves some 2000 students from 88 local schools. This remarkable \ngathering combines physical activity and competition with math \nquestions and answers. Not only does the size of the event speak highly \nof its success but, the fact that Mr. Luther handles the mind-boggling \nlogistics of an event this size himself is further cause for \nrecognizing this fine educator.\n  I applaud Mr. Luther's initiative, creativity and ability to \nencourage his students to succeed. It is the work of educators like Mr. \nLuther and the efforts of students like those in Mr. Luther's 3rd grade \nclass who are making education work across America. That is why it is \nmy pleasure to recognize Mr. Luther and his third grade class for their \naccomplishments and it is why I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting local educators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2974-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE TALIBAN'S ABUSE OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, yesterday, Senator Brownback and I \nintroduced a resolution, S. Res. 68, condemning the treatment of Afghan \nwomen and girls by the Taliban. I hope my colleagues will join us in \ncondemning the systematic human rights violations that are being \ncommitted against women and girls in that war-torn nation.\n  The Taliban militia seized control of most of Afghanistan in 1996 and \nnow control about 90 percent of the country, including the capital, \nKabul. This group imposes an extreme interpretation of Islam practiced \nno where else in the world on all individuals. It is especially \nrepressive on women.\n  Before the Taliban assumed control of much of Afghanistan, women were \nhighly involved in public life. They held positions in the government \nand worked as doctors, lawyers, nurses, and teachers. The picture could \nnot be more different today. Today, under Taliban rule women in \nAfghanistan are denied even the most basic human rights: they cannot \nwork outside the home, attend school, or even wear shoes that make \nnoise when they walk. They must wear a head-to-toe covering called a \nburqa, which allows only a tiny opening to see and breathe through. \nParents cannot teach their daughters to read, or take their little \ngirls to be treated by male doctors. Mr. President, women have been \nstoned to death, beaten, and otherwise abused for ``breaking'' these \nharsh laws.\n  The Physicians for Human Rights recently conducted a study of 160 \nwomen in Afghanistan and their findings are horrific. One of those \nwomen, a 20 year-old woman interviewed in Kabul had the following \nstory:\n\n       Eight months ago, my two-and-a-half year old daughter died \n     from diarrhea. She was refused treatment by the first \n     hospital that we took her to. The second hospital mistreated \n     her [they refused to provide intravenous fluids and \n     antibiotics because of their Hazara ethnicity, according to \n     the respondent]. Her body was handed to me and her father in \n     the middle of the night. With her body in my arms, we left \n     the hospital. It was curfew time and we had a long way to get \n     home. We had to spend the night inside a destroyed house \n     among the rubble. In the morning we took my dead baby home \n     but we had no money for her funeral.\n\n  The study found that 77 percent of women had poor access to health \ncare in Kabul, while another 20 percent reported no access at all. Of \nthose surveyed, 71 percent reported a decline in their physical \ncondition over the last two years. In addition, there was also a \nsignificant decline in the mental health of the women surveyed. Of the \nparticipants, 81 percent reported a decline in their mental condition; \n97 percent met the diagnostic criteria for depression; 86 percent \nshowed symptoms of anxiety; 42 percent met the diagnostic criteria for \npost-traumatic stress disorder; and 21 percent reported having suicidal \nthoughts ``extremely often'' or ``quite often.'' In addition, 53 \npercent of women described occasions in which they were seriously ill \nand unable to seek medical care. 28 percent of the Afghan women \nreported inadequate control over their own reproduction.\n  S. Res. 68 calls on the President of the United States to prevent a \nTaliban-led government of Afghanistan from taking a seat in the United \nNations General Assembly, so long as these gross violations of human \nrights persist.\n  Our resolution also urges the Administration not to recognize any \ngovernment in Afghanistan which does not take actions to achieve the \nfollowing goals: effective participation of women in all civil, \neconomic, and social life; the right of women to work; the right of \nwomen and girls to an education without discrimination and the \nreopening of schools to women and girls at all levels of education; the \nfreedom of movement of women and girls; equal access of women and girls \nto health care; equal access of women and girls to humanitarian aid.\n  Mr. President, I am shocked that women and girls in Afghanistan are \nsuffering under these conditions as we approach the 21st Century. The \nUnited States has an obligation to take the lead in condemning these \nabuses.\n  I want to thank Senator Brownback for joining me in introducing this \nlegislation. He has been a strong voice for human rights and I know \nthat he shares my passion for seeing an end to these abuses in \nAfghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2974-3", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2974-S2975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RESOLUTION TO COMMEND SENATOR J. ROBERT KERREY\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators \nDaschle and Edwards and the other cosponsors of this resolution \ncommending our friend and colleague Bob Kerrey on the 30th anniversary \nof the events giving rise to his receiving the Medal of Honor.\n  During my tenure as Secretary of the Navy, I had the honor and \nprivilege of working with a great many brave men and women--citizens of \nall stripes who were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to serve \ntheir country. One especially courageous naval officer was Lieutenant \n(j.g.) Joseph Robert Kerrey.\n  Thirty years ago last Sunday in Vietnam, Bob Kerrey lead a SEAL team \nmission aimed at capturing certain Viet Cong leaders. While leading \nthis dangerous mission, he was badly wounded as a grenade exploded at \nhis feet. Despite suffering massive injuries from this explosion and \nbeing in a state of near-unconsciousness, Lieutenant Kerrey did not \ngive up. He continued to lead his men, ordering them to secure and \ndefend an extraction site.\n  For his heroism in combat, Lieutenant Kerrey was awarded the \nCongressional Medal of Honor. And just what is this award? It is the \nhighest award for valor in action that can be bestowed upon a member of \nthe armed forces.\n  The Medal of Honor was created in the days of the Civil War through \nlegislation sponsored by Senator James Grimes, chairman of the Senate \nNaval Committee, with the support of Navy Secretary Gideon Wells and \nPresident Abraham Lincoln. At that time, although serving in the \nmilitary was required of all men, it had become clear that some \nservicemembers went ``above and beyond the call of duty.''\n  So, the first two hundred medals were presented to those who \ndistinguished themselves in the Civil War by their gallantry in action \nand other\n\n[[Page S2975]]\n\nqualities. Less than thirty-five hundred medals have been authorized to \ndate, and just 158 are living today.\n  One of those 158 living recipients is a colleague of ours here in the \nSenate--a colleague I will surely miss upon my retirement. I think all \nSenators, and indeed all Americans, ought to take this moment to \nrecognize Bob Kerrey's heroic action on that day in 1969, when he \ndisplayed immense bravery in the face of overwhelming adversity.\n  Today--thirty years later--Bob Kerrey continues to exhibit the kind \nof dedication and honor that earned him the Medal of Honor. Just one \nexample of Senator Kerrey's distinction as a Senator is the countless \nhours he had devoted to curbing the politically popular entitlement \nprograms that have contributed so greatly to our staggering national \ndebt. Taking on this issue isn't the easiest thing for an elected \nofficial to do--it is a task fraught with political danger. But Bob \nKerrey knows that it's the right thing to do for our nation, and that \nis why he continues to persevere.\n  My colleagues here today will provide numerous other examples of Bob \nKerry's accomplishments as a U.S. Senator. Given his heroism during my \ntenure as Navy Secretary, these accomplishments come as no surprise. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of this resolution, and thank Senators \nDaschle and Edwards for their leadership in bringing it to the Senate \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2975-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2975-S2976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE ACT\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss yesterday's \noverwhelming Senate vote in favor of the National Missile Defense Act \nof 1999. I was pleased to join with many of my colleagues in support of \nthis legislation that will help to ensure that the United States does \neverything it can to defend itself from the threat of limited ballistic \nmissile launches, both accidental and intentional. This legislation, \nwhich makes it the policy of the United States to deploy an effective \nnational missile defense when technologically possible, takes an \nimportant first step toward providing a significant defense for all \ncitizens of the United States against limited ballistic missile \nattacks.\n  As most of my colleagues know, today, the United States faces a \nserious, credible, and growing threat from limited ballistic missiles \nthat could potentially carry nuclear, biological or chemical payloads. \nThis new threat is not from Russia, our partner in many important arms \ncontrol agreements. Instead, this threat comes from the increasing \nproliferation of ballistic missile technology. In particular, certain \nrogue states pose the greatest threat as they continue to push for--and \nmake great progress in acquiring--delivery systems that directly \nthreaten the United States. I do not believe that the threat from these \nrogue states, most of which have demonstrated a complete disregard for \nthe well-being of their own citizens as they relentlessly pursue the \nacquisition of this ballistic missile technology, can be understated.\n  Mr. President, this new and emerging ballistic missile threat from \nrogue states was dramatically highlighted by the August 1998 Taepo Dong \nI missile launch in North Korea. This North Korean missile launch \ndemonstrated important aspects of intercontinental missile development. \nMost importantly, the missile included multiple stage separation and \nthe use of a third stage. This use of a third stage, in particular, was \nsurprising to our intelligence community. Using a third stage gives \nthis missile a potential range in excess of 5,500 kilometers, thus \neffectively making the Taepo Dong I an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile.\n  Unfortunately, America's intelligence community did not expect the \nNorth Korean's to have the capability to make such a three stage \nmissile. In fact, the most recent U.S. intelligence reports made prior \nto this Taepo Dong I launch claimed that no rogue state would have this \ncapability for at least ten years.\n  Even before the North Koreans launched their Taepo Dong I missile \nlast August, there were other disturbing reports that predicted the \neminent ballistic missile threat to the United States. In July, the \nCommission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States, \nknown as the Rumsfeld Commission, released its report. The Rumsfeld \nCommission was a bipartisan commission headed by former Defense \nSecretary Rumsfeld and other well respected members in the defense \ncommunity. The Rumsfeld Commission warned of the growing ballistic \nmissile threat that rogue states posed to the United States. The \nRumsfeld Commission unanimously found that, ``concerted efforts by a \nnumber of overtly or potentially hostile nations to acquire ballistic \nmissiles with biological or nuclear payloads pose a growing threat to \nthe United States, its deployed forces and its friends and allies.''\n  The Commission reported further that, ``The threat to the U.S. posed \nby these emerging capabilities is broader, more mature and evolving \nmore rapidly than has been reported in estimates and reports by the \nIntelligence Community.''\n  The launch of the Taepo Dong I missile and the findings of the \nRumsfeld Commission are very troubling. It is clear that ballistic \nmissile technology is progressing rapidly and proliferating just as \nrapidly and, consequently, the threat to the United States is real. It \nis no longer a perceived threat or a potential threat. It is not a \nthreat that may come ten years down the road. This threat is tangible \nand it is here now. I believe that we have a moral responsibility to \nall Americans to do everything possible to defend the United States \nfrom this threat. Supporting this legislation, in my opinion, is an \nimportant step in providing a solid defense for the United States \nagainst limited ballistic missile attacks.\n  Moreover, S.257 is a responsible way to address the threat that the \nUnited States faces. In contrast to previous legislative efforts, most \nof which micro managed this policy by setting a fixed date for \ndeployment and by dictating the exact type of missile defense system to \nbe deployed, this legislation more properly lays out broad U.S. policy. \nThe bill simply--but clearly--calls for deployment of an effective \nsystem once the technology is possible. No date for deployment is set. \nNo requirement for a specific type of ballistic missile defense is \noutlined. By not dictating such requirements, this legislation \nresponsibly allows for flexibility for our military experts to develop \nand deploy the best possible missile defense system. This language \nhelps ensure that the United State will not rush into deployment with a \nsubstandard system--at a cost of billions of taxpayer dollars--just to \nbe able to say we've deployed a limited missile defense.\n  Instead, this legislation will help ensure that the United States has \ndeployed a system that has been thoroughly tested and proven \noperationally effective. I fully support this flexible approach.\n  Mr. President, let me briefly address the issue of cost. A lot has \nbeen said about how the original draft of this legislation could have \nbypassed future deliberations about how much the Pentagon should spend \non missile defense. In effect, many critics of this legislation \nbelieved this bill would simply be providing a blank check for all \nfuture missile defense development and deployment efforts. I don't \nbelieve that is the case. This legislation does not preclude such \nimportant funding deliberations. However, I was very glad to support \nthe amendment that Senator Cochran offered yesterday to make it \nabsolutely explicit that Congress will fully debate the cost \nimplications of a missile defense system in all annual defense \nauthorizations and appropriations proceedings in the future. I plan to \nfully weigh the costs and benefits of missile defense in comparison to \nall other defense programs and to assess all potential threats to the \nUnited States at the time of those deliberations.\n  Finally, I am also pleased that the bill now calls for the United \nStates to continue working with the Russians to reduce nuclear weapons. \nI strongly supported the amendment offered by Senator Landrieu which \nadded this policy statement to S. 257. The United States and Russia \nhave made great progress in reducing nuclear weapons over the past \ndecade and both countries need to continue to do so. I think this \nstatement of policy calling for continued efforts to reduce nuclear \nweapons is extremely important. We need to make it clear to ourselves, \nto all American citizens, to\n\n[[Page S2976]]\n\nour allies, and to the world that not only does the United States plan \nto defend itself from the threat of limited ballistic missile attacks, \nbut that the best protection we can offer our nation is a world in \nwhich the fewest possible weapons of mass destruction exist.\n  Again, I thank Senator Cochran and all the cosponsors for introducing \nthis important piece of legislation and for allowing the modifications \nto be made that garnered broad bipartisan support. I believe it is \nentirely appropriate for Congress to make it the policy of the United \nStates to deploy an effective missile defense when technologically \npossible. The National Missile Defense Act will help allow this \nGovernment to keep its most important covenant with the American \npeople--to protect their life and liberty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2976-1", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DRUG FREE BORDERS ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Drug Free \nBorders Act of 1999, of which I am an original cosponsor. This \nlegislation, identical to S. 1787 from the 105th Congress, authorizes \nfunding for advanced sensing equipment for detecting illegal drugs \nbefore they can cross our border and emerge on the streets of America's \ncities. I would like to commend my good friend, Senator Phil Gramm, for \nonce again taking the lead in introducing the Drug Free Borders Act \nduring the 106th Congress.\n  Those of us who represent States bordering Mexico are particularly \nsensitive to the dangers implicit in failing to properly monitor \ntraffic crossing that border. Yet, we also recognize that Mexico is one \nof our largest trading partners, and a country with which it is in our \nbest interest to maintain as open a border as possible. It is a careful \nbalancing act, but one that merits our greatest efforts.\n  While the effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement are \nbeing closely monitored by supporters and critics of that pact alike, \nit has become clear that NAFTA represents an important component of our \ninternational economic policy, contributing to the creation of 300,000 \nnew American jobs since its passage. The agreement only went into \neffect in 1994, and it will likely be several more years before its \nfull impact can be determined. The results from the first five years, \nhowever, unambiguously demonstrate that the agreement has a net \npositive impact on the U.S. economy.\n  But this bill is not about trade, it is about drugs, and about the \nmeasures that must be taken to ensure that we are doing everything we \ncan to stem the flow of illegal drugs into our cities without impeding \nthe flow of legitimate commerce. The key to finding that balance is the \nprocurement of the equipment needed to expeditiously scan incoming \ncargo, not just on the U.S.-Mexican border, but at our other ports of \nentry as well--and I should point out the emphasis in this bill on your \nmaritime ports of entry. The Drug Free Borders Act of 1999 represents \nan important and substantive step in that direction. Authorizing over \n$1 billion to beef-up Customs Department operations along our borders \nwith Mexico and Canada, as well as at the maritime ports of entry, this \nlegislation is a sound, responsible approach to enhancing this \ncountry's capabilities to interdict the flow of drugs before they reach \nour children.\n  Mr. President, I urge the support of all of my colleagues for the \nDrug Free Borders Act of 1999. This bill passed both Chambers of \nCongress last year, but fell victim to the vagaries of time, as the \n105th Congress adjourned while the bill was still in conference. Its \npassage by both the Senate and the House of Representatives, however, \nclearly illustrates its broad bipartisan support, and I look forward to \nits passage into law during the current session of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/03/18/senate-section/article/S2976-2", "month": "03", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       DESIGNATING MARCH 25, 1999, AS ``GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY''\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.
