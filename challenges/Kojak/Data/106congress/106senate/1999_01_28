We are confident in Your unlimited power. Therefore, \nat no time are we helpless or hapless. Our confidence is rooted in Your \nCommandments. Therefore, we are strengthened by Your absolutes that \ngive us enduring values. Our courage is based on the assurance of Your \never-present, guiding Spirit. Therefore, we will not fear. Our hope is \nrooted in trust in Your reliability. Therefore, we will not be anxious. \nYour interventions in trying times in the past have made us hopeful \nthinkers for the future. Therefore, we trust You.\n  You have called us to glorify You in the work here in this Senate. \nTherefore, we give You our best for this day's responsibilities. You \nhave guided our beloved Nation through difficult periods of discord and \ndivision in the past. Therefore, we ask for Your help in the present \ndeliberations of the impeachment trial. Thank You for the courage that \nflows from our unshakable confidence in You. Through our Lord and \nSavior. Amen.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senators will be seated. The Sergeant at Arms will \nmake the proclamation.\n  The Sergeant at Arms, James W. Ziglar, made proclamation as follows:\n\n       Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the Senate of the \n     United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of \n     impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no objection, the Journal of \nproceedings of the trial are approved to date.\n  The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                           order of procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all of our colleagues--obviously, \nthey have already received the word by the fact that they are not all \npresent--but we are still attempting to reach an agreement with respect \nto the remaining procedures for the trial, particularly with regard to \nhow and when the depositions will be taken.\n  We have been making progress, but it is something we need to be \ncareful about. Hopefully, we will be able to reach an agreement yet \ntoday. If agreement is reached, I expect it very likely that a rollcall \nvote would be requested on that agreement and, therefore, all Members \nshould be aware of that. We will notify them via the hotline system as \nthe voting schedule becomes clear. Certainly we will keep the Chief \nJustice informed of our deliberations and when we anticipate the need \nto reconvene.\n\n\n                                 recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. But in view of the continuing negotiations and conferences \nthat are meeting at this time, I ask unanimous consent the Senate stand \nin recess until the hour of 2 p.m. today.\n  There being no objection, at 1:07 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n2:02 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, again, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, in an effort to get an agreement on how \nto proceed, it is very important that all parties are aware of the \nprocedures that we are outlining and that those include Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle, the House managers, the White House, the \nattorneys for the witnesses. So it does take time.\n  Just as we were prepared to come in at 2 and move to a resolution, \nquestions were raised about a couple specific points. We feel like \nthose questions need to be clarified for certainty. Rather than \ncontinue to recess hour to hour, which I know is not fair to the Chief \nJustice, I think it would be better at this point to make sure Senators \nare aware that we are working to get an agreement on this procedure, \nand we need to get that done today so the depositions can get underway \nwith the attorneys consulting with their clients Friday and Saturday, \nand hopefully, the depositions will begin on Sunday and Monday, and \nhopefully, completed\n\n[[Page S1070]]\n\nby Tuesday. But we are working on the details of that.\n  This still could very well require a vote or two today or even \ntomorrow. But we will make that announcement once it is clear that it \nis going to take a recorded vote of one or more and exactly how that \nwould work.\n  So, we will keep the Chief Justice notified of the expected \ntimeframe, and as information becomes available as to exactly when we \nwill come back into session, and whether or not or how many votes will \nbe required. We will get that information to Senators.\n\n\n                Recess Subject to the Call of the Chair\n\n  Mr. LOTT. In view of all that, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate stand in recess subject to the call of the Chair.\n  There being no objection, at 2:03 p.m., the Senate recessed subject \nto the call of the Chair.\n  The Senate reassembled at 5:31 p.m., when called to order by the \nChief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  I thought we were ready to proceed. I see Senator Daschle is not on \nthe floor. He should be back momentarily. Maybe I can explain a few \ndetails. He is returning now. We may still need a little more time.\n  We thank you for your patience, and our colleagues on both sides for \ntheir patience, as we have tried to work through the details of these \nresolutions and how to proceed with the depositions. There are a lot of \ndetails to it and everybody needs to be relatively comfortable they \nunderstand how that will work. That is why it has taken this additional \ntime.\n  I think we are to the point where we are ready to proceed. I believe \nthe way it will proceed is that we will have a resolution that I will \nsend to the desk, followed by a substitute from Senator Daschle. Then \nSenator Daschle has indicated that they may want to have a motion to go \nstraight to the articles of impeachment. That would require three \nvotes. Then we also, at that point, would make it clear the depositions \nwould begin on Monday, the 1st. It is our intent to then go to those \nthree votes. I also understand that both sides are willing to waive--\nthe parties--willing to waive the debate time on these issues.\n  With that explanation, I begin that process.\n\n\n   Relating to the Procedures Concerning the Articles of Impeachment \n                   Against William Jefferson Clinton\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I send a resolution to the desk and ask that it be read in \nits entirety by the clerk, and time for the two parties be waived.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the resolution in its \nentirety.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe there was a request for unanimous consent.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, the request is agreed to.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 30) relative to the procedures \n     concerning the Articles of Impeachment against William \n     Jefferson Clinton.\n       Resolved,\n\n  TITLE I--PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST \n                       WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON\n\n       Sec. 101. That the deposition time for all witnesses be \n     determined by the Senate Majority Leader and Minority Leader, \n     as outlined in Senate Resolution 16, One Hundred Sixth \n     Congress, First Session, and title II of this resolution and \n     that all Senators have an opportunity to review all \n     deposition material, which shall be made available at the \n     earliest possible time.\n       Sec. 102. When the Senate reconvenes on the day after \n     completion of the depositions, and the review period, it \n     shall be in order for both the House Managers and the \n     President's counsel to move to resolve any objections made \n     during any deposition. After resolution of any such motions, \n     it shall be in order for the House Managers and/or White \n     House counsel to make a motion or motions to admit the \n     depositions or portions thereof into evidence, whether \n     transcribed or on video tape provided further for a \n     presentation employing all or portions of such tape, and it \n     shall then be in order for the two Leaders jointly, only to \n     make motions for additional discovery because of new relevant \n     evidence discovered during the depositions. Motions may also \n     then be made for orders governing the presentation of \n     evidence and/or the testifying of witnesses before the \n     Senate.\n       Sec. 103. If no such motions are made, or following the \n     completion of any procedures authorized as a result of the \n     votes on any motions, the White House shall have up to 24 \n     hours to make any motions dealing with testimony or evidence \n     that the White House counsel deems appropriate, as described \n     previously.\n       Sec. 104. If no such motions are made, or no witnesses are \n     called to testify in the Senate, the Senate shall proceed to \n     final arguments as provided in the impeachment rules waiving \n     the two person rule contained in Rule XXII of the Rules of \n     Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on \n     Impeachment Trials for not to exceed six hours, to be equally \n     divided. If motions are agreed to regarding new evidence or \n     calling of new witnesses, this resolution is suspended.\n       Sec. 105. At the conclusion of the final arguments the \n     parties shall proceed in accordance with the rules of \n     impeachment: Provided however, That no motion with respect to \n     re-opening the record in the case shall be in order, and: \n     Provided further, That it shall be in order for a Senator \n     to offer a motion to suspend the rules to allow for open \n     final deliberations with no amendments or motions to that \n     motion in order; and the Senate shall proceed to vote on \n     the motion to suspend the rules to provide for open Senate \n     deliberations.\n       Sec. 106. Following that vote, and if no motions have been \n     agreed to as provided in sections 102 and 103, and no motions \n     are agreed to following the arguments, then the vote will \n     occur on any pending motions and amendments thereto and then \n     on the articles of impeachment no later than 12:00 noon on \n     Friday, February 12, 1999.\n\nTITLE II--TO AUTHORIZE ISSUANCE OF SUBPOENAS TO TAKE DEPOSITIONS IN THE \nTRIAL OF THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON, \n                     PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n       Sec. 201. That, pursuant to Rules V and VI of the Rules of \n     Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on \n     Impeachment Trials, and S. Res. 16, 106th Congress, 1st \n     Session, the Chief Justice of the United States, through the \n     Secretary of the Senate, shall issue subpoenas for the taking \n     of testimony on oral deposition to the following witnesses: \n     Sidney Blumenthal, Monica S. Lewinsky, and Vernon E. Jordan, \n     Jr.\n       Sec. 202. The Sergeant at Arms is authorized to utilize the \n     services of the Deputy Sergeant at Arms or any other employee \n     of the United States Senate in serving the subpoenas \n     authorized to be issued by this resolution.\n       Sec. 203. Depositions authorized by this resolution shall \n     be taken before, and presided over by, on behalf of the \n     Senate, two Senators appointed by the Majority Leader and the \n     Democratic Leader, acting jointly, one of whom shall \n     administer to witnesses the oath prescribed by Rule XXV of \n     the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When \n     Sitting on Impeachment Trials. Acting jointly, the presiding \n     officers shall have authority to rule, as an initial matter, \n     upon any question arising out of the deposition. All \n     objections to a question shall be noted by the presiding \n     officers upon the record of the deposition, but the \n     examination shall proceed, and the witness shall answer such \n     question. A witness may refuse to answer a question only when \n     necessary to preserve a legally-recognized privilege, and \n     must identify such privilege cited if refusing to answer a \n     question.\n       Sec. 204. Examination of witnesses at depositions shall be \n     conducted by the Managers on the part of the House or their \n     counsel, and by counsel for the President. Witnesses shall be \n     examined by no more than two persons each on behalf of the \n     Managers and counsel for the President. Witnesses may be \n     accompanied by counsel. The scope of the examination by the \n     Managers and counsel for both parties shall be limited to the \n     subject matters reflected in the Senate record. The party \n     taking a deposition shall present to the other party, at \n     least 18 hours in advance of the deposition, copies of all \n     exhibits which the deposing party intends to enter into the \n     record during the deposition. No exhibits outside of the \n     Senate record shall be employed, except for articles and \n     materials in the press, including electronic media. Any \n     party may interrogate any witness as if that witness were \n     declared adverse.\n       Sec. 205. The depositions shall be videotaped and a \n     transcript of the proceedings shall be made. The depositions \n     shall be conducted in private. No person shall be admitted to \n     any deposition except for the following: the witness, counsel \n     for the witness, the Managers on the part of the House, \n     counsel for the Managers, counsel for the President, and the \n     presiding officers; further, such persons whose presence is \n     required to make and preserve a record of the proceedings in \n     videotaped and transcript forms, and employees of the Senate \n     whose presence is required to assist the presiding officers \n     in presiding over the depositions, or for other purposes, as \n     determined after consultation by the Majority Leader with the \n     Democratic Leader. All present must maintain the \n     confidentiality of the proceedings.\n       Sec. 206. The presiding officers at the depositions shall \n     file the videotaped and transcribed records of the \n     depositions with the Secretary of the Senate, who shall \n     maintain them as confidential proceedings of the Senate. The \n     Sergeant at Arms is authorized to make available for review \n     any of the videotaped or transcribed deposition records to \n     Members of the Senate, one designated staff member per \n     Senator, and the Chief Justice. The Senate may direct the \n     Secretary of the Senate to distribute such materials, and\n\n[[Page S1071]]\n\n     to use whichever means of dissemination, including printing \n     as Senate documents, printing in the Congressional Record, \n     photo- and video-duplication, and electronic dissemination, \n     he determines to be appropriate to accomplish any \n     distribution of the videotaped or transcribed deposition \n     records that he is directed to make pursuant to this section.\n       Sec. 207. The depositions authorized by this resolution \n     shall be deemed to be proceedings before the Senate for \n     purposes of Rule XXIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     Senate Resolution 259, 100th Congress, 1st Session, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 191, 192, 194, 288b, 288d, 288f, 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 6002, 6005, and 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1365. The Secretary \n     shall arrange for stenographic assistance, including \n     videotaping, to record the depositions as provided in section \n     5. Such expenses as may be necessary shall be paid from the \n     Appropriation Account--Miscellaneous Items in the contingent \n     fund of the Senate upon vouchers approved by the Secretary.\n       Sec. 208. The Secretary shall notify the Managers on the \n     part of the House, and counsel for the President, of this \n     resolution.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the minority leader.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 1\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. Chief Justice, I have an amendment that I send to \nthe desk.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Daschle] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1.\n       In the resolution strike all after the word ``that'' in the \n     first line and insert the following:\n\n     ``the deposition time for all witnesses to be deposed be \n     limited to no later than close of business Wednesday, \n     February 3 and that all Senators have an opportunity to \n     review all deposition material, which shall be made available \n     at the earliest possible time.\n       ``When the Senate reconvenes the trial at 10 a.m. on \n     Saturday, February 6 it shall be in order to resolve any \n     objections that may not be resolved regarding the \n     depositions; after these deposition objections have been \n     disposed of, it shall be in order for the House managers and/\n     or the White House counsel to make a motion, or motions to \n     admit the depositions or portions thereof into evidence, such \n     motions shall be limited to transcribed deposition material \n     only;\n       ``On Monday, February 8 there shall be 4 hours equally \n     divided for closing arguments; with the White House using the \n     first 2 hours and the House Republican managers using the \n     final 2 hours; that\n       ``Upon the completion of the closing arguments the Senate \n     shall begin final deliberation on the articles; a timely \n     filed motion to suspend the rules and open these deliberation \n     shall be in order; upon the completion of these deliberations \n     the Senate shall, without any intervening action, amendment, \n     motion or debate, vote on the articles of impeachment.\n       ``Provided further, That the votes on the articles shall \n     occur no later than 12 noon Friday, February 12.''\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah, Mr. \nHatch.\n  Mr. HATCH. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chief Justice: Does the \nmajority leader's resolution, does that also keep open the right of \nSenators to file----\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Parliamentarian says it takes a unanimous \nconsent for a parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to ask one \nquestion.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Does the majority leader's resolution allow for the filing \nand consideration of motions that may not be mentioned in the \nresolution itself?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Parliamentarian tells me it is never the \nfunction of the Chair to interpret a resolution.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the regular order is, now we would go to a vote \non the two resolutions. Just for the information of the Senators, after \nthat, Senator Daschle may have a motion, again, as I indicated earlier, \njust to go to a vote on the articles of impeachment.\n  So there could be three votes now, in order, without intervening \ndebate. After that, Senator Daschle and I will formally lock in the \nbeginning time for the depositions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The first vote will be on the amendment from the \nminority leader, the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The yeas and nays are required.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] is \nabsent because of illness.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMaryland [Ms. Mikulski] would vote ``aye.''\n  The result was announced--yeas 44, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                         [Rollcall Vote No. 6]\n\n            [Subject: Daschle amendment No. 1 to S.

That, pursuant to Rules V and VI of the Rules of \n     Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on \n     Impeachment Trials, and Senate Resolution 16, One Hundred \n     Sixth Congress, First Session, the Chief Justice of the \n     United States, through the Secretary of the Senate, shall \n     issue subpoenas for the taking of testimony on oral \n     deposition to the following witnesses: Sidney Blumenthal, \n     Monica S. Lewinsky, and Vernon E. Jordon, Jr.\n       Sec. 202. The Sergeant at Arms is authorized to utilize the \n     services of the Deputy Sergeant at Arms or any other employee \n     of the United States Senate in serving the subpoenas \n     authorized to be issued by this resolution.\n       Sec. 203. Depositions authorized by this resolution shall \n     be taken before, and presided over by, on behalf of the \n     Senate, two Senators appointed by the Majority Leader and the \n     Democratic Leader, acting jointly, one of whom shall \n     administer to witnesses the oath prescribed by Rule XXV of \n     the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When \n     Sitting on Impeachment Trials. Acting jointly, the presiding \n     officers shall have authority to rule, as an initial matter, \n     upon any question arising out of the deposition. All \n     objections to a question shall be noted by the presiding \n     officers upon the record of the deposition but the \n     examination shall proceed, and the witness shall answer such \n     question. A witness may refuse to answer a question only when \n     necessary to preserve a legally-recognized privilege, or \n     constitutional right, and must identify such privilege cited \n     if refusing to answer a question.\n       Sec. 204. Examination of witnesses at depositions shall be \n     conducted by the Managers on the part of the House or their \n     counsel, and by counsel for the President. Witnesses shall be \n     examined by no more than two persons each on behalf of the \n     Managers and counsel for the President. Witnesses may be \n     accompanied by counsel. The scope of the examination by the \n     Managers and counsel for both parties shall be limited to the \n     subject matters reflected in the Senate record. The party \n     taking a deposition shall present to the other party, at \n     least 18 hours in advance of the deposition, copies of all \n     exhibits which the deposing party intends to enter into the \n     deposition. No exhibits outside of the Senate record shall be \n     employed, except for articles and materials in the press, \n     including electronic media. Any party may interrogate any \n     witness as if that witness were declared adverse.\n       Sec. 205. The depositions shall be videotaped and a \n     transcript of the proceedings shall be made. The depositions \n     shall be conducted in private. No person shall be admitted to \n     any deposition except for the following: The witness, counsel \n     for the witness, the Managers on the part of the House, \n     counsel for the Managers, counsel for the President, and the \n     presiding officers; further, such persons whose presence is \n     required to make and preserve a record of the proceedings in \n     videotaped and transcript forms, and Senate staff members \n     whose presence is required to assist the presiding officers \n     in presiding over the depositions, or for other purposes, as \n     determined by the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader. \n     All present must maintain the confidentiality of the \n     proceedings.\n       Sec. 206. The presiding officers at the depositions shall \n     file the videotaped and transcribed records of the \n     depositions with the Secretary of the Senate, who shall \n     maintain them as confidential proceedings of the Senate. The \n     Sergeant at Arms is authorized to make available for review \n     at secure locations, any of the videotaped or transcribed \n     deposition records to Members of the Senate, one designated \n     staff member per Senator, and the Chief Justice. The Senate \n     may direct the Secretary of the Senate to distribute such \n     materials, and to use whichever means of dissemination, \n     including printing as Senate documents, printing in the \n     Congressional Record, photo- and video-duplication, and \n     electronic dissemination, he determines to be appropriate to \n     accomplish any distribution of the videotaped or transcribed \n     deposition records that he is directed to make pursuant to \n     this section.\n       Sec. 207. The depositions authorized by this resolution \n     shall be deemed to be proceedings before the Senate for \n     purposes of Rule XXIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     Senate Resolution 259, One Hundredth Congress, First Session, \n     sections 191, 192, 194, 288b, 288d, 288f of title 2, United \n     States Code, sections 6002, 6005 of title 18, United States \n     Code, and section 1365 of title 28, United States Code. The \n     Secretary shall arrange for stenographic assistance, \n     including videotaping, to record the depositions as provided \n     in section 205. Such expenses as may be necessary shall be \n     paid from the Appropriation Account--Miscellaneous Items in \n     the contingent fund of the Senate upon vouchers approved by \n     the Secretary.\n       Sec. 208. The Majority and Minority Leaders, acting \n     jointly, may make other provisions for the orderly and fair \n     conduct of these depositions as they seem appropriate.\n       Sec. 209. The Secretary shall notify the Managers on the \n     part of the House, and counsel for the President, of this \n     resolution.\n\n  The resolution (S. Res. 30), as amended, as modified, reads as \nfollows:\n\n                               S. Res. 30\n\n       Resolved,\n\n[[Page S1073]]\n\n  TITLE I--PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST \n                       WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON\n\n       Sec. 101. That the deposition time for all witnesses be \n     determined by the Senate Majority Leader and Minority Leader, \n     as outlined in Senate Resolution 16, One Hundred Sixth \n     Congress, First Session, and title II of this resolution and \n     that all Senators have an opportunity to review all \n     deposition material, which shall be made available at the \n     earliest possible time.\n       Sec. 102. When the Senate reconvenes on the day after \n     completion of the depositions, and the review period, it \n     shall be in order for both the House Managers and the \n     President's counsel to move to resolve any objections made \n     during any deposition. After resolution of any such motions, \n     it shall be in order for the House Managers and/or White \n     House counsel to make a motion or motions to admit the \n     depositions or portions thereof into evidence, whether \n     transcribed or on videotape provided further for a \n     presentation employing all or portions of such tape, and it \n     shall then be in order for the two Leaders jointly, only to \n     make motions for additional discovery because of new relevant \n     evidence discovered during the depositions. Motions may also \n     then be made for orders governing the presentation of \n     evidence and/or the testifying of witnesses before the \n     Senate.\n       Sec. 103. If no such motions are made, or following the \n     completion of any procedures authorized as a result of the \n     votes on any motions, the White House shall have up to 24 \n     hours to make any motions dealing with testimony or evidence \n     that the White House counsel deems appropriate, as described \n     previously.\n       Sec. 104. If no such motions are made, or no witnesses are \n     called to testify in the Senate, the Senate shall proceed to \n     final arguments as provided in the impeachment rules waiving \n     the two person rule contained in Rule XXII of the Rules of \n     Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on \n     Impeachment Trials for not to exceed six hours, to be equally \n     divided. If motions are agreed to regarding new evidence or \n     calling of new witnesses, this resolution is suspended.\n       Sec. 105. At the conclusion of the final arguments the \n     parties shall proceed in accordance with the rules of \n     impeachment: Provided however, That no motion with respect to \n     reopening the record in the case shall be in order, and: \n     Provided further, That it shall be in order for a Senator to \n     offer a motion to suspend the rules to allow for open final \n     deliberations with no amendments or motions to that motion in \n     order; and the Senate shall proceed to vote on the motion to \n     suspend the rules to provide for open Senate deliberations.\n       Sec. 106. Following that vote, and if no motions have been \n     agreed to as provided in sections 102 and 103, and no motions \n     are agreed to following the arguments, then the vote will \n     occur on the articles of impeachment no later than 12:00 noon \n     on Friday, February 12, 1999, if all motions are disposed of \n     and final deliberations are completed.\n\nTITLE II--TO AUTHORIZE ISSUANCE OF SUBPOENAS TO TAKE DEPOSITIONS IN THE \nTRIAL OF THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON, \n                     PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n       Sec. 201. That, pursuant to Rules V and VI of the Rules of \n     Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on \n     Impeachment Trials, and Senate Resolution 16, One Hundred \n     Sixth Congress, First Session, the Chief Justice of the \n     United States, through the Secretary of the Senate, shall \n     issue subpoenas for the taking of testimony on oral \n     deposition to the following witnesses: Sidney Blumenthal, \n     Monica S.

Mr. chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the \nunanimous consent agreement I send to the desk be agreed to. This all \ndeals with the taking of depositions.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The text of the unanimous consent agreement reads as follows:\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that the time and place to take \n     depositions in the trial of the articles of impeachment \n     against William Jefferson Clinton be decided jointly by the \n     majority leader, and the Democratic leader, and shall be set \n     forth in each subpoena.\n       I further ask unanimous consent that the opportunity for \n     taking depositions of Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and \n     Sidney Blumenthal expires when the Senate convenes on \n     Thursday, Feb. 4, 1999.\n       Finally I ask unanimous consent that each deposition may \n     last no more than 8 hours, unless the majority leader, and \n     the Democratic leader determine on a deposition-by-deposition \n     basis, to extend the time of the deposition, and all the time \n     allotted for examination shall be divided equally between the \n     parties, and time consumed by objections shall not be charged \n     to either objecting party.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Now, I understand, Mr. Chief Justice, that the Democratic \nleader is prepared to agree that the depositions will begin on Monday, \nFebruary 1, and with this having been decided, and the vote we just \ntook, we have discussed the schedule for the remainder of the week. In \nview of the fact that at this point the parties will begin to prepare \nfor depositions and the depositions will begin on Monday, Members will \nnot be expected to be here for any business before Wednesday, but we \ncould be required to have a session Wednesday afternoon.\n  I want to emphasize that as the deposition material becomes \navailable, we will have the Sergeant at Arms have it in a room for \nMembers to begin to review. So beginning Tuesday, Senators who would \nlike to begin reviewing the depositions, the material in the \ndepositions, it will be available in installments as it becomes \navailable on Tuesday. So you would have that opportunity Tuesday and \nWednesday. Not\n\n[[Page S1074]]\n\nlater than Thursday, then, we would go to the next phase of our \nagreement that we have voted on.\n  At this time, we are notifying the Members that there will be no \nfurther recorded votes and no further business while we await returning \nof the depositions through Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and \nTuesday, but Members should expect to be here on Wednesday and they \nwould need to be here on Wednesday, in order to begin to make sure they \nhave had time to review the documents, the deposition material, so that \nwe can proceed, then, on Thursday.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Are Senators allowed to attend these depositions or not?\n  Mr. LOTT.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nan exclusion for gain from the sale of farmland which is similar to the \nexclusion from gain on the sale of a principal residence, to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             CAPITAL GAINS TAX FAIRNESS FOR FAMILY FARMERS\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today Senator Hagel of Nebraska and \nI rise to introduce a bill to correct a fundamental flaw and inequity \nin the tax code that we need to fix immediately. This legislation is \nidentical to a bill that I authored in the last Congress.\n  Too often, family farmers are not able to take full advantage of the \n$500,000 capital gains tax break that city folks get when they sell \ntheir homes. Today, this inequity is particularly onerous for thousands \nof family farmers who are being forced to sell their farms due to \ndepressed commodity prices, crop disease and failed federal farm \npolicies. Once family farmers have been beaten down and forced to sell \nthe farm they've farmed for generations, they get a rude awakening. \nMany of them discover, as they leave the farm, that Uncle Sam is \nwaiting for them at the end of the lane with a big tax bill.\n  One of the most popular provisions included in the major tax bill in \n1997 permits families to exclude from federal income tax up to $500,000 \nof gain from the sale of their principal residences. That's a good \ndeal, especially for most urban and suburban dwellers who have spent \nmany years paying for their houses, and who regard their houses as both \na home and a retirement account. For many middle income families, their \nhome is their major financial asset, an asset the family can draw on \nfor retirement. House prices in major growth markets such as \nWashington, D.C., New York, or California may start at hundreds of \nthousands of dollars. As a result, the urban dwellers who have owned \ntheir homes through many years of appreciation can often benefit from a \nlarge portion of this new $500,000 capital gains tax exclusion. \nUnfortunately this provision, as currently applied, is virtually \nuseless to family farmers.\n  For farm families, their farm is their major financial asset. \nUnfortunately, family farmers under current law receive little or no \nbenefit from the new $500,000 exclusion because the IRS separates the \nvalue of their homes from the value of the land the homes sit on. As \npeople from my state of North Dakota\n\n[[Page S1077]]\n\nknow, houses out on the farmsteads of rural America are more commonly \nsold for $5,000 to $40,000. Most farmers plow any profits they make \ninto the whole farm rather than into a house that will hold little or \nno value when the farm is sold. It's not surprising that the IRS often \njudges that homes far out in the country have very little value and \nthus farmers receive much less benefit from this $500,000 exclusion \nthan do their urban and suburban counterparts. As a result, the capital \ngains exclusion is little or no help to farmers who are being forced \nout of business. They may immediately face a hefty capital gains tax \nbill from the IRS.\n  This is simply wrong, Mr. President. It is unfair. Federal farm \npolicy helped create the hole that many of these farmers find \nthemselves in. Federal tax policy shouldn't dig the hole deeper as they \nattempt to shovel their way out.\n  The Dorgan-Hagel bill recognizes the unique character and role of our \nfamily farmers and their important contributions to our economy. It \nexpands the $500,000 capital gains tax exclusion for sales of principal \nresidences to cover family farmers who sell their farmhouses or \nsurrounding farmland, so long as they are actively engaged in farming \nprior to the sales. In this way, farmers may get some benefit from a \ntax break that would otherwise be unavailable to them.\n  Our bill is not a substitute for larger policy reforms that are \nneeded to restore the economic health of our farm communities. This tax \nrelief measure is just one of a number of policy initiatives we can use \nto ease the pain for family farmers as we pursue other initiatives to \nhelp turn around the crippled farm economy.\n  Specifically, the Dorgan-Hagel bill would expand the $500,000 tax \nexclusion for principle residences to cover the entire farm. This \nprovision will allow a family or individual who has actively engaged in \nfarming prior to the farm sale to exclude the gain from the sale up to \nthe $500,000 maximum.\n  What does this relief mean to the thousands of farmers who are being \nforced to sell off the farm due to current economic conditions?\n  Take, for example, a farmer who is forced to leave today because of \ncrop disease and slumping grain prices and sells his farmstead that his \nfamily has operated for decades. If he must report a gain of $10,000 on \nthe sale of farm house, that is all he can exclude under current law. \nBut if, for example, he sold 1000 acres surrounding the farm house for \n$400,000, and the capital gain was $200,000, he would be subject to \n$40,000 tax on that gain. Again, our provision excludes from tax the \ngain on the farmhouse and land up to the $500,000 maximum that is \notherwise available to a family on the sale of its residence.\n  We must wage, on every federal and state policy front, the battle to \nstem the loss of family farmers. Reforming tax provisions has grown \nincreasingly important as a tool in helping our farm families deal with \ndrought, floods, crop disease and price swings.\n  We believe that Congress should move quickly to pass this legislation \nand other meaningful measures to get working capital into the hands of \nour family farmers in the Great Plains and all across the nation. Let's \nstop penalizing farmers who are forced out of agriculture. Let's allow \nfarmers to benefit from the same kind of tax exclusion that most \nhomeowners already receive. This is the right thing to do. And it's the \nfair thing to do.\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I rise with Senator Dorgan to \nintroduce tax legislation that will help our family farmers cope with \nthe economic crisis now affecting them.\n  Our tax code is full of provisions that are unfair and punitive. We \nneed to overhaul our tax code to make it flatter, fairer and simpler. \nHowever, until the present tax code is overhauled, it is important that \nwe fix specific provisions of the tax code to ensure that all taxpayers \nare treated fairly and equally.\n  In the 105th Congress we passed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. This \nlegislation included capital gains tax and federal estate tax relief. \nIt was a good first step, but we can't stop there. We have much more to \ndo. We need more capital gains tax relief, and I will keep pushing for \nmore cuts and the eventual elimination of the tax. The federal estate \ntax also needs to be abolished. The estate tax is a leading cause for \nthe break-up of family-run businesses, including farming, and I will \ncontinue to work for its elimination. Additionally, we need to provide \nall American taxpayers with an across-the-board tax cut.\n  We gave most Americans serious capital gains tax relief in 1997, but \nwe neglected the family farmer. We now have the opportunity and \nobligation to correct this omission. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \ncreated a $500,000 exclusion for homeowners on the sale of a principal \nresidence, but this does not adequately address the needs of family \nfarmers. Most farmers put whatever profit they earn from their hard \nwork back into the land, not their home. As a result, the $500,000 \nexclusion for the sale of a principal residence does not provide the \nsame level of relief to the family farmer as it does for the vast \nmajority of others. So, when family farmers are forced to sell their \nfarms due to economic downturns, not only are they out of the farming \nbusiness, but the federal government is waiting to take a large portion \nin taxes on the sale of their home and farmland.\n  The legislation that Senator Dorgan and I are introducing would help \nease the financial burden associated with selling the farm. It would \nallow the family farmer to take advantage of capital gains tax relief. \nIt expands the $500,000 capital gains tax exclusion for sales of \nprincipal residences to cover family farmers who sell their farmhouses \nand/or surrounding farmlands.\n  This legislation is not a cure-all solution to the many problems now \naffecting our family farmers and ranchers. However, it will help. There \nare many other things that can be done including more tax relief in the \nareas of the estate tax and capital gains tax. We need to continue to \nopen new markets for our commodities and knock down unilateral economic \nsanctions that are unfairly punishing our farmers. The future of U.S. \nagriculture lies in export expansion and trade reform. This tax \nlegislation starts the process, but we must continue to push forward to \nhelp our family farmers and ranchers.\n      By Mr. INOUYE:\n  S. 318. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to \nfacilitate the immigration to the United States of certain aliens born \nin the Philippines or Japan who were fathered by United States \ncitizens; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            THE AMERASIAN IMMIGRATION ACT AMENDMENT OF 1999\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce \nlegislation which amends Public Law 97-359, the Amerasian Immigration \nAct, to include American children from the Philippines and Japan as \neligible applicants. This legislation also expands the eligibility \nperiod for the Philippines to November 24, 1992, the date of the last \nUnited States military base closure and the date of enactment of the \nproposed legislation for Japan.\n  Under the Amerasian Immigration Act (Public Law 97-359) children born \nin Korea, Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand, and Vietnam after December 31, \n1950, and before October 22, 1982, who were fathered by United States \ncitizens, are allowed to immigrate to the United States. The initial \nlegislation introduced in the 97th Congress included Amerasians born in \nthe Philippines and Japan with no time limits on their births. The \nfinal version enacted by the Congress included only those areas where \nthe U.S. had engaged in active military combat from the Korean War \nonward. Consequently, Amerasians from the Philippines and Japan were \nexcluded from eligibility.\n  Although the Philippines and Japan were not considered war zones from \n1950 to 1982, the extent and nature of U.S. military involvement in \nboth countries are not dissimilar to U.S. military involvement in other \nAsian countries during the Korean and Viet- nam conflicts. The role of \nthe Philippines and Japan as vital supply and stationing bases brought \ntens of thousands of U.S. military personnel to these countries. As a \nresult, interracial relations in both countries were common, leading to \na significant number of Amerasian children being fathered by U.S. \ncitizens. There are now more than 50,000 Amerasian children in the \nPhilippines. According to the Embassy of Japan, there are 6,000 \nAmerasian children in Japan born between 1987 and 1992.\n  Public Law 97-359 was enacted in the hope of redressing the situation \nof\n\n[[Page S1078]]\n\nAmerasian children in Korea, Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand, and Vietnam \nwho, due to their illegitimate or mixed ethnic make-up, their lack of a \nfather or stable mother figure, or impoverished state, have little hope \nof escaping their plight. It became the ethical and social obligation \nof the United States to care for these children.\n  The stigmatization and ostracism felt by Amerasian children in those \ncountries covered by the Amerasian Immigration Act also is felt by \nAmerasian children in the Philippines and Japan. These children of \nAmerican citizens deserve the same viable opportunities of employment, \neducation and family life that are afforded their counterparts from \nKorea, Laos, Kampuchea, Thailand, and Vietnam.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 318\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     section 204(f)(2)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     (8 U.S.C. 1154(f)(2)(A)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(I)'' after ``born''; and\n       (2) by inserting after ``subsection,'' the following ``(II) \n     in the Philippines after 1950 and before November 24, 1992, \n     or (III) in Japan after 1950 and before the date of enactment \n     of this subclause,''.\n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 319. A bill to provide for childproof handguns, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       the childproof handgun act\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation \nthat will help prevent the tragedies that occur when children gain \naccess to firearms.\n  Each year, there are 10,000 injuries and deaths due to the accidental \ndischarge or unauthorized use of a firearm. Many of these incidents \ninvolve children who have gained access to improperly stored guns.\n  Recently, a family in my home state of New Jersey suffered this type \nof tragedy. Akeen Williams, a 4-year-old boy for Lawnside, was visiting \na relative with his 5-year-old sister, Gabrielle, and their 6-year-old \nbrother, Phillip. Eventually, the children were put in a bedroom for an \nafternoon nap. But they found a gun stored in the room, and Akeen and \nGabrielle began playing with it. The gun accidentally discharged, and \nAkeen was hit in the face by the ricocheting bullet.\n  Across the nation, similar stories have become all too common. \nFamilies in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, and Springfield are \nstill struggling to deal with the horrific shootings in their \ncommunities. We must find new ways to stop gun violence.\n  In many other areas the federal government has taken steps to protect \nconsumer safety: cars are now sold with seat belts and airbags; drug \ncontainers have childproof caps; and lawn mowers have guards and \nautomatic braking devices. It is hard to understand how anyone can \noppose similar safety measures for deadly weapons. The time has come to \nhold firearm manufacturers to a higher standard of safety.\n  The bill I am introducing today will help prevent children from being \nkilled or injured in firearm tragedies. My bill would require that all \nhandguns be engineered so that they can only be fired by an authorized \nuser. To give manufacturers time to comply, this requirement would not \ngo into effect until 3 years after the bill is enacted. Additionally, \nto spur additional innovation and help lower the cost of the new \nhandgun designs, my bill would also authorize the National Institute of \nJustice to provide grants for improvements in firearms safety. In order \nto prevent the unauthorized use of handguns and better protect children \nin the 3-year period before this regulation goes into effect, my bill \nwould also require that, 90 days after enactment, all handguns be sold \nwith a locking device and a warning concerning responsible firearm \nstorage.\n  Despite what some members of the gun lobby may say, the technology to \nmake handguns childproof exists today. Since 1976, more than 30 patents \nhave been granted for various technologies that will prevent a handgun \nfrom being fired by anyone except the authorized user. For example, the \nSafTLok company in Florida manufactures a push-button combination lock \nthat is incorporated into the grip of a handgun. If the buttons are not \npushed in the proper sequence, the gun will not fire. These locks sell \nfor $80 each, and the Boston police department recently announced that \nthese locks will be standard equipment for its officers.\n  Similarly, the Fulton Arms company in Texas has developed a revolver \nthat cannot be fired unless the user is wearing a magnetic ring. And \nColt Manufacturing in Connecticut has designed a prototype handgun that \nemits a radio signal and cannot be fired unless the user is wearing a \nsmall transponder that returns a coded radio signal.\n  In addition to making children safer, these technologies will also \nhelp law enforcement. Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nshows that about 16 percent of the officers killed in the line of duty, \nas many as 19 in a single year, are killed by a suspect armed with \neither the officer's firearm or that of another officer. Because of the \npotential to stop these ``take away'' shootings, the National Institute \nof Justice has funded studies of these technologies and supported \ndevelopment of the Colt prototype. However, in order to ensure that the \npolice have the weapons they need to protect the public, law \nenforcement entities are exempt from the requirements in the bill.\n  None of the provisions in this legislation will burden the vast \nmajority of firearm owners who are already storing their handguns \nsafely and securely. Of course, Congress cannot legislate \nresponsibility. But we can and should take steps to lessen the \nlikelihood that guns will fall into the wrong hands and be used \nimproperly.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me to pass this measure and help \nmake homes, school, and communities safer for our children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 319\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 to clarify \nthe acreage limitations and incorporate a means test for certain farm \noperations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                irrigation subsidy reduction act of 1999\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am introducing a measure that I \nsponsored in the 105th Congress to reduce the amount of federal \nirrigation subsidies received by large agribusiness interests. I \nbelieve that reforming federal water pricing policy by reducing \nsubsidies is an important area to examine as a means to achieve our \nbroader objectives of achieving a truly balanced budget. This \nlegislation is also needed to curb fundamental abuses of reclamation \nlaw that cost the taxpayer millions of dollars every year.\n  In 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt proposed legislation, which \ncame to be known as the Reclamation Act of 1902, to encourage \ndevelopment of family farms throughout the western United States. The \nidea was to provide needed water for areas that were otherwise dry and \ngive small farms--those no larger than 160 acres--a chance, with a \nhelping hand from the federal government, to establish themselves. \nAccording to a 1996 General Accounting Office report, since the passage \nof the Reclamation Act, the federal government has spent $21.8 billion \nto construct 133 water projects in the west which provide water for \nirrigation. Irrigators, and other project beneficiaries, are required \nunder the law to repay to the federal government their allocated share \nof the costs of constructing these projects.\n  However, as a result of the subsidized financing provided by the \nfederal government, some of the beneficiaries of federal water projects \nrepay considerably less than their full share of these costs. According \nto the 1996 GAO report, irrigators generally receive the largest amount \nof federal financial assistance. Since the initiation of the irrigation \nprogram in 1902, construction costs associated with irrigation have \nbeen repaid without interest. The GAO further found, in reviewing the \nBureau of Reclamation's financial reports, that $16.9 billion, or 78 \npercent, of the $21.8 billion of federal investment in water projects \nis considered to be reimbursable. Of the reimbursable costs, the \nlargest share--$7.1 billion--is allocated to irrigators. As of \nSeptember 30, 1994 irrigators have repaid only $941 million of the $7.1 \nbillion they owe. GAO also found that the Bureau of Reclamation will \nlikely shift $3.4 billion of the debt owed by irrigators to other users \nof the water projects for repayment.\n  There are several reasons why irrigators continue to receive such \nsignificant subsidies. Under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982, \nCongress acted to expand the size of the farms that could receive \nsubsidized water from 160 acres to 960 acres. The RRA of 1982 expressly \nprohibits farms that exceed 960 acres in size from receiving federally-\nsubsidized water. These restrictions were added to the Reclamation law \nto close loopholes through which federal subsidies were flowing to \nlarge agribusinesses rather than the small family farmers that \nReclamation projects were designed to serve. Agribusinesses were \nexpected to pay full cost for all water received on land in excess of \ntheir 960 acre entitlement. Despite the express mandate of Congress, \nregulations promulgated under the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 have \nfailed to keep big agricultural water users from receiving federal \nsubsidies. The General Accounting Office and the Inspector General of \nthe Department of the Interior continue to find that the acreage limits \nestablished in law are circumvented through the creation of \narrangements such as farming trusts. These trusts, which in total \nacreage well exceed the 960 acre limit, are comprised of smaller units \nthat are not subject to the reclamation acreage cap. These smaller \nunits are farmed under a single management agreement often through a \ncombination of leasing and ownership.\n  In a 1989 GAO report, the activities of six agribusiness trusts were \nfully explored. According to GAO, one 12,345 acre cotton farm (roughly \n20 square miles), operating under a single partnership, was reorganized \nto avoid the 960 acre limitation into 15 separate land holdings through \n18 partnerships, 24 corporations, and 11 trusts which were all operated \nas one large unit. A seventh trust very large trust was the sole topic \nof a 1990 GAO report. The Westhaven trust is a 23,238 acre farming \noperation in California's Central\n\n[[Page S1080]]\n\nValley. It was formed for the benefit of 326 salaried employees of the \nJ.G. Boswell Company. Boswell, GAO found, had taken advantage of \nsection 214 of the RRA, which exempts from its 960 acre limit land held \nfor beneficiaries by a trustee in a fiduciary capacity, as long as no \nsingle beneficiary's interest exceeds the law's ownership limits. The \nRRA, as I have mentioned, does not preclude multiple land holdings from \nbeing operated collectively under a trust as one farm while qualifying \nindividually for federally subsidized water. Accordingly, the J.G. \nBoswell Company re-organized 23,238 acres it held as the Boston Ranch \nby selling them to the Westhaven Trust, with the land holdings \nattributed to each beneficiary being eligible to receive federally \nsubsidized water.\n  Before the land was sold to Westhaven Trust, the J.G. Boswell Company \noperated the acreage as one large farm and paid full cost for the \nfederal irrigation water delivered for the 18-month period ending in \nMay 1989. When the trust bought the land, due to the loopholes in the \nlaw, the entire acreage became eligible to receive federally subsidized \nwater because the land holdings attributed to the 326 trust \nbeneficiaries range from 21 acres to 547 acres--all well under the 960 \nacre limit.\n  In the six cases the GAO reviewed in 1989, owners or lessees paid a \ntotal of about $1.3 million less in 1987 for federal water then they \nwould have paid if their collective land holdings were considered as \nlarge farms subject to the Reclamation Act acreage limits. Had \nWesthaven trust been required to pay full cost, GAO estimated in 1990, \nit would have paid $2 million more for its water. The GAO also found, \nin all seven of these cases, that reduced revenues are likely to \ncontinue unless Congress amends the Reclamation Act to close the \nloopholes allowing benefits for trusts.\n  The Department of the Interior has acknowledged that these problems \ndo exist. Interior published a proposed rulemaking in the Federal \nRegister on November 18, 1998. The proposed rulemaking requires farm \noperators who provide services to more than 960 nonexempt acres \nwestwide, held by a single trust or legal entity or any combination of \ntrusts and legal entities to submit RRA forms to the district(s) where \nsuch land is located. If the rule is finalized, the districts will be \nrequired to provide specific information about declaring farm operators \nto Interior annually. This information will be an important step toward \nenforcing the legislation that I am reintroducing today.\n  This legislation combines various elements of proposals introduced by \nother members of Congress to close loopholes in the 1982 legislation \nand to impose a $500,000 means test. This new approach limits the \namount of subsidized irrigation water delivered to any operation in \nexcess of the 960 acre limit which claimed $500,000 or more in gross \nincome, as reported on their most recent IRS tax form. If the $500,000 \nthreshold were exceeded, an income ratio would be used to determine how \nmuch of the water should be delivered to the user at the full-cost \nrate, and how much at the below-cost rate. For example, if a 961 acre \noperation earned $1 million dollars, a ratio of $500,000 (the means \ntest value) divided by their gross income would determine the full cost \nrate, thus the water user would pay the full cost rate on half of their \nacreage and the below cost rate on the remaining half.\n  This means testing proposal is featured, for the fourth year in a \nrow, in this year's 1999 Green Scissors report which is being released \ntoday. This report is compiled by Friends of the Earth and Taxpayers \nfor Common Sense and supported by a number of environmental, consumer \nand taxpayer groups. I am pleased to join with the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Gregg) in distributing a copy of this report to all \nmembers of the Senate. The premise of the report is that there are a \nnumber of subsidies and projects that could be cut to both reduce the \ndeficit and benefit the environment. This report underscores what I and \nmany others in the Senate have long known: we must eliminate practices \nthat can no longer be justified in light of our effort to achieve a \ntruly balanced budget and eliminate our national debt. The Green \nScissors recommendation on means testing water subsidies indicates that \nif a test is successful in reducing subsidy payments to the highest \ngrossing 10% of farms, then the federal government would recover \nbetween $440 million and $1.1 billion per year, or at least $2.2 \nbillion over five years.\n  When countless federal program are subjected to various types of \nmeans tests to limit benefits to those who truly need assistance, it \nmakes little sense to continue to allow large business interests to dip \ninto a program intended to help small entities struggling to survive. \nTaxpayers have legitimate concerns when they learn that their hard \nearned tax dollars are being expended to assist large corporate \ninterests in select regions of the country who benefit from these \nloopholes, particularly in tight budgetary times. Other users of \nfederal water projects, such as the power recipients, should also be \nconcerned when they learn that they will be expected to pick up the tab \nfor a portion of the funds that irrigators were supposed to pay back. \nThe federal water program was simply never intended to benefit these \nlarge interests, and I am hopeful that legislative efforts, such as the \nmeasure I am introducing today, will prompt Congress to fully \nreevaluate our federal water pricing policy.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, it is clear that the conflicting \npolicies of the federal government in this area are in need of reform, \nand that Congress should act. Large agribusinesses should not be able \nto continue to soak the taxpayers, and should pay their fair share. We \nshould act to close these loopholes and increase the return to the \ntreasury from irrigators as soon as possible. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of the measure be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 320\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Irrigation Subsidy Reduction \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal reclamation program has been in existence \n     for over 90 years, with an estimated taxpayer investment of \n     over $70,000,000,000;\n       (2) the program has had and continues to have an enormous \n     effect on the water resources and aquatic environments of the \n     western States;\n       (3) irrigation water made available from Federal water \n     projects in the West is a very valuable resource for which \n     there are increasing and competing demands;\n       (4) the justification for providing water at less than full \n     cost was to benefit and promote the development of small \n     family farms and exclude large corporate farms, but this \n     purpose has been frustrated over the years due to inadequate \n     implementation of subsidy and acreage limits;\n       (5) below-cost water prices tend to encourage excessive use \n     of scarce water supplies in the arid regions of the West, and \n     reasonable price increases to the wealthiest western farmers \n     would provide an economic incentive for greater water \n     conservation;\n       (6) the Federal Government has increasingly applied \n     eligibility tests based on income for Federal entitlement and \n     subsidy programs, measures that are consistent with the \n     historic approach of the reclamation program's acreage \n     limitations that seek to limit water subsidies to smaller \n     farms; and\n       (7) including a means test based on gross income in the \n     reclamation program will increase the effectiveness of \n     carrying out the family farm goals of the Federal reclamation \n     laws.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to streamline, modernize, and enhance the authority of \nthe Secretary of Agriculture relating to plant protection and \nquarantine, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                    THE PLANT PROTECTION ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Plant Protection Act of 1999''--a comprehensive bill which will focus \nthe effort of federal agencies in fighting noxious weeds and other \nplant pests.\n  Noxious weeds are a serious problem on both public and private lands \nacross the nation. They are particularly troublesome in the West where \nmuch of our land is entrusted to the management of the federal \ngovernment. A ``slow burning wildfire,'' noxious weeds take land out of \nproduction, force native species off the land, and interrupt the \ncommerce and activities of all those who rely on the land for their \nlivelihoods--including farmers, ranchers, recreationists, and others.\n  The bill I introduce today will focus the efforts of the federal \ngovernment to better fight this wildfire. It organizes and expands the \nfunctions of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and \nappoints it as the lead government agency in this fight.\n  The bill was drafted with the assistance and advice of APHIS as well \nas several national agriculture organizations such as the American \nNursery\n\n[[Page S1082]]\n\nand Landscape Association, National Association of State Departments of \nAgriculture, National Christmas Tree Association, National Potato \nCouncil, and American Farm Bureau Federation. The Idaho Department of \nAgriculture and many concerned citizens from my state have also helped \nme shape the bill I introduce today.\n  Similar legislation will be introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives some time next month by Representative Canady of \nFlorida. The two bills have only one difference. The bill I introduce \ntoday lacks the section on federal preemption included in Mr. Canady's \nlegislation. This is an issue that will have to be addressed during the \nlegislative process. I will admit that APHIS will not endorse the \nlegislation without the preemption section. However, I am confident \nthat, working together with all of those interested in fighting noxious \nweeds at the federal and state levels, we can resolve this matter in a \nway we might all agree to.\n  Working together is what this entire effort is about. Along that same \nvein, I know of several Senators with an interest in this issue, \nincluding Senator Akaka who introduced legislation on this matter \nearlier this month, and I hope we can work together in finding a \nsolution we can all support. In addition, I might mention that it is my \nunderstanding that the President and the Secretary of the Interior have \nexpressed interest in noxious weeds and may be planning their own \nannouncement. I invite them--indeed, I invite everyone interested in \nthis matter--to work with me to find an approach which confronts this \nproblem head on.\n  Mr. President, I believe we must focus our efforts to rid our lands \nof these noxious weeds and plant pests. We must reclaim the rangeland \nfor natural species. We must return the acres of lost farmland to \nproduction. Doing so will require the combined efforts of the federal \ngovernment, state governments, local weed control boards, and private \nland owners.\n  I believe the ``Plant Protection Act of 1999'' is the first step in \nthis process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unaminous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 321\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 4, United States Code, to add the \nMartin Luther King Jr. holiday to the list of days on which the flag \nshould especially be displayed; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n      The Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Recognition Act of 1999\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation that would amend the ``Flag Code'' to add the Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. holiday to the list of days on which the American flag should \nbe displayed nationwide.\n  It is a testament to the greatness of Martin Luther King, Jr., that \nnearly every major city in the U.S. has a street or school named after \nhim. I have to admit, I was surprised to learn that the American flag \nwas not flown to commemorate the Dr. King holiday.\n  Dr. King, a minister, prolific writer and Nobel Prize winner \noriginated the nonviolence strategy within the activist civil rights \nmovement. He was one of the most important black leaders of his era and \nin American history.\n  When Dr. King was tragically assassinated on April 4, 1968, he had \nalready transformed himself as a national hero and a pioneer in trying \nto unite a divided nation. He strove to build communities of hope and \nopportunity for\n\n[[Page S1087]]\n\nall and recognized that all Americans must be free to truly have a \ngreat country.\n  Dr. King was a person who wanted all people to get along regardless \nof their race, color or creed. His holiday came about due to the work \nof many determined people who wanted all of us to pause to remember his \nlegacy.\n  This legislation simply would make sure that we celebrate his \nbirthday as a federal holiday in the fashion afforded to other great \nAmericans whose birthdays are cause for national commemoration. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 322\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ADDITION OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. HOLIDAY TO LIST \n                   OF DAYS.\n\n       Section 6(d) of title 4, United States Code, is amended by \n     inserting ``Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, third Monday \n     in January;'' after ``January 20;''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 323. A bill to redesignate the Black Canyon of the Gunnison \nNational Monument as a national park and establish the Gunnison Gorge \nNational Conservation Area, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n  black canyon national park and gunnison gorge national conservation \n                            area act of 1999\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to create the Black Canyon National Park. This bill is \nbased on legislation which I introduced in the 104th Congress, but has \nbeen revised to include additional input from the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the National Park Service. In 1996, as the former \nChairman of the Subcommittee on Parks, Historic Preservation and \nRecreation, I conducted a field hearing and received input from local \ngroups and individuals which I also incorporated into my new bill.\n  With its narrow opening, sheer walls, and scenic depths, the Black \nCanyon is a jewel in North America. Nearly everyone who has visited the \nsite is struck by the breathtaking beauty of this 2,000 foot deep, \nnearly impenetrable canyon. The canyon is also home to a vast \nassortment of wildlife that range from chipmunks to black bear, from \nbobcats to coyotes. Its unique combination of geologic features makes \nthe Black Canyon deserving of National Park status.\n  This legislation has been a long time coming to the State of \nColorado, and in particular, the Western Slope of my state. My Black \nCanyon bill incorporates the input of the federal agencies involved \nand, in my view, represents an innovative approach to protecting unique \nnatural resources for future generations in the most fiscally \nresponsible manner possible.\n  This legislation does far more than simply create a new national park \nfrom what is now a national monument. This legislation establishes a \ncooperative approach to managing this natural resource and calls on all \naffected resource management agencies in the area to play key \ncollaborative roles.\n  I want to stress that this legislation does not increase federal \nexpenditures, and the collective management approach this legislation \ncreates does not in any way require, imply, or contemplate an attempt \nby the Federal Government to usurp state water rights, state water law, \nor intrude upon private property rights.\n  The Secretary of the Interior will manage the entire area and will be \nable to utilize all available fiscal and human resources in the \nadministration and management of this natural resource in a unique, \nmoney-saving manner. This legislation will also eliminate duplicate \noperations and form a coordinated, efficient and fiscally responsible \nmanagement structure.\n  I have worked to forge consensus on this issue, and I am pleased to \npropose this cooperative management plan for this beautiful example of \nour natural heritage. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this \nbill. I ask unanimous consent that the bill and letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 323\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: The Montrose Chamber of Commerce, \n     Board of Directors, has been informed of your intent to \n     introduce legislation regarding the Black Canyon National \n     Park endeavor. We are writing to endorse the legislation. The \n     Black Canyon is truly one of God's gifts to Colorado. By \n     giving it National Park status, it receives the accolades it \n     deserves.\n       Please keep us apprised as to the status of the \n     legislation. If there is any way we can assist with your \n     efforts please do not hesitate to ask. We thank you for your \n     efforts and dedication to Western Colorado and its citizens.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Marge Keehfuss,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Board of County Commissioners,\n\n\n                                          Gunnison County, CO,\n\n                                                 January 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Senator, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: As you are aware, the National Park \n     Service administers the lands within Curecanti National \n     Recreation Area under a 1965 agreement with the Bureau of \n     Reclamation. Colorado State Highway 92 is one of the most \n     scenic drives in Colorado as it skirts the Black Canyon on \n     the Gunnison within and adjacent to Curecanti. This portion \n     of the highway is also designated as a component of the West \n     Elk Loop Scenic and Historic Byway. The preservation of the \n     rural values now dominating Highway 92 will play an important \n     role in maintaining the quality of life for area residents as \n     well as providing a quality visitor experience worth \n     remembering. The National Park Service has been working with \n     two willing landowners that own property adjacent to Highway \n     92 and within the Curecanti National Recreation Area. \n     Collectively, this ownership represents 1,065 acres and \n     development of this significant amount of land would forever \n     alter the scenic values.\n       We realize the National Park Service has very limited \n     authority to acquire lands outside of its boundaries. This is \n     especially true for the recreation area since its boundary \n     has never been formally established. Therefore, it is our \n     understanding that specific authority will need to be granted \n     through legislation by Congress in order to adjust the \n     boundary and acquire these lands.\n       The Gunnison County Board of Commissioners is very \n     supportive of these properties being acquired by the National \n     Park Service. The Board of Commissioners would encourage you \n     to also support this acquisition and hopes you would consider \n     sponsoring legislation to achieve this goal. If you have any \n     questions regarding Gunnison County's support of this \n     acquisition or its importance, please don't hesitate to \n     contact my office.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                      John DeVore,\n                                           County Manager.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 324. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act with respect to \nregistration requirements for practitioners who dispense narcotic drugs \nin schedule IV or V for maintenance treatment or detoxification \ntreatment; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                THE DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce S. 324, the \n``Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999''--the DATA Act. The goal in \nthis bill is simple but it is important: S. 324 attempts to help make \ndrug treatment more available and more effective.\n  In developing this legislation I have worked closely with \nRepresentative Thomas Bliley of Virginia, Chairman of the House \nCommittee on Commerce who plans to introduce shortly the House \ncounterpart of this bill. I am very pleased to report that in \nsponsoring this bi-partisan bill I am joined by two colleagues from \nacross the aisle--Senator Levin from Michigan and Senator Moynihan from \nNew York. Senators Levin and Moynihan and I have long shared an \ninterest in speeding the development of anti-addiction medications.\n  One of the most troublesome problems that our Nation faces today is \ndrug abuse. The spectrum of deleterious by-products of drug abuse \ninclude rampant and often violent crime, breakdown in family life and \nother fundamental social structures, and the inability of addicted \nindividuals to reach their full potential as contributing members of \nAmerican society. For example, a 1997 report by the Utah State Division \nof Substance Abuse, ``Substance Abuse and Need for Treatment Among \nJuvenile Arrestees in Utah'' cites literature reporting that heroin-\nusing offenders committed 15 times more robberies, 20 times more \nburglaries, and 10 times more thefts than offenders who do not use \ndrugs.\n  In my own state of Utah--I am sorry to report--a 1997 survey by the \nState Division of Substance Abuse reported that 9.6% of Utahns--one in \nten of our citizens--used illicit drugs in the past month. That is \nsimply too high.\n  Unfortunately, no state or city in our great Nation is immune from \nthe dangers of illicit drugs. I want the children of Utah to grow up \ndrug free so that they may realize their enormous potential. And I want \nto help my neighbors in Salt Lake and fellow citizens across Utah and \nthroughout the country who are addicted to break the grip of this \ndeadly epidemic.\n  The wide variety of negative behaviors associated with drug abuse \nrequire policymakers to employ a wide variety of techniques to cut down \nboth the supply of and demand for illegal drugs. We must do all we can \ndo to stop the criminal behavior involved in supplying the contraband \nproducts as well as taking steps to stop all Americans from starting or \ncontinuing to use drugs.\n  This legislation I am introducing today focuses on increasing the \navailability and effectiveness of drug treatment. The purpose of the \nDrug Addiction Treatment Act of 1999 is to allow qualified physicians, \nas determined by experts at the Department of Health and Human \nServices, to prescribe schedule IV and V anti-addiction medications in \nphysicians' offices without an additional Drug Enforcement \nAdministration (DEA) registration if certain conditions are met.\n  These conditions include certification by participating physicians \nthat: they are licensed under state law and have the training and \nexperience to treat opium addicts; they have the capacity to refer \npatients to counseling and other ancillary services; and they will not \ntreat more than 20 in an office setting unless the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services adjusts this number.\n  The DATA provisions allow the Secretary, as appropriate, to add to \nthese conditions and allow the Attorney General to terminate a \nphysician's DEA registration if these conditions are violated. This \nprogram will continue after three years only if the Secretary and \nAttorney General determine that this new type of decentralized \ntreatment should not continue based on a number of determinations. \nThese determinations include whether the availability of drug treatment \nhas significantly increased without adverse consequences to the public \nhealth and the extent to which covered drugs have been diverted or \ndispensed in violation of the law such as exceeding the initial 20-\npatient per doctor limitation. This bill would allow the Secretary and \nAttorney General to discontinue the program earlier than three years \nif, upon consideration of the specified factors, they determine that \nearly termination is advisable.\n  Nothing in the waiver policy undertaken in the new bill is intended \nto change the rules pertaining to methadone clinics or other facilities \nor practitioners that conduct drug treatment services under the dual \nregistration system imposed by current law.\n  In drafting the waiver provisions of the bill, the co-sponsors have \nconsulted with the Drug Enforcement Agency, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse. As well, this \ninitiative is consistent with the recent announcement of the Director \nof the Office of National Drug Control Policy, General Barry McCaffrey, \nof the Administration's intent to work to decentralize methadone \ntreatment.\n\n[[Page S1090]]\n\n  In 1995, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of \nSciences issued a report, ``Development of Medications for Opiate and \nCocaine Addictions: Issues for the Government and Private Sector.'' The \nstudy called for ``(d)eveloping flexible, alternative means of \ncontrolling the dispensing of anti-addiction narcotic medications that \nwould avoid the `methadone model' of individually approved treatment \ncenters.''\n  The Drug Addiction Treatment Act--DATA--is exactly the kind of policy \ninitiative that experts have called for in America's multifaceted \nresponse to the drug abuse epidemic. I recognize that the DATA \nlegislation is just one mechanism to attack this problem and I plan to \nwork with my colleagues to devise additional strategies to reduce both \nthe supply and demand for drugs. I urge all my colleagues to support S. \n324 because it promises to get more patients into treatment and back on \nthe road to honest, productive lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of S. 324 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 324\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the need for additional anti-\naddiction medications is a matter of great concern to me and an issue \nthat I have been deeply involved with for a number of years. We must \ncome up with new medications which block the craving of heroin. This is \nwhy I am very pleased to join with Senator Hatch and Senator Moynihan \nin introducing legislation that would establish the infrastructure to \nenable qualified physicians to prescribe schedule IV and V anti-\naddiction medications in their offices without an additional DEA \nregistration if certain conditions are met. This will allow for a \npromising new drug, buprenorphine, to be used in the treatment of \nopiate addiction in physicians offices, under a separate registration \nfrom the Attorney General. Specific conditions would have to be met. \nThese conditions include: Certification by participating physicians \nthat they are licensed under state law and have the training and \nexperience to treat heroin addicts; and that they have the capacity to \nrefer patients to counseling and other ancillary services.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of reasons why this legislation is \nnecessary. The Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974, requires separate \nDEA registrations for physicians who want to use approved narcotics in \ndrug abuse treatment and separate approvals of registrants by U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) and by state agencies. \nThe result has been a treatment system consisting primarily of large \nmethadone clinics located in big cities, and preventing physicians from \ntreating patients in an office setting or in rural areas or small \ntowns, thereby denying treatment to thousands in need of it. \nAdditionally, experts say that many heroin addicts who want treatment \nare often deterred because of the stigma that is associated with such \nwith such clinics.\n  The intent of our legislation is to exclude medications like \nbuprenorphine from burdensome regulatory requirements of the Narcotic \nTreatment Act, in order to carry drug abuse treatment beyond the \nmethadone clinics and into physicians' offices. In so doing, the \nlegislation includes protections against abuse. These protections \ninclude the following: Physicians may not treat more than 20 patients \nin an office setting unless the HHS Secretary adjusts this number; the \nHHS Secretary, as appropriate, may add to these conditions and allow \nthe Attorney General to terminate a physician's DEA registration if \nthese conditions are violated; and the program will continue after \nthree years only if the HHS Secretary and Attorney General determine \nthat this new type of decentralized treatment should continue based on \na number of determinations.\n  The National Institute on Drug Abuse [NIDA], under a Cooperative \nResearch and Development Agreement with a pharmaceutical manufacturer, \nhas helped to develop buprenorphine, which is expected to be approved \nby the Food and Drug Administration in the near future. The Congress, \nNIDA and the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine (IOM) \nhave long recognized the urgent need to develop new medications for \ndrug addiction treatment. This is evident in the enactment of the Anti-\nDrug Abuse Act of 1988, which established the Medications Development \nDivision of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and the enactment of \nlegislation requiring HHS and IOM to cooperate in the development of \nanti-addiction medications.\n  Recent data show that five out of six opiate addicts are currently \nnot in treatment. This has contributed to a continuing public health \ncrisis of significant proportions--the age of first heroin use is \ndropping; the number of heroin users is increasing; and the number of \npeople becoming dependent on heroin is increasing. According to NIDA, \nthe incidence of first-time use of herion in the 12-17 year old group \nhas increased fourfold from the 1980s to 1995.\n  These facts and sentiments were also expressed by experts in this \nfield of critical importance to the Nation during a May 9, 1997 Drug \nForum on Anti-addiction Research, which I convened along with Senator \nMoynihan and Senator Bob Kerrey. Forum participants, including \ndistinguished experts such as Dr. Herbert Kleber and Dr. Donald Landry \nof Columbia University, Dr. Charles Schuster of Wayne State University \nand Dr. James Woods of the University of Michigan, made it crystal \nclear that time is of the essence--we must act expeditiously on new \ntreatment discoveries. According to public health experts, the \nuntreated population of opiate addicts (and other injection drug users) \nis the primary means for the spread of HIV, hepatitis B and C, and \ntuberculosis into the general population, not to mention the families \nof such addicted persons. Failure to block the craving for drugs along \nwith failure to provide traditional treatment will most certainly \ncontinue the spiral of huge health care costs--costs that will largely \nbe borne not by the addicts, not by insurance companies--but by the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Buprenorphine, currently in Schedule V of the Controlled Substances \nAct, has a unique property--it has a ceiling effect, it is well \ntolerated by opiate addicted persons, and has a very low value for \ndiversion on the street. Clinical trials conducted in 12 hospitals \naround the United States proved the new medication to be an extremely \neffective treatment medication. According to NIDA, of the 100,000 \nheroin addicts in France, between 40,000-50,000 addicts are being \ntreated with buprenorphine without ill effects. Dr. Donald Wesson, \nChairman of the American Society of Addiction Medicine {ASAM  \nMedication Development Committee wrote: ``The availability of \nbuprenorphine in physicians' offices adds a needed level of care and is \none avenue to expand current opioid treatment capacity. ASAM strongly \nsupports federal legislation to enable buprenorphine to be prescribed \nin physicians' offices for treatment of opioid dependence . . . We are \nvery pleased to see that the bill makes provisions for physician \ntraining and qualification.''\n  Mr. President, finally, there are a number of questions that I raised \nwith NIDA regarding buprenorphine prior to the introduction of this \nlegislation which I would like to share with my colleagues in the \nSenate. I would also like to share the informative memo on this subject \nwhich I received from The American Society of Addiction Medicine \n(ASAM). I ask unanimous consent that the October 5, 1998 reply from \nNIDA Director, Dr. Alan Leshner, and the October 8, 1998 memo from Dr. \nDonald R. Wesson of ASAM be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Department of Health & Human Services, National Institute \n           on Drug Abuse,\n                                   Rockville, MD, October 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for your letter dated \n     September 17 requesting the views of the National Institute \n     on Drug Abuse (NIDA) regarding the use of buprenorphine and \n     buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of opiate \n     dependence. Your letter asked us to address three specific \n     questions. Our answers are provided below.\n       Question No. 1. Is buprenorphine (alone and in combination) \n     a safe and effective treatment for drug addiction?\n       While the ultimate decision concerning safety and efficacy \n     rests with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), NIDA has \n     funded many studies that support the safety and efficacy of \n     buprenorphine and the buprenorphine/naloxone combination for \n     the treatment of opiate dependence. During the time NIDA has \n     studied this medication, we have been impressed with its \n     safety and efficacy as a treatment for opiate dependence. \n     Over the last 5 years, NIDA has worked with Reckitt & Colman \n     Pharmaceuticals, Inc., under a Cooperative Research and \n     Development Agreement in an attempt to bring buprenorphine \n     (which the FDA has designated as an orphan product), to a \n     marketable status in the United States. These studies have \n     been submitted by Reckitt & Colman to the FDA in support of a \n     New Drug Application for buprenorphine products in\n\n[[Page S1092]]\n\n     the treatment of opiate dependence. The major studies of \n     relevance have shown that buprenorphine is more effective \n     than a low dose of methadone (Johnson et al, J.A.M.A., 1992), \n     and that an orderly dose effect of buprenorphine on reduction \n     of opiate use occurred (Ling et al, Addiction, 1998). Most \n     recently, buprenorphine tablets (either buprenorphine alone \n     or the combination with naxolone) were shown in a large \n     clinical trial to be superior to placebo treatment in \n     reducing opiate use (Fudala et al, CPDD, 1998). Additional \n     clinical studies have shown that the addition of naxolone to \n     the buprenorphine tablet decreased the response to \n     buprenorphine when the combination is injected under \n     controlled conditions. This means that when persons attempt \n     to dissolve the tablets and inject them, they will either \n     experience withdrawal or a diminished buprenorphine effect. \n     These properties will make buprenorphine combined with \n     naxolone undesirable for diversion to illicit use, especially \n     when compared with other existing illegal and legal opiate \n     products.\n       Pharmacologically, buprenorphine is related to morphine but \n     is a partial agonist (possesses both agonist and antagonist \n     properties). Partial agonists exhibit ceiling effects (i.e., \n     increasing the dose only has effects to a certain level). \n     Therefore, partial agonists usually have greater safety \n     profiles than full agonists (such as heroin or morphine and \n     certain analgesic products chemically related to morphine). \n     This means that buprenorphine is less likely to cause \n     respiratory depression, the major toxic effect of opiate \n     drugs, in comparison to full agonists such as morphine or \n     heroin. We believe this will translate into a greatly reduced \n     chance of accidental or intentional overdose. Another benefit \n     of buprenorphine is that the withdrawal syndrome seen upon \n     discontinuation with buprenorphine is, at worst, mild to \n     moderate and can often be managed without administration of \n     narcotics.\n       Question No. 2. Do current regulations properly set forth \n     the rules for administration, delivery, and use of these \n     drugs?\n       There are no current regulations which address the use of \n     buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone for the treatment of \n     opiate dependence because these products are not yet approved \n     for this purpose by the FDA. The current regulations (21 CFR \n     291) for administration and delivery of narcotic medications \n     in the treatment of narcotic dependent persons were written \n     for the use of full agonist medications such as methadone \n     with demonstrated abuse potential and do not take into \n     account the unique pharmacological properties of these drugs. \n     Therefore, these regulations would need to be re-examined and \n     substantially rewritten in order to recognize the unique \n     possibilities posed by buprenorphine/naloxone. Among these \n     are the potential to administer buprenorphine and \n     buprenorphine/naloxone in settings and situations other than \n     the formal Narcotic Treatment Programs (NTPs) which have \n     existed to date under existing regulations. As you may be \n     aware, NTPs are the most highly regulated form of medicine \n     practiced in the U.S., as they are subject to Federal, State, \n     and local regulation. Under this regulatory burden, expansion \n     of this system has been static for many years. This has \n     resulted in a ``treatment gap'', which is defined as the \n     difference between the number of opiate dependent persons and \n     those in treatment. The gap currently is over 600,000 persons \n     and represents 75-80% of all addicts.\n       It may be useful to note the status of the last new product \n     introduced to the opiate dependence treatment market \n     (levoacetyl methadol, tradename ORLAAM). ORLAAM was an orphan \n     product developed by NIDA and a U.S. small business in the \n     early 1990s for narcotic dependence. ORLAAM was approved by \n     the FDA as a treatment medication for opiate dependence in \n     July 1993. In the five years since its approval and \n     dispensing under the more restrictive rules relating to the \n     use of full agonist medications (21 CFR 291), ORLAAM has been \n     poorly utilized to increase treatment for narcotic \n     dependence. It is estimated that 2,000 of the estimated \n     120,000 patients in narcotic treatment programs are receiving \n     ORLAAM. The failure of ORLAAM to make an appreciable impact \n     under the more restrictive rules suggests that if \n     buprenorphine is to make an appreciable impact on the \n     ``treatment gap'' it must be delivered under different rules \n     and regulations.\n       The issue then becomes why should buprenorphine products be \n     delivered differently from ORLAAM and methadone. First, \n     buprenorphine's different pharmacology should be kept in mind \n     when rules and regulations are promulgated. The regulatory \n     burden should be determined based on a review of the risks to \n     individuals and society of this medication being dispensed by \n     prescription and commensurate with its safety profile, as is \n     the case with evaluation of all controlled substances. It is \n     our understanding that the Drug Enforcement Administration \n     has recognized the difference between buprenorphine treatment \n     products and those currently subject to 21 CFR 291 and has \n     communicated these views to your staff. Second, there are \n     many narcotic addicts who refuse treatment under the current \n     system. In a recent NIDA funded study (NIDA/VA #1008), \n     approximately 50% of the subjects had never been in treatment \n     before. Of that group, fully half maintained that they did \n     not want treatment in the current narcotic treatment program \n     system. The opportunity to participate in a new treatment \n     regimen (buprenorphine) was a motivating factor. Fear of \n     stigmatization is a very real factor holding back narcotic \n     dependent individuals from entering treatment. Third, \n     narcotic addiction is spreading from urban to suburban areas. \n     The current system, which tends to be concentrated in urban \n     areas, is a poor fit for the suburban spread of narcotic \n     addiction. There are many communities whose zoning will not \n     permit the establishment of narcotic treatment facilities, \n     which has in part been responsible for the treatment gap \n     described above. While narcotic treatment capacity has been \n     static, there has been an increase in the amount of heroin of \n     high purity. The high purity of this heroin has made it \n     possible to nasally ingest (snort) or smoke heroin. This \n     change in the route of heroin administration removes a major \n     taboo, injection and its attendant use of needles, from \n     initiation and experimentation with heroin use. The result of \n     these new routes of administration is an increase in the \n     number of younger Americans experimenting with, and becoming \n     addicted to, heroin. The incidence of first-time use of \n     heroin in the 12 to 17 year old group has increased fourfold \n     from the 1980s to 1995. Treatment for adolescents should be \n     accessible, and graduated to the level of dependence \n     exhibited in the patient. Buprenorphine products will likely \n     be the initial medication(s) for most of the heroin-dependent \n     adolescents.\n       Question No. 3: Should more physicians be permitted to \n     dispense these drugs under controlled circumstances?\n       It is our contention that more treatment should be made \n     more widely available for the reasons stated above. The \n     safety and effectiveness profiles for buprenorphine and \n     buprenorphine/naloxone suggest they could be dispensed under \n     controlled circumstances that would be delineated in the \n     product labeling and associated rules and regulations. As \n     currently envisioned, buprenorphine and buprenorphine/\n     naloxone would be prescription, Schedule V controlled \n     substances. The treatment of patients by physicians or group \n     practice would allow office-based treatment to augment the \n     current system, while placing an adequate level of control on \n     the dispensing of these medications. Given the increased need \n     for treatment, the relative safety and efficacy of the \n     treatment product, and the development of a regulatory scheme \n     satisfactory to the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     we believe that these goals could be accomplished in a timely \n     and effective manner.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to respond to your questions. \n     Should you need additional information, please feel free to \n     contact me again.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Alan I. Leshner, Ph.D,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Chairman, Medication Development Committee, The American Society of \n                  Addiction Medicine, October 8, 1998\n\n                       (By Donald R. Wesson, M.D.)\n\n       Clinical experience within the context of narcotic \n     treatment clinics, drug abuse treatment clinics, and private \n     practice shows that opioid \\1\\ abusers are very diverse in \n     lifestyle, extent of involvement in the drug subculture, and \n     criminal activities. Clinical experience has also established \n     that many opioid abusers relapse to opioid use unless they \n     are maintained on medications with opioid properties.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Opioid is a broad term that covers drugs and medications \n     with morphine-like effects. Technically, opiate refers to \n     drugs or medications that are derived from the opium poppy \n     plant. The most common abused opiate is heroin; however, \n     synthetic medications with morphine-like effects, such a \n     fentanyl, are also abused. Opioid is the more inclusive term. \n     Opioid and opiate are often used interchangeably.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Opioid maintenance treatment, by blocking the effect of \n     illicit opioids and stabilizing patients' emotional states, \n     allows patients to receive outpatient treatment while making \n     the life-style changes needed to remain abstinent. Most \n     opioid abusers will relapse to illicit opioid abuse unless \n     they are also provided drug counseling, group therapy or \n     individual psychotherapy; however, all opioid abusers do not \n     require the same level of drug abuse treatment services. Some \n     need the highly-structured, behavior modification services \n     and maintenance with methadone or LAAM. Others require less \n     intensive drug abuse treatment and could be adequately \n     treated with a less potent opioid maintenance medication, \n     such as buprenorphine, provided within the context of \n     physicians' offices in conjunction with an appropriate level \n     of psychosocial services.\n       Treatment of opioid addiction has for many years been \n     separated from mainstream medical practice. There is a body \n     of specialized knowledge concerning treatment of opioid \n     addiction that has evolved from clinical experience with \n     methadone maintenance and from non-narcotic treatment of \n     opioid addiction. Unlike most areas of medicine in which \n     physicians voluntarily confine their medical practice to \n     areas in which they have specialized training, treatment of \n     drug abusers is unusual in that many physicians may assume \n     competence that they may not, in fact, possess. At the \n     present time, many physicians who are not addiction \n     specialists do not understand addiction, particularly \n     narcotic addiction. Further, there are no generally accepted \n     practice guidelines for office-based narcotic addiction \n     treatment.\n       The American Society on Addiction Medicine strongly \n     supports the position that physicians appropriately trained \n     and qualified in\n\n[[Page S1093]]\n\n     the treatment of opiate withdrawal and opiate dependence \n     should be permitted to prescribe buprenorphine in the normal \n     course of medical practice and in accordance with appropriate \n     medical practice guidelines, and that federal controlled \n     substance scheduling guidelines and other federal and state \n     regulations should permit buprenorphine to be made available \n     for physicians to prescribe to their patients in accordance \n     with documented clinical indications.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Adopted by ASAM Board April 15, 1998.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) has a \n     certification examination in addiction medicine and the \n     American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology has a \n     certification examination in addiction psychiatry. The \n     American Society of Addiction Medicine, the American \n     Methadone Treatment Association and the American Academy of \n     Addiction Psychiatry have agreed to develop guidelines and \n     physician training for use of opioids in office-based \n     physician practices.\n       It is highly desirable that physicians who plan to \n     prescribe opioids from their offices be certified by one of \n     the national organizations that offers training and \n     certification in addiction medicine or psychiatry.\n       A problem with current federal regulation of opioid \n     treatment is that opioid maintenance is viewed as a treatment \n     of last resort and only possible within the context of \n     specially licensed clinics with methadone or LAAM. Because of \n     costs, or limited public sector treatment capacity, or \n     because they do not meet state and federal requirements for \n     maintenance with methadone or LAAM, many patients who need \n     opioid medication treatment cannot access methadone or LAAM \n     treatment. The availability of buprenorphine in physicians' \n     offices adds a needed level of care and is one avenue to \n     expand current opioid treatment capacity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Nickles, Mr. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \n        Thomas, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 325. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives to encourage production of oil and gas within the United \nStates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  the u.s. energy economic growth act\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nthe U.S. Energy Economic Growth Act.\n  Mr. President, the oil and gas industry in this country is in a state \nof crisis. In energy producing states, we are hearing daily from our \nconstituents about this crisis.\n  This week the oil and gas rig count hit an all-time low of 588 rigs \nnationwide. This is down from nearly 5,000 rigs operating in 1981. \nCrude oil prices are at their lowest point in decades, and some think \nthey will fall further.\n  According to the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, for every \ndollar drop in the price of oil, ten thousand Texas jobs are at risk. \nLast year, the energy industry lost 30,000 jobs in the United States.\n  Mr. President, not only is this an economic issue, it's a national \nsecurity issue. We are importing more oil than we produce. This is not \na healthy situation for shaping our foreign policy agenda.\n  To reverse these trends and increase our energy independence, I have \nworked, on a bi-partisan basis, to develop the U.S. Energy Economic \nGrowth Act.\n  This legislation provides tax incentives in two significant areas to \nboost U.S. oil production. First, the legislation would provide a $3 \ndollar a barrel tax credit, on the first three barrels that can offset \nthe cost of keeping marginal wells operating at a time of low prices.\n  Marginal wells are those that produce 15 barrels a day or less. On \naverage, they produce two barrels a day. There are close to 500,000 \nsuch wells across the U.S. that collectively produce 20 percent of \nAmerica's oil. To put this in perspective, we import 20 percent of our \noil from Saudia Arabia. Texas, alone, has 100,000 marginal wells. \nRegrettably, 48,000 wells have been idled or shut in the past year.\n  In recent months, some marginal well producers report prices as low \nas $6 per barrel. If we don't act soon, these producers--and the \nthousands they employ--will go out of business.\n  These marginal wells can still be profitable for all of us. In 1998, \nthese low-volume wells generated $314 million in taxes paid annually to \nstate governments.\n  Second, Mr. President, the bill would provide incentives to restart \ninactive wells by offering producers a tax exemption for the costs of \ndoing so.\n  In Texas, a similar program has resulted in 6,000 wells being \nreturned to production, injecting approximately $1.65 billion into the \nTexas economy.\n  Mr. President, improving the production and flow from both marginal \nwells and inactive wells will do a great deal to improve our energy \nproduction. This is vital to improving the state of the U.S. oil and \ngas industry.\n  I am pleased that this legislation has 18 co-sponsors from both sides \nof the aisle. I would invite all members of the Senate to join me as a \nco-sponsor.\n  This morning I testified before the Senate Energy Committee on this \nbill. Certainly that Committee recognizes the gravity of this \nsituation. I would hope that, with the introduction of this bill, the \nSenate as a whole will begin to focus on this problem and we can begin \nfinding solutions.\n Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise today to join in offering \nthe U.S. Energy and Economic Growth Act. This legislation is an effort \nto help revive our domestic oil and gas industry which plays such a \nvital role in our national security. If our domestic industry is to \nsurvive, then Congress needs to act now to provide tax incentives to \nencourage energy production in America.\n  Since the early 1980's, oil and gas extraction employment has been \ncut in half. Employment in the oil and gas industry has declined by \nalmost 500,000 since 1984. Imports of crude oil products were $71 \nbillion in 1977, and the import dependency ratio now exceeds fifty \npercent. From 1973 to 1998, crude oil production dropped 43% in the \nlower 48 states. We must take action now to save domestic production \nnot only for the sake of the oil and gas industry but for the sake of \nthe national security of this nation.\n  To date, the Clinton Administration has done nothing to encourage \ndomestic production. In the President's State of the Union address, he \nnamed no initiatives to aid this troubled industry and recently, his \nAdministration has conspired with the U.N. to almost double the amount \nof oil Iraq can export under the so-called food-for-oil program.\n  The U.S. Energy and Economic Growth Act is intended to do just what \nits name implies--preserve and revitalize the domestic oil and gas \nindustry through economic incentives to production. This bill would \naccomplish these goals through specific tax proposals.\n  Marginal wells are those which produce less than 15 barrels per day \nor gas wells which produce less than 90 thousand cubic feet per day. \nThe United States has over 500,000 marginal wells producing nearly 700 \nmillion barrels of oil each year and contributing 80,000 jobs and $14 \nbillion to the annual economy.\n  This legislation provides incentives to keep these valuable wells in \nproduction through a $3 per barrel tax credit on the first three \nbarrels of daily production, or $0.50 per mcf for the first 18 mcf of \ndaily natural gas production. These credits would only apply when low \nmarket prices necessitated them for the survival of the industry, and \nare phased out when prices increase.\n  In an effort to reclaim oil lost to closed wells, this bill allows \nproducers to exclude income attributable to oil and natural gas from a \nrecovered inactive well. The provision only applies to wells which have \nbeen inactive for at least two years prior to the date of enactment, \nand which are recovered within five years from the date of enactment.\n  The U.S. Energy and Economic Growth Act would also allow current \nexpensing of geological and geophysical costs incurred domestically \nincluding the Outer Continental Shelf. These costs are an important and \nintegral part of exploration and production for oil and natural gas, \nand should be expensed.\n  Furthermore, this bill clarifies that delay rental payments are \ndeductible, at the election of the taxpayer, as ordinary and necessary \nbusiness expenses. This clarifies an otherwise gray area in Treasury \nregulations and eliminates costly administrative and compliance burdens \non both taxpayers and the IRS.\n  Lastly, the legislation includes hydro injection and horizontal \ndrilling as tertiary recovery methods for purposes of\n\n[[Page S1094]]\n\nthe Enhanced Oil Recovery Credit. Although the Treasury Department is \ntasked with continued evaluations and editions to the list of recovery \nmethods covered under this credit, they have proven notably lax in \npursuing this objective. By legislating this outcome, this bill keeps \ndomestic production of our endangered marginal wells on the cutting \nedge of available technology.\n  Collectively, the provisions of this bill provide much needed \nincentives to an industry that is vital to our national security. The \nsooner the Administration and Congress acknowledge the critical \nimportance of the domestic oil and gas industry and stop burdening this \nindustry with high taxes and regulatory obstacles, the sooner we can \ntake the necessary actions to preserve and revitalize this important \nsector of our economy. Passage of the U.S. Energy and Economic Growth \nAct would be a significant step in that direction. I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation which will positively impact the domestic \noil and gas industry by helping to bridge the gap in these lean \neconomic times.\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator \nHutchison, many members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nand other Senators who recognize the importance of our domestic energy \nmarket in presenting the United States Energy Economic Growth Act. This \nact is extremely important given the current state of our domestic oil \nand gas industry. The current market, coupled with government inaction \nand misguided regulation, has created an environment that is forcing \nmany of our producers out of the energy market.\n  I have risen many times before, and unless things change I will rise \nmany times again, to voice my concern over that fact that we are \nrunning our producers into the ground. Agriculture, timber, mining and \nenergy; it doesn't seem to make a difference these days which natural \nresource market you work in, you don't get a fair price for an honest \nday's work.\n  This morning in the Energy and Natural Resource Committee, we had a \nhearing on this very problem. I must say, I heard some of the best \ntestimony that I have ever heard before a Senate Committee. It just \nmade good sense. We didn't have people asking for handouts. We didn't \nhave people placing blame. We had some hard working oil and gas \nproducers, state governors and representatives of oil and gas producing \nstates outline the problem and offer solutions.\n  One of the biggest problems discussed was the loss of domestic \nproduction capability in the form of marginal wells. We are losing \nthese wells at an alarming rate. As a result our reliance on foreign \nenergy sources is skyrocketing. We are running our producers out of \nbusiness, increasing our dependence on foreign oil, and throwing our \ntrade balance askew.\n  This legislation will help our independent producers running marginal \nwells stay in business. Much more needs to be done, but this bill will \nhelp relax the heavy hand of government on an ailing industry. As \npointed out this morning, the current administration stepped in to help \nthe straw broom industry when less than a hundred jobs were at risk. \nIt's time this Congress takes a stand, and hopefully the administration \nwill join us, in supporting an industry where tens of thousands of \njobs, our national security, and our economic well-being are all being \nplaced at risk.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Enzi, \n        Mr. Hutchinson, Ms. Collins, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. \n        Sessions);\n  S. 326. A bill to improve the access and choice of patients to \nquality, affordable health care, to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am proud to join with \neight other members of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions in introducing the ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' I think it is \nsolid legislation that will result in a greatly improved health care \nsystem for Americans.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions, with its jurisdiction of private health insurance and public \nhealth programs, I anticipate that the Committee will have an active \nhealth care agenda during the 106th Congress, including early \nconsideration of patient protection legislation. In fact, on January \n20th, the Committee held a hearing on the Department of Labor's \nproposed rules on health plan information requirements and internal and \nexternal appeals rights.\n  Last week's hearing builds on the foundation of 14 related hearings, \nwhich my Committee held during the 105th Congress. These included 11 \nhearings related to the issues of health care quality, confidentiality, \ngenetic discrimination, and the Health Care Financing Administration's \n(HCFA) implementation of its new health insurance responsibilities. And \nSenator Bill Frist's Public Health and Safety Subcommittee held three \nhearings on the work of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research \n(AHCPR). Each of these hearings helped us in developing the separate \npieces of legislation that are reflected in our ``Patients' Bill of \nRights.''\n  People need to know what their plan will cover and how they will get \ntheir health care. The ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' requires full \ninformation disclosure by an employer about the health plans he or she \noffers to employees. Patients also need to know how adverse decisions \nby the plan can be appealed, both internally and externally, to an \nindependent medical reviewer.\n  The limited set of standards under the Employee Retirement and Income \nSecurity Act (ERISA) may have worked well for the simple payment of \nhealth insurance claims under the fee-for-service system in 1974. We \nhave moved from a system where an individual received a treatment or \nprocedure, and the bill was simply paid. In our current system, an \nindividual frequently obtains authorization before a treatment or \nprocedure can be provided. And it is in the context of these changes \nthat ERISA needs to be amended in order to give participants and \nbeneficiaries the right to appeal adverse coverage or medical necessity \ndecisions to an independent medical expert.\n  Under the ``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' enrollees will get timely \ndecisions about what will be covered. Furthermore, if an individual \ndisagrees with the plan's decision, that individual may appeal the \ndecision to an independent, external reviewer. The reviewer's decision \nwill be binding on the health plan. However, the patient maintains his \nor her current rights to go to court. Timely utilization decisions and \na defined process for appealing such decisions is the key to restoring \ntrust in the health care system.\n  Another important provision of the ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' would \nlimit the collection and use of predictive genetic information by group \nhealth plans and health insurance companies. As our body of scientific \nknowledge about genetics increases, so, too, do the concerns about how \nthis information may be used. There is no question that our \nunderstanding of genetics has brought us to a new future. Our challenge \nas a Congress is to quickly enact legislation to help ensure that our \nsociety reaps the full health benefits of genetic testing, and also to \nput to rest any concerns that the information will be used as a new \ntool to discriminate against specific ethnic groups or individual \nAmericans.\n  Our legislation addresses these concerns by prohibiting group health \nplans and health insurance companies in all markets from adjusting \npremiums on the basis of predictive genetic information; and it \nprohibits group health plans and health insurance companies from \nrequesting predictive genetic information as a condition of enrollment.\n  Many of our colleagues argue that the current accountability \nstructure of ERISA is insufficient to protect patients from bad \ndecisions made by health plans. They would like to hold health plans \naccountable by removing the ERISA preemption and allowing group health \nplans to be sued in State court for damages resulting from personal \ninjury or for wrongful death due to ``the treatment of or the failure \nto treat a mental illness or disease.''\n  Mr. President, patients already have the right to sue their health \nplan in State court. Patients can sue health plans for personal injury \nor wrongful death resulting from the delivery of\n\n[[Page S1095]]\n\nsubstandard care or the failure to diagnose and properly treat an \nillness or disease. Furthermore, the courts have determined that health \nplans can be held liable for having policies that encourage providers \nto deliver inadequate medical care.\n  You simply cannot sue your way to better health. We believe that \npatients need to get the care they need when they need it. In the \n``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' we make sure each patient is afforded \nevery opportunity to have the right treatment decision made by health \ncare professionals. And, we make sure that a patient can appeal an \nadverse decision to an independent medical expert outside the health \nplan. This approach, Mr. President, puts teeth into ERISA and will \nassure that patients get the care they need. Prevention, not \nlitigation, is the best medicine.\n  As the Health and Education Committee works on health care quality \nlegislation, I will keep in mind three goals. First, to give families \nthe protections they want and need. Second, to ensure that medical \ndecisions are made by physicians in consultation with their patients. \nAnd, finally, to keep the cost of this legislation low, so that it \ndisplaces no one from getting health care coverage.\n  Our goal is to give Americans the protections they want and need in a \npackage that they can afford and that we can enact. This is why I hope \nthe ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' we have introduced today will be \nenacted and signed into law by the President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Grams, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Roberts, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 327. A bill to exempt agricultural products, medicines, and \nmedical products from U.S. economic sanctions; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/28/senate-section/article/S1076-3", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1095-S1101]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FOOD AND MEDICINE SANCTION RELIEF ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today Senator Dodd and I are \nintroducing the Food and Medicine Sanctions Relief Act of 1999. Joining \nus as cosponsors are our colleagues Senators Dorgan, Grams, Harkin, \nLugar, Roberts, and Warner.\n  This bill makes the simple statement that we should not include food \nand medicine in any unilateral sanction or embargo we may place on \nanother country. Food and medicine are the most fundamental of human \nneeds. Food and medicine should have no place in any sanctions we may \nimpose on other countries because we do not like the policies of an \naggressive or oppressive government.\n  We have gone too far in imposing unilateral economic sanctions on \nother nations. Sanctions can be a tool of foreign policy, but too often \nthen have become a substitute for foreign policy.\n  From 1993 to 1996, the United States imposed 61 unilateral economic \nsanctions on 35 nations. We now have some form of sanctions on more \nthan half of the world's population. It is time that we say ``no \nmore.'' This legislation says that we will no longer use farm policy as \na foreign policy weapon.\n  The pace of change today is unprecedented in modern history, and \nmaybe all of history. Trade, and particularly the trade in food and \nmedicine, is the common denominator that ties together the nations of \nthe world. American exports of food and medicine acts to build bridges \naround the world. It strengthens ties between people and demonstrates \nthe basic humanitarian impulse of the American people.\n  We live in a dynamic, interconnected world. Sanctions without the \nsupport of our allies only hurt us. And from a foreign policy \nperspective, unilateral sanctions rarely achieve their goal. Their real \nharm is on U.S. producers. It's estimated that sanctions cost the U.S. \neconomy more than $20 billion each year. If a nation can't purchase \nproducts from the United States, particularly agricultural products, \nother nations are more than ready to fill the needs of those markets.\n  American agriculture and the U.S. government must send a strong \nmessage to our customers and our competitors around the world--our \nagricultural producers are going to be consistent and reliable \nsuppliers of quality and plentiful agricultural products.\n  Once foreign agricultural markets are lost--for whatever reason--it \ncan take decades to restore them. In 1973, the U.S. banned soybean \nexports to Japan. What did that accomplish? It turned Brazil into a \nsignificant soybean producer, and America has never fully recovered its \nsoybean market share in Japan . . . and for good reasons, because it \nraised questions about the reliability of America as an agricultural \nsupplier. Another example is that the Soviet grain embargo of 1979 cost \nthe U.S. $2.3 billion in lost farm exports and USDA compensation to \nfarmers. When the U.S. cut off sales of wheat to protest the Soviet \ninvasion of Afghanistan, France, Canada, Australia and Argentina \nstepped in to claim this market and the former Soviet states have been \ntimid buyers of U.S. farm products ever since.\n  This is also the right thing to do. It's beneath this great nation to \nwithhold medicine and food as a tool to implement its foreign policy. \nWe are the most powerful nation on earth. Removing these items from the \nU.S. arsenal of economic sanctions will say to the poor and hungry of \nthe world that they will not have to suffer the consequences of their \ngovernment's actions.\n  I am from a Midwestern state, a large agriculture exporting state. \nBut there is not a farmer or rancher in Nebraska who would say, ``I \nwould trade America's national or security interests just to sell more \ncorn or beef.'' That is not the question. The question is whether we \nshould place a humanitarian hardship on the people of other countries \nbecause of the actions of their governments. Doing this does not \nadvance our country's interests. In fact, it hurts our national \ninterest, just as it intensifies the hardship being faced today by \nAmerica's agricultural producers.\n  History has shown, Mr. President, that trade and commerce does more \nto change attitudes and alter behaviors over time than any one thing. \nWhy? It improves diets; it improves standards of living; it opens \nsocieties; it exposes people who lived under totalitarian rule to the \nconcepts of personal freedom, economic freedom, and individual choice.\n  Ultimately, sanctions and embargoes mostly isolate ourselves. Trade \nembargoes isolate those who impose them. This bill is an important step \nforward, and is a part of the larger debate this Congress on the role \nof the U.S. in the world and how we intend to engage in the world. \nTrade is the keystone of our global engagement.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, \nand to engage in the debate over the role of unilateral economic \nsanctions in American foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to make permanent the moratorium on the imposition of \ntaxes on the Internet; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                internet consumer protection legislation\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, last year, we \nenacted a three-year moratorium on new Internet sales taxes. Today, I \nam introducing a bill that would make this moratorium permanent.\n  Internet commerce has exploded in recent years. For example, U.S. \nsales on the Internet last year totaled $8 billion. This last Christmas \nseason was about three times as busy as the previous one, with \nconsumers spending about $3 billion on goods purchased over the \nInternet. A recent survey of American adults by the Pew Research Center \nsuggests that 41% of American adults now uses the Internet.\n  For Americans who live in remote areas, such as residents of New \nHampshire's North Country, the Internet offers major advantages. They \nnow can shop by computer instead of driving several hours to the urban \nshopping malls or Main Street businesses. As noted by economist Larry \nKudlow, other potential Internet shoppers include the elderly, busy \nexecutives, stay-at-home parents, the disabled and others.\n  Despite all of its benefits for our economy and American consumers, \nInternet commerce is at risk from state and local politicians seeking \never more tax revenues. Already, a number of states have imposed taxes \non Internet sales. But there are several reasons why we should refuse \nto transform the Internet into a pot of gold for state and local tax \ncollectors.\n  First, not only do all states and localities have other options for \nraising revenue--such as income taxes, use taxes and property taxes--\nbut most are running budget surpluses. I asked the Congressional \nResearch Service to analyze what has happened to traditional sales tax \nrevenues over the past five years, when Internet use exploded. CRS \nreported that the growth in sales tax revenues has outpaced inflation \nin this period.\n  Second, a tax on Internet shopping is really just another tax on the \nAmerican consumer. American consumers already pay taxes on their \nsalaries, taxes on their capital gains, property taxes on their homes, \ntaxes on the goods they purchase from instate vendors, and estate taxes \non any property they have managed to save by the time of their death. \nImposing yet another layer of taxes in cyberspace is simply unfair, \nespecially because many Internet shoppers already pay shipping or \nhandling costs in addition to the purchase price of the goods they buy.\n  Furthermore, imposing new taxes on Internet-related revenues could \nstifle the development of Internet commerce in the U.S. As reported in \nyesterday's Wall Street Journal, a University of Chicago economist who \nstudied the buying decisions of 25,000 Internet shoppers found that \napplying sales taxes to Internet commerce ``would reduce the number of \nonline buyers by 25% and spending by more than 30%.''\n  Some politicians would like to make each online business be a sales \ntax collector for every tax jurisdiction in the United States. Doing so \nsimply would give Internet businesses--especially those whose profit \nmargins are slim--a good incentive to move offshore. Geography is not \nimportant on the Internet, and many Internet vendors can relocate \nwithout disruption to their customers.\n  Finally, many Internet transactions are really interstate commerce. \nThe Founding Fathers recognized the danger that each state might impose \ntaxes or tariffs on goods produced in other states, so they authorized \nthe Federal government to prevent interstate trade wars. In \ninterpreting the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, the Supreme \nCourt has held that commerce which crosses state boundaries should be \nsubject to state sales taxes only when both seller and buyer are in the \nsame state, or when the seller has a presence in the buyer's state.\n  There is little reason to fear, as some have claimed, that Main \nStreet businesses are at risk from Internet vendors. I can think of \nnothing that would prevent these businesses from offering their own on-\nline shopping services. Some already have done so with great success. \nMoreover, the Internet likely will attract entirely new customers whose \npurchases will only increase total retail sales.\n  The purpose of the bill I am introducing today is to allow Internet \ncommerce to continue to prosper in this country, by making permanent \nthe three-year moratorium that we enacted last year. Under my bill, \nstate and local governments could not impose new Internet sales taxes.\n  Mr. President, I hope that all of my colleagues will support this \nlegislation, which is of great importance to the American consumer and \nour economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB:\n      S. 329. A bill to amend title, United States Code, to extend \n        eligibility for hospital care and medical services under \n        chapter 17 of that title to veterans who have been awarded the \n        Purple Heart, and for other purposes.\n\n\n               combat veterans medical equity act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Combat \nVeterans Medical Equity Act of 1999, legislation which will serve to \ncodify America's obligation to provide for the medical needs of our \ncombat-wounded veterans.\n  Although we have long recognized the combat-wounded vet to be among \nour most deserving veterans, and although we have long distinguished \nthe sacrifices of these veterans by awarding the Purple Heart medal, \nremarkably, there is nothing in current law that stipulates an \nentitlement to health care based upon this physical sacrifice. In fact, \nI believe most Americans would be surprised to learn that a combat-\nwounded Purple Heart recipient could be denied services for which a \nnon-combat veteran, with a non-service-connected disability, would be \neligible. This legislation would seek to remedy that situation.\n  Specifically, this bill establishes for VA hospital care and medical \nservices based upon the award of the Purple Heart Medal. It also gives \nPurple Heart recipients an enrollment priority on par with former \nPrisoners of War and veterans with service-connected disabilities rated \nbetween 10 and 20%.\n  Mr. President, as a Vietnam Veteran who has been privileged to lead \nmarines in combat, and as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I have a keen appreciation for the sacrifices made by all of \nour men and women in uniform. At the same time, in the face of tighter \nbudgets and greater competition for services, I believe strongly that \nCongress should ensure equity in disbursing of medical services for our \nmost deserving veterans--the combat wounded. These veterans, who have \nshed their blood to keep our country safe and free, deserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I salute them, and ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 329\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to expand the \navailability of health care coverage for working individuals with \ndisabilities, to establish a Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency \nProgram in the Social Security Administration to provide such \nindividuals with meaningful opportunities to work, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                work incentives improvement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today Senators Kennedy, Roth, Moynihan, \nand I, joined by many of our colleagues are introducing the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act of 1999. The reason for this broad \nbipartisan effort is both compelling and simple. Currently, individuals \nwith disabilities must choose between working or getting health care. \nSuch a choice is absurd. But, current federal law forces individuals \nwith disabilities to make that choice. Our legislation addresses this \nfundamental flaw.\n  The federal government helps individuals with significant \ndisabilities, who earn under $500 a month. Individuals, who have less \nthan $2,000 in assets and have not paid into Social Security, receive \nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) cash payments and access to \nMedicaid. Individuals, who have worked and paid into Social Security, \nreceive Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) cash payments and \naccess to Medicare. Yet, the current system offers no incentive for SSI \nand SSDI recipients to work to their full potential, to be taxpayers, \nto contribute to their well-being and that of their families. The facts \nbear out this assertion. Less than one half of one percent of the 7.5 \nmillion individuals on the Social Security disability rolls leave them.\n  Do these individuals really want to work? The answer is a resounding, \n``Yes.'' Over the last 10 years, national surveys consistently confirm \nthat people with disabilities of working age want to work, but only \nabout one-third are working.\n  Are the numbers low because of discrimination or because of lack of \nskills? Congress has tackled these issues. We passed the Americans with \nDisabilities Act in 1990. It is against the law to discriminate against \nan individual on the basis of disability in employment as well as in \nall other contexts. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nthe Rehabilitation Act, and most recently the Workforce Investment Act \nof 1998 contribute to the access of individuals with disabilities to \nthe education and training they need to become qualified workers.\n  However, protection against discrimination is not enough. Access to \neducation and training is not enough. Colleagues, the biggest remaining \nbarrier is health insurance. Individuals with significant disabilities \nwho meet the rigorous eligibility criteria of the Social Security \ndisability programs cannot often get reasonably priced, appropriate \nhealth insurance coverage from the private sector. These individuals \ncan only get health insurance from the government, and the government \ngives it to them only if they stay home, or at best, work a minimal \namount.\n  It is difficult to measure fully the effect of having a job on an \nindividual's life. It has a positive impact on a person's identity and \nsense of self-worth. Having a job results in satisfaction associated \nwith supporting oneself and one's family or at least not being a burden \non it. If only one percent of the 7.5 million SSI and SSDI recipients \ngo to work and forgo cash payments from the Social Security \nAdministration (SSA), this would result in a cash savings of $3.5 \nbillion to the federal Treasury over the lifetimes of these \nindividuals. If we factor in the income taxes these individuals would \npay, their lack of need for food stamps, subsidized housing, and other \nforms of assistance, that $3.5 billion dollar figure would be even \nhigher.\n\n  Beyond the individual, there is another factor. Recently we learned \nthat our unemployment rate, 4.3 percent, is the lowest it has been \nsince 1956. Our economy, to stay vibrant and strong, needs access to a \nqualified and enthusiastic pool of potential workers fro which to draw. \nSSI and SSDI recipients are an untapped resource. Many of the jobs that \ncurrently go unfilled, in the service sector and technology industry, \nare the very jobs that many SSI and SSDI recipients are ready and \nwilling to fill, if only they could have access to health care.\n  The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 is targeted, fiscally \nresponsible legislation. It would enable individuals with significant \ndisabilities to enter the work force for the first time, reenter the \nwork force, or avoid leaving it in the first place. These individuals \nwould need not worry about losing their health care if they choose to \nwork a forty hour week, to put in overtime, to go for a career \nadvancement or change with more income potential.\n  Under current law, a poor individual with a disability who has not \nworked and not paid into Social Security, who meets rigorous criteria, \nreceives monthly SSI payments. Once eligible for SSI cash payments, \nthese individuals have access to Medicaid. In some states these \nindividuals may have coverage of personal assistance services and \nprescription drugs through Medicaid. An SSI recipient who chooses to \nearn income, and then exceeds his or her state's threshold for earned \nincome for an SSI beneficiary, loses SSI cash payments and access to \nMedicaid.\n  Also under current law, an individual who has worked and paid into \nSocial Security, has a disability, and meets rigorous criteria, \nreceives SSDI payments. After 24 months, these individuals have access \nto Medicare. Medicare does not cover the cost of personal assistance \nservices or prescription drugs, items an individual with a disability \nmay need to work at all. To access coverage of these items, an \nindividual must spend-down his or her resources until he or she has \nunder $2,000. Then, the individual can become eligible for coverage of \nthese items through Medicaid in states where they are offered. An SSDI \nrecipient who chooses to work and earns $500 monthly in a 12 month \nperiod, loses SSDI cash payments. SSDI beneficiaries continue to \nreceive Medicare coverage after returning to work throughout a 39-month \nextended period of eligibility, but afterwards must pay the full \nMedicare Part A premium, which is over $300 monthly.\n  The bill would allow states to expand Medicaid coverage to workers \nwith disabilities. These options build on previous reforms including a \nrecent provision enacted in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). The \nBBA provision permitted states to offer a Medicaid buy-in to those \nindividuals with incomes below 250 percent of poverty who would be \neligible for SSI disability benefits but for their income.\n\n  The first option in our legislation would build on the BBA provision. \nStates may elect to offer a Medicaid buy-in to people with disabilities \nwho work and have earnings above 250 percent of poverty. Even so, \nparticipating States may also set limits on an individual's unearned \nincome, assets, and resources and may require cost-sharing and premiums \non a sliding scale up to a full premium.\n  The second option in our legislation would allow states that elect to \ndo so to cover individuals who continue to have a severe medically \ndeterminable impairment but lose eligibility for SSI or SSDI because of \nmedical improvement. Although medical improvement for individuals with \ndisabilities is inextricably linked to ongoing interventions made \npossible through insurance coverage, under current law improvement can \njeopardize continued eligibility for that coverage.\n  The legislation requires that states not supplant existing state-only \nspending with Medicaid funding under either of these options and \nmaintain current spending levels on eligible populations.\n  A state which elects to implement the first option or the first and \nsecond options would receive a grant to support the design, \nestablishment and operation of infrastructures to support working \nindividuals with disabilities. A\n\n[[Page S1098]]\n\ntotal of $150 million would be available for five years, and annual \namounts would be increased at the rate of inflation from 2004 through \n2009. In 2009, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would \nrecommend whether the program is still needed.\n  The bill includes a ten-year trial program that would permit SSDI \nbeneficiaries to continue to receive Medicare coverage when they return \nto work. This option in effect extends the current 39-month extended \nperiod of eligibility.\n  The legislation includes a time-limited demonstration program that \nwould allow states to extend Medicaid coverage to workers who have a \ndisability which, without access to health care, would become severe \nenough to quality them for SSI or SSDI. This demonstration would \nprovide new information on the cost effectiveness of early health care \nintervention in keeping people with disabilities from becoming too \ndisabled to work. Funding of $300 million would be available for the \ndemonstration, which would sunset at the end of FY 2004.\n  The legislation eliminates other programmatic disincentives. It would \nencourage SSDI and SSi beneficiaries to return to work by providing \nassurance that cash benefits remain available if employment proves \nunsuccessful. Specifically, the legislation would prohibit using \nemployment as the sole basis for scheduling a continuing disability \nreview and would expedite eligibility determinations for those \nindividuals that need to return to SSDI benefits after losing such \nbenefits because of work.\n  We estimate the total cost of these health care-related provisions to \nbe a total of $1.2 billion over five years.\n  Recognizing that some SSI and SSDI recipients will need training and \njob placement assistance and that they seek choices related to these \nactivities, in our bill we include provisions modeled on Senator \nBunning's legislation that passed the House last year. These ``ticket \nto work and self-sufficiency'' provisions would give SSI and SSDI \nbeneficiaries more choices in where to obtain vocational rehabilitation \nand employment services and would increase incentives to public and \nparticipating private providers serving these individuals. The \n``ticket'' provisions would create a new payment system for employment \nservices to SSI and SSDI beneficiaries the result in employment. For \neach beneficiary a provider assists, the provider would be reimbursed \nwith a portion of benefits savings to the federal government that would \noccur when the beneficiary earns more than the current law Substantial \nGainful Activity (SGA) standard of $500 per month. These ticket \nprovisions have been estimated to cost a total of $17 million over five \nyears.\n  To assist individuals with disabilities to understand the myriad \noptions available to them and their interrelationship, the legislation \nwould create a community-based outreach program to provide accurate \ninformation on work incentives programs to individuals with \ndisabilities, and a state grant program to help people cut red tape to \naccess work incentives. For the community-based work incentives \noutreach program, up to $23 million per year would be provided for \ngrants to states or private organizations. SSA would have the authority \nto provide state grants ($7 million annually) to provide help to \nbeneficiaries in accessing the ``ticket to work'' and other work \nincentives programs.\n  The legislation would reauthorize SSA's demonstration authority which \nexpired June 10, 1996. In addition, through mandated demonstration \nprojects SSA is to assess the effect of a gradual reduction in cash \nbenefits a earnings increase. Under current law, SSI recipients have \naccess to a gradual reduction in their cash payments, but SSDI \nrecipients do not. SSDI recipients lose cash payments immediately after \nearning $500 monthly in a 12 month trial work period. SSDI recipients \nparticipating in the demonstration would lose one SSDI dollar for every \n$2 earned.\n  Finally, the legislation directs the General Accounting Office (GAO) \nto study three issues: (1) tax credits and other disability-related \nemployment incentives under the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990; (2) the coordination of SSI and SSDI benefits; and (3) the \neffects of the Substantial Gainful Activity (currently $500 monthly) \nstandard on work incentives.\n  These provisions have been estimated to cost a total of $55 million \nover five years.\n  This legislation represents two years of work. It reflects what \nindividuals with disabilities say they need. It was shaped by input \nacross the philosophical spectrum. It was endorsed by the President in \nthis State of the Union Address. It is an opportunity to bring \nresponsible change to federal policy and eliminate a perverse dilemma \nfor many Americans with disabilities--if you don't work, you get health \ncare; if you do work, you don't.\n  This legislation is a vital link that will make the American dream a \nreality for many Americans with disabilities. Let's work together to \nmake the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 the first significant \nlegislation enacted by the 106th Congress.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Jeffords, \nKennedy, Roth, and Moynihan in introducing this historic, bipartisan \ninitiative that will help tear down the barriers that prevent Americans \nwith disabilities who want to work from reaching their full potential \nand achieving economic independence.\n  Eight million Americans receive more than $50 billion a year in cash \ndisability benefits under the Supplemental Security Income and Social \nSecurity Disability programs. While surveys show that the overwhelming \nmajority of adults with disabilities want to work, fewer than \\1/2\\ of \n1 percent of them actually do.\n  Advances in medicine and technology coupled with tougher civil rights \nlaws have made it possible for more and more people with physical and \nmental disabilities to enter the workforce. These are people who \ngenuinely want to work. They have the skills and talents necessary to \nbe productive members of the workforce. But they face a Catch-22. If \nthey leave the disability rolls for a job, they risk losing the \nMedicare and Medicaid benefits that made it possible for them to enter \nthe workforce in the first place. Moreover, many of these individuals' \nvery lives depend on the prescription drugs, technology, personal \nassistance services, and medical care they receive.\n  Mr. President, no one should have to make a choice between a job and \nhealth care. The legislation we are introducing today will create and \nfund new options for States to encourage them to allow people with \ndisabilities who enter the workforce to buy into the Medicaid program, \nso they can continue to receive the prescription drugs, personal \nassistance services, and medical care upon which they depend. It will \nalso allow workers leaving the social Security Disability Insurance \nprogram to extend their Medicare coverage for ten years. This is \ntremendously important since many people returning to work after having \nbeen on SSDI either work part time and are therefore not eligible for \nemployer-based insurance, or they work in jobs that do not offer health \ninsurance. Allowing these disabled individuals to maintain their \nMedicare coverage will serve as a tremendous incentive for them to \nreturn to the workforce.\n  Other provisions of the legislation we are introducing today \nincorporate a more ``user-friendly'' approach in programs providing job \ntraining and placement assistance to individuals with disabilities who \nwants to work. Our bill gives disabled SSI and SSDI beneficiaries \ngreater consumer choice by creating a ``ticket'' that enables them to \nchoose whether they want to go to a public or private provider of \nvocational rehabilitation services. The bill also provides grants to \nStates and organizations to help connect people with disabilities with \nappropriate services, and funds demonstrations and studies to better \nunderstand policies that will encourage and enable work.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing today is an \ninvestment in human potential that promises tremendous return. By \nensuring that Americans with disabilities have access to affordable \nhealth insurance, we are removing the major barrier between them and \nthe workplace. The Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 will both \nencourage and enable Americans with disabilities to be full \nparticipants in our nation's workforce and growing economy, and I urge \nall of my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S1099]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Work Incentives Improvement Act to provide affordable \nand accessible health care for persons with disabilities so they can \nwork and live independently.\n  Despite the extraordinary growth and prosperity the country is now \nenjoying, people with disabilities continue to struggle to live \nindependently and become fully contributing members of their \ncommunities. We have made significant progress through special \neducation programs that open new horizons for excellence in learning, \nand through rehabilitation programs that develop practical independent \nliving skills.\n  Too often, however, the goal of independence is still out of reach. \nWe need to do more to see that the benefits of our prosperous economy \nare truly available to all Americans, including those with \ndisabilities. Disabled children and adults deserve access to the \nbenefits and support they need to achieve their full potential.\n  Large numbers of the 54 million disabled Americans have the capacity \nto work and become productive citizens. But they are unable to do so \nbecause of the unnecessary barriers they face. For too long, people \nwith disabilities have suffered from unfair penalties if they go to \nwork. They are in danger of losing their cash benefits if they accept a \npaying job. They are in danger of losing the medical coverage, which \nmay well mean the difference between life and death. Too often, they \nface a harsh choice between eating a decent meal and buying their \nneeded medication.\n  The bipartisan legislation we are introducing today will help to \nremove these unfair barriers. It will make health insurance coverage \nmore widely available, through opportunities to buy-in to Medicare and \nMedicaid at an affordable rate. It will phase out the loss of cash \nbenefits as income rises--instead of the unfair sudden cut-off that so \nmany workers with disabilities face today. It will bring greater access \nfor people with disabilities to the services they need in order to \nbecome successfully employed.\n  Our goal is to restructure and improve existing disability programs \nso that they do more to encourage and support every disabled person's \ndream to work and live independently, and be productive and \ncontributing members of their community. That goal should be the \nbirthright of all Americans--and when we say all, we mean all.\n  This bill is the right thing to do, it is the cost effective thing to \ndo, and now is the time to do it. For too long, our fellow disabled \ncitizens have been left out and left behind. A new and brighter day is \non the horizon for Americans with disabilities, and together we can \nmake it a reality.\n  I especially commend Senator Jeffords, Senator Roth and Senator \nMoynihan for their impressive leadership on this issue. We look forward \nto working with all members of Congress to pass this landmark \nlegislation that will give disabled persons across the country a better \nopportunity to fulfill their dreams and participate fully in the social \nand economic mainstream of the nation.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I join Senators \nMoynihan, Roth, Kennedy and Jeffords on their significant initiative to \nexpand work opportunities for Americans with disabilities. As \nAmericans, we value the opportunity to support ourselves and our \nfamilies to the best of our abilities. In fact, we refer to this right \nand this responsibility as the American dream. But today, millions of \nAmericans who want to work remain on various forms of public \nassistance, because they can't access the supports they need to begin \nand continue working.\n  People with disabilities face unique barriers to self-sufficiency. \nMany of them need certain types of health services, such as home health \ncare and personal care services, in order to work--yet these services \nare rarely available under employer-sponsored health insurance. Many of \nthem find private health insurance unavailable or unaffordable. Some \nneed vocational rehabilitation services and help finding employment. \nOthers need assistive technology in order to do their job.\n  Currently, health care coverage and other services are linked to two \ncash programs--Social Security Disability (SSDI) and Supplemental \nSecurity Income. So people with disabilities must choose whether they \nwant to reach self-sufficiency and risk losing their health coverage \nand other supportive services, or retain their health insurance but \nremain dependent on these safety-net programs. At the same time, \nwithout personal attendants or other supportive services, they may not \nbe able to work in the first place, or no longer be able to work if \ntheir health status is threatened by the loss of the services they can \naccess through health coverage.\n  I do not believe that people who wish to work and support themselves \nshould face this kind of agonizing choice and take these types of \nrisks. However, we can change this Catch-22. The Work Incentives \nImprovement Act will make several important changes. Most \nsignificantly, it will provide new options for Medicaid and Medicare \ncoverage for disabled individuals who enter the workforce, and expand \naccess to employment services for disabled individuals who are building \ntheir employment skills.\n  By enabling workers with disabilities to buy-in to the Medicaid \nprogram, this legislation will permit Americans with disabilities to \nenter the workforce without worrying about losing the prescription drug \ncoverage, personal care services, and other health care services they \nneed to work in the first place. It also allows States to establish \nsliding-scale premiums for workers with higher incomes, therefore \nensuring that as workers' income increases, they maintain their health \ncoverage but are less financially dependent on public programs. This \nproposal will also allow States to continue covering people whose \nhealth condition has improved through treatment made possible through \nMedicaid coverage. Finally, through a ten-year demonstration, the Work \nIncentives Improvement Act will determine whether permitting SSDI \nbeneficiaries to continue their Medicare coverage is a cost-effective \nstrategy for providing health insurance to individuals who lose SSDI \nwhen they return to work.\n  This legislation will also reduce barriers to employment for \nAmericans with disabilities by providing new mechanisms for these \nindividuals to receive the vocational rehabilitation and employment \nservices they need from the providers they choose. In addition, it will \nencourage SSDI and SSI beneficiaries to develop their skills and \nventure into the workplace by providing a new assurance that their cash \nbenefits will remain available, if necessary. These individuals may \nstill lose their cash benefits, depending on their working income, but \nthey can be assured that their SSDI and SSI eligibility application \nwould be expedited if their work experience ultimately proves \nunsuccessful.\n  As we look towards the next century, we know that America's economic \nstrength and sense of national community are dependent on the \ncontributions of each and every American. We need to take the necessary \nsteps to ensure that all Americans will have a chance to enjoy the \nAmerican dream. Americans with disabilities have the same dreams as the \nrest of us--including a productive and rewarding working life that \nenables them to support their families and achieve economic self-\nsufficiency. We should do our best to help make these dreams a reality.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues Senators \nRoth, Kennedy and Jeffords to introduce The Work Incentives Improvement \nAct of 1999. This bill would address some of the barriers and \ndisincentives that individuals enrolled in Federal disability programs \nface in returning to work.\n  Many persons with disabilities need the health coverage that \naccompanies their eligibility for cash benefits. (Social Security \nDisability Insurance (SSDI) beneficiaries are also covered under \nMedicare. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) beneficiaries receive \nMedicaid coverage). Disability is determined based on an inability to \nsustain gainful work activity, which is measured by an earned income \nthreshold. Under current law, as they return to work and earn income, \nbeneficiaries lose their cash benefits and, subsequently, their health \ncoverage. The risk of losing health benefits may deter disabled \nindividuals from returning to work and, instead, encourage them to\n\n[[Page S1100]]\n\ncontinue to receive cash benefits despite their ability to work.\n  Less than one percent of SSDI and SSI beneficiaries leave the \nprograms and return to work each year. A survey released by the \nNational Organization on Disability showed that, currently, only 29 \npercent of all disabled adults are employed full-time or part-time, \ncompared to 79 percent of the non-disabled adult population.\n\n\n                            PAST INITIATIVES\n\n  Our former Majority Leader and Finance Committee Chairman, Senator \nBob Dole, should be commended for pioneering legislation to address \nwork disincentives for people with disabilities. On March 19, 1986, \nSenator Dole introduced The Employment Opportunities for Disabled \nAmericans Act to permanently authorize an SSI demonstration that would \nallow SSI beneficiaries who return to work to continue to receive cash \nassistance and, most importantly, continue their Medicaid coverage. At \na slightly higher income level, beneficiaries returning to work would \nhave a phased down SSI benefit while maintaining their Medicaid \ncoverage. I was an original cosponsor of that bill, which passed the \nSenate by a voice vote. On November 11, 1986, President Reagan signed \nthe bill into law.\n  Most recently, under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, states were \ngiven the option to provide Medicaid coverage on a sliding premium \nscale for disabled workers with net incomes up to 250 percent of \npoverty. This provision gave workers with disabilities an opportunity \nto buy into Medicaid coverage without leaving their job to qualify for \nSSI and Medicaid.\n  These initiatives were necessary first steps, yet several \ndisincentives still exist.\n\n\n              THE WORK INCENTIVES IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1999\n\n  The bill we introduce today would provide additional Medicare and \nMedicaid options for workers with disabilities, and would encourage SSI \nand SSDI beneficiaries to seek vocational rehabilitative services.\n  With regard to health coverage, the bill would allow states to lift \nthe income and asset limits for the Medicaid buy-in program established \nin BBA. States would also have the option to continue Medicaid coverage \nfor workers with disabilities that lose SSI benefits due to a medical \nimprovement criteria. This bill would establish state demonstrations to \nprovide the Medicaid buy-in for workers with disabilities that are not \nyet severe enough to end work but would be if they did not have \ncomprehensive Medicaid coverage. In addition, as a ten-year trial \nperiod, SSDI beneficiaries who return to work may continue to receive \nMedicare coverage, despite losing SSDI benefits.\n  The bill would also create incentives for vocational rehabilitation \nproviders to assist beneficiaries in finding work and achieving \nsufficient income. These providers would be paid a portion of the \nbenefits saved by the beneficiaries returning to work. The bill would \ncreate several grant programs for outreach, advocacy, and planning and \nassistance for beneficiaries in work incentive programs.\n  Again, Senator Dole has offered his support for this legislation to \ncontinue the initiatives he began. My colleagues and I developed this \nproposal last year and would like to see it pass this year. Chairman \nRoth and I are committed to marking up the bill in the Committee on \nFinance in early spring. At that time, the Chairman's Mark will include \noffsets to the proposed spending. We urge all members to support this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Lott, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Craig, and \n        Mr. Graham):\n  S. 330. A bill to promote the research, identification, assessment, \nexploration, and development of methane hydrate resources, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n          methane hydrate research and development act of 1999\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Lott, \nLandrieu, Craig, and Graham I am introducing the Methane Hydrate \nResearch and Development Act of 1999.\n  Methane hydrates are rigid, ice-like solids of water surrounding a \ngas molecule. They remain solid at high pressure and low temperature. \nSuch conditions are found in Arctic permafrost and in deep sea \nsediments. Methane hydrate has tremendous gas storage capacity: one \nvolume of methane hydrate will expand to more than 160 volumes of \nmethane under normal temperature and pressure conditions.\n  The data on this unlikely resource will surprise you. We are only \nbeginning to quantify and characterize methane hydrate resources. \nFundamental research on methane hydrates is urgently needed to serve \nour long-term energy supply needs, create short-term advances in \nconventional fuel extraction, and further the science of global climate \nchange.\n  Significant, widespread quantities of gas hydrates have been \ndetected, but not characterized, all over the world. In the United \nStates, on-shore Arctic deposits are found in Alaska. Deep sea methane \nhydrate deposits are perhaps the most abundant source of methane, \noccurring at depths greater than 300 meters. Marine geologists have \nidentified large deposits off the coasts of most of the U.S., including \nAlaska, Louisiana, Texas, New Jersey, Oregon, and North and South \nCarolina. However, we know very little about the quantity and nature of \nthese deposits.\n  Worldwide, the estimated amount of methane trapped in gas hydrate \nform is 10,000 gigatons--twice the amount of carbon found in all other \nfossil fuels on Earth. This represents close to 3,000 times the amount \nof methane present in the atmosphere. Scientists estimate that 320,000 \ntrillion cubic feet (tcf) of natural gas exists in hydrate form in the \nU.S.--a staggering resource. By comparison, we have an estimated \nreserve of 1,300 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of conventional natural gas.\n\n  The potential of methane hydrates as an energy resource is best \ndescribed in terms of consumption. The U.S. consumes 22 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas per year; U.S. gas reserves will likely supply gas \nfor approximately 60 years at current consumption rates. However, gas \nconsumption is expected to rise dramatically in the future. If the \nhydrate resource can be harvested, the amount of natural gas found in \none deposit off the Carolina would satisfy our natural gas needs for \nover 70 years.\n  Can we produce natural gas from these vast reserves? Natural gas from \nmethane hydrates will never be realized unless we undertake a serious \nmethane hydrates research program. The U.S. is not doing enough to \nexplore this exciting new energy source. Other nations, primarily Japan \nand India, have launched aggressive R programs to explore methane \nhydrates. Some believe that Japanese commercial production is only a \ndecade away. Clearly we are falling behind in our efforts to understand \nthis energy source. In the face of dwindling energy resources and \nincreased reliance on energy imports, we can hardly afford to miss this \nimportant opportunity.\n  In addition to potential use as an energy source, methane hydrate \ndeposits also represent a challenge to conventional oil and gas \nextraction. Hydrates influence physical properties of ocean sediments, \nparticularly strength and stability. Characterizing hydrate formation \nand breakdown is important for the safety of deep offshore drilling and \nother deep sea operations.\n  Release of large quantities of methane to the atmosphere from hydrate \ndeposits, and the sequestration methane in hydrate form, can also have \nsignificant effects on global climate change. The importance of the \nprocess in global climate regulation is relatively unknown, and demands \ninvestigation.\n  Even though this resource accounts for more potential energy than all \nother conventional fuels combined, has attracted significant foreign \ninvestment, challenges conventional oil and gas production, and holds \nunknown secrets about global climate, the Department of Energy budget \nis limited to $500,000 in FY 1999.\n  My bill establishes a small research and development program with the \npotential for major payback. It would direct the Department of Energy \nto conduct research and development in collaboration with the U.S. \nGeological Survey, National Science Foundation, and the Naval Research \nLaboratory. \n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Robb, and \n        Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 332. A bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory \ntreatment\n\n[[Page S1101]]\n\n(normal trade relations treatment) to the products of Kyrgyzstan. A \nbill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment (normal \ntrade relations treatment to the products of Kyrgyzstan; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 normal trade relations for kyrgyzstan\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill \nwhich would authorize ``normal trade relations'' treatment to the \nproduct of Kyrgyzstan.\n  In 1998, Kyrgyzstan acceeded into the World Trade Organization, one \nof two republics of the former Soviet Union to be granted membership. \nOnly Latvia can join Kyrgyzstan in boasting of that accomplishment.\n  Admission to the World Trade Organization was an acknowledgement of \nthe progress Kyrgyzstan has made in adopting and implementing economic \nand trade reforms since its independence from the Soviet Union. \nHowever, despite World Trade Organization membership, Kyrgyzstan \nremains subject to the Jackson-Vanik amendment to Title IV of the Trade \nAct of 1974.\n  As you are aware, Title IV is the provision of law governing the \nnormal trade relations status of nonmarket economy countries. Under the \npresent arrangement, Kyrgyzstan's compliance with the requirements of \nthe Jackson-Vanik amendment must be assessed semiannually. The \nlegislation that I am introducing would eliminate the twice yearly \nreview by granting Kyrgyzstan permanent ``normal trade relations'' \ntreatment.\n  Currently, the United States cannot extend unconditional and \nreciprocal treatment to Kyrgyzstan, nor can we apply the World Trade \nOrganization agreements to Kyrgyzstan. Until granted ``normal trade \nrelations'' treatment, transactions with Kyrgyzstan continue to be \ngoverned by the provisions of the bilateral trade agreement negotiated \nunder Title IV.\n  It is important that Kyrgyzstan be extended unconditional ``normal \ntrade relations'' treatment. It is important not only because the \nKyrgyz Republic has met the criteria required by that designation, but \nalso because Kyrgyzstan is deserving of that designation. It is also \nimportant because until accorded that status, neither Kyrgyzstan nor \nthe United States can realize fully the benefits of Kyrgyzstan's World \nTrade Organization membership. Kyrgyzstan has complied with both the \nfreedom-of-emigration and the bilateral commercial agreement \nrequirements of Jackson-Vanik and Title IV.\n  Kyrgyzstan should graduate from Jackson-Vanik in recognition of the \ngreat strides the country has made in employing market-oriented \nreforms. The Kyrgyz Republic has served as a leader in economic and \npolitical reform in Central Asia and demonstrates the potential to \nserve as a model for other transforming economies.\n  Passage of this legislation would send a powerful message not only to \nKyrgyzstan, but to all of Central Asia that a free-market economy is \nthe path to prosperity. Permanent ``normal trade relations'' status for \nKyrgyzstan would help advance further reform not only in that country, \nbut would also serve as incentive for other countries in the region.\n  ``Normal trade relations'' is important for both Kyrgyzstan and the \nUnited States. I hope my colleagues will join me in acknowledging \nKyrgyzstan's progress and support this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

The Sergeant at Arms is authorized to utilize the \n     services of the Deputy Sergeant at Arms or any other employee \n     of the United States Senate in serving the subpoenas \n     authorized to be issued by this resolution.\n       Sec. 203. Depositions authorized by this resolution shall \n     be taken before, and presided over by, on behalf of the \n     Senate, two Senators appointed by the Majority Leader and the \n     Democratic Leader, acting jointly, one of whom shall \n     administer to witnesses the oath prescribed by Rule XXV of \n     the Rules of Procedure and Practice in the Senate When \n     Sitting on Impeachment Trials. Acting jointly, the presiding \n     officers shall have authority to rule, as an initial matter, \n     upon any question arising out of the deposition. All \n     objections to a question shall be noted by the presiding \n     officers upon the record of the deposition but the \n     examination shall proceed, and the witness shall answer such \n     question. A witness may refuse to answer a question only when \n     necessary to preserve a legally-recognized privilege, or \n     constitutional right, and must identify such privilege cited \n     if refusing to answer a question.\n       Sec. 204.

The scope of the examination by the \n     Managers and counsel for both parties shall be limited to the \n     subject matters reflected in the Senate record. The party \n     taking a deposition shall present to the other party, at \n     least 18 hours in advance of the deposition, copies of all \n     exhibits which the deposing party intends to enter into the \n     deposition. No exhibits outside of the Senate record shall be \n     employed, except for articles and materials in the press, \n     including electronic media. Any party may interrogate any \n     witness as if that witness were declared adverse.\n       Sec. 205. The depositions shall be videotaped and a \n     transcript of the proceedings shall be made. The depositions \n     shall be conducted in private. No person shall be admitted to \n     any deposition except for the following: The witness, counsel \n     for the witness, the Managers on the part of the House, \n     counsel for the Managers, counsel for the President, and the \n     presiding officers; further, such persons whose presence is \n     required to make and preserve a record of the proceedings in \n     videotaped and transcript forms, and Senate staff members \n     whose presence is required to assist the presiding officers \n     in presiding over the depositions, or for other purposes, as \n     determined by the Majority Leader and the Democratic Leader. \n     All present must maintain the confidentiality of the \n     proceedings.\n       Sec. 206.

The depositions authorized by this resolution \n     shall be deemed to be proceedings before the Senate for \n     purposes of Rule XXIX of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     Senate Resolution 259, One Hundredth Congress, First Session, \n     sections 191, 192, 194, 288b, 288d, 288f of title 2, United \n     States Code, sections 6002, 6005 of title 18, United States \n     Code, and section 1365 of title 28, United States Code. The \n     Secretary shall arrange for stenographic assistance, \n     including videotaping, to record the depositions as provided \n     in section 205. Such expenses as may be necessary shall be \n     paid from the Appropriation Account--Miscellaneous Items in \n     the contingent fund of the Senate upon vouchers approved by \n     the Secretary.\n       Sec. 208. The Majority and Minority Leaders, acting \n     jointly, may make other provisions for the orderly and fair \n     conduct of these depositions as they seem appropriate.\n       Sec. 209. The Secretary shall notify the Managers on the \n     part of the House, and counsel for the President, of this \n     resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/28/senate-section/article/S1102-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   RELATIVE TO THE PROCEDURES CONCERNING THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT \n                   AGAINST WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE proposed an amendment to the resolution (S.

Mr. President, while the nation's eyes are turned \ntoward Washington and the Senate impeachment trial, I would like to \nbriefly turn the nation's eyes away from Washington and toward the \neconomic catastrophe that is devastating our family farmers.\n  Prices are falling at alarming rates, and family farms are perishing, \nas rural America faces its worst crisis since the Great Depression. And \nto some, it may appear as though Nero is fiddling while Rome burns.\n  So I want to assure my constituents--and indeed all family farmers \nacross our great nation--that while Congress spends it time deciding \nthe fate of the President, some members have not lost sight of their \ndaily struggle to make ends meet, and their fate.\n  On Tuesday, along with Minority Leader Daschle and several other farm \nstate Democratic Senators, we introduced the Agricultural Safety Net \nand Market Competitiveness Act of 1999. With this legislation we intend \nto restore an economic safety net to producers and rural communities so \nthat they can remain vital during these times of economic hardship. As \nwell, we proposed ways in which we can revitalize markets--both \ndomestic and abroad--so that all American producers have a fair shot to \ncompete in the marketplace. We also introduced a bill, S. 30, to offset \nextreme losses to our producers resulting from severe economic and \nweather-related events.\n  I want my constituents and all family farmers to know that I will \nwelcome the day when we can turn our attentions toward doing the \nbusiness of the American people, and more specifically American \nfarmers.\n  In the January 18, 1999 edition of the Lincoln Journal Star, farm \njournalist Alan Guebert wrote a thought provoking piece describing 10 \nways in which the average American and American farmer can help regain \nthe power they have lost and continue to lose during this economic \ncatastrophe.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a moment to read this very important \narticle, and I ask that Mr. Guebert's article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n           [From the Lincoln Journal Star, January 18, 1999]\n\n                           (By Alan Guebert)\n\n       In the nearly 100 farmer calls, letters, e-mails and faxes \n     to this office in the first two weeks of 1999, the central \n     theme in most was the same: farmer powerlessness.\n       Many correspondents cited farmers' dwindling share of the \n     retail food dollar as evidence of their growing \n     powerlessness. Others likened supersized, globalized \n     businesses--packers and grain companies being the favored \n     targets--to power-taking, farmer-breaking, peasant-making \n     monsters. And still other suggested ``free, but not fair \n     trade'' drains them of market power.\n       Despite the woe-filled times, farmers are not powerless. \n     There are many things all can do individually to claim, or \n     reclaim, the power they feel has been vacuumed from them. \n     Here's a list of 10 actions farmers or ranchers can take to \n     be empowered:\n       1. Get informed. If information is power--and it is--the \n     inverse must be that ignorance is powerlessness. Go to the \n     library, get on the Internet, read the newspaper, turn off \n     the television.\n       And don't read, listen or view just the ag press. We're \n     some of the duller knives in the journalism drawer. Include \n     nonag sources, too, such as The Wall Street Journal, The \n     Washington Post Weekly Edition and National Public Radio's \n     Morning Edition.\n       2. Sign a checkoff recall petition. Petitions are \n     circulating for recall votes in both the pork and beef \n     checkoffs. This year also should bring a recall petition for \n     the soybean checkoff. It's your right to petition and your \n     right to vote. Secure it, then exercise it.\n       3. Write your U.S. representatives and senators to demand \n     full, open and immediate price reporting in all ag markets. \n     Don't ask\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\n     for it; demand it. The only entity that can make the present \n     hide-and-seek system work are integrators. And not in just \n     today's livestock markets. Tomorrow's grain markets will be \n     equally messy if the current price reporting system is not \n     pried open so all farmers have equal standing and full \n     information when approaching the market.\n       4. Don't buy from firms that are destroying farm markets \n     and rural communities. Holdover from the '60s, heh? \n     Positively. You don't have to buy eggs from a sleazy company \n     that violates every state pollution law on the books; you \n     don't need to buy chicken from a firm that buys members of \n     Congress and Cabinet members; and you don't have to buy \n     livestock feed--at whatever price--from the integrated \n     conglomerate that is building hog units and destroying your \n     neighbors' businesses and families. And sure, withholding \n     your nickels and dimes may not stop the inevitable. But it \n     won't finance it either.\n       5. Join a farm organization--any of them--and get involved. \n     You can't hit the game-winning home run if you're not a \n     player.\n       6. Make 1999 the year you reclaim your co-ops, especially \n     your regional co-ops. It--and as a stockholder, really you--\n     should not be in the business of ruining the livestock \n     industry and building a fabulously well-paid bureaucracy in \n     the process. If you reshape it from its present vertical \n     structure to a more horizontal structure--the co-op shape \n     your grandfather envisioned--more of its profits will come \n     back to co-op's owners. That's you.\n       7. Push, prod, poke, pound and humiliate Congress to pass \n     tough, meaningful campaign finance reform. The present system \n     is a dollar democracy, owned and operated by well-oiled \n     influence peddlers and puppeteers who make politicians dance \n     like an organ grinder's monkey.\n       It is the very rotten core of your growing powerlessness.\n       8. The United States grows billions of pounds of beef and \n     not one pound of bananas. Yet this administration will fight \n     for the handful of very rich U.S. banana exporters and not \n     impose similar import tariffs on European goods in support of \n     900,000 U.S. cattlemen (See No. 7.) Every farm group and \n     every farmer should make exposing this sham one of their top \n     five priorities in 1999.\n       9. Draw the line and categorically oppose every new \n     agribusiness merger. Every one. Why is the farmer's share of \n     the food dollar dwindling? Largely because big--and getting \n     bigger--corporations have strengthened their holds on choke \n     points in the food chain until they choke their profits out \n     of you.\n       10. Don't quit. To paraphrase an old axiom, all it takes \n     for bad ideas to further dominate agriculture is for good \n     people--you--to do nothing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/28/senate-section/article/S1103-3", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ROBERT J. SCHWINGHAMER\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nRobert Schwinghamer on the occasion of his retirement for his \nsignificant contributions to our nation's space and rocket program. He \nserved most recently within the office of the Director as the Associate \nDirector, Technical, at NASA's George C. Marshall Space Flight Center \nin Huntsville, Alabama. Bob Schwinghamer's legacy is one of outstanding \nleadership, unselfish professional service, and a steadfast dedication \nto America's space program. It is a personal honor for me to recognize \nthe more than 40 years that Bob so willingly committed to our country. \nI salute the distinguished achievements of this remarkable Alabamian \nfor what his service has meant to the State of Alabama, the Nation, and \nNASA.\n  Bob's splendid record of achievement speaks for itself. He has been \nthe recipient of several NASA Outstanding Leadership and Distinguished \nService Medals; the Presidential Rank Distinguished Executive Award \nfrom President George Bush in 1992; Top Engineer in NASA and one of the \nTop Ten Engineers in Federal Government in 1990 and 1992. He also \nreceived numerous Group Achievement and Sustained Superior Performance \nAwards. With an ebullient leadership style, Bob Schwinghamer also led \nNASA investigation teams through times of crisis. In 1973, he received \nthe NASA Medal for Exceptional Service to the Apollo Program. In 1986, \nhe led the Space Shuttle Challenger Accident Solid Rocket Motor \nInvestigation Team. In 1998, he received the NASA Outstanding \nLeadership Medal for leadership in Returning the Space Shuttle Safely \nto Flight, and in 1990, he led the Space Shuttle Hydrogen Leak \nInvestigation Team. His outstanding record of service and his unfailing \nloyalty to the U.S. space program cannot be paid its proper due with \nmere words.\n  Bob Schwinghamer received his Bachelor-of-Science Degree in \nEngineering from Purdue University in 1950 and then completed his \nMaster of Science Degree in Management from the Massachusetts Institute \nof Technology in 1968. During his notable career, he served as a \nregistered professional engineer in the States of Indiana, Ohio, and \nAlabama.\n  Bob is a member of several highly regarded professional and honorary \nsocieties including the American Society for Materials, International; \nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Society of \nManufacturing Engineers, and the Society for Advancement of Materials \nand Processes Engineering. His devotion to the field of science has \nearned him continuing recognition throughout the space and missile \ncommunity all over the country.\n  Mr. Schwinghamer's professional prowess and outstanding leadership \nare certainly noteworthy, but he also deserves recognition for being a \ndevoted husband and father and an involved citizen. As an active member \nof his community, he has given his efforts to outside activities \nincluding service as Vice President of Grissom High School's PTA, \nPresident of the Lily Flagg Club, and President of the MSFC Skeet Club. \nHe has and continues to inspire individuals in his workplace, \ncommunity, and home. Bob's generosity and willingness to serve others \nis a trait which endears him to all of us.\n  It is with warmest regards and best wishes that I offer Robert J. \nSchwinghamer and his family every happiness in all of their future \nendeavors. It is right that we honor and celebrate his retirement. I \nsalute Bob Schwinghamer as he embarks on the beginning of the next \nchapter of his life. Our nation's space program will have to replace \none of its finest. His presence and expertise will certainly be \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/28/senate-section/article/S1104-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NEW SHOREHAM POLICE CHIEF WILLIAM A.

McCombe, Chief of Police in the Town of New Shoreham on \nBlock Island, Rhode Island.\n  Chief McCombe grew up in my hometown of Cranston, Rhode Island. He \nembarked on a long and successful career in public service by joining \nthe New Shoreham Police Department in 1980 at the age of 20, attending \nthe Rhode Island Police Academy the following year.\n  After being promoted to Sergeant in 1984, Mr. McCombe received a \nbachelors degree in Criminal Justice from Roger Williams University in \n1987. In 1992, at 32 years of age, he was promoted to Chief of Police \nfor the Town of New Shoreham. Two years later, Chief McCombe graduated \nfrom the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia. He also has \nattended the Secret Service Diplomatic School in Washington, DC in \n1998.\n  I have known Chief McCombe for a few years, but following President \nClinton's decision to accept my invitation to visit Block Island, I \nworked closely with the Chief to ensure the President's short stay went \nsmoothly. Chief McCombe's professionalism and attention to detail were \nexemplary and were essential in ensuring that the island's limited \nresources were not overwhelmed.\n  Chief McCombe has lived on Block Island for 21 years and has served \non the police department for 19 of those years. He has devoted his life \nto preserving the public safety enjoyed by the people of the Town of \nNew Shoreham and the entire state of Rhode Island.

Mr. President, let me begin by saying that the \nreason we are here today, the reason the United States Senate is being \nasked to exercise what Alexander Hamilton termed the ``awful \ndiscretion'' of impeachment, is because of the wrongful, reprehensible, \nindefensible conduct of one person, the President of the United States, \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton. Indeed, I believe it is conduct deserving of \nthe censure of the Senate, and I will support such a resolution when it \ncomes before us.\n  The question before the Senate, however, is not whether the \nPresident's conduct was wrong, or immoral, or even censurable. We must \ndecide solely as to whether or not he should be convicted of the \nallegations contained in the Articles of Impeachment and thus removed \nfrom office. In my opinion, the case for removal, presented in great \ndetail in the massive 60,000 page report submitted by the House, in \nmany hours of very capable but often repetitive presentations to the \nSenate by the House Managers and the President's defense team, and in \nmany additional hours of Senators' questioning of the two sides, fails \nto meet the very high standards which we must demand with respect to \nPresidential impeachments. Therefore, I will vote to dismiss the \nimpeachment case against William Jefferson Clinton, and to vote for the \nSenate resuming other necessary work for the American people.\n  To this very point, I have reserved my judgment on this question \nbecause of my Constitutional responsibility and Oath to ``render \nimpartial justice'' in this case. Most of the same record presented in \ngreat detail to Senators in the course of the last several weeks has \nlong been before the public, and indeed most of that public, including \neditorial boards, talk show hosts, and so forth, long ago reached their \nown conclusions as to the impeachment of President Clinton. But I have \nnow heard enough to make my decision. With respect to the witnesses the \nHouse Managers apparently now wish to depose and call before the \nSenate, the existing record represents multiple interrogations by the \nOffice of the Independent Counsel and its Grand Jury, with not only no \ncross-examinations by the President's counsel but, with the exception \nof the President's testimony, without even the presence of the \nwitnesses' own counsel. It is difficult for me to see how that record \nwould possibly be improved from the prosecution's standpoint. Thus, I \nwill not support motions to depose or call witnesses.\n  In reaching my decision on impeachment, there are a number of factors \nwhich have been discussed or speculated about in the news media which \nwere not a part of my calculations.\n  First of all, while as political creatures neither the Senate nor the \nHouse can or should be immune from public opinion, we have a very \nprecise Constitutionally-prescribed responsibility in this matter, and \npopular opinion must not be a controlling consideration. I believe \nRepublican Senator William Pitt Fessenden of Maine said it best during \nthe only previous Presidential Impeachment Trial in 1868:\n\n       To the suggestion that popular opinion demands the \n     conviction of the President on these charges, I reply that he \n     is not now on trial before the people, but before the Senate \n     . . . The people have not heard the evidence as we have heard \n     it. The responsibility is not on them, but upon us. They have \n     not taken an oath to ``do impartial justice according to the \n     Constitution and the laws.'' I have taken that oath. I cannot \n     render judgment upon their convictions, nor can they transfer \n     to themselves my punishment if I violate my own. And I should \n     consider myself undeserving of the confidence of that just \n     and intelligent people who imposed upon me this great \n     responsibility, and unworthy of a place among honorable men, \n     if for any fear of public reprobation, and for the sake of \n     securing popular favor, I should disregard the convictions of \n     my judgment and my conscience.\n\n  Nor was my decision premised on the notion, suggested by some, that \nthe stability of our government would be severely jeopardized by the \nimpeachment of President Clinton. I have full faith in the strength of \nour government and its leaders and, more importantly, faith in the \nAmerican people to cope successfully with whatever the Senate decides. \nThere can be no doubt that the impeachment of a President would not be \neasy for the country but just in this Century, about to end, we have \nendured great depressions and world wars. Today, the U.S. economy is \nstrong, the will of the people to move beyond this national nightmare \nis great, and we have an experienced and able Vice President who is \nmore than capable of stepping up and assuming the role of the \nPresident.\n  Third, although we have heard much argument that the precedents of \njudicial impeachments should be controlling in this case, I have not \nbeen convinced and did not rely on such testimony in making my \ndecision. After a review of the record, historical precedents, and \nconsideration of the different roles of Presidents and federal judges, \nI have concluded that there is indeed a different legal standard for \nimpeachment of Presidents and federal judges. Article 11, Section 4 of \nthe Constitution provides that ``the President, Vice President, and all \ncivil officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on \nImpeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high \nCrimes and Misdemeanors.'' Article III, Section I of the Constitution \nindicates that judges ``shall hold their Offices during good \nBehavior.'' Presidents are elected by the people and serve for a fixed \nterm of years, while federal judges are appointed without public \napproval to serve a life tenure without any accountability to the \npublic. Therefore, under our system, impeachment is the only way to \nremove a federal judge from office while Presidents serve for a \nspecified term and face accountability to the public through elections. \nWith respect to the differing impeachment standards themselves, Chief \nJustice Rehnquist once wrote, ``the terms `treason, bribery and other \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors' are narrower than the malfeasance in \noffice and failure to perform the duties of the office, which may be \ngrounds for forfeiture of office held during good behavior.''\n  And my conclusions with respect to impeachment were not based upon \nconsiderations of the proper punishment of President Clinton for his \nmisdeeds. During the impeachment of President Nixon, the Report by the \nStaff of the Impeachment Inquiry concluded that ``impeachment is the \nfirst step in a remedial process--removal from office and possible \ndisqualification from holding future office. The purpose of impeachment \nis not personal punishment; its function is primarily to maintain \nconstitutional government.'' Regardless of the outcome of the Senate \nimpeachment trial, President Clinton remains subject to censure by the \nHouse and Senate, and criminal prosecution for any crimes he may have \ncommitted. Whatever punishment President Clinton deserves for his \nmisdeeds will be provided elsewhere.\n  Finally, I do not believe that perjury or obstruction of justice \ncould never rise to the level of threatening grievous harm to the \nRepublic, and thus represent adequate grounds for removal of a \nPresident. However, we must approach such a determination with the \ngreatest of care. Impeachment of a President is, perhaps with the power \nto declare War, the gravest of Constitutional responsibilities bestowed \nupon the Congress. During the history of the United States, the Senate \nhas only held impeachment trials for two Presidents, the 1868 trial of \nPresident Johnson, who had not been elected to that office, and now \nPresident Clinton. Although the Senate can look to impeachment trials \nof other public officials, primarily judicial, as I have already said, \nI do not believe that those precedents are or should be controlling in \nimpeachment trials of Presidents, or indeed of other elected officials.\n  My decision was based on one overriding concern: the impact of this \nprecedent-setting case on the future of the Presidency, and indeed of \nthe Congress itself. It is not Bill Clinton who should occupy our only \nattention. He already stands rebuked by the House impeachment votes, \nand by the words of virtually every member of Congress of both \npolitical parties. And even if we do not remove him from office, he \nstill stands liable to future criminal prosecution for his actions, as \nwell as to the verdict of history. No, it is Mr. Clinton's successors, \nRepublican, Democrat or any other Party, who should be our concern.\n\n[[Page S1106]]\n\n  The Republican Senator, Edmund G. Ross of Kansas, who ``looked down \ninto my open grave'' of political oblivion when he cast one of the \ndecisive votes in acquitting Andrew Johnson in spite of his personal \ndislike of the President explained his motivation this way:\n\n       . . . In a large sense, the independence of the executive \n     office as a coordinate branch of the government was on trial \n     . . . If . . . the President must step down . . . upon \n     insufficient proofs and from partisan considerations, the \n     office of President would be degraded, cease to be a \n     coordinate branch of government, and ever after subordinated \n     to the legislative will. It would practically have \n     revolutionized our splendid political fabric into a partisan \n     Congressional autocracy.\n\n  While our government is certainly on a stronger foundation now than \nin the aftermath of the Civil War, the basic point remains valid. If \nanything, in today's world of rapidly emerging events and threats, we \nneed an effective, independent Presidency even more than did mid-19th \nCentury Americans.\n  While in the history of the United States the U.S. Senate has never \nbefore considered impeachment articles against a sitting elected \nofficial, we do have numerous cases of each House exercising its \nConstitutional right to, ``punish its Members for disorderly behavior, \nand, with the concurrence of two-thirds expel a Member.'' However, \nsince the Civil War, while a variety of cases involving personal and \nprivate misconduct have been considered, the Senate has never voted to \nexpel a member, choosing to censure instead on seven occasions, and the \nHouse has rarely chosen the ultimate sanction. Should the removal of a \nPresident be subject to greater punishment with lesser standards of \nevidence than the Congress has applied to itself when the Constitution \nappears to call for the reverse in limiting impeachment to cases of \n``treason, bribery and other high crimes or misdemeanors''? In my view, \nthe answer must be NO.\n  Thus, for me, as one United States Senator, the bar for impeachment \nand removal from office of a President must be a high one, and I want \nthe record to reflect that my vote to dismiss is based upon a standard \nof evidence equivalent to that used in criminal proceedings--that is, \nthat guilt must be proven ``beyond a reasonable doubt''--and a standard \nof impeachable offense which, in my view, conforms to the Founders' \nintentions that such an offense must be one which represents official \nmisconduct threatening grievous harm to our whole system of government. \nTo quote Federalist #65, Hamilton defined as impeachable, ``those \noffenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other \nwords, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a \nnature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as \nthey relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society \nitself.'' As I have said before, I can conceive of instances in which \nboth perjury and obstruction of justice would meet this test, and I \ncertainly believe that most, if not all, capital crimes, including \nmurder, would qualify for impeachment and removal from office. However, \nin my judgment, the current case does not reach the necessary high \nstandard.\n  In the words of John F. Kennedy, ``with a good conscience our only \nsure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds,'' I believe \nthat dismissal of the impeachment case against William Jefferson \nClinton is the appropriate action for the U.S. Senate. It is the action \nwhich will best preserve the system of government which has served us \nso well for over two hundred years, a system of checks and balances, \nwith a strong and independent chief executive.\n  In closing, I wish to address those in the Senate and House, and \namong the American public, who have reached a different conclusion than \nhave I in this case. I do not question the sincerity or legitimacy of \nyour viewpoint. The process itself pushes us to make absolute \njudgments--yes or no to conviction and removal from office--and the \nnature of debate yields portraits of complex issues in stark black-and-\nwhite terms, but I believe it is possible for reasonable people to \nreach different conclusions on this matter. Indeed, I recognize that, \nwhile my decision seeks to avoid the dangers of setting the impeachment \nbar too low, setting that bar too high is not without risks. I believe \nthe House Managers spoke eloquently about the need to preserve respect \nfor the rule of law, including the critical principle that no one, not \neven the President of the United States, is above that rule. However, I \nhave concluded that the threat to our system of a weakened Presidency, \nmade in some ways subordinate to the will of the legislative branch, \noutweighs the potential harm to the rule of law, because that latter \nrisk is mitigated by:\n  An intact, independent criminal justice system, which indeed will \nretain the ability to render final, legal judgment on the President's \nconduct;\n  A vigorous, independent press corps which remains perfectly capable \nof exposing such conduct, and of extracting a personal, professional \nand political price; and\n  An independent Congress which will presumably continue to have the \nwill and means to oppose Presidents who threaten our system of \ngovernment.\n  By the very nature of this situation, where I sit in judgment of a \nDemocratic President as a Democratic Senator, I realize that my \ndecision cannot convey the non-partisanship which is essential to \nachieve closure on this matter, one way or the other. Indeed, in words \nwhich could have been written today, the chief proponent among the \nFounding Fathers of a vigorous Chief Executive, Alexander Hamilton, \nwrote in 1788, in No. 65 of The Federalist Papers, that impeachments \n``will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and \nto divide them into parties, more or less friendly or inimical, to the \naccused. In many cases, it will connect itself with the pre-existing \nfactions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, \ninfluence and interest on one side, or on the other; and in such cases \nthere will always be the greatest danger, that the decision will be \nregulated more by the comparative strength of the parties than by the \nreal demonstration of guilt or innocence.''\n  I have, however, in making my decision laid out for you the standards \nwhich I believe to be appropriate whenever the Congress considers the \nremoval from office of an elected official, whether Executive Branch, \nor Legislative Branch. I will do my best to stand by those standards in \nall such cases to come before me while I have the privilege of \nrepresenting the people of Georgia in the United States Senate, \nregardless of the party affiliation of the accused. I only hope and \npray that no future President, of either Party, will ever again engage \nin conduct which provides any basis, including the basis of the current \ncase, for the Congress to consider the grave question of \nimpeachment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/28/senate-section/article/S1105-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1106-S1107]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MOTIONS TO DISMISS AND TO SUBPOENA WITNESSES\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, during yesterday's impeachment \ntrial proceedings, I voted against the motion to dismiss offered by the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. I also voted in favor \nof allowing the House Managers to depose a limited number of witnesses \nin this case. I would like to explain the reasons for my votes.\n  Let me state first that I understand that this trial is a unique \nproceeding; it is not precisely a ``trial'' as we understand that term \nto be used in the criminal context. The Senate, for example, as the \nChief Justice made clear in upholding Senator Harkin's objection early \nin the trial, is both judge and jury, with the final authority to \ndetermine not only the ``guilt'' or ``innocence'' of the defendant, but \nalso the legal standard to apply and what kind of evidence is relevant \nto the decision.\n  Nonetheless, Sen. Byrd's motion was a motion to dismiss, which I \nbelieve gives the motion a legal connotation we must not ignore. I \nbelieve that in order to dismiss the case at this point, a Senator \nshould be of the opinion that it is not possible for the House Managers \nto show that the President has committed high crimes and misdemeanors, \neven if they are permitted to call the witnesses that they want to \ncall. Even apart from the possibility of witness testimony, in order to \nvote for the motion, a Senator should believe that regardless of what \noccurs in the closing arguments by the parties and in deliberations in \nthe Senate, that a Senator would not vote to convict.\n  So for me, this motion to dismiss was akin to asking the judge in \nthis case not to send the case to the jury. In a\n\n[[Page S1107]]\n\ncriminal trial, there is a strong presumption against taking a case out \nof the hands of the jury, and a very high degree of certainty on the \nfacts of the case is demanded before a judge will take that step. \nIndeed, a judge must decide that a reasonable juror viewing the \nevidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution could not vote \nto convict the defendant, before he will direct a judgment of \nacquittal.\n  My view, as of this moment, is that to dismiss this case would in \nappearance and in fact improperly ``short circuit'' this trial. I \nsimply cannot say that the House Managers cannot prevail regardless of \nwhat witnesses might plausibly testify and regardless of what \npersuasive arguments might be offered either by the Managers or by \nSenators who support conviction. And when the history of this trial is \nwritten, I want it to be viewed as fair and comprehensive, not as \nhaving been shortened merely because the result seemed preordained.\n  As Senator Collins and I indicated in a letter to Senator Byrd on \nSaturday and in a unanimous consent request we offered on Monday, my \npreference would have been to divide the motion to dismiss and allow \nseparate votes on the two articles of impeachment to more closely \napproximate the separate final votes on the two articles contemplated \nby the impeachment rules. It would have allowed the Senate to consider \nthe strength of the evidence presented on the two separate articles and \nthe possibility that one of the articles comes closer to the core \nmeaning of high crimes and misdemeanors than the other.\n  I believe that many of my colleagues on the Republican side view the \nperjury article as less convincing than the obstruction article and \nmight have voted to dismiss it had the opportunity to do that been made \navailable. But we will never know. When a final vote is taken on the \narticles, and I now believe such votes will almost certainly occur, I \nhope that my colleagues who did not vote to dismiss the case today will \ncarefully consider the two articles separately.\n  I want to be clear that my vote not to dismiss this case does not \nmean that I would vote to convict the President and remove him from \noffice or that I am leaning in that direction. I have not reached a \ndecision on that question. It is my inclination, however, to demand a \nvery high standard of proof on this question. Because the House \nManagers have relied so heavily on the argument that the President has \ncommitted the federal crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice as \nthe reason that his conduct rises to the level of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors, they probably should be required to prove each element of \nthose crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. That is the standard that \njuries in criminal proceedings must apply. In this case, where the \n``impeachability'' question rests so much on a conclusion that the \nPresident's conduct was not only reprehensible but also criminal, I \ncurrently believe that standard is the most appropriate for a Senator \nto apply.\n  It is my view at this point that the House Managers' case has some \nserious problems, and I am not certain that it can be helped by further \ntestimony from witnesses. But I believe it is possible that it can, and \nthe Managers deserve the opportunity to take the depositions they have \nrequested.\n  In voting against the motion to dismiss and to allow witnesses to be \nsubpoenaed, I have not reached the important question of whether, even \nif the House Managers manage to prove their case beyond a reasonable \ndoubt, the offenses charged would be ``impeachable'' and require the \nPresident to be removed from office. That is an important question that \nI decided should be addressed in the context of a final vote on the \narticles after the evidentiary record is complete. Therefore, I want to \nbe clear that my vote against the motion does not mean I am leaning in \nfavor of a final vote to convict the President. I am not.\n  But I have determined, after much thought, that we must continue to \nmove forward and not truncate the proceeding at this point. I believe \nthat it is appropriate for the House Managers, and if they so choose, \nthe President's Counsel, to be able to depose and possibly to present \nthe live testimony of at least a small number of witnesses. And I want \nto hear final arguments and deliberate with my colleagues before \nrendering a final verdict on the articles.\n  I reached my decision on witnesses for a number of reasons. First, \nalthough I recognize that this is not a typical, ordinary criminal \ntrial, it is significant and in my mind persuasive that in almost all \ncriminal trials witnesses are called by the prosecution in trying to \nprove its case. Because I have decided that the House Managers probably \nmust be held to the highest standard of proof--beyond a reasonable \ndoubt--I believe that they should have every reasonable opportunity to \nmeet that standard and prove their case.\n  Furthermore, witnesses have been called every time in our history \nthat the Senate has held an impeachment trial. (In two cases, the \nimpeachment of Sen. Blount in 1797 and the impeachment of Judge English \nin 1926, articles of impeachment passed by the House were dismissed \nwithout a trial.) Now I recognize that an unusually exhaustive factual \nrecord has been assembled by the Independent Counsel, including \nnumerous interviews with, and grand jury testimony from, key witnesses. \nThat distinguishes this case from a number of past impeachments. But in \nat least the three judicial impeachments in the 1980s, the record of a \nfull criminal trial (two resulting in conviction and one in acquittal) \nwas available to the Senate and still witnesses testified.\n  In this case, the House Managers strenuously argued that witnesses \nshould be called. It would call the fairness of the process into \nquestion were we to deny the House Managers the opportunity to depose \nat least those witnesses that might shed light on the facts in a few \nkey areas of disagreement in this case. I regard this as a close case \nin some respects, and the best course to follow is to allow both sides \na fair opportunity to make the case they wish to make.\n  This does not mean that I support an unlimited number of witnesses or \nan unnecessarily extended trial. Furthermore, at this point, I am \nreserving judgment on the question of whether live testimony on the \nSenate floor should be permitted. I believe the Senate has the power, \nand should exercise the power, to assure that any witnesses called to \ndeliver live testimony have evidence that is truly relevant to present.\n  In this regard, I think we should allow somewhat greater latitude to \nthe President's counsel since he is the defendant in this proceeding. I \nam inclined to give a great deal of deference to requests by the \nPresident's counsel to conduct discovery and even call additional \nwitnesses if they feel that is necessary. But at least with respect to \nthe House Manager's case, while we must be fair in allowing them to \ndepose the witnesses they say they need to prove their case, we need \nnot allow them to broaden their case beyond the acts alleged in the \narticles or inordinately extend the trial with witnesses who cannot \nreasonably be expected to provide evidence relevant to our decision on \nthose articles.\n  Finally, let me reiterate. My vote against the motion to dismiss \nshould not be interpreted as a signal that I intend to vote to convict \nthe President. Nor does it mean that I would not support a motion to \nadjourn or a motion to dismiss offered at some later stage of this \ntrial, although I strongly prefer that this trial conclude with a final \nvote on the articles. It only means that I do not believe that \ndismissing the case at this moment is the appropriate course for the \nSenate to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/28/senate-section/article/S1106-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1107-S1109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MOTION OF THE HOUSE MANAGERS FOR THE APPEARANCE OF WITNESSES AT \n                   DEPOSITIONS AND TO ADMIT EVIDENCE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the House Managers want to conduct \ndepositions of at least four people and their requests to admit \naffidavits could very well lead to the depositions of at least three \nothers and, indeed, many more witnesses. The three people they \nexpressly ask be subpoenaed are Monica Lewinsky, Vernon Jordan and \nSidney Blumenthal. All three have previously testified before the Starr \ngrand jury and Ms. Lewinsky has been interviewed or testified at least \n23 times on these matters over the last year.\n  The fourth deponent requested by the House Managers is none other \nthan the President of the United States. Although they characterize \ntheir request\n\n[[Page S1108]]\n\nas a ``petition'' that the President be requested to appear, in their \nMemorandum, the House Republican Managers are less coy about their \nrequest. They note that ``obtaining testimony from the witness named in \nthe motion, and additionally from the President himself'' is what they \nseek.\n  The House Manager' request is unprecedented in impeachments. The \nSenate has never formally requested or demanded that a respondent \ntestify in his own impeachment trial. Should the President decide that \nhe wants to speak to the Senate, that would be his choice. But I cannot \nsupport an effort that would have the Senate reject over 200 years of \nour jurisprudence and begin requiring an accused to prove his \ninnocence.\n  The presumption of innocence is a core concept in our rule of law and \nshould not be so cavalierly abandoned. The petition of the House \nManagers is a clever but destructive effort to stand this trial on its \nhead. As a former prosecutor and trial attorney, I appreciate the \ntemptation to turn the tables on an accused person to make up for a \nweak case, but the Senate should not condone it. The burden of proof is \non the House to establish why the Senate should convict and remove from \noffice the person the American people elected to serve as their \nPresident.\n  I commend President Clinton for focussing on his duties as President \nand on moving the country forward. That the Congress remains immersed \nin this impeachment trial is distraction enough from the functions of \nour federal government. We have heard hours of argument from the House \nRepublican Managers and the response of the President's lawyers. \nSenator Byrd has, pursuant to our Unanimous Consent Resolution \ngoverning these proceedings, offered a motion to dismiss to bring this \nentire matter to conclusion. If, on the other hand, the majority in the \nSenate wishes to continue these proceedings, that is the majority's \nprerogative.\n  The House Managers apparently want to excuse the weaknesses in their \ncase by blaming the Senate for not calling the President to the stand \nor the President for not volunteering to run the gauntlet of House \nManagers. Having had the House reject their proposed article of \nimpeachment based on the President's deposition in the Jones case, the \nHouse Managers are left to pursue their shifting allegations of \nperjury  before the grand jury. Their allegations of perjury have \ndevolved to semantical differences and the choice of such words as \n``occasional'' and ``on certain occasions.'' Their view of perjury \nallows them to take a part of a statement out of context and say that \nit is actionable for not explicating all relevant facts and \ncircumstances. They view perjury by a standard that would condemn most \npresentations, even some of their own presentations before the Senate.\n\n  In addition to their request that the President be deposed, the House \nRepublican Managers also propose to include in this record affidavits \nand other materials apparently not part of the record provided by Mr. \nStarr or considered by the House. Ironically, in so doing, they have \nchosen to proceed by affidavit. They must know that by proffering the \ndeclaration of an attorney for Paula Jones about that case and the link \nbetween that now settled matter and the Starr investigation, they are \nnecessarily opening this area to possible extensive discovery that \ncould result in the depositions of additional witnesses, as well.\n  Does anyone think that the Senate record can fairly be limited to the \nproffered declaration of Mr. Holmes without giving the President an \nopportunity to depose him and other relevant witnesses after fair \ndiscovery? The links between the Jones case and the Starr investigation \nwill be fair game for examination in the fullness of time if the Holmes \ndeclaration proffered by the House Managers is accepted.\n  The Holmes declaration is at variance with the House Managers' \nproffer. The declaration suggests that the Jones lawyers made a \ncollective decision, whereas the House Managers suggest that the \ndecision to subpoena Ms. Currie was Mr. Holmes' decision. Mr. Holmes \ndeclares that no Washington Post article played any part in his \ndecisionmaking to subpoena Ms. Currie and that the ``does not recall'' \nany attorney in his firm saying anything about such an article ``in the \ndiscussions in which we decided to subpoena Ms. Currie.'' This could \nlead to discovery from a number of Jones lawyers.\n  The Holmes declaration says that the Jones lawyers ``had received \nwhat [they] considered to be reliable information that Ms. Currie was \ninstrumental in facilitating Monica Lewinsky's meetings with Mr. \nClinton and that Ms. Currie was central to the `cover story' Mr. \nClinton and Ms. Lewinsky had developed to use in the event their affair \nwas discovered.'' That assertion was strongly omitted from the House \nRepublican Managers' proffer. That assertion raises questions abut what \nthe Jones lawyers knew, when they knew it and whether there was any \nlink to the Starr investigation. If the purpose of the declaration is \nto rebut the notion that Ms. Currie was subpoenaed because the Jones \nlawyers were following the activities of the Starr investigation, this \ndeclaration falls far short of the mark. It raises more questions that \nit resolves.\n  I am surprised to see a judicial clerk submit an affidavit in this \ncase. The one thing that is clear from Mr. Ward's affidavit is that it \ndoes not support the conclusions drawn in the House Managers' proffer. \nMr. Ward says only that President Clinton was looking directly at Mr. \nBennett at one moment during the argument by the lawyers during the \ndeposition. He does not aver, as the House Managers suggest he would \ncompetently testify, that ``he saw President Clinton listening \nattentively to Mr. Bennett's remarks.''\n\n  While the affidavit of Barry Ward cannot convert the President's \nsilence into statements, it does provide one perspective on the \nPresident's deposition in the Jones case. Accepting that proffered \nevidence may, however, prompt the President's lawyers to want to \nexamine other perspectives to give the Senate a more complete picture \nand a fairer opportunity to consider what was happening during the \ndiscussions among Judge Wright and the lawyers. For that purpose, is \nthe Senate next going to authorize the deposition of Judge Wright and \nthe other lawyers who attended the deposition? The circumstances under \nwhich Mr. Ward came to take such an affidavit and what he knows about \nthe variety of issues mentioned in the House Managers' proffer on this \nitem will undoubtedly be fair subjects of discovery by the President's \nlawyers if this is admitted.\n  The House Managers characterized documents as certain telephone \nrecords and the participants in various telephone calls whose \nidentifies are not revealed by the records. Indeed, those proffered \ndocuments are without authentification. The House Republican Managers' \nbrief goes even farther, suggesting that the telephone records will \nprove what happened at the White House gate on December 6, and \nasserting the identity of those who participated in telephone calls and \nthe content of those telephone calls and concluding that they prove \nmeetings and conversations that were not even by telephone. The \ndocuments appear to be a series of numbers. Giving them content and \ncontext will require more than mere authentification and any such \ntestimonial explanation can be expected to engender further discovery, \nas well.\n  Now let me turn to the witnesses that the House Managers have \nidentified by name and for which they are expressly seeking subpoenas \nat the outset of this discovery period. I understand that under Senate \nResolution 16 Senator must vote for or against the entire package of \nwitnesses and discovery requested by the House.\n  The House Republican Managers have already interviewed Monica \nLewinsky after Mr. Starr arranged for that interview and had her \nordered to comply. In light of the circumstances under which she has \nalready been forced to cooperate with the House Republican Managers, \nany doubt as to the coercion being exercised through her immunity \nagreement could not be more starkly seen. I seriously question Ms. \nLewinsky's freedom to express herself in the present circumstances and \nsuggest that her immunity situation will inevitably affect the \ncredibility of anything that she might ``add'' to the House's case. Mr. \nStarr has the equivalent of a loaded gun to her head, along with her \nmother's and her father's.\n  Consider also the report in The Washington Post on Tuesday that Mr. \nStarr\n\n[[Page S1109]]\n\ntore up her immunity agreement once before when she tried to clarify \nher February 1998 proffer to note that she and the President had talked \nabout using a ``cover story'' before she was ever subpoenaed as a \nwitness in the Jones case, not after. That is now a key point of the \nHouse Managers' proffer but it points now in the other direction by \nsuggesting that she is now willing to testify that the President \n``instructed'' her to invoke cover stories if questioned in connection \nwith the Jones case. Would not such a shift in testimony necessarily \nlead to discovery into the impact of the immunity agreement on her \ntestimony and the many twists and turns in the 7-month negotiation \nbetween Mr. Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's attorneys and the pressures \nexerted upon her over the last six months?\n\n  Moreover, press accounts of the celebrated interview of Ms. Lewinsky \nby the House Managers last weekend suggest that she may also have said \nthings during that interview that were favorable to the President. The \nPresident's counsel are now in the untenable position of having to \noppose the House Managers' motion without specific knowledge of any \nexculpatory information that Ms. Lewinsky may have provided that would \nweigh against the need to call her as a witness. That is unfair and \ncontrary to basic precepts of our law. The House Managers created this \ncircumstance and should not benefit from it.\n  The House Managers also insist that they must open discovery to take \nthe deposition of Vernon Jordan. Mr. Jordan has been interviewed or \ntestified under oath before Starr's grand jury at least five times \nalready. The House Managers' proffer is merely that they expect that \nhis live testimony will lead to reasonable and logical inferences that \nmight help their case and somehow link the job search to discouraging \nher testimony in the Jones case. That is not a proffer of anything new \nbut an attempt to take another shot at eliciting testimony that Mr. \nStarr could not.\n  The House Managers also insist that the Senate must depose Sidney \nBlumenthal. Mr. Blumenthal also testified before the Starr grand jury. \nThe House Managers' proffer notes nothing new that he would be expected \nto provide.\n  If the President has been willing to forego the opportunity to cross \nexamine the witnesses whose grand jury testimony has been relied upon \nby the House Managers, that removes the most pressing need for further \ndiscovery in this matter. After all, Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan, and \nto a lesser extent, Mr. Blumenthal, were interviewed for days and weeks \nby the FBI, trained investigators, Mr. Starr's lawyers and then \ntestified, some repeatedly, before the Starr grand jury. That is about \nas one-sided as discovery gets--no cross examination, no opportunity to \ncompare early statements with the way things are reconfigured and re-\nexpressed after numerous preparation sessions with Mr. Starr's office.\n  These witnesses testified under threat of prosecution by Mr. Starr. \nMs. Lewinsky remains under a very clear threat of prosecution, even \nthough she has a limited grant of immunity from Starr. This special \nprosecutor has shown every willingness to threaten and prosecute.\n  If the President has not initiated efforts to obtain more discovery \nand witnesses and is willing to have the matter decided on the \nvoluminous record submitted to the House, the House Managers carry a \nheavy burden to justify extending these proceedings further and \nrequiring the reexamination of people who have already testified.\n\n  I heard over and over from the House Managers that there is no doubt, \nthat the record established before the House and introduced into this \nSenate proceeding convinced the House to vote for articles of \nimpeachment to require the removal of the President from office last \nmonth. The House Managers have told us that they have done a \nmagnificent job and established their case.\n  Based on the House Managers' Motion and their proffer in \njustification, I do not believe that they have justified extending \nthese proceedings into the future through additional depositions and \nadditional evidence. Can anyone confidently predict how many witnesses \nwill be needed to sort through the evidentiary supplement that the \nHouse proffers and the issues that it raises? Can anyone confidently \npredict how long that discovery will take and how long this trial will \nbe extended? And for what? What is the significant and ultimate \nmateriality to the fundamental issues being contested at this trial of \nthe materials the House is moving now to include in the record? \nAlthough the House Managers can say that they only sought to depose \nthree witnesses, does anyone think that in fairness the President's \nlawyers and the House Managers together will not end up deposing at \nleast 10 people if the Senate were to grant the House motion?\n  The Senate should not extend these proceedings by a single day. The \nSenate runs a grave risk of being drawn down into the mire that stained \nthe House impeachment proceedings. Republicans and Democrats have all \ntold me that they do not believe that there is any possibility that \nthis trial will end in the conviction of the President and his removal. \nIn that light, the Senate should have proceeded to conclude this matter \nrather than extend it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/28/senate-section/article/S1107-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1109-S1110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMOTION TO DISMISS THE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST WILLIAM JEFFERSON \n                                CLINTON\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this Senate is the last of the 20th \ncentury. We begin this first session of the 106th Congress facing a \nchallenge that no other Senate in over 100 years has been called upon \nto meet; namely, whether to remove from office the person the American \npeople elected to serve as the President of the United States.\n  What we do in this impeachment of the President, in terms of the \nstandards we apply and the judgments we make, will either follow the \nConstitution or alter the intent of the Framers for all time. I have \nheard more than one Senator acknowledge that in that sense it is not \njust the President but also the Senate that is on trial in this matter.\n  The Senate now has an opportunity, as provided in S. Res. 16, to vote \non a motion to conclude these proceedings by adopting Senator Byrd's \nmotion to dismiss. I commend Senator Byrd and agree with him that such \naction is both appropriate and in the best interests of the nation. I \ndo not believe that the House Managers have proven a case for \nconviction and removal of the President on the Articles of Impeachment \nsent by the House last year. I further suggest that those articles are \nimproperly vague and duplicitous.\n\n\n                        the president's conduct\n\n  We can all agree that the President's conduct with a young woman in \nthe White House was inexcusable. It was deeply disappointing, \nespecially to those who know the President and who support the many \ngood things he has done for this country. His conduct in trying to keep \nhis illicit relationship secret from his wife and family, his friends \nand associates, and from the glare of a politically-charged lawsuit and \nfrom the American public, though understandable on a human level, has \nhad terrible consequences for him personally and for the legacy of his \npresidency.\n  Last week Senator Bumpers reminded us of the human costs that have \nbeen paid by this President and his family. The underlying lawsuit has \nnow been settled and a financial settlement of $850,000 has been paid \non a case that the District Court judge had dismissed for failing to \nstate a claim. The President has admitted terribly embarrassing \npersonal conduct before a Federal grand jury, has seen a videotape of \nthat grand jury testimony broadcast to the entire nation and had \nexcerpts replayed over and over, again. Articles of Impeachment were \nreported by the House of Representatives against a President for only \nthe second time in our history.\n\n  The question before the Senate is not whether William Jefferson \nClinton has suffered, for surely he has as a result of his conduct. The \nquestion is not even whether William Jefferson Clinton should be \npunished and sent to jail on a criminal charge, for the Constitution \ndoes not confer that authority on this court of impeachment. The \nquestion, as framed by the House, is whether his conduct violated \nfederal criminal laws and, if he did, whether those crimes constitute \n``other high crimes and misdemeanors'' warranting his removal\n\n[[Page S1110]]\n\nfrom the office of President to which he was reelected by the people of \nthe United States in 1996.\n\n\n                        special prosecutor starr\n\n  Justice Robert Jackson, when he was Attorney General in 1940, \nobserved that the most dangerous power of the prosecutor is the power \nto ``pick people that he thinks he should get, rather than cases that \nneed to be prosecuted.'' When this happens, he said, ``it is not a \nquestion of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for \nthe man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the man and \nthen . . . putting investigators to work, to pin some offense on him.'' \n``It is here,'' he concluded, ``that law enforcement becomes personal, \nand the real crime becomes that of being unpopular with the predominant \nor governing group, being attached to the wrong political views, or \nbeing personally obnoxious to or in the way of the prosecutor \nhimself.''\n  In the case of President William Jefferson Clinton, things became \npersonal a long time ago. I am not alone in questioning Mr. Starr's \nconduct. His own ethics advisor felt compelled to resign his position \nafter Mr. Starr appeared before the House Judiciary Committee as the \nhead cheerleader for impeachment.\n  It now appears that Mr. Starr has gone from head cheerleader to the \nchief prosecutor for impeachment. Over the last week he forced Ms. \nLewinsky to cooperate with the House Republican managers as part of her \nimmunity agreement. She must ``cooperate'' under the threat that Mr. \nStarr may decide to prosecute her, her mother or her father if he is \nnot satisfied.\n\n\n                               the senate\n\n  It is now up to the Senate to restore sanity to this process, \nexercise judgment, do justice and act in the interests of the nation. \nWe will be judged both today and by history on whether we resolve this \ncase in a way that serves the good of the country, not the political \nends of any political party or particular person.\n\n  I doubt that any Senator can impartially say that the case against \nthe President has been established beyond a reasonable doubt. In this \nmatter, my view is that is the appropriate standard of proof. Here the \nSenate is being asked to override the electoral judgment of the \nAmerican people with respect to the person they elected to serve them \nas the President of the United States. In this matter the charges have \nnot been established beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal case.\n  The inferences the House Managers would draw from the facts are not \ncompelled by the evidence. Indeed, the House Managers fail to take into \naccount Ms. Lewinsky's admitted interest in keeping her relationship \nwith President Clinton from the public and out of the Jones case. They \nignore the role of Linda Tripp in Ms. Lewinsky's job search and the \nfact that it was Ms. Tripp who suggested that Ms. Lewinsky involve \nVernon Jordan. In light of these and other fundamental flaws in the \nHouse Manager's case, I doubt whether many can vote that the articles \nhave been established by clear and convincing evidence.\n  I know that Republican Senators as well as Democratic Senators have \ntold me that they do not believe there is any realistic possibility \nthat the Senate will convict the President and remove him from office. \nI agree. Having heard the arguments from both sides and considered the \nevidence, I do not believe that there is any possibility that the \nSenate will convict the President on the Articles of Impeachment and \nremove him from office. That being so, I believe that the interests of \nthe nation are best served by ending this matter now, at the earliest \nopportunity.\n  As a consequence of the House's action, the impeachment process is \ncontinuing to preoccupy the Congress into this year. This unfinished \nbusiness of constitutional dimension will necessarily displace the \nother important business facing the country until it is resolved. I \nbelieve this matter should be concluded and we should turn our \nattention to legislative matters.\n  History has judged harshly the Radical Republicans who pursued \nimpeachment against President Andrew Johnson. I believe that history \nwill likewise render a harsh judgment against those who have fomented \nthis impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton on the charges brought \nforward by the House of Representatives. I do not believe those charges \nhave been or can be proven. I do not believe that the House Managers \nhave justified the Senate overriding the 1996 presidential election and \nordering the duly elected President of the United States removed from \noffice.\n\n  When the Chief Justice as presiding officer sustained objection to \nthe House Managers' mischaracterization of the Senate in this matter, \nit highlighted the House Managers' misconceptions of the trial. \nSenators are not merely serving as petit jurors who will be instructed \non the law by a judge and are asked to find facts. Senators have a \ngreater role and a greater responsibility in this trial. As the Chief \nJustice properly observed: ``The Senate is not simply a jury; it is a \ncourt in this case.''\n  Our job is to do justice in this matter and to protect the \nConstitution. In that process, I believe we must serve the interests of \nthe nation and fulfill our responsibilities to the American people. I \nbelieve that this impeachment trial should have been concluded now and \nthat the Articles of Impeachment should be dismissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/28/senate-section/article/S1109-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1110]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ORDERS FOR JANUARY 29, FEBRUARY 2, AND FEBRUARY 3, 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
