We are stunned by the psalmist's reminder that \nYou have crowned us with glory and honor and given us responsibility \nover the work of Your hands. We renew our dependence on You as we \nassume this breathtaking call to courageous leadership.\n  Help the Senators to claim Your promised glory and honor. Imbue them \nwith Your own attributes and strengthen their desire to do what is \nright and just. As they humbly cast before You any crowns of position \nor pride, crown them with Your presence and power. In Your holy Name. \nAmen.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Sergeant at Arms will make proclamation.\n  The Sergeant at Arms, James W. Ziglar, made proclamation as follows:\n\n       Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the Senate of the \n     United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of \n     impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no objection, the Journal of \nproceedings of the trial are approved to date.\n  The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. This afternoon, the Senate will begin final deliberations \non the articles of impeachment. However, pursuant to S. Res. 30, a \nSenator may at this time offer a motion to suspend the rules to allow \nthe final deliberations to remain open. That motion is not amendable \nand no motions to that motion may be offered. Therefore, I expect at \nleast one vote to occur shortly. Following that vote, if the motion is \ndefeated, I will move to close deliberations. If that motion should be \nadopted, the Senate will begin full deliberations, with each Senator \nallocated 15 minutes to speak. And I note that that will be true \nwhether it is in open or closed session, although Senator Daschle and I \nmay have some further comments to make about that later on.\n  I note that if each Senator uses his or her entire debate time, the \nproceedings will take 25 hours, not including breaks and recesses. \nTherefore, I remind all Senators that Lincoln gave his Gettysburg \nAddress in less than 3 minutes and Kennedy's inaugural address was \nslightly over 7 minutes. But certainly every Senator will have his or \nher opportunity to speak for up to 15 minutes, if that is their desire, \nand, of course, we would also need to communicate with the Chief \nJustice about the time of the proceedings.\n  I expect that we will try to go until about 6 or 6:30 this afternoon. \nI want to confer with Senator Daschle, but I think maybe we will try to \nbegin earlier tomorrow and go throughout the day into the early \nevening. Again, we do have to take into consideration the fact that \nabout 7 or 8 hours will be the absolute maximum we will probably be \nable to do in a single day. We will talk further about that and make an \nannouncement before we conclude today.\n  I now yield the floor to the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter, for the purpose of propounding a unanimous consent request.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Senator Specter.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of the leader, and in my \ncapacity as a copresider for the Senate at the deposition of Mr. Sidney \nBlumenthal, I ask unanimous consent that the parties be allowed to take \nadditional discovery, including testimony on oral deposition of Mr. \nChristopher Hitchens, Ms. Carol Blue, Mr. R. Scott Armstrong and Mr. \nSidney Blumenthal with regard to possible fraud on the Senate by \nalleged perjury in the deposition testimony of Mr. Sidney Blumenthal \nwith respect to allegations that he, Mr. Sidney Blumenthal, was \ninvolved with the dissemination beyond the White House of information \ndetrimental to the credibility of Ms. Monica Lewinsky, and that \npursuant to the authority of title II of Senate Resolution 30, the \nChief Justice of the United States, through the Secretary of the \nSenate, shall issue subpoenas for the taking of such testimony at a \ntime and place to be determined by the majority leader after \nconsultation with the Democratic leader, and, further, that these \ndepositions be conducted pursuant to the procedures set forth in title \nII of Senate Resolution 30, except that the last four sentences of \nsection 204 shall not apply to these depositions, provided, further, \nhowever, that the final sentence of section 204 shall apply to the \ndeposition of Mr. Sidney Blumenthal.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. Chief Justice, I object.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n\n\n                      Motion To Suspend The Rules\n\n  Mr. LOTT. On behalf of myself and Senator Daschle, I move to suspend \nthe rules on behalf of Senators Hutchison, Harkin, and others in order \nto conduct open deliberations.\n\n[[Page S1386]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that there be a 40-minute \ndebate, equally divided, between the leaders or their designees in open \nsession on the motion to suspend the rules.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Objection is heard.\n  The question is on the motion to suspend the rules. The yeas and nays \nare automatic. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 59, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                         [Rollcall Vote No. 15]\n\n              [Subject: Lott motion to suspend the rules]\n\n                                YEAS--59\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. On this vote the yeas are 59, the nays are 41. \nTwo-thirds of those Senators voting--a quorum being present--not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. In the absence of objection, so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I want to make this reminder: Only those \npeople who are properly authorized to be on the floor of the Senate \nshould be here. The Sergeant at Arms will act accordingly.\n  Now, Mr. Chief Justice, there is a desire by a number of Senators \nthat it be possible for their statements, even in closed session, to be \nmade a part of the Record. Senator Daschle and I have talked a great \ndeal about this. We think this is an appropriate way to proceed.\n\n\n    Motion Relating to Record of Proceedings Held in Closed Session\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, I send this motion to the desk: That the record \nof the proceedings held in closed session for any Senator to insert \ntheir final deliberations on the articles of impeachment shall be \npublished in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of the trial.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] for himself and Mr. \n     Daschle, moves as follows:\n       That the record of the proceedings held in closed session \n     for any Senator to insert their final deliberations on the \n     Articles of Impeachment shall be published in the \n     Congressional Record at the conclusion of the trial.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, so everybody can understand this, may I \nbe recognized?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is the desire of one and all to have the opportunity for \nthis record to be made. After the trial is concluded, Senators can have \ntheir statements in the closed session put into the Congressional \nRecord--in the record of the trial. There may be Senators that choose, \nfor whatever reason, not to do it in that way at that time. Senator \nDaschle and I have talked a great deal about this. We think this is the \nfair way to make that record. We urge that it be adopted.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. Chief Justice, point of clarification.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. Leader, can I ask a point of clarification? Does \nthis mean that repartee between Members will not be recorded, but just \nthe statement as the Member submits it?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, if I could respond to that, I think that \nwould be up to the Senators. That has been one of my points. I hope we \nwon't just have speeches and that, in fact, we will have deliberations. \nAs we have found ourselves in previous closed sessions, almost \nuncontrollably we wound up discussing and talking with each other. I \nhope that if we come to that, the Senators involved in the exchange \nwould make that a part of the record and part of history. I believe \nthey would have that right under this proposal.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the leader will yield for the purpose of \nclarification, I may have misunderstood what the majority leader \ndescribed here. But our intent would be to allow statements to be \ninserted into the Congressional Record, not into the hearing record.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct. I misstated that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. So that people understand, this would actually allow you \nthe opportunity to insert your statement into the Congressional Record, \nsucceeding the votes on the two articles.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question for the majority \nleader. I might not have heard this the right way. This would allow any \nSenator who so wishes to have his or her statements made in all of \nour--not just the final deliberations, but this would cover all of our \nsessions that have been in closed session; is that correct or not?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe this would be applicable only \nto the final deliberations.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. Chief Justice, if I could ask the majority leader \nwhether he might be willing--it seems to me that if this is the \nprinciple, I wonder if he would amend his request to any Senator who \nwants to--and it is up to the Senator--this is far different than \nhaving our final deliberations a matter of public record, which is what \nI think we should do, but what you are saying is any Senator who so \nwishes can do so. Might that not apply to all of the closed sessions we \nhad? It seems to me that the same principle applies.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is not what is in this proposal. I would like to think \nabout that and discuss it with the Senator from Minnesota and others. I \nremember making a passionate speech, but I had no prepared notes; and \nso I could not put it into the Record if I wanted to when we were in \none of those closed sessions.\n\n  I honestly had not considered that. This was aimed at the closing \ndeliberations. I think we need to give some thought to reaching back \nnow to the other closed sessions before we move in that direction.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Idaho, Mr. Craig, is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. Chief Justice, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Is my understanding correct that your motion would keep \nthis session of deliberations closed, except for those Senators who \nwould choose to have their statements become a part of the \nCongressional Record, and that it would be the choice of the individual \nSenators, and that the deliberations of the closed session would remain \nclosed unless otherwise specified by each individual Senator, specific \nto their statements; is that a fair understanding?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, that is an accurate understanding, and \nthat is with the presumption that we will go into closed session, and \nsuch a motion will be made in short order.\n\n[[Page S1387]]\n\n  I want to also clarify that this is made on behalf of Senator Daschle \nand myself. We have consulted a great deal on this and we have both \nbeen thinking about doing something like this, but we never put it on \npaper until a moment ago.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Georgia, Senator Coverdell, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I want to make an inquiry to the leader in response to \nthe question by the Senator from California, who alluded to actual \ndeliberations and statements among Senators. I assume that in order to \ngo into the Congressional Record, it would require all of the \nparticipants of the colloquy----\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Parliamentarian tells me that this is all out \nof order.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, if I may, in a moment I will make a \nmotion to close the doors for deliberations. However, we have to \ndispose of this.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is on the motion----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask consent to ask the majority \nleader one follow-up question on his motion.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chief Justice, I want to make sure I fully understand \nthe distinguished majority leader. Our vote on what we do on the record \ndoes not include a vote on closing the session itself, it simply \nassumes that vote carries?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, again, I ask consent that I be able to \nask the majority leader a question regarding the ethics.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have a question regarding the ethics rules. Under this \nproposed motion, could a Senator give his or her statement in public \nand then give the same statement in closed session and still not \nviolate the ethics rules? I am concerned about how we might want to \nfollow that.\n  I yield to the head of the Ethics Committee for clarification.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. If the motion carries, as has been \noutlined by the majority leader, you have every right to release your \nstatement. That would not violate rule 29.5.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I could do whatever----\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Your statement, yours, not anybody \nelse's.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask consent to ask the majority \nleader a point of clarification.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If we reference another Senator's remarks in our \nstatements, would we have to get that other Senator's consent in order \nto submit our statement, then, for the Record?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am not chairman of the Ethics Committee, but I am assured \nby those on the committee that you would have to do so. Are we ready to \nmove forward?\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, is \nrecognized,\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask consent that I be permitted to \nask a point of clarification.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask the majority leader this: He mentioned that he hoped \nduring the deliberations that there would be more than just speeches, \nthat there would be a process of colloquy. I was wondering if he was \ncontemplating how that would work because I think under the rules we \nare limited to one intervention of a specific time period. Does the \nmajority leader contemplate approaching that difficulty?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I have discussed this with the \nDemocratic leader, and there is no ironclad rule. You know, in our \nother closed session when we sort of got on a roll, we yielded \nadditional time to each other, and then at some point we started to \nhave a round robin. The Chief Justice probably thought it was all \ncompletely out of order, but he allowed us to go forward. I think we \nwill have to deal with that when we get there. I think, as has been the \ncase all the way along, we will be understanding of each other and try \nto make these deliberations genuine deliberations. I think it would \nbenefit us all in the final result.\n  Before I make a motion to close the doors, I yield to the Senator \nfrom Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, for a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. We have a motion, do we not?\n  Mr. LOTT. I beg your pardon.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. However amorphous it may be. (Laughter.)\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, for that amorphous ruling. \n(Laughter.)\n  I yield to the Senator from Texas for a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas, \nSenator Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. Chief Justice, rule XX says that while the Senate \nis in session the doors shall remain open unless the Senate directs \nthat the doors be closed.\n  My inquiry is this: If the Senate, by a majority, voted not to direct \nthe doors to be closed, would it be in order to proceed to \ndeliberations with the doors open?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair is of the view that it would not be in \norder for this reason: On the initial reading of rules XX and XXIV of \nthe Senate impeachment rules, it would not appear to mandate that the \ndeliberations and debate occur in closed session, but only to permit \nit. But it is clear from a review of the history of the rules that the \ncommittee that was established in 1868 to create the rules specifically \nintended to require closed sessions for debate and deliberation. \nSenator Howard reported the rules for the committee and clearly \nunderstated his intention, and Chief Justice Chase, in the Andrew \nJohnson trial, stated in response to an inquiry, ``There can be no \ndeliberation unless the doors are closed. There can be no debate under \nthe rules unless the doors be closed.''\n\n  I understand from the Parliamentarian that it has been the consistent \npractice of the Senate for the last 130 years in impeachment trials to \nrequire deliberations and debate by the Senate to be held in closed \nsession. Therefore--though there may be some ambiguity between the two \nrules--my ruling is based partly on deference of the Senate's \nlongstanding practice.\n  In the opinion of the Chair, there can be no deliberation on any \nquestion before the Senate in open session unless the Senate suspends \nits rules, or consent is granted.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you.\n\n\n            Motion to Close the Doors for Final Deliberation\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, with that record now having been made, I \nnow move that the doors for final deliberations be closed, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. Chief Justice, the majority leader is trying to \nget the floor, but I wonder whether I could not move that any Senator \nbe allowed, if he or she makes it their choice, to have our statements \nthat have been made and passed in closed session left entirely up to us \nto also be a part of the Congressional Record.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, if I could respond, give us an \nopportunity to discuss this with you. We will have another opportunity \nto do that. I think maybe we can work something out. I would like to \nmake sure we thought it through, if that is appropriate, Mr. Chief \nJustice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I object.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Objection is heard.\n  The yeas and nays are automatic. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1388]]\n\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                         [Rollcall Vote No. 16]\n\n                  [Subject: Motion to close the doors]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n\n                             Closed Session\n\n  (At 1:52 p.m., the doors of the Chamber were closed.

I am also pleased to transmit my \nwritten approval, authorization, and determination concerning the \nagreement, and the memorandum of the Director of the United States Arms \nControl and Disarmament Agency with the Nuclear Proliferation \nAssessment Statement concerning the agreement. The joint memorandum \nsubmitted to me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy, \nwhich includes a summary of the provisions of the agreement and various \nother attachments, including agency views, is also enclosed.\n  The proposed agreement with Romania has been negotiated in accordance \nwith the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended by the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation act of 1978 and as otherwise amended. In my judgment, the \nproposed agreement meets all statutory requirements and will advance \nthe nonproliferation and other foreign policy interests of the United \nStates. The agreement provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful \nnuclear cooperation between the United States and Romania under \nappropriate conditions and controls reflecting our common commitment to \nnuclear nonproliferation goals. Cooperation until now has taken place \nunder a series of supply agreements dating back to 1966 pursuant to the \nagreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation between the United States \nand the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n  The Government of Romania supports international efforts to prevent \nthe spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries. Romania is a \nparty to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) \nand has an agreement with the IAEA for the application of full-scope \nsafeguards to its nuclear program. Romania also subscribes to the \nNuclear Suppliers Group guidelines, which set forth standards for the \nresponsible export of nuclear commodities for peaceful use, and to the \nguidelines of the NPT Exporters Committee (Zangger Committee), which \noblige members to require the application of IAEA safeguards on nuclear \nexports to nonnuclear weapon states. In addition, Romania is a party to \nthe Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material, whereby \nit agrees to apply international standards of physical protection to \nthe storage and transport of nuclear material under its jurisdiction or \ncontrol. Finally, Romania was one of the first countries to sign the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\n  I believe that peaceful nuclear cooperation with Romania under the \nproposed new agreement will be fully consistent with, and supportive \nof, our policy of responding positively and constructively to the \nprocess of democratization and economic reform in Central Europe. \nCooperation under the agreement also will provide opportunities for \nU.S. business on terms that fully protect vital U.S. national security \ninterests.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \nagencies in reviewing the proposed agreement and have determined that \nits performance will promote, and will not constitute an unreasonable \nrisk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, I have approved \nthe agreement and authorized its execution and urge that the Congress \ngive it favorable consideration.\n  Because this agreement meets all applicable requirements of the \nAtomic Energy Act, as amended, for agreements for peaceful nuclear \ncooperation, I am transmitting it to the Congress without exempting it \nfrom any requirement contained in section 123 a. of that Act. This \ntransmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both sections \n123 b. and 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act. My Administration is \nprepared to begin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign \nRelations and House International Relations Committees as provided in \nsection 123 b. Upon completion of the 30-day continuous session period \nprovided for in section 123 b., the 60-day continuous session period \nprovided for in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, February 9, 1999.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1388-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1388-S1391]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1619.

A bill to provide Internet access to certain Congressional \ndocuments, including certain Congressional Research Service \npublications, Senate lobbying and gift report filings, and Senate and \nJoint Committee documents; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n                       CONGRESSIONAL OPENESS ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to introduce the \nCongressional Openess Act, a bill to make selected Congressional \nResearch Service products, lobbyist disclosure reports and Senate gift \ndisclosure forms available over the Internet for the American people. \nThis bipartisan legislation is sponsored by Senators Leahy, Lott, \nAbraham, Robb, and Enzi.\n  The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has a well-known reputation \nfor producing high-quality reports and issue briefs that are concise, \nfactual, and unbiased--a rarity for Washington. Many of us have used \nthese CRS products to make decisions on a wide variety of legislative \nproposals and issues, including Amtrak reform, the Endangered Species \nAct, the Line-Item veto, and U.S. policy in Zambia. Also, we routinely \nsend these products to our constituents in order to help them \nunderstand the important issues of our time.\n  My colleagues and I believe that it is important that the public be \nable to use this CRS information. The American public will pay $67.1 \nmillion to fund CRS' operations for fiscal year 1999. They should be \nallowed to see that their money is being well-spent on material that is \nneither confidential nor classified.\n\n[[Page S1392]]\n\n  Congress can also serve two important functions by allowing public \naccess to this information. When we give the public access to these CRS \nproducts, it will mark an important milestone in opening up the federal \ngovernment. Our constituents will be able to see the research documents \nwhich influence our decisions and understand the factors that we \nconsider before a vote. This will give the public a more accurate view \nof the Congressional decision-making process to counter the current \nprevailing cynical view.\n  Also, CRS reports will serve an important role in informing the \npublic. Members of the public will be able to read these CRS products \nand receive a concise, accurate summary of the issues that concern \nthem. As elected representatives, we should do what we can to promote \nan informed, educated public. The educated voter is best able to make \ndecisions and petition us to do the right things here.\n  It is important to realize that these products are already out on the \nInternet. ``Black market'' private vendors can charge $49 for a single \nreport. Other web sites have outdated CRS products on them. It is not \nfair for the American people to have to pay a third party for out-of-\ndate products for which they have already footed the bill.\n  Last year my colleagues on the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration proposed that Senators and Committee chairmen be allowed \nto post CRS products as they see fit on the Internet. I appreciate this \ngesture, and believe that it was a first step. Today we are proposing \nthe commonsense next step--a centralized web site.\n  A centralized web site will make it much easier for the public to \nfind CRS information. The public can just go to a web site and look up \nthose products that interest them. That would be much easier than \nhaving them go through all of our web sites to find CRS reports.\n  One concern about the legislation we introduced last year was that it \nwould not protect CRS from more public scrutiny. We would like to \nensure you that we do not want to put CRS in a position that would in \nany way alter its current mission or open it up to liability suits.\n  Therefore, the bill provides that this centralized web site will be \naccessible only through Members' and Committees' web sites. This \nprocess will preserve CRS' mission by reducing its public visibility. \nMore importantly, it will continue to allow us to inform our \nconstituents about how we are helping them here in Washington.\n  This bill also includes other safeguards to ensure that CRS will \nremain protected from public interference. The Director of CRS is \nempowered to remove any information from these reports that he believes \nis confidential. He also can remove the names and phone numbers of CRS \nemployees from these products to keep the public from distracting them \nfrom doing their jobs. We have also been informed that CRS may not have \npermission to release copyrighted information over the Internet. While \nwe hope that this situation can be quickly resolved, we have included a \nprovision in this bill to allow the Director to remove unprotected \ncopyrighted information from these reports before they are posted. \nFinally, we have allowed a 30-day delay between the release of these \nCRS products to Members of Congress and the public. This delay allows \nCRS to review their products, consult with us, and revise their \nproducts to ensure that only accurate, up-to-date information is \navailable to the public.\n  It should be pointed out that CRS has been granted none of these \nprotections as part of the current decentralized approach.\n  This bill also requires the Senate Office of Public Records to place \nlobbyist disclosure forms and Senate gift disclosure forms on the \nInternet. We have already voted to make this information available to \nthe public. Unfortunately, the public can only get access to this \ninformation through an office in the Hart building. These provisions \nwill give our constituents throughout the country timely access to this \ninformation.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by many groups including the \nAmerican Association of Engineering Societies, the Congressional \nAccountability Project, the League of Women Voters of the U.S., and the \nNational Association of Manufacturers.\n  In conclusion, we would like to urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this legislation. The Internet offers us a unique \nopportunity to allow the American people to have everyday access to \nimportant information about their government. We are sure you agree \nthat a well-informed electorate can best govern our great country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there letters of support \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                        Engineering Societies,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 4, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the Engineers Public \n     Policy Council (EPPC) of the American Association of \n     Engineering Societies, I want to thank you for your \n     leadership on providing public access to Congressional \n     Research Service (CRS) materials. EPPC believes that all \n     citizens of the United States will benefit from being able \n     read these materials and will enable them to better engage in \n     the policy debates of our times.\n       The EPPC has had the opportunity to review a number of CRS \n     reports that were provided via our member's congressional \n     offices. We believe that they are of the highest quality and \n     deserve to be made widely available.\n       The members of EPPC and AAES will continue to advocate that \n     their own Senators and Representatives support this important \n     legislation.\n       Again, thank you for your leadership. If we can ever be of \n     assistance please feel free to contact me or Pete Leon, \n     Director of Public Policy, at (202) 296-2237 x 214.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Dr. Theodore T. Saito,\n     1999 EPPC Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Congressional Accountability\n\n\n                                                      Project,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McCain and Leahy: We strongly endorse the \n     Congressional Openness Act to place important congressional \n     documents on the Internet, including Congressional Research \n     Service (CRS) Reports and Issue Briefs, CRS Authorization and \n     Appropriations products, lobbyist disclosure reports, and \n     Senate gift disclosure reports.\n       The Congressional Openness Act recognizes that ``it is so \n     often burdensome, difficult and time-consuming for citizens \n     to obtain timely access to public records of the United \n     States Congress,'' and would help provide taxpayers with easy \n     access to the congressional research and documents that we \n     pay for.\n       CRS products are some of the finest research prepared by \n     the federal government, on a vast range of topics. But \n     citizens cannot obtain most CRS products directly. At \n     present, many CRS products are available on an internal \n     congressional intranet only for use by Members of Congress \n     and their staffs--not the public. Barriers to obtaining CRS \n     products serve no useful purpose, and damage citizens' \n     ability to participate in the congressional legislative \n     process. Citizens, scholars, journalists, librarians, \n     businesses, and many others have long wanted access to CRS \n     reports via the Internet.\n       In 1995, Congress passed the Lobbying Disclosure Act to \n     require Washington lobbyists to disclose key information \n     about their activities. Placing lobbyist disclosure reports \n     on the Internet would help citizens to track patterns of \n     influence in Congress, and to discover who is paying whom how \n     much to lobby on what issues.\n       The Congressional Openness Act contains a sense of the \n     Senate resolution that Senate and Joint Committees ``should \n     provide access via the Internet to publicly-available \n     committee information, documents, and proceedings, including \n     bills, reports, and transcripts of committee meetings that \n     are open to the public.'' Congress owns this to the American \n     people.\n       In 1822, James Madison aptly described why the public must \n     have reliable information about Congress: ``A popular \n     Government, without popular information, or the means of \n     acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, \n     perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: And a \n     people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm \n     themselves with the power which knowledge gives.''\n       Your bill falls squarely within the spirit of Madison's \n     honorable words. Thank you for your efforts in making \n     congressional documents available on the Internet.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Association of Law Libraries, American \n           Conservative Union, American Society of Newspaper \n           Editors, Common Cause, Computer & Communications \n           Industry Association, Computer Professionals for Social \n           Responsibility, Consumer Project on Technology, \n           Congressional Accountability Project, Electronic \n           Frontier Foundation, Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting \n           (FAIR), Forest Service Employees\n\n[[Page S1393]]\n\n           for Environmental Ethics, League of Women Voters of the \n           U.S., National Association of Manufacturers, National \n           Citizens Communications Lobby, National Newspaper \n           Association, National Taxpayers Union, NetAction, OMB \n           Watch, Project on Government Oversight, Public Citizen, \n           Radio-Television News Directors Association, Reform \n           Party of the United States, Taxpayers for Common Sense, \n           U.S. Public Interest Research Group (USPIRG).\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with \nSenator McCain to introduce the Congressional Openness Act of 1999. I \nwant to thank Senators Abraham, Enzi, Lott and Robb for joining us as \noriginal cosponsors.\n  Our bipartisan legislation makes certain Congressional Research \nService products, lobbyist disclosure reports and Senate gift \ndisclosure forms available over the Internet to the American people.\n  The Congressional Research Service (CRS) has a well-known reputation \nfor producing high-quality reports and information briefs that are \nunbiased, concise, and accurate. The taxpayers of this country, who pay \n$65 million a year to fund the CRS, deserve speedy access to these \npublic resources and have a right to see that their money is being \nspent well.\n  The goal of our legislation to allow every citizen the same access to \nthe wealth of information at the Congressional Research Service (CRS) \nas a Member of Congress enjoys today. CRS performs invaluable research \nand produces first-rate reports on hundreds of topics. American \ntaxpayers have every right to direct access to these wonderful \nresources.\n  Online CRS reports will serve an important role in informing the \npublic. Members of the public will be able to read these CRS products \nand receive a concise, accurate summary of the issues before the \nCongress. As elected representatives, we should do what we can to \npromote an informed, educated public. The educated voter is best able \nto make decisions and petition us to do the right things here in \nCongress.\n  Our legislation also ensures that private CRS products will remain \nprotected by giving the CRS Director the authority to hold back any \nproducts that are deemed confidential. Moreover, the Director may \nprotect the identity of CRS researchers and any copyrighted material. \nWe can do both--protect confidential material and empower our citizens \nthrough electronic access to invaluable CRS products.\n  In addition, the Congressional Openness Act would provide public \nonline access to lobbyist reports and gift disclosure forms. At \npresent, these public records are available in the Senate Office of \nPublic Records in Room 232 of the Hart Building. As a practical matter, \nthese public records are accessible only to those inside the Beltway.\n  The Internet offers us a unique opportunity to allow the American \npeople to have everyday access to this public information. Our \nbipartisan legislation would harness the power of the Information Age \nto allow average citizens to see these public records of the Senate in \ntheir official form, in context and without editorial comment. All \nAmericans would have timely access to the information that we already \nhave voted to give them.\n  And all of these reports are indeed ``public'' for those who can \nafford to hire a lawyer or lobbyist or who can afford to travel to \nWashington to come to the Office of Public Records in the Hart Building \nand read them. That is not very public. That does not do very much for \nthe average voter in Vermont or the rest of this country outside of \neasy reach of Washington. That does not meet the spirit in which we \nvoted to make these materials public, when we voted ``disclosure'' \nlaws.\n  We can do better, and this bill does better. Any citizen in any \ncorner of this country with access to a computer at home or the office \nor at the public library will be able to get on the Internet and for \nthe first time read these public documents and learn the information \nwhich we have said must be disclosed.\n  It also is important that citizens will be able to get the \ninformation in its original, official form. At present, the information \nmay be selected by an interested party who can afford to send a lawyer \nor lobbyist to the Hart Building to cull through the information. \nSelected information then may--or may not--be given to the press and \npublic with commentary. Our bipartisan legislation allows citizens to \nget accurate information themselves, the full information in context \nand without editorial comment. It allows individual citizens to check \nthe facts, to make comparisons, and to make up their own minds.\n  I want to commend the Senior Senator from Arizona for his leadership \non opening public access to Congressional documents. I share his desire \nfor the American people to have electronic access to many more \nCongressional resources. I look forward to working with him in the days \nto come on harnessing the power of the information age to open up the \nhalls of Congress to all our citizens.\n  This is not a partisan issue; it is a good government issue. That is \nwhy the Congressional Openness Act is endorsed by such a diverse group \nof organizations as the Congressional Accountability Project, American \nAssociation of Law Libraries, American Conservation Union, American \nSociety of Newspaper Editors, Common Cause, Computer & Communications \nIndustry Association, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, \nConsumer Project on Technology, Electronic Frontier Foundation, \nFairness and Accuracy in Reporting, Forest Service Employees for \nEnvironmental Ethics, League of Women Voters of the U.S., National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, National Citizens Communications Lobby, \nNational Newspaper Association, National Taxpayers Union, NetAction, \nOMB Watch, Project of Government Oversight, Public Citizen, Radio-\nTelevision News Directors Association, Reform Party of the United \nStates, Taxpayers for Common Sense and U.S. Public Interest Research \nGroup. I want to thank each of these organizations for their support.\n  As Thomas Jefferson wrote, ``Information is the currency of \ndemocracy.'' Our democracy is stronger if all citizens have equal \naccess to at least that type of currency, and that is something which \nMembers on both sides of the aisle can celebrate and join in.\n  The Congressional Openness Act is an important step in informing and \nempowering American citizens. I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this legislation to make available useful Congressional \ninformation to the American people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 394. A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to permit a State to register a Canadian pesticide for \ndistribution and use within that State; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1391-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1393-S1399]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PESTICIDE HARMONIZATION WITH CANADA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President. When the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement \ncame into effect ten years ago, part of the understanding on \nagriculture was that our two nations were going to move rapidly toward \nthe harmonization of pesticide regulations. It is now a decade later \nand relatively little actual progress has been in harmonization that is \nmeaningful to our agricultural producers.\n  Since this trade agreement took effect, the pace of Canadian spring \nand durum wheat, and barley exports to the United States have grown \nfrom a barely noticeable trickle into annual floods of imported grain \ninto our markets. Over the years, I have described many factors that \nhave produced this unfair trade relationship and unlevel playing field \nbetween farmers of our two nations. The failure to achieve \nharmonization in pesticides between the United States and Canada \ncompounds this ongoing trade problem.\n  Our farmers are concerned that agricultural pesticides that are not \navailable in the United States are being utilized by farmers in Canada \nto produce wheat, barley, and other agricultural commodities that are \nsubsequently imported and consumed in the United States. They \nrightfully believe that it is unfair to import commodities produced \nwith agricultural pesticides that are not available to U.S. producers. \nThey believe that it is not in the interests of consumers or producers \nto allow such imports. However, it is not just a\n\n[[Page S1394]]\n\ndifference of availability of agricultural pesticides between our two \ncountries, but also in the pricing of these chemicals.\n  In recent times as the cost-price squeeze has escalated, our farmers \nhave also been deeply concerned about pricing discrepancies for \nagricultural pesticides between our two countries. This past summer a \nsurvey of prices by the North Dakota Agricultural Statistics Services \nverified that there were significant differences in prices being paid \nfor essentially the same pesticide by farmers in our two countries. In \nfact, among the half-dozen pesticides surveyed, farmers in the United \nStates were paying between 117 percent and 193 percent higher prices \nthan Canadian farmers. This was after adjusting for differences in \ncurrency exchange rates at that time.\n  As a result of the pricing concerns raised by our producers, the \nrecent agricultural agreement between the United States and Canada \nincluded a provision for a study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture \nand Ag Canada into the pricing differentials in agricultural chemicals \nbetween our two countries. While such a study is a welcome step \nforward, our farmers deserve more concrete steps. Harmonization cannot \ncontinue to be an illusive goal for the future. We must provide \nmeaningful tools by which we can bring some fairness to our farmers.\n  Today, I am reintroducing legislation that would take an important \nstep in providing equitable treatment for U.S. farmers in the pricing \nof agricultural pesticides. This bill would only deal with agricultural \nchemicals that are identical or substantially similar. It only deals \nwith pesticides that have already undergone rigorous review processes \nand have been registered and approved for use in both countries by the \nrespective regulatory agencies.\n  The bill would establish a procedure by which states may apply for \nand receive an Environmental Protection Agency label for agricultural \nchemicals sold in Canada that are identical of substantially similar to \nagricultural chemicals used in the United States. Thus, U.S. producers \nand suppliers could purchase such chemicals in Canada for use in the \nUnited States. The need for this bill is created by pesticide companies \nwhich use chemical labeling laws to protect their marketing and pricing \nstructures, rather than the public interest. In their selective \nlabeling of identical or substantially similar products across the \nborder they are able to extract unjustified profits from farmers, and \ncreate unlevel pricing fields between our two countries.\n  This bill is one legislative step in the process of full \nharmonization of pesticides between our two nations. It is designed to \nspecifically to address the problem of pricing differentials on \nchemicals that are currently available in both countries. We need to \ntake this step, so that we can start creating a bit more fair \ncompetition and level playing fields between farmers of our two \ncountries. This bill would make harmonization a reality for those \npesticides in which pricing is the only real difference.\n  Together with this legislation, I will be working on other fronts to \nmove forward as rapidly as possible toward full harmonization of \npesticides. The U.S. Trade Representative, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have the responsibility \nto make harmonization a reality. Farmers have been waiting for a decade \nfor such harmonization. We should not make them wait any longer.\n  Mr. President, I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 394\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure that the volume of steel imports does not \nexceed the average monthly volume of such imports during the 36-month \nperiod preceding July 1997; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  Stop Illegal Steel Trade Act of 1999\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am taking a major step to \nforce action to help the American steel industry through the current \nimport crisis. Today, I propose that Congress legislate a solution to \nthe problem of illegal steel dumping. I believe that without swift \naction, the United States' steelworkers will continue to be laid off in \nnear record numbers, and our steelworkers will--not unlike the late 70s \nand early 80s--permanently lose jobs and that the industry's long term \nviability will be threatened. The difference between 1998 and what \nhappened a decade or two ago is that this time our steel industry has \ninvested in itself and become the most efficient steel producer in the \nworld. We can take on all comers if we are given a level playing field. \nSadly, the strength of our steel industry is now jeopardized, despite \nits own successful efforts to retool for the next century, because of \nunfair trade practices and unprecedented levels of imports. I firmly \nbelieve the ongoing devastation of our steel industry is unnecessary \nand a direct result of massive import surges from countries who are \nseeking to make America the world's importer of last resort. We cannot \ncontinue to let our nation's steelworkers bear the brunt of the \nfinancial shocks caused by financial mismanagement in Asia or elsewhere \nin the world.\n  I am joined in introducing this legislation today by my colleagues, \nSenators Sarbanes, Byrd and Hollings. The bill is the ``Stop Illegal \nSteel Trade Act of 1999.'' This legislation would place restrictions on \nsteel imports for a period of three years in order to return steel \nimports to a fairer, 20% share of the United States' market. The bill \nprovides the President with the authority to take the necessary steps \nto ensure that we return to this pre-crisis level--he can impose \nquotas, tariff surcharges, negotiate enforceable voluntary export \nrestraint agreements, or choose other means to ensure that steel \nimports in any given month do not exceed the average of steel imports \nin the United States for the three years prior to July 1997. The bill \nwould be effective within 60 days of enactment. The Secretary of the \nTreasury, as the head of the United States' Customs Service, and the \nSecretary of Commerce are charged with implementing, administering, and \nenforcing the restraints on steel imports. The Customs Service is \nexplicitly authorized to deny entry into the United States any steel \nproducts that exceed the allowable level of imports. Volume will be \ndetermined on the basis of tonnage. This bill would apply to the \nfollowing categories of steel products--semifinished, plates, sheets \nand strips, wire rods, wire and wire products, rail type products, \nbars, structural shapes and units, pipes and tubes, iron ore and coke. \nThe bill's provisions will expire after 3 years (beginning 60 days from \nenactment).\n  Right now, imports comprise roughly 30-35% of all steel sold in the \nUnited States. Imports of steel mill products in 1998 are expected to \nexceed 41 million net tons. Over the last year and a half, steel \nimports have increased by 47%. That high percentage of imports is \nunsustainable and without quick action I think they will effectively \nundermine our steel industry's ability to survive. The industry and its \nworkers have responded to this import surge by filing international \ntrade cases against Japan, Russia, and Brazil. The Department of \nCommerce found critical circumstances exist with respect to those cases \nand has expedited their consideration. I commend them for doing so, but \nthe trade case only deals with hot-rolled steel. Import surges have \noccurred in a wide variety of steel imports and if the hot-rolled \nproblem was adequately addressed I think we would just see a new \nproblem with cold-rolled, or plate.\n  I think Congress must act to deal comprehensively with this problem. \nIt should make sure that one category of imports isn't controlled only \nto find we have a new problem with a new category of steel products. \nUnder the legislation we are introducing today, Japan would be forced \nto reduce its imports to 2.2 million tons per year down\n\n[[Page S1396]]\n\nfrom the approximately 6.6 million tons of steel they sent to the \nUnited States in 1998. Russia, which sent about 5.2 million tons of \nsteel to the United States in 1998, under this bill would be forced to \ndramatically reduce the amount of steel it ships to the United States. \nStemming the import flood from Russia is especially important because \nthe numbers show that the Russians have steadily and significantly \nincreased their exports to the United States over the last several \nyears. Russia exported 1.4 million tons to the United States in 1995, \n1.6 million tons in 1996, and 3.3 million tons in 1997. Japan and \nRussia are two countries which provide a clear illustration of why we \nneed to limit steel imports. Job losses and unfilled order books of \nsteel companies across the country tell us we need to act to stop the \nflood of imports. But these numbers, which give you an idea as to how \nmuch tonnage has increased, make it clear why the United States must \nguard against the continued import surges in our market from foreign \ncountries seeking to sell to the United States market. Currently, there \nis no cost for foreign countries to violate our trade laws other than \nthe threat of suit, but our steelworkers, their families and \ncommunities are paying a steep price every day for our failure to step \nin and effectively address the problem.\n  I should note to my colleagues that legislation restricting the level \nof steel imports was introduced last week in the House of \nRepresentatives and it has already garnered over a quarter of its \nmembership as cosponsors. Congressman Visclosky is leading this effort \nin the House of Representatives and I look forward to working with him \nand all the House cosponsors who are eager to stand up for steel.\n  Frankly, I have watched and waited for months as this crisis has \ncontinued, and as more and more workers have been laid off or placed on \nshort weeks. The number of workers who have been directly affected by \nthis crisis stands at over 10,000 today, but I believe that number \ncould escalate to as many as ten times that figure if we all we \ncontinue to do is hope that the crisis will abate on its own. I think \nit is time to take a leadership role in this crisis and move \naggressively to stop the dumping. Under current U.S. law, only the \nPresident has the full authority to act immediately to begin the \nprocess of an International Trade Commission investigation into this \nproblem of import surges and steel dumping. The ITC's work takes time--\nanywhere from 120 to 150 days depending on the complexity of the case. \nI believe what my steelworkers have told me, our industry doesn't have \nthe luxury of time to wait. That's why I have taken this extraordinary \nstep of suggesting that Congress substitute its judgement for Executive \naction. Effective Executive action could eliminate the need for this \nCongressional action, but I cannot sit idly by and watch our steel \nindustry take a beating because of unfair foreign competition.\n  For the record, you all should know that West Virginia has a proud \nhistory as one of our nation's foremost steel manufacturers. We are the \nhome of Weirton, Wheeling Pittsburgh, Wheeling Nisshin, and Follansbee \nSteel. West Virginia and its neighboring states are the birthplace of \nour modern steel industry--an industry that built an industrialized \nAmerica and launched our nation's prosperity in the beginning of this \ngreat century. They forged the metal that brought us through two world \nwars, built the American economy's manufacturing base and allowed us to \nlead the world in the transition to the new economy.\n  That is why, when Weirton Steel has laid off 20% of its workforce and \nis facing losses that it cannot sustain over time, I cannot just hope \nthat trade cases will take care of part of the problem caused by some \nof the worst offenders. Wheeling Pittsburgh, Wheeling Nisshin, and \nFollansbee, are making it through these hard times, but they would be \nthat much more prosperous if they weren't dealing with unfair \ncompetition.\n  Today I want to share a quote with my colleagues that I believe will \nprovide my colleagues with some important context for this matter and \nwhich underscores why I believe that Congress should act:\n\n       So, Mr. President, it is an extremely timely occasion that \n     my colleagues and I rise to address the Senate on this issue. \n     It is also timely, Mr. President, because the American steel \n     industry is in the midst of its most serious crisis in the \n     postwar era.\n       Yet, at the same time, the steel industry is fundamental to \n     the American economy. It supplies virtually every sector, \n     from automobiles, construction, railroads, shipbuilding, \n     aerospace, defense, oil and gas, agriculture, industrial \n     machinery and equipment, the appliances, utensils and \n     beverage containers. The fortunes of this industry--good or \n     ill--will have a major impact on the rest of the economy.\n       But the purpose a number of us have in speaking today, Mr. \n     President, is to discuss trade; for it is the major component \n     of the current crisis and may prove to be the factor most \n     difficult to control, inasmuch as it is not totally a \n     domestic issue.\n       Trade is also not a new problem. Steel import restraints \n     have been proposed in one form or another since the 1960's. \n     The trigger price mechanism was in effect from 1978 to 1980 \n     and then again in 1981. Although these programs achieved some \n     short-term results, mostly in terms of improving price \n     levels, none of them provided long-term solutions to the \n     growing problems of global overcapacity and the failure of \n     noncompetitive steel industries to adjust.\n       The latter problem has become more and more a factor in the \n     difficulties of the past several years. While we have \n     continued to practice the ethic of the free market system, \n     the Europeans, quite plainly, have not. Subsidies and dumping \n     have increased as European governments attempt to stay in \n     power and forestall social unrest and unemployment by \n     maintaining steel jobs and production at any cost. Hence \n     the tremendous Government subsidies.\n       In the beginning those were social policy decisions any \n     government is entitled to make for itself. However, it has \n     become apparent in the past few years that maintaining steel \n     production through subsidies require substantial exporting in \n     order to unload the excess supply. The chief victim of that \n     export has been the United States, meaning that the European \n     steel process has been at our expense. And that, Mr. \n     President, is unacceptable.\n       It is all well and good for European Community governments \n     to say their steel industry is in bad shape--which it is; or \n     to argue they need time for adjustment--which they do. But \n     their adjustment plans have consistently been behind schedule \n     thanks to foot-dragging by member nation governments, while \n     exports here have increased. I have no intention of \n     explaining to the steelworker in Pittsburgh or Youngstown or \n     Gary or East Chicago that has to give up his job in order to \n     help his Belgian, French, or Italian colleague to keep his. \n     My responsibility, the responsibility of the Senate, the \n     responsibility of the administration, is to our own people--\n     to take those actions which will be good for them both in the \n     long term and in the short term.\n       That responsibility does not preclude compromise, and it \n     does not preclude a recognition that steel is a global \n     industry where multilateral solutions may be necessary and \n     appropriate. In fact, I think there is much to be said for an \n     international steel agreement which would include limits on \n     financing new capacity in third countries, guidelines on \n     adjustment, and, if necessary, global import restraints. But \n     progress in that direction must begin with a recognition of \n     where the problems are and whose responsibility it is to \n     begin fixing them. And, as I said in this Chamber last \n     Thursday, the responsibility in this case--both legal and \n     economic--is clear.\n       European steel subsidies violate both U.S. law and \n     international agreements which the European Community member \n     nations have signed. We went through five years of \n     negotiations to produce those agreements. On our part we made \n     significant, substantive, concessions, like the abolition of \n     the American selling price, the wine-gallon-proof-gallon \n     system, and the acceptance of an injury test in subsidy \n     cases. What we seem to have received in return was a lot of \n     promises. Promises to adhere to the discipline of the codes \n     that had been negotiated. Promises to reduce or eliminate \n     subsidies, dumping, and other unfair trade practices. \n     Promises to open up Government procurement.\n       We accepted all those promises. Mr. President, because they \n     contained the hope of greater discipline over unfair trade \n     practices and the hope of more markets for American products. \n     And we accepted them because we believe in a free market \n     system that functions according to the prescribed rules that \n     all parties adhere to. Promoting those rules has been the \n     essence of our trade policy ever since, and I for one believe \n     that should continue to be our policy.\n       But I must say, Mr. President, that in the intervening \n     years since 1979 when we finished negotiating the Tokyo round \n     and enacted the Trade Agreements Act of that year, I have \n     heard a lot from the people in this country injured by the \n     concessions we made in the Tokyo round and very little from \n     anyone who has gained by those agreements. And now, the \n     system we sought to establish at that time faces its most \n     serious test. Simply put, the European Community and its \n     member states do not want to accept the responsibilities they \n     agreed to undertake in 1979. They do not want the rules \n     enforced. They do not want to make the hard economic \n     decisions about their own steel industry that the market \n     requires them to make.\n       They would rather export their unemployment to the United \n     States. They are screaming very loud about our efforts to \n     hold them\n\n[[Page S1397]]\n\n     not only to their word, but to the letter and spirit of \n     international law. Mr. President, despite the screams, \n     despite the alleged serious consequences to trade relations, \n     this is a test we must meet, because both our own industry \n     and the international trading system, one based on the \n     concept of free and fair trade, are at stake.\n       I need say no more about the desperate situation in our \n     steel industry. Those of us with steel facilities in our \n     State see it every time we return home. Not to defend our own \n     industry, particularly when it is consistent with our own law \n     and with our international obligations to do so, is to turn \n     an already serious situation into a major disaster. It is \n     also to abandon the people who elected us.\n       There is an issue here beyond the survival of the American \n     steel industry, Mr. President. That is the survival of a fair \n     and equitable trading system based on mutually acceptable \n     rules of the game. Some people in this country bemoan the \n     revival of the days of the Smoot-Hawley tariff or a return to \n     the ``begger-thy-neighbor'' policies of years ago every time \n     anyone in Congress starts to talk about imports being a \n     problem.\n       Mr. President, no one, including me--most specifically me--\n     wants to return to that era of depression, but to avoid it, \n     we must understand the reason for it. That reason, in my \n     judgement, was the failure at that time to develop an \n     international trading system based on free market principles, \n     based on the theory of comparative advantage, based on \n     universally accepted rules for participation in that system.\n       Mr. President, this country was a great leader in during \n     and after World War II. In 1943, our leaders of the free \n     world went to Bretton Woods, N.H., and at Bretton Woods, we \n     developed a system with exactly those goals in mind that I \n     just mentioned. At Bretton Woods, we developed that system \n     and we have maintained it ever since, at least up to now. Now \n     we face problems more intractable, a world more complex, and \n     power more diffused than ever before. The old solutions seem \n     to be losing their attractiveness in favor of even older \n     solutions, a return to the mercantilist policies of the past.\n       Mr. President, that is what is at stake in this \n     controversy. Not just our steel industry, and not just the \n     European steel industry, important though they both are. It \n     is the survival of a free world trading system that is the \n     issue, because it cannot survive unless nations are willing \n     to accept their responsibilities and their subsidies.\n       Mr. President, I state this not only to send a message to \n     the European Community, but also to make it clear to others \n     in our own Government that we in Congress hold very strong \n     views on this matter. We in Congress wrote this law. We in \n     Congress made it tough on purpose--precisely to prevent the \n     kind of devastating unfair trade practices and actions that \n     we are experiencing right now in steel.\n       Today it is steel, tomorrow, it may be some other product, \n     it may be some other set of States, it may be some other \n     industries.\n       I say, Mr. President, that it is terribly important that \n     the law continue to work now against those kinds of unfair \n     trade actions.\n       So far the law is working to stop that action. It is \n     absolutely essential that we let it continue to work and not \n     seek some expedient end to the matter that might make for \n     short-term peace at the bargaining table but will produce \n     long-term chaos in the international trading system.\n       It is not ``protectionist'' to take action against such \n     patently unfair practices. In fact, to fail to do so would \n     compromise the principles of free trade which are central to \n     the international trade agreement both we and the Europeans \n     signed.\n       We must send a strong message to our trading partners that \n     the United States expects fair trade in our markets and the \n     vigorous enforcement of our trade laws, and I urge the \n     Secretary of Commerce to hold to that course.\n\n  That quote is from a statement delivered on the Senate floor on July \n26, 1982 by the late Senator John Heinz from the great steel state of \nPennsylvania. He made it when he introduced legislation to deal with \nthe problems facing the steel industry during the early 1980s. We've \nheard a lot about Yogi Beara lately, but I think this statement says \n``the more things change, the more they remain the same.'' Our trade \ndilemma remains the same today.\n  We survived the crises in the late 70s and 80s because our industry, \nits workers, and their elected representatives acted. The industry \nneeded to streamline and heavily invest in capital improvements. It \nneeded to become leaner, and more efficient. The hard transitions we \nmade as a direct result of action and sacrifice by our steelworkers and \ntheir families. Steel technology dramatically improved because the \nindustry invested $50 billion of its own money. Cost of production \ndecreased. The United States' steel industry has the lowest number of \nman hours per ton of any steel producer in the world. Today, we can \nmake steel better, cheaper, and cleaner than any of our competitors, \nbar none. But it cost 300,000 steelworkers their jobs. After all that, \nthe one thing we cannot compromise is that we have to have a level \nplaying field on which we can compete. No one can compete when the \ncompetition sells below the cost of production and dumps steel in \nmassive amounts onto our market--not even the American steel industry.\n  Short of a handful of trade cases, and tough talk to trading partners \nwho have shown little intention of caring what our stance will be, \nlittle has been done to stop the illegal dumping. If after all that \nagony of transforming itself into the most efficient steel producer in \nthe world we are still trying to tell our industry that they have to \ntake it on the chin against illegal imports--that our unfair trade laws \ncan't protect their ability to compete on the world market--then many \nwho hope to continue to grow our economy through expanded trade will be \nsorely surprised by the reaction of an American public that does not \nsee the benefits of trade.\n  I want the United States to push to continue to open new markets for \nour exports. I think that only makes good economic sense. I very much \nwant a fair and free international trading system. But I think we have \nto insist that everyone has to play by the rules. This bill says that \nif our trading partners won't play by the rules, then Congress will see \nto it that our industry isn't unduly disadvantaged--to me, that only \nseems fair.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join on as cosponsors. We can do this, \ntogether.\n  Mr. President--I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stop Illegal Steel Trade Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REDUCTION IN VOLUME OF STEEL IMPORTS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, within 60 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall \n     take the necessary steps, by imposing quotas, tariff \n     surcharges, negotiated enforceable voluntary export restraint \n     agreements, or otherwise, to ensure that the volume of steel \n     products imported into the United States during any month \n     does not exceed the average volume of steel products that was \n     imported monthly into the United States during the 36-month \n     period preceding July 1997.\n\n     SEC. 3. ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.\n\n       Within 60 days after the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of the Treasury, through the United States Customs \n     Service, and the Secretary of Commerce shall implement a \n     program for administering and enforcing the restraints on \n     imports under section 2. The Customs Service is authorized to \n     refuse entry into the customs territory of the United States \n     of any steel products that exceed the allowable levels of \n     imports of such products.\n\n     SEC. 4. APPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Categories.--This Act shall apply to the following \n     categories of steel products: semifinished, plates, sheets \n     and strips, wire rods, wire and wire products, rail type \n     products, bars, structural shapes and units, pipes and tubes, \n     iron ore, and coke products.\n       (b) Volume.--Volume of steel products for purposes of this \n     Act shall be determined on the basis of tonnage of such \n     products.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to provide dollars to the classroom; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    the dollars to the classroom act\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am honored to have the \nopportunity to introduce legislation addressing one of the most \nimportant issues Americans are concerned about today--education. The \nDollars to the Classroom Act will redirect approximately 3.5 billion \ndollars in funding for elementary and secondary education back to the \nstates and into our classrooms.\n  This year Congress will be focusing its efforts on the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It is \ntime for us to take a good look at the status of education in America \nand to recognize the lack of improvement we have seen in our elementary \nand secondary schools. The percentage of 12th grade students who meet \nstandards in reading has actually decreased during this decade. When \nlimited Federal funding is spread so thinly over such a wide area, the \nresult is ineffective programs that fail to provide students with the \nbasic skills they need to succeed.\n  I am committed to improving educational opportunities for our \nchildren,\n\n[[Page S1398]]\n\nand this can happen best at the local level. Those who best know our \nchildren--parents and teachers--should be responsible for deciding what \nprograms are most important, not bureaucrats in Washington. It is time \nto stop the one-size-fits-all approach, and start letting those at the \nlocal level decide what is best for them.\n  Right now, state and local educational agencies are implementing \nreforms to better prepare their students for the future. Even the \npresident recently stated in his budget proposal that ``we have long \nknown the ingredients for successful schools; the challenge is to give \nparents and teachers and superintendents the tools to put them in place \nand stimulate real change right now.'' Many states have already \nimplemented class-size reduction programs, and nineteen states \ncurrently have programs to turn around their poorest-performing school. \nThe problem is not that states and local school districts do not have \nideas about how to improve their schools, it is that Washington is \ntelling them how to do it through competitive grants.\n  Many schools never see these grants, either. Schools in rural areas \nand that have low funding levels often cannot afford to hire grant \nwriters to apply for the numerous federal programs. These schools \nshould not have to spend money on administration just to receive \nfunding, when they could receive the funding directly and decide what \ntheir needs are.\n  Currently, states have to bear the burden of abiding by federal \nregulations to receive education dollars. The system we have in place \nnow is inefficient and does not allow the best use of each taxpayer \ndollar that is spent. According to the Crossroads Project--the \nCongressional fact-finding education initiative--only 65 percent of \nDepartment of Education elementary and secondary dollars reach \nclassrooms. Instead of paying for administration and paperwork, we must \ngive control back to parents and teachers, who can decide what is best \nfor our children. Who do you trust to spend our taxpayer dollars best--\nbureaucrats, or those involved in our local schools?\n  That is why I am introducing the Dollars to the Classroom Act. This \nlegislation has been included in S. 277, the Republican education \npackage, and similar legislation will be introduced soon in the House \nof Representatives. In fact, the House of Representatives passed its \nversion of the Dollars to the Classroom Act last fall. This legislation \nredirects $3.5 billion of K-12 education dollars to the States, \nrequiring only that 95% of that money actually reach our children's \nclassrooms. This money can be used for whatever the local education \nofficials deem necessary and important to our children's education. \nSchool districts may buy new books, hire more teachers, build new \nschools, or buy new computers.\n  We must begin to prioritize the way we spend our education dollars, \nand we must put children first, not bureaucracy. Let those on the State \nand local levels decide if more books are needed to help our children \nread, or more teachers are needed to reduce class size. We cannot \nafford to allow a stagnant system to continue. We owe it to our \nchildren to allow schools to address the real needs they are facing \ntoday.\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, on two separate occasions this \nyear I have made statements about the importance of education to our \nNation and to this Congress. I've talked about what our parents want \nfor their children, how to provide a good education, and how many of \nour current federal policies have failed to achieve what we want for \nour children.\n  Today, as the Senator from Arkansas introduces his ``Dollars to the \nClassroom Act,'' which incorporates ingredients for educational success \ninto our federal policy, I want to join in cosponsoring his bill as it \nwill empower states and local school districts to spend federal \nresources in the best way they see fit. I also want to take this \nopportunity to emphasize the importance of education.\n  A Pew Research Center poll conducted last fall found that 88% of \nthose surveyed think that improving the quality of public school \neducation is ``very important.'' Now, I am not one to put a lot of \nemphasis on polls, but I think that this poll indicates what we already \nknow: that making sure kids get a world-class education is a real \npriority for our nation. Moms and dads want their children to be in \nsettings where they will be challenged to reach high levels of academic \nachievement, taught by qualified and caring teachers, and provided a \nsafe learning environment.\n  Obviously, parents want to be sure that schools are using the \ningredients of success in education: parental involvement, local \ncontrol, an emphasis on basic academics, and dollars spent in the \nclassroom, not on distant bureaucracy and ineffective programs. These \nare the ingredients we must have to elevate educational performance. It \nis interesting to note that a recent report of the House Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce Subcommittee on Oversight and \nInvestigations found that successful schools and school systems were \nnot the product of federal funding and directives.\n  Unfortunately, we are continuing to find that many of our current \nfederal education programs, while well-intended, simply do not contain \nthe ingredients of a successful education. Rather than promoting \nparental involvement, local control, and dollars going to the \nclassroom, many federal programs promote a ``Washington-knows-best'' \npolicy, in which federal bureaucrats decide exactly what education \nprograms should be developed and exactly how every dollar should be \nspent. Not only are states, schools, teachers, and parents left without \nmuch say in how to educate their children, but they are also drained of \ntime and energy complying with all the federal mandates handed down to \nthem.\n  Our current federal education laws bog states down in mountains of \npaperwork every year. Even though the U.S. Department of Education \nrecently attempted to reduce paperwork burdens, the Department still \nrequires over 48.6 million hours worth of paperwork per year--or the \nequivalent of 25,000 employees working full-time. There are more than \n20,000 pages of applications states must fill out to receive federal \neducation funds each year.\n  While the Department of Education brags that its staff is one of the \nsmallest federal agencies with 4,637 people, state education agencies \nhave to employ nearly 13,400 FTEs (full-time equivalents) with federal \ndollars to administer the myriad federal programs. Hence, there are \nnearly three times as many federally funded employees of state \neducation agencies administering federal education programs as there \nare U.S. Department of Education employees.\n  It is no wonder that up to 35% of our federal education dollar gets \neaten up by bureaucratic and administrative costs. And we should \nremember this in the context of the fact that only about 7% of all \neducation funding comes from the federal government. As we can see, \nthis small amount of the entire education pie consumes a \ndisproportionate share of the time states and local school districts \nmust spend to administer education programs.\n  I have also spoken in the past about the Ohio study finding that 52% \nof the paperwork required of an Ohio school district was related to \nparticipation in federal programs, while federal dollars provided less \nthan 5% of its total education funding. And I've also noted that in \nFlorida it takes six times as many state employees to administer \nfederal funds as it does to administer state dollars.\n  Clearly, federal rules and regulations eat up precious dollars and \nteacher time. We must find a way to change this.\n  I have also highlighted that the problem that many of our children \nand school districts never get to see the federal tax dollars paid by \ntheir parents for education because a great deal of federal educational \nfunding is awarded on a competitive basis. Local schools must come to \nWashington and plead their case to get back the money the parents of \ntheir communities sent to the federal treasury. Who suffers the most \nfrom this system? Smaller and poorer schools, who don't have the time \nand money to wade through thick grant applications or hire a grant \nwriter to get their fair share of the federal dollar.\n  It is also interesting to note that, according to the Department of \nEducation's own estimates, it takes 216 steps and 20 weeks to complete \nthe review process for a federal discretionary education grant. The \nDepartment\n\n[[Page S1399]]\n\nboasts that this is actually a streamlined process, since it used to \ntake 26 weeks and took 487 steps from start to finish!\n  I have talked about a third problem with many current federal \neducation programs: dollars are earmarked for one and only one purpose, \nto the exclusion of all other uses. And many times, the distant \nWashington bureaucrats are designating funds for something that a \nschool district doesn't even need at the time.\n  I like to use an analogy to explain this problem. If you feel a \nheadache coming on, would you rather be treated by a doctor one mile \naway from where you live, or a thousand miles away? And if you have to \nuse the doctor a thousand miles away, how good is he or she going to be \nat prescribing what you need for your headache? It sure would be nicer \nto see someone close by who could take a look at you in person and make \na proper diagnosis.\n  And what if, when you tell the doctor a thousand miles away that you \nhave a headache, she says to you, ``Oh, that's too bad. But today we're \nrunning a special on crutches. We are prescribing crutches for people \nlike you all over the country, because we've heard that you may need \nthem.'' You say, ``That's fine, but how is a crutch going to help my \nheadache? Can't I get the money to buy some aspirin?'' And the doctor \nsays, ``Sorry, but you can only use this money for crutches, not for \naspirin, or anything else.''\n  This is exactly what happens with so many of these categorical \nprograms mandated from the federal level. Your local school district \nhas determined that it needs funding for one thing, but the federal \ngovernment will only release it for another. As a result, schools don't \nhave the flexibility to use their funding for what they know they need \nto provide the best education possible for their students.\n  For all the federal programs and dollars committed to education, are \nwe seeing success? I'm afraid not.\n  I have heard of a recent report from the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development, which noted that even though the United \nStates dedicates one of the largest shares of gross domestic product to \neducation, it has fallen behind other economic powers in high school \ngraduation rates. Only 72 percent of 18-year-old Americans graduated in \n1996, trailing all other developed countries.\n  Our Congressional Research Service has explained why current federal \naid programs may not lead to educational improvement. They note that \nthese programs have generally been focused on specific student \npopulation groups with special needs, priority subject areas, or \nspecific educational concepts or techniques. CRS reports:\n\n       While such ``categorical'' program structures assure that \n     aid is directed to the priority population or purpose, they \n     may not always be effective--instruction may become \n     fragmented and poorly coordinated; the proliferation of \n     programs may be duplicative; each federally assisted program \n     may affect only a marginal portion of each pupil's \n     instructional time that is poorly coordinated with the \n     remainder of her or his instruction; regulations intended to \n     target aid on particular areas of need may unintentionally \n     limit local ability to engage in comprehensive reforms; or \n     the partial segregation of special needs students, while it \n     helps to guarantee that funds can be clearly associated with \n     each program's intended beneficiaries, may also reinforce \n     tendencies toward tracking pupils by achievement level, and \n     unintentionally contribute to a perpetuation of lower \n     expectations for their performance.\n\n  I think the Congressional Research Service makes some valid \nobservations about why our current federal education policy is not \ngenerally boosting student achievement and making our children \ncompetitive with other nations. CRS says that current federal policy \nhinders an important element of educational success: local control.\n  Based upon what we know about the state of our current federal \neducation policy, we must explore how to direct our resources in ways \nthat will stimulate academic success and high achievement. States, \nschool districts, school boards, teachers, and of course, parents, are \nasking for local control and flexibility to spend federal education \ndollars in ways they know will work. They know how to incorporate the \ningredients of success into the education of their children.\n  Senator Hutchinson's ``Dollars to the Classroom Act'' will give \nstates and local schools the flexibility that they desperately need. \nHis legislation takes nearly $3.5 billion from a number of federal \neducation programs, directs the money to the states based upon student \npopulation, and requires that at least 95% of it is spent in our \nchildren's classrooms. Local school districts may use the funds in ways \nthey believe will be most effective in elevating student achievement.\n  Under the ``Dollars to Classroom Act,'' parents, teachers, school \nboards and administrators will have the freedom to use federal dollars \nfor what they need: whether it be to hire more teachers, raise teacher \nsalaries, strengthen reading programs, buy new computers, or provide \nmore one-on-one tutoring.\n  The bill ensures that federal bureaucracy will be held at bay by \nforbidding the Secretary of Education from issuing any regulations \nregarding the type of classroom activities or services that school \ndistricts may choose to provide with the federal dollars. Finally, the \n``Dollars to Classroom Act'' calls for ways to streamline regulations \nand eliminate bureaucracy within major federal education laws.\n  Mr. President, we need to ensure that more federal education money is \nsent to the classroom, and that states, schools, and parents have more \nflexibility in using those funds in the way that will best help \nstudents achieve their fullest potential. We must find ways to \nencourage states and local schools to be innovative and creative in \nfinding the most successful ways to challenge our students to the \nhighest levels and achievement. Senator Hutchinson's ``Dollars to the \nClassroom Act'' will help accomplish these goals, and that is why I am \npleased to co-sponsor his legislation.\n  During the coming months, Congress should continue to evaluate our \ncurrent federal elementary and secondary education programs and make \nthe necessary changes to incorporate the ingredients we know have \nproven successful in providing the best education possible for our \nchildren. We cannot afford to maintain the status quo if it is not \nworking. We owe it to our next generation to provide them what they \nneed to be successful in the 21st Century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1393-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1399-S1400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 17\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dodd, the name of the Senator from Nevada (Mr. \nReid) was added as a cosponsor of S. 17, a bill to increase the \navailability, affordability, and quality of child care.\n\n\n                                 S. 136\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the name of the Senator from Nebraska \n(Mr. Kerrey) was added as a cosponsor of S. 136, a bill to provide for \nteacher excellence and classroom help.\n\n\n                                 S. 170\n\n  At the request of Mr. Smith, the name of the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd) was added as a cosponsor of S. 170, a bill to permit \nrevocation by members of the clergy of their exemption from Social \nSecurity coverage.\n\n\n                                 S. 285\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the name of the Senator from Iowa (Mr. \nGrassley) was added as a cosponsor of S. 285, a bill to amend title II \nof the Social Security Act to restore the link between the maximum \namount of earnings by blind individuals permitted without demonstrating \nability to engage in substantial gainful activity and the exempt amount \npermitted in determining excess earnings under the earnings test.\n\n\n                                 S. 311\n\n  At the request of Mr. McCain, the names of the Senator from Nevada \n(Mr. Reid) and the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Bryan) were added as \ncosponsors of S. 311, a bill to authorize the Disabled Veterans' LIFE \nMemorial Foundation to establish a memorial in the District of Columbia \nor its environs, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 323\n\n  At the request of Mr. Campbell, the name of the Senator from Colorado \n(Mr. Allard) was added as a cosponsor of S. 323, a bill to redesignate \nthe Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument as a national park \nand establish the Gunnison Gorge National Conservation Area, and for \nother purposes.\n\n[[Page S1400]]\n\n                     Senate Concurrent Resolution 5\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brownback, the names of the Senator from Idaho \n(Mr. Crapo) and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning) were added as \ncosponsors of Senate Concurrent Resolution 5, a concurrent resolution \nexpressing congressional opposition to the unilateral declaration of a \nPalestinian state and urging the President to assert clearly United \nStates opposition to such a unilateral declaration of statehood.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1399-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 33--DESIGNATING MAY 1999 AS NATIONAL MILITARY \n                           APPRECIATION MONTH\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Levin, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \nKennedy, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nCleland, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Allard) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation, \ncosponsored by Senators Warner and Levin and other members of the Armed \nServices Committee, to designate May 1999 as National Military \nAppreciation Month. I would like to emphasize at the outset the role of \nthe United Services Organization, the USO, in approaching me to ask \nthat I submit this resolution. I am honored that an organization so \ncentral to the quality of the lives of our service personnel for so \nmany decades chose me as the one to carry this legislation forward.\n  Last week, I joined with a number of my colleagues on the Armed \nServices Committee to report to the Senate S. 4, the Soldiers', \nSailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights of 1999. That \nlegislation addresses areas identified by the Joint Chiefs of Staff as \ntheir highest priorities in resolving the growing readiness problems \nafflicting the Armed Forces. By restoring the retirement system that \nexisted prior to 1986 and taking concrete measures to close the pay gap \nand remove military families from the rolls of those eligible for food \nstamps, I am confident that S. 4 will go a long way toward alleviating \nthe retention and recruitment problems that have contributed so much to \nthe recent decline in military readiness.\n  It is out of concern for the welfare of the men and women who wear \nthe uniform of our nation's armed forces that S. 4 was passed so early \nin the legislative year by the Armed Services Committee. It is out of a \nsense of pride in those same men and women that I offer this resolution \ndesignating May as National Military Appreciation Month.\n  During May 1999, we will observe Victory in Europe Day, Military \nSpouse Day, Armed Forces Day, and, most importantly, Memorial Day. It \nis appropriate that, with our armed forces currently operating in \nBosnia, Macedonia, Haiti, and the Persian Gulf, and conducting routine \npeacetime activities too numerous to list in support of U.S. foreign \npolicy in virtually every part of the globe, that the nation dedicate \nthat month to remind itself of the contribution these individuals make \nto the preservation of a way of life increasingly taken for granted.\n  It has become almost platitudinous to point out the increased burden \nplaced on a smaller military since the dissolution of the Soviet Union \nand the end of the Cold War. Our military forces are being sent into \nharm's way more often than during any period since the Vietnam War, \nwith additional deployments contemplated as I speak. Strong economic \ngrowth and low unemployment have reduced the incentive on the part of \nmany young people to enlist in the Armed Forces, thereby further \ndiminishing the percentage of Americans exposed to military Service. By \ndesignating May 1999 as National Military Appreciation Month, it is my \nhope that the country will be more inclined to reflect on the \nsacrifices of so many throughout our history and today, and to better \nunderstand why we in Congress are acting so hastily to address quality \nof life issues affecting our service personnel and their families. My \ngood friend, Duncan Hunter, has offered companion legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives, and I look forward to speedy passage of this \nbill in the weeks ahead.\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend \nSenator McCain in submitting this resolution designating May 1999 as \n``National Military Appreciation Month.'' Senator McCain is one of the \ngreat champions in the Senate of the men and women who serve in our \narmed forces. It is a privilege to join him in sponsoring this \nresolution.\n  Day after day, our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines continue to \ndemonstrate a high degree of excellence and commitment. No matter what \nwe ask of them, they always respond in the most professional manner \nimaginable. We have asked them to serve in combat operations, in \npeacekeeping missions, and in humanitarian relief efforts. We have \ndeployed them around the world to stand in the face of aggression. They \nmake tremendous personal sacrifices to serve their nation.\n  The most recent example of the excellence and professionalism of our \nforces was Operation Desert Fox. Over 40,000 troops deployed from bases \naround the world in response to Sadam Hussain's flagrant defiance of UN \nauthorized inspections. Without a single U.S. or British casualty, our \ntroops flew more than 600 aircraft sorties, 300 of them a night. \nSoldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines all participated in this flawless \noperation. This same excellence has been demonstrated in Bosnia, Korea, \nCentral America, and every other place where our members serve.\n  Our troops are, quite simply, the best. They are the best trained, \nbest equipped, best disciplined and most highly skilled and motivated \nmilitary force in the world. They deserve the recognition of a grateful \nNation. This resolution calls on all Americans to recognize and honor \ntheir dedication and service. It is the least we can do.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1400-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S1401]]\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SOLDIERS', SAILORS', AIRMEN'S, AND MARINES' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        CLELAND AMENDMENT NO. 6\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. CLELAND submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 4) to improve pay and retirement equity for members of the \nArmed Forces; and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 33, line 16, strike ``for a period of more than 30 \n     days'' and insert ``and a member of the Ready Reserve in any \n     pay status''.\n       On page 34, beginning on line 10, strike ``on active duty'' \n     and insert ``: members on active duty; members of the Ready \n     Reserve''.\n       On page 35, strike lines 3 through 6 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(c) Maximum Contribution.--(1) The amount contributed by \n     a member of the uniformed services for any pay period out of \n     basic pay may not exceed 5 percent of such member's basic pay \n     for such pay period.\n       ``(2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the amount \n     contributed by a member of the Ready Reserve for any pay \n     period for any compensation received under section 206 of \n     title 37 may not exceed 5 percent of such member's \n     compensation for such pay period.\n       ``(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     subchapter, no contribution may be made under this paragraph \n     for a member of the Ready Reserve for any year to the extent \n     that such contribution, when added to prior contributions for \n     such member for such year under this subchapter, exceeds any \n     limitation under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986.\n       On page 35, line 9, insert ``, or out of compensation under \n     section 206 of title 37,'' after ``out of basic pay''.\n       On page 35, line 12, strike ``308a, 308f,'' and insert \n     ``308a through 308h,''.\n       On page 36, in the matter following line 15, strike ``on \n     active duty'' and insert ``: members on active duty; members \n     of the Ready Reserve''.\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, when S. 4 is debated in the \nSenate, I intend to offer an amendment to expand the Thrift Savings \nPlan to allow the participation of members of the Ready Reserve. The \n1.5 million members of the Reserve Components make up half of our \nmilitary forces. They are contributing to our military efforts at home \nand around the world every day of the year, side-by-side with their \nactive duty counterparts. We are using our Reserve component personnel \nmore often and for a broader range of missions and operations then ever \nbefore.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, members of the Reserve Components have \nparticipated at record levels. In fact, over 17,000 Reservists and \nGuardsmen have answered the Nation's call to bring peace to Bosnia. \nNearly 270,000 Reservists and Guardsmen were mobilized during \nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Numerous Guard and Reserve \nunits from all corners of the United States responded immediately to \nrequests for assistance in the wake of Hurricane Mitch, delivering over \n10 million pounds of humanitarian aid to devastated areas in Central \nAmerica. Closer to home, Reserve and National Guard personnel answered \nthe cries for help after devastating floods struck in North and South \nDakota, Minnesota and Iowa. They braved high winds and water to fill \nsandbags, provide security, and transport food, fresh water, medical \nsupplies and disaster workers to the affected areas. And the Air Force \nReserve's ``Hurricane Hunters'' are the only Department of Defense \norganization that routinely flies into tropical storms and hurricanes \nto collect data to improve forecast accuracy, which dramatically \nminimizes losses due to the destructive forces of these storms. These \nare but a few examples of what members of the Guard and Reserve do on a \ndaily basis. What amazes me most is that many take part in these \nimportant military operations on a volunteer basis, and have to balance \nthese demands with those of their full-time civilian careers and their \nfamilies.\n  In September 1997, Secretary of Defense Cohen wrote a memorandum \nacknowledging an increased reliance on the Reserve Components. He \ncalled upon the Services to remove all remaining barriers to achieving \na ``seamless Total Force.'' He has also said that without Reservists, \n``we can't do it in Bosnia, we can't do it in the Gulf, we can't do it \nanywhere.'' The Reserve Components will, without a doubt, play an \nintegral role in our national military strategy of the 21st century.\n  Allowing members who serve in the Reserve Components to participate \nin the Thrift Savings Plan would carry on the spirit of Secretary \nCohen's Total Force policy at virtually no additional cost. But, most \nimportantly, doing so sends a message to our citizen soldiers, sailors, \nmarines, and airmen that we recognize and appreciate their \nsacrifices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1401-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n      NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                      COMMITTEE ON INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I rise to honor the memory of a \ngreat man, King Hussein of Jordan.\n  Today the world said goodbye to King Hussein and the great outpouring \nof grief by his people and the presence today in Amman of almost all of \nthe world's leaders, is testament to his greatness and to the real \nhonor and affection in which he was held; it was a testament to the \nenormous contribution he made to world peace and stability.\n  King Hussein was very young when he became king 47 years ago, in a \ntough neighborhood where wits and courage and character are quickly \ntested--and tested often. During his reign, he dodged at least 12 \nassassination attempts and 7 plots to overthrow him.\n  Though he took over a shaky throne, his perseverance, his vision and \nhis great faith carried him through and resulted in a much stronger \nnation of Jordan and a more stable Middle East. He took his country far \ndown the path of democratic reforms--reforms which he had hoped to \ncontinue to improve upon and to broaden.\n  His rule saw his country acquire stability and make peace with \nIsrael. He modernized Jordan and created a situation in which \nJordanians enjoy a degree of political freedom not found in most other \nArab nations.\n  He did all this by living his faith and his ideals: he practiced \npolitical tolerance and even reached a peace and pardoned those who had \ntried to kill him.\n  He was a true friend and ally of the United States but his true \ndevotion was to his people and to the cause of peace. He took great \nrisks to achieve this peace.\n  He was a lynchpin in Middle East Peace Process. Only a few months \nago, he left his sickbed and came to Wye to\n\n[[Page S1402]]\n\nhelp broker the Wye River accord that revived the failing peace process \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians. It was his presence and his \ncommitment that brought a successful resolution to this agreement.\n  He did this at great personal sacrifice when he was near death. He \nfought illness with grace, courage and faith in the same way he had \nlived his life.\n  A stronger Kingdom of Jordan and a more stable Middle East, capable \nof eventually sustaining a lasting peace will be one of his great \nlegacies.\n  Mr. President it is vitally important for the United States and \nJordan to continue our close ties and to deepen our mutual commitment.\n  I join my colleagues in expressing my support and best wishes to King \nHussein's son and successor, King Abdullah.\n  I met with King Abdullah this past November. He is very capable, \nknowledgeable and his is a strong leader. He is now a key to peace in \nthe world and he is up to the task. We all wish him God's speed and \ngreat blessings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1401-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1402-S1403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE NATIONAL SALVAGE MOTOR VEHICLE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to talk about America's used \ncar buyers. They are looking to this Congress to take prompt action on \nlegislation that will curtail the fraudulent practice of ``title \nwashing.'' A deceptive scheme that costs consumers and the automobile \nindustry over $4 billion annually and places millions of structurally \nunsafe vehicles back on America's roads and highways.\n  Last week I brought to your attention a January 8, 1999, Washington \nPost article entitled ``Wrecked Cars, On the Road Again.'' This is \nscary--government crash test cars--deliberately destroyed cars--are \nbeing rebuilt and sold to unsuspecting consumers as undamaged vehicles. \nOne of these crash cars could have been next to any one of us on the \nway to work today.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about how they would feel if their son \nor daughter unknowingly purchased a NHSTA crash test car. Aside from \nthe significant monetary loss, buyers of these previously totaled cars \nor trucks are also unwittingly risking life and limb. As well as \neveryone with whom they share the road.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, Senator Ford and I coauthored \nlegislation in the 105th Congress with the intent of putting dishonest \nrebuilders out of business. Our bill would have provided greater \ndisclosure to potential used car buyers by establishing national \nuniform definitions for salvage, rebuilt salvage, nonrepairable, and \nflood vehicles. As everyone knows, especially the crooks and charlatans \nwho prey on unsuspecting victims, that it is the lack of uniformity and \nthe inconsistencies in state automobile titling procedures that allows \ntitle laundering to flourish unabated.\n  Mr. President, the provisions of the National Salvage Motor Vehicle \nConsumer Protection Act mirrored the recommendations of the Motor \nVehicle Titling, Registration and Salvage Advisory Committee. This \ncongressionally mandated committee, overseen by the U.S. Department of \nTransportation, included State motor vehicle officials, motor vehicle \nmanufactures, dealers, recyclers, insurers, salvage yard operators, \nscrap processors, federal and state law enforcement representatives, \nand others. While I would like to claim credit for authoring the \ndefinitions in the title branding legislation, they were in fact based \non the knowledge and experience of the Salvage Committee and the \nrecommendations offered in their final report. So these are not my \ndefinitions, they are the expert advisory committee's definitions.\n  Mr. President, too often Congress lets recommendations from \ncommissions we mandate sit on a shelf gathering dust.\n  Mr. President, I do not want this to happen here. Title washing is a \npervasive problem. The salvage advisory group provided a wealth of \ninformation and recommendations to address this national problem. \nCongress needs to act.\n  Aside from promoting the use of uniform definitions, the bill \nrequires rebuilt salvage vehicles to undergo a theft inspection in \naddition to any required state safety inspection. These vehicles would \nalso have a decal permanently affixed to its window and the driver's \ndoorjamb to provide even greater disclosure. Equally important, the \nvehicle's brand would be carried forward to each state where the \nvehicle is retitled. And, the Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN) of \nirreparably damaged vehicles would be tracked to prevent automobile \ntheft.\n  Contrary to the misrepresentations about this bill, it allowed states \nto adopt disclosure standards beyond those provided for in the bill. In \nfact, states would have had broad latitude to provide almost unlimited \ndisclosure to their citizens. This important legislation merely created \na basic minimum national standard while allowing states the flexibility \nto adopt more stringent regulations. It also did not create a federal \nmandate on the states as some had proposed. As my colleagues will \nrecall, the Supreme Court held in New York v. United States [505 U.S. \n144 (1992)] that states cannot be forced by Congress to execute \nprograms that should be administered by the U.S. government.\n  Mr. President, Congress came very close to enacting title branding \nlegislation last year. The original measure received the formal support \nof 57 of our colleagues in this chamber and a similar bill passed the \nHouse of Representatives with a vote of 333 to 72. Throughout the \nlegislative process, a number of significant changes were made to the \nbill to address the concerns expressed by consumer groups and some \nstate attorneys general. In a good faith effort, the following changes \nwere included in the modified version of the bill.\n  The percentage threshold for defining a ``salvage vehicle'' was \nlowered from 80 percent to 75 percent.\n  The final bill included a provision allowing states broad latitude in \ndetermining which vehicles would be designated as ``salvage.'' The \ncompromise permitted a state to maintain or establish a lower \npercentage threshold for defining a ``salvage vehicle.'' So if a state \nset its percentage threshold below the 75 percent level, it would still \nhave been in compliance with the bill. Some consumer groups and state \nattorneys general advocated that states be able to set their thresholds \nas low as they desired. This bill would have allowed any state to do \njust that.\n  A new provision was added that allowed states to cover any vehicle, \nregardless of age. This is referred to as ``older model salvage \nvehicle.''\n  Another new provision in the legislation granted state attorneys \ngeneral the ability to sue on behalf of consumers who are victimized by \nrebuilt salvage fraud and to recover monetary judgments for damages \nthat citizens may have suffered.\n  The bill's section on ``prohibited acts,'' replaced the House's \n``knowingly and willfully'' standard with a ``knowingly'' standard.\n  Two new prohibited acts were included--one related to failure to make \na flood disclosure and the other related to moving a vehicle or title \nacross state lines for the purpose of avoiding the bill's requirements.\n  In the original bill, conforming states were prohibited from using \nsynonyms of terms defined in the legislation (i.e. reconstructed, \nunrebuildable, junk) in connection with a vehicle. The modified bill \ndeleted this restrictive language, giving states increased flexibility \nto provide additional disclosures to their citizens regarding the \ndamage history of vehicles.\n  The compromise bill added a provision making it clear that nothing in \nthe legislation would affect any private right of action under existing \nstate laws. Let me say again that a citizen's ability to pursue private \nrights of action would have continued under the legislation.\n  At the request of Senator Slade Gorton, the proposed federal criminal \npenalty provision was removed from the bill. As a former state attorney \ngeneral, Senator Gorton was concerned that creating new federal \npenalties would unnecessarily increase the burden on an already \nstressed federal court system, especially in instances where existing \nstate civil and criminal remedies would adequately address violations \nof the bill's titling requirements. Senator Gorton's concerns were \nrecently buttressed by Chief Justice Rehnquist who recently complained \nabout Congress' ``trend to federalize crimes that traditionally have \nbeen handled in state courts.'' While\n\n[[Page S1403]]\n\nthe proposed criminal penalty was dropped, a provision authorizing \ncivil penalties was retained.\n  At the request of Sen. Ernest Hollings, a new provision was added \nconcerning the Secretary of Transportation advising automobile dealers \nof the prohibition on selling vans as school buses.\n  Again, these were significant changes aimed at achieving consensus \nand balancing the need for uniformity with the desire to provide states \nwith reasonable and appropriate flexibility.\n  It is also important to point out that the final title branding bill \nthat passed the House with a bipartisan majority last October was \nstrongly supported by state motor vehicle administrators. These are the \nvery people responsible for implementing titling rules and procedures. \nIf there is anyone that Congress should listen to on this topic, it is \nthe state DMV directors. They have the most commitment to and \nsignificant knowledge and experience dealing with titling matters. \nSince they are on the front lines, these administrators know what works \nand what will not. Their only vested interest is to ensure that the \npeople they serve in their states have an effective titling system. To \nthat end, they have been working with the Department of Transportation \nand the Department of Justice to develop a National Motor Vehicle Title \nInformation System that would provide titling offices around the \ncountry with accurate, reliable, and timely registration information.\n  As I have said repeatedly, title branding legislation would \nsignificantly improve disclosure for used car buyers. It would close \nthe many loopholes that exist by establishing uniform definitions. It \nwould create national standards that would protect the safety and well-\nbeing of consumers and motorists across America. Enacting this \nlegislation would allow our sons and daughters to buy a used car \nwithout fear that they may be purchasing a totaled and subsequently \nrebuilt vehicle.\n  For these reasons, I intend on introducing the National Salvage Motor \nVehicle Consumer Protection Act as it passed the House last October. I \nhave also solicited technical corrections from a number of interested \nand affected sources including the U.S. Department of Transportation.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to \nsafeguard our friends and families from title fraud by formally \nsupporting this legislation.\n  With your help, Congress can put thousands of chop-shop owners and \ncon-artists out of business and keep millions of structurally unsafe \nvehicles off our nation's roads and highways. Let us take quick action \nto keep our constituents from buying wrecks on wheels.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1402-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1403-S1404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL WILLIAM L. STUBBLEFIELD ON THE OCCASION OF HIS \n                               RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Rear \nAdmiral Bill Stubblefield on the occasion of his retirement as the \nDirector of the Office of NOAA Corps Operations and the Director of the \nNOAA Corps, in the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration. Rear Admiral Stubblefield has given 33 \nyears of dedicated service to the nation.\n  Bill Stubblefield served as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy \nfrom 1962 to 1968 aboard a minesweeper and an icebreaker, and then with \nthe U.S. Navy's SOSUS network. In 1968, he resigned his commission from \nthe Navy to further his education and received his Master's degree in \nGeology from the University of Iowa in 1971.\n  In July 1971 Admiral Stubblefield joined the NOAA Commissioned Corps \nas a Lieutenant in his home town of Medina, Tennessee, and attended the \n38th NOAA Corps Basic Officer Training Class which was held at the \nUnited States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York. After \nhis commissioning, he was assigned to serve as a Junior Officer aboard \nthe NOAA Ships Pathfinder and Rainier, conducting hydrographic surveys \nin California, Washington, and Alaska. His next assignment was ashore \nwith the Environmental Research Laboratory, Office of Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Research, in Miami, Florida, as Deputy Director of the \nMarine Geology and Geophysics Division. For this work, he received a \nNOAA Corps Special Achievement Award.\n  Admiral Stubblefield returned to sea duty in December of 1975 as \nOperations Officer aboard the NOAA Ship Researcher, which conducted \noceanographic and atmospheric research in the waters of the Atlantic \nOcean.\n  From January 1978 to May 1979, Admiral Stubblefield attended full-\ntime university training at Texas A University receiving his Ph.D. in \ngeological oceanography. He returned to the Environmental Research \nLaboratory as a research oceanographer until 1981, when he was summoned \nback to sea as the Executive Officer of the NOAA Ship Researcher.\n  Following his sea assignment Admiral Stubblefield had tours of duty \nas the Scientific Support Coordinator of the southeastern Atlantic and \nGulf coastal areas for the NOAA Office of Marine Pollution Assessment \nHazardous Material Program and Technical Specialist for the NOAA Office \nof Sea Grant in Washington, D.C. Admiral Stubblefield was then assigned \nto the position of Chief Scientist for the NOAA Undersea Research \nProgram.\n  He returned to sea in 1988 as Commanding Officer of the NOAA Ship \nSurveyor which conducted oceanic research from the Arctic to the \nAntarctic, including the north and south Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Alaska, \nand the Bering Sea. At the time, the Surveyor had attained the award of \ntraveling the farthest north and south of any NOAA vessel at its time.\n  In 1990 he was assigned the position of Coordinator for the Fleet \nModernization Study to assess the life expectancy of NOAA's ships and \ndetermine how to modernize NOAA's fleet to operate into the 21st \ncentury. For this work, he received the Department of Commerce Silver \nMedal, DOC's second highest award. In late 1990, Admiral Stubblefield \nbecame the Executive Director for the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric \nResearch, where he was responsible for the management and budget \nfunctions, international affairs, and administrative duties of this \nNOAA program office.\n  In August 1992, he was promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral, Lower \nHalf and assigned as Deputy Director, Office of NOAA Corps Operations \nwhere he was responsible for the day-to-day operations of this staff \noffice. In 1995, Admiral Stubblefield was selected for the position of \nDirector, Office of NOAA Corps Operations and Director of the NOAA \nCommissioned Corps, and promoted to Rear Admiral, Upper Half, the \nhighest position in the NOAA Corps.\n  Since Admiral Stubblefield became Director, the Office of NOAA Corps \nOperations has undergone many changes. He re-engineered the office to \nbecome more cost-efficient and customer oriented. He decommissioned \nfive older ships, downsized the headquarters office by over 40 percent, \nboth civilian and commissioned personnel, and reduced ship operating \ncosts, while increasing the level of ship support.\n  Under his command, a new oceanographic ship, the Ronald H. Brown, was \nbuilt and commissioned, and two former Navy ships were converted to \nconduct fisheries, oceanic, and atmospheric research. He also saw the \nnew Gulfstream IV jet built and brought into operation to study the \neffects of El Nino last winter off the California coast and conduct \nhurricane reconnaissance this past hurricane season.\n  Also under his command, Admiral Stubblefield faced the most \nchallenging task of his career, one that no head of a uniformed service \nwould ever want to face--the decision to disestablish the NOAA \nCommissioned Corps. The Corps was under a hiring freeze that lasted for \n4 years. Yet, Admiral Stubblefield still was able to maintain morale \nand fill the assignments required to operate the ships and aircraft.\n  This past October, when it became apparent the NOAA Corps plays a \nvital role for the country, the decision was made to retain the NOAA \nCorps. In January 1999, 17 new officers began their basic training at \nthe Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York.\n\n  Admiral Stubblefield is an officer, a scientist, and a gentleman. I \ncommend Bill for his tremendous accomplishments during his career and \nservice to\n\n[[Page S1404]]\n\nthe Nation, especially those over the past three years. Thanks to his \nefforts, NOAA is stronger, more efficient and will carry out its \ninvaluable mission into the next century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1403-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN ROBBIE BISHOP\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCaptain Robbie Bishop of the Villa Rica Police Department in Villa \nRica, Georgia, who was tragically slain in the line of duty on \nWednesday, January 20, 1999, bringing his service which spanned a \ndecade to the people of Georgia to an end. In addition, I would like to \nhonor Captain Bishop's family for the sacrifice that they have made in \nthe name of Freedom. He was a husband and father of two.\n  Captain Bishop, I understand, was known to have an extraordinary \nability to detect drugs during the most routine traffic stops and was \nconsidered by some to be the best in the Southeast at highway drug \ninterdiction. He was known to have seized thousands of pounds of \nillegal drugs and millions of dollars in cash. Police departments \naround the country solicited Captain Bishop's help to train their \nofficers. In fact, it is believed that it was a routine traffic stop \nwhere he had, once again, detected illegal drugs that resulted in the \nsudden end to his remarkable career.\n  Once again, Mr. President, the work of law enforcement is an elegant \nand lofty endeavor but one that is fraught with terrible dangers. \nCaptain Bishop knew of these threats, but still chose to serve on the \nfront line, protecting Georgia citizens. As we discuss ways to continue \nour fight with the war on drugs, let us remember the lives of those \nlike Captain Robbie Bishop who have fallen fighting this war.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1404-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1404-S1405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO PAUL MELLON--GIANT OF THE ARTS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, America lost one of its greatest \ncitizens and greatest patrons of the arts last week with the death of \nPaul Mellon. All of us who knew him admired his passion for the arts, \nhis extraordinary taste and insights, and his lifelong dedication to \nour country and to improving the lives of others.\n  He was widely known and loved for many different aspects of his \nphilanthropy in many states, including Massachusetts. Perhaps his \ngreatest gift of all to the nation is here in the nation's capital--the \nNational Gallery of Art. The skill and care and support which he \ndevoted to the Gallery for over half a century brilliantly fulfilled \nhis father's gift to the nation. He made the Gallery what it is today--\na world-renowned museum containing many of the greatest masterpieces of \nour time and all time, a fitting and inspiring monument to the special \nplace of the arts in America's history and heritage.\n  I believe that all Americans and peoples throughout the world who \ncare about the arts are mourning the loss of Paul Mellon. We are proud \nof his achievements and his enduring legacy to the nation. We will miss \nhim very much.\n  An appreciation of Paul Mellon by Paul Richard in the Washington Post \nlast week eloquently captured his philosophy of life and his lifelong \ncontributions to our society and culture, and I ask that it be printed \nin the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 3, 1999]\n\n  Appreciation--Paul Mellon's Greatest Gift: The Philanthropist Left \n               Behind a Fine Example of the Art of Living\n\n                           (By Paul Richard)\n\n       Though it never came to anything, Paul Mellon once \n     considered fitting every windowsill in Harlem with a box for \n     growing flowers.\n       Mellon understood that Titians were important, that magic \n     was important, that thoroughbreds and long hot baths and \n     kindness were important, that thinking of the stars, and \n     pondering the waves, and looking at the light on the \n     geraniums were all important, too.\n       In a nation enamored of the lowest common denominators, \n     what intrigued him were the highest. He spent most of his \n     long life, and a vast amount of money, about $1 billion all \n     in all, buying for the rest of us the sorts of private mental \n     pleasures that he had come to value most--not just the big \n     ones of great art, great buildings and great books, but the \n     little ones of quietude, of just sitting in the sand amid the \n     waving dune grass, looking out to sea.\n       He died Monday night at home at Oak Spring, his house near \n     Upperville, Va. Cancer had weakened him. Mellon was 91.\n       Twenty-five years ago, while speaking at his daughter's \n     high school graduation, that cheerful, thoughtful, courtly \n     and unusual philanthropist delivered an assertion that could \n     stand for his epitaph:\n       ``What this country needs is a good five-cent reverie.\n       Mellon's money helped buy us the 28,625-acre Cape Hatteras \n     National Seashore. He gave Virginia its Sky Meadows State \n     Park. In refurbishing Lafayette Square, he put in chess \n     tables, so that there's something to do there other than just \n     stare at the White House. He gave $500,000 for restoring \n     Monticello. He gave Yale University his collection of \n     ancient, arcane volumes of alchemy and magic. He published \n     the I Ching, the Chinese ``book of changes,'' a volume of \n     oracles. And then there is the art.\n       I am deeply in his debt. You probably are, too.\n       If you've ever visited the National Gallery of Art, you \n     have felt his hospitality. Its scholarship, its graciousness, \n     its range and installations--all these are Mellonian.\n       It was Mellon, in the 1930s, who supervised the \n     construction of its West Building, with its fountains and \n     marble stairs and greenhouse for growing the most beautiful \n     fresh flowers. After hiring I.M. Pei to design the East \n     Building, Mellon supervised its construction, and then filled \n     both buildings with art. Mellon gave the gallery 900 works, \n     among them 40 by Degas, 15 by Cezanne, many Winslow Homers \n     and five van Goghs--and this is just a part of his donations. \n     His sporting pictures went to the Virginia Museum of Fine \n     Arts in Richmond, and his British ones to Yale University, \n     where Louis I. Kahn designed the fine museum that holds them.\n       At home, he hung the art himself. He never used a measuring \n     tape; he didn't need to. He had the most observant eye.\n       ``I have a very strong feeling about seeing things,'' he \n     said once. ``I have, for example, a special feeling about how \n     French pictures ought to be shown, and how English pictures \n     ought to be shown. I think my interest in pictures is a bit \n     the same as my interest in landscape or architecture, in \n     looking at horses or enjoying the country. They all have to \n     do with being pleased with what you see.''\n       He would not have called himself an artist, but I would. It \n     was not just his collecting, or the scholarship he paid for, \n     or the museums that he built, all of which were remarkable. \n     Nobody did more to broadcast to the rest of us the profound \n     rewards of art.\n       He was fortunate, and knew it. He had comfortable homes in \n     Paris, Antigua, Manhattan and Nantucket, and more money than \n     he needed. His Choate-and-Yale-and-Cambridge education was \n     distinguished. So were his friends. Queen Elizabeth II used \n     to come for lunch. His horses were distinguished. He bred \n     Quadrangle and Arts and Letters and a colt named Sea Hero, \n     who won the Kentucky Derby. ``A hundred years from now,'' \n     said Mellon, ``the only place my name will turn up anywhere \n     will be in the studbook, for I was the breeder of Mill \n     Reef.'' His insistence on high quality might have marked him \n     as elitist, but he was far too sound a character to seem any \n     sort of snob.\n       His manners were impeccable. Just ask the gallery's older \n     guards, or the guys who groomed his horses. When you met him, \n     his eyes twinkled. He joked impishly and easily. Once, during \n     an interview, he opened his wallet to show me a headline he \n     had clipped from the Daily Telegraph: ``Farmer, 84, Dies in \n     Mole Vendetta.'' He liked the sound of it.\n       There was an if-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it spirit to his \n     luxuries. They were well patinaed. His Mercedes was a `68. \n     His jet wasn't new, and neither were his English suits or his \n     handmade shoes. The martinis he served--half gin, half \n     vodka--were 1920s killers. There was a butler, but he shook \n     them himself. He said he'd always liked the sound of ice \n     cubes against silver.\n       Nothing in his presence told you that Paul Mellon had been \n     miserable when young.\n       His childhood might easily have crushed him. His father, \n     Andrew W. Mellon--one of the nation's richest men and the \n     secretary of the Treasury--had been grim and ice-cube cold.\n       Paul Mellon loved him. It could not have been easy. ``I do \n     not know, and I doubt anyone will ever know,'' he wrote, \n     ``why Father was so seemingly devoid of feeling and so \n     tightly contained in his lifeless, hard shell.''\n       His parents had warred quietly. Paul was still a boy when \n     their marriage ended coldly, in a flurry of detectives. His \n     sister, Ailsa, never quite recovered. Paul never quite forgot \n     his own nervousness and nausea and feelings of inadequacy. It \n     seems a stretch to use this term for someone born so wealthy, \n     but Paul Mellon was a self-made man.\n       Most rich Americans, then as now, saw it as their duty to \n     grow richer. Mellon didn't. When he found his inner compass, \n     and abandoned thoughts of making more money, and said so to \n     his father, he was 29 years old.\n       First he wrote himself a letter. ``The years of habit have \n     encased me in a lump of ice, like the people in my dreams,'' \n     he wrote. ``When I get into any personal conversation with \n     Father, I become congealed and afraid to speak. . . . \n     Business. What does he really expect me to do, or to be? Does \n     he want me to be a great financier . . .? The mass of \n     accumulations, the responsibilities of great financial \n     institutions, appall me. My mind is not attuned to it. . . . \n     I have some very important things to do still in my life, \n     although I am not sure what they are. . . . I\n\n[[Page S1405]]\n\n     want to do in the end things that I enjoy. . . . What does he \n     think life is for? Why is business . . . more important than \n     the acceptance and digestion of ideas? Than the academic \n     life, say, or the artistic? What does it really matter in the \n     end what you do, as long as you are being true to yourself?''\n       So Mellon changed his life. He gave up banking. He moved to \n     Virginia. He started breeding horses. And then, in 1940, \n     after having spent so many years at Cambridge and at Yale, \n     Mellon went back to school. To St. John's College in \n     Annapolis. To study the Great Books.\n       (Mellon later gave more than $13 million to St. John's.)\n       His path had been determined. Though deflected by World War \n     II--he joined the cavalry, then the OSS--Mellon would \n     continue on it for the rest of his long life. As his friend \n     the mythologist Joseph Campbell might have put it (it was \n     Mellon who published Campbell's ``The Hero With a Thousand \n     Faces''), Paul Mellon had determined to follow his own bliss.\n       He was curious about mysticism, so he studied with Carl \n     Jung. He liked deep, expansive books, so he began to publish \n     the best he could discover. Bollingen Series, his book \n     venture, eventually put out 275 well-made volumes, among them \n     the I Ching, Andre Malraux's ``Museum Without Walls,'' Ibn \n     Khaldun's ``The Muqadimah,'' Vladimir Nabokov's translations \n     from Pushkin, and Kenneth Clark's ``The Nude.''\n       Because Mellon liked high scholarship, he started giving \n     scholars money. Elias Caetti, who received his Nobel prize \n     for literature in 1981, got his first Bollingen grant in \n     1985. Others--there were more than 300 in all--went to such \n     thinkers as the sculptor Isamu Noguchi (who was paid to study \n     leisure), the poet Marianne Moore, and the art historian \n     Meyer Schapiro.\n       Because Mellon liked poetry, he established the Bollingen \n     Prize for poetry. The first went to Ezra Pound, the second to \n     Wallace Stevens.\n       Mellon loved horses. So he started buying horse pictures. \n     He had had a great time at Cambridge--``I loved,'' he wrote, \n     ``its gray walls, its grassy quadrangles, its busy, narrow \n     streets full of men in black gowns . . . the candlelight, the \n     coal-fire smell, and walking across the Quadrangle in a \n     dressing gown in the rain to take a bath.''\n       Though America's libraries were full of English books, \n     America's museums were not full of English art. It didn't \n     really count. What mattered was French painting and Italian \n     painting. Mellon didn't care. He thought that if you were \n     reading Chaucer or Dickens or Jane Austen, you ought to have \n     a chance to see what England really looked like. Mellon knew. \n     He remembered. He remembered ``huge dark trees in rolling \n     parks, herds of small friendly deer . . . soldiers in scarlet \n     and bright metal, drums and bugles, troops of gray horses, \n     laughing ladies in white, and always behind them and behind \n     everything the grass was green, green, green.'' So Mellon \n     formed (surprisingly inexpensively) and then gave away \n     (characteristically generously) the world's best private \n     collection of depictive English art.\n       He knew what he was doing. As he knew what he was doing \n     when he took up fox hunting, competitive trail riding and the \n     20th-century abstract paintings of Mark Rothko and Richard \n     Diebenkorn.\n       He was following his bliss.\n       He didn't really plan it that way. He just went for it. \n     ``Most of my decisions,'' he said, ``in every department of \n     my life, whether philanthropy, business or human relations, \n     and perhaps even racing and breeding, are the results of \n     intuition. . . . My father once described himself as a `slow \n     thinker.' It applies to me as well. The hunches or impulses \n     that I act upon, whether good or bad, just seem to rise out \n     of my head like one of those thought balloons in the comic \n     strips.''\n       That wasn't bragging. Mellon wasn't a braggart. He wasn't \n     being falsely modest, either. Mellon knew the value of what \n     it was he'd done.\n       Mellon was a patriot, a good guy and a gentleman. He had a \n     healthy soul. What he did was this:\n       With wit and taste and gentleness, with the highest self-\n     indulgence and the highest generosity, he made the lives of \n     all of us a little bit like his.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1404-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to express my commitment \nto make the Nuclear Waste Storage Bill an early priority during the \n106th Congress. More than 15 years ago, Congress directed the \nDepartment of Energy (DOE) to take responsibility for the disposal of \nnuclear waste created by commercial nuclear power plants and our \nnation's defense programs.\n  Today there are more than 100,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel that \nmust be dealt with. One year has now passed since the DOE was \nabsolutely obligated under the NWPA of 1982 to begin accepting spent \nnuclear fuel from utility sites, and DOE is no closer today in coming \nup with a solution. This is unacceptable. The law is clear, and DOE \nmust meet its obligation. If the Department of Energy does not live up \nto its responsibility, Congress will act.\n  I am encouraged that the House of Representatives has begun to \naddress this issue. A bill introduced by Representative Fred Upton and \nEd Towns of the House's Commerce Committee would set up a temporary \nstorage site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for this waste until a \npermanent repository is approved and built. It is good to see \nbipartisan cosponsors for a safe, practical and workable solution for \nAmerica's spent fuel storage needs. This solution is certainly more \nresponsible than leaving waste at 105 separate power plants in 34 \nstates across the nation. There are 29 sites which will reach capacity \nby the end of 1999. All of America's experience in waste management \nover the last twenty-five years of improving environmental protection \nhas taught Congress that safe, effective waste handling practices \nentail centralized, permitted, and controlled facilities to gather and \nmanage accumulated waste.\n  Mr. President, the management of used nuclear fuel should capitalize \non this knowledge and experience. Nearly 100 communities have spent \nfuel sitting in their ``backyard,'' and it needs to be moved. This lack \nof storage capacity could very possibly cause the closing of several \nnuclear power plants. These affected plants produce nearly 20% of the \nUnited States' electricity. Closing these plants just does not make \nsense.\n  Nuclear energy is a significant part of America's energy future, and \nmust remain part of the energy mix. America needs nuclear power to \nmaintain our secure, reliable, and affordable supplies of electricity \nat the same time the nation addresses increasingly stringent air \nquality requirements. Nuclear power is one of the best ways America can \naddress those who say global warming is a problem--a subject I'll leave \nfor another day.\n  Both the House and the Senate passed a bill in the 105th Congress to \nrequire the DOE to build this interim storage site in Nevada, but \nunfortunately this bill never completed the legislative process. I \nchallenge my colleagues in both chambers of the 106th Congress to get \nthis environmental bill done. The citizens, in some 100 communities \nwhere fuel is stored today, challenge the Congress to act and get this \nbill done. This nuclear industry has already committed to the federal \ngovernment about $15 billion toward building the facility. In fact, the \nnuclear industry continues to pay about $650 million a year in fees for \nstorage of spent fuel. It is time for the federal government to live up \nto its commitment. It is time for the federal government to protect \nthose 100 communities.\n  To ensure that the federal government meets its commitment to states \nand electricity consumers, the 106th Congress must mandate completion \nof this program--a program that includes temporary storage, a site for \npermanent disposal, and a transportation infrastructure to safely move \nused fuel from plants to the storage facility.\n  Mr. President, this federal foot dragging is unfortunate and \nunacceptable, so clearly the only remedy to stopping these continued \ndelays is timely action in the 106th Congress on this \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1405-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1405-S1406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF NATHAN SCHACHT\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and \ncongratulate Nathan Schacht of Walla Walla, Washington, who was awarded \nthe rank of Eagle Scout rank, the Boy Scout of America's highest honor, \non January 19, 1999.\n  Nathan is the son of Don and Margaret Schacht and a sophomore at \nDeSales Catholic High School. He began scouting five years ago with the \nEastgate Lions Troop 305 and moved onto the Cub Scout program with Pack \n309.\n  Nathan and I share a common love for the outdoors. During his tenure \nwith the Boy Scouts he logged over 70 miles of hiking and 70 miles of \ncanoeing; earned the 50 Miler Afloat award; camped 63 nights and earned \n31 merit badges. He recently completed his term as Senior Patrol Leader \nfor Troop 305. He has been a member of the Order of the Arrow since \n1996 and was awarded his Eagle Cap Credentials in 1997.\n  His Eagle project involved building a recycling center for Assumption \nElementary School. He spent over 115 hours planning and carrying out \nthis\n\n[[Page S1406]]\n\nproject which included contacting donors for the materials and working \nwith the volunteers in all phases of the project. He secured over $700 \nin donated materials and 261 hours of volunteer time.\n  Nathan also participates in other activities in his school and \ncommunity. He participates in the football, basketball, and golf \nprograms at DeSales High School, as well as band, drama and National \nHonor Society. He has served as a page in the Washington State House of \nRepresentatives and as an altar server for the past seven years at \nAssumption Catholic Church.\n  I am confident that Nathan will continue to be a positive role model \namong his peers, a leader in his community and a friend to those in \nneed. I extend my sincerest congratulations and best wishes to him. His \nachievement of Eagle Scout and significant contributions to the Walla \nWalla community are truly outstanding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1405-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1406-S1409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ON THE MOTIONS TO OPEN TO THE PUBLIC THE FINAL DELIBERATIONS ON THE \n                        ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. In relation to the earlier vote, I have these \nthoughts. Accustomed as we and the American people are to having our \nproceedings in the Senate open to the public and subject to press \ncoverage, the most striking prescription in the ``Rules of Procedure \nand Practice in the Senate when Sitting on Impeachment Trials'' has \nbeen the closed deliberations required on any question, motion and now \non the final vote on the Articles of Impeachment.\n  The requirement of closed deliberation more than any other rule \nreflects the age in which the rules were originally adopted in 1868. \nEven in 1868, however, not everyone favored secrecy. During the trial \nof President Johnson, the senior Senator from Vermont, George F. \nEdmunds, moved to have the closed deliberations on the Articles \ntranscribed and officially reported ``in order that the world might \nknow, without diminution or exaggeration, the reasons and views upon \nwhich we proceed to our judgment.'' [Cong. Globe Supp'l, Impeachment \nTrial of President Andrew Johnson, 40th Cong., 2d Sess., vol. 4, p. \n424.] The motion was tabled.\n  In the 130 years that have passed since that time, the Senate has \nseen the advent of television in the Senate Chamber, instant \ncommunication and rapid news cycles, distribution of Senate documents \nover the Internet, the addition of 46 Senators representing 23 \nadditional States, and the direct election of Senators by the people in \nour States.\n  Opening deliberations would help further the dual purposes of our \nrules to promote fairness and political accountability in the \nimpeachment process. I supported the motion by Senators Harkin, \nWellstone and others to suspend this rule requiring closed \ndeliberations and to open our deliberations on Senator Byrd's motion to \ndismiss and at other points earlier in this trial. We were \nunsuccessful. Now that we are approaching our final deliberations on \nthe Articles of Impeachment, themselves, I hope that this secrecy rule \nwill be suspended so that the Senate's deliberations are open and the \nAmerican people can see them. In a matter of this historic importance, \nthe American people should be able to witness their Senators' \ndeliberations.\n  Some have indicated objection to opening our final deliberations \nbecause petit juries in courts of law conduct their deliberations in \nsecret. Analogies to juries in courts of law are misplaced. I was \nprivileged to serve as a prosecutor for eight years before I was \nelected to the Senate. As a prosecutor, I represented the people of \nVermont in court and before juries on numerous occasions. I fully \nappreciate the traditions and importance of allowing jurors to \ndeliberate and make their decisions privately, without intrusion or \npressure from the parties, the judge or the public. The sanctity of the \njury deliberation room ensures the integrity and fairness of our \njudicial system.\n  The Senate sitting as an impeachment court is unlike any jury in any \ncivil or criminal case. A jury in a court of law is chosen specifically \nbecause the jurors have no connection or relation to the parties or \ntheir lawyers and no familiarity with the allegations. Keeping the \ndeliberations of regular juries secret ensures that as they reach their \nfinal decision, they are free from outside influences or pressure.\n  As the Chief Justice made clear on the third day of the impeachment \ntrial, the Senate is more than a jury; it is a court. Courts are called \nupon to explain the reasons for decisions.\n  Furthermore, to the extent the Senate is called upon to evaluate the \nevidence as is a jury, we stand in different shoes than any juror in a \ncourt of law. We all know many of the people who have been witnesses in \nthis matter; we all know the Republican Managers--indeed, one Senator \nis a brother of one of the Managers; and we were familiar with the \nunderlying allegations in this case before the Republican Managers ever \nbegan their presentation.\n  Because we are a different sort of jury, we shoulder a heavier burden \nin explaining the reasons for the decisions we make here. I appreciate \nwhy Senators would want to have certain of our deliberations in closed \nsession: to avoid embarrassment to and protect the privacy of persons \nwho may be discussed. Yet, on the critical decisions we are now being \ncalled upon to make our votes on the Articles themselves, allowing our \ndeliberations to be open to the public helps assure the American people \nthat the decisions we make are for the right reasons.\n\n  In 1974, when the Senate was preparing itself for the anticipated \nimpeachment trial of former President Richard Nixon, the Committee on \nRules and Administration discussed the issue of allowing television \ncoverage of the Senate trial. Such coverage did not become routine in \nthe Senate until later in 1986. In urging such coverage of the possible \nimpeachment trial of President Nixon, Senator Metcalf (D-MT), \nexplained:\n\n       Given the fact that the party not in control of the White \n     House is the majority party in the Senate, the need for \n     broadcast media access is even more compelling. Charges of a \n     `kangaroo court,' or a `lynch mob proceeding' must not be \n     given an opportunity to gain any credence whatsoever. \n     Americans must be able to see for themselves what is \n     occurring. An impeachment trial must not be perceived by the \n     public as a mysterious process, filtered through the \n     perceptions of third parties. The procedure whereby the \n     individual elected to the most powerful office in the world \n     can be lawfully removed must command the highest possible \n     level of acceptance from the electorate.'' (Hrg. August 5 and \n     6, 1974, p. 37).\n\n  Opening deliberation will ensure complete and accurate public \nunderstanding of the proceedings and the reasons for the decisions we \nmake here. Opening our deliberations on our votes on the Articles would \ntell the American people why each of us voted the way we did.\n  The last time this issue was actually taken up and voted on by the \nSenate was more than a century ago in 1876, during the impeachment \ntrial of Secretary of War William Belknap. Without debate or \ndeliberation, the Senate refused then to open the deliberations of the \nSenate to the public. That was before Senators were elected directly by \nthe people of their State, that was before the Freedom of Information \nAct confirmed the right of the people to see how government decisions \nare made. Keeping closed our deliberations is wholly inconsistent with \nthe progress we have made over the last century to make our government \nmore accountable to the people.\n  Constitutional scholar Michael Gerhardt noted in his important book, \n``The Federal Impeachment Process,'' that ``the Senate is ideally \nsuited for balancing the tasks of making policy and finding facts (as \nrequired in impeachment trials) with political accountability.'' Public \naccess to the reasons each Senator gives for his vote on the Articles \nis vital for the political accountability that is the hallmark of our \nrole.\n  I likewise urge the Senate to adjust these 130-year-old rules to \nallow the Senate's votes on the Articles of Impeachment to be recorded \nfor history by news photographers. This is an momentous official and \npublic event in the annals of the Senate and in the history of the \nnation. This is a moment of history that should be documented for both \nits contemporary and its lasting significance.\n  Open deliberation ensures complete accountability to the American \npeople. Charles Black wrote that presidential impeachment ``unseats the \nperson the\n\n[[Page S1407]]\n\npeople have deliberately chosen for the office.'' ``Impeachment: A \nHandbook,'' at 17. The American people must be able to judge if their \nelected representatives have chosen for or against conviction for \nreasons they understand, even if they disagree. To bar the American \npeople from observing the deliberations that result in these important \ndecisions is unfair and undemocratic.\n  The Senate should have suspended the rules so that our deliberations \non the final question of whether to convict the President of these \nArticles of Impeachment were held in open session.\n  I ask that following my remarks a copy of the Application of Cable \nNews Network, submitted by Floyd Abrams and others, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows:\n\n          IN THE U.S. SENATE SITTING AS A COURT OF IMPEACHMENT\n\n                               __________\n                               \n\n                                 In re\n\n   Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United \n                                 States\n\n                               __________\n                               \n\n\napplication of cable news network for a determination that the closure \nof these proceedings violates the first amendment to the united states \n                              constitution\n\n                               __________\n                               \n     To: The Honorable William H. Rehnquist and The Honorable \n         Members of the U.S. Senate\n       Cable News Network (``CNN'') respectfully submits this \n     application for a determination that the First Amendment to \n     the United States Constitution requires that the public be \n     permitted to attend and view the debates, deliberations and \n     proceedings of the United States Senate as to the issue of \n     whether President William Jefferson Clinton shall be \n     convicted and as to other related matters.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of document.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       Under Rules VII, XX and XXIV of the ``Rules of Procedure \n     and Practice in the Senate When Sitting On Impeachment \n     Trials,'' the Senate has determined to sit in closed session \n     during its consideration of various issues that have arisen \n     during these impeachment proceedings. Motions to suspend the \n     rules have failed and the debates among members of the Senate \n     as to a number of significant matters have been closed. As \n     the final debates and deliberations approach at which each \n     member of the Senate will voice his or her views on the issue \n     of whether President Clinton should be convicted or acquitted \n     of the charges made, the need for the closest, most intense \n     public scrutiny of the proceedings in this body increases. By \n     this application, CNN seeks access for the public to observe \n     those debates, as well as other proceedings that bear upon \n     the resolution of the impeachment trial. The basis of this \n     application is the First Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n       We make this application mindful that deliberations upon \n     impeachment were conducted behind ``closed doors'' at the \n     last impeachment trial of a President, in 1868. We are, as \n     well, mindful of the power of the Senate--consistent with the \n     power conferred upon it in Article I, Section 3 of the \n     Constitution--to exercise full control over the conduct of \n     impeachment proceedings held before it. In so doing, however, \n     the Senate must itself be mindful of its unavoidable \n     responsibility to adopt rules and procedures consistent with \n     the entirety of the Constitution as it is now understood and \n     as the Supreme Court has interpreted it.\n       The commands of the First Amendment, we urge, are at war \n     with closed-door impeachment deliberations. If there is one \n     principle at the core of the First Amendment it is that, as \n     Madison wrote, ``the censorial power is in the people over \n     the Government, and not in the Government over the people.'' \n     4 Annals of Congress, p. 934 (1794). That proposition in turn \n     is rooted in the expectation that citizens--the people--will \n     have the information that enables them to judge government \n     and those in government. The right and ability of citizens to \n     obtain the information necessary for self-government is \n     indeed at the heart of the Republic itself: ``a people who \n     mean to be their own Governors,'' Madison also wrote, ``must \n     arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.'' James \n     Madison, Letter to W.T. Barry, in 9 Writings of James Madison \n     103 (G. Hunt ed., 1910). As Chief Justice Warren Burger \n     observed, writing for the Supreme Court in 1980 in one of its \n     many recent rulings vindicating the principle of open \n     government: ``People in an open society do not demand \n     infallibility from their institutions, but it is difficult \n     for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.'' \n     Richmond Newspapers,  Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 572 \n     (1980). Those very words could well have been written \n     about the proceedings before the Senate today.\n       All agree that the impeachment of a President presents the \n     most solemn question of self-government that a free society \n     can ever confront. All should also agree that the public \n     ought to have the most complete information about each \n     decision made by the body responsible for ruling upon that \n     impeachment. Should the Senate vote to convict, a President \n     duly elected twice by the public will be removed from office. \n     Does not a self-governing public have the most powerful \n     interest in being informed about every aspect of that \n     decision and why it was taken? Should the Senate vote to \n     acquit, the President will not be removed in the face of \n     impeachment proceedings in which the majority in the House \n     branded him a criminal. Can it seriously be doubted that the \n     public possesses just as profound a right to know why?\n       Only recently--and only during this century (and well after \n     the trial of Andrew Johnson)--has our commitment to the \n     principle that debate on public issues should be open become \n     not merely a nationally shared philosophy but an element \n     embedded in constitutional law as well. But deeply-rooted in \n     the law it has become. It is thus no answer to observe that \n     impeachment deliberations in the Senate were closed in the \n     nineteenth century. The Senate has a duty to consider the \n     transformation of First Amendment principles since that time \n     in determining whether it is now constitutionally permissible \n     to close impeachment deliberations on the eve of the twenty-\n     first century. If, as is also true, the Senate, rather than \n     the Supreme Court, was chosen to try impeachments precisely \n     because its members are ``the representatives of the \n     nation,'' Federalist No. 65, and as such possess a greater \n     ``degree of credit and authority'' than the Supreme Court to \n     carry out the task of determining the fate of a President,\\1\\ \n     that ``credit and authority'' can only be brought to bear if \n     the process by which judgment is reached is open to the \n     public.\n\n\n   the obligation of congress to account for and abide by the first \n                               amendment\n\n       As we have said, we are mindful of the language of Article \n     I, Section 3, according the Senate the ``sole Power to try \n     all Impeachments.'' See Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224 \n     (1993) (according the Senate broad discretion to choose \n     impeachment procedures). But this very delegation of \n     authority to the Senate, a delegation that makes most issues \n     concerning impeachment rules ``non-justiciable'', see Nixon, \n     supra, also imposes on this body a very special \n     responsibility to ensure that those rules comply with \n     constitutional mandates.\\2\\ Congress itself--the very entity \n     against which the First Amendment affords the most explicit \n     protection \\3\\--is bound to abide by the First Amendment. The \n     Constitution is ``the supreme Law of the Land,'' U.S. Const., \n     art. VI, para. 2, and all ``Senators and Representatives . . \n     . shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support'' it. Id. \n     para. 3. The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that \n     Congress is itself obligated to interpret the Constitution in \n     exercising its authority. See, e.g., Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 \n     U.S. 57, 64 (1981) (``Congress is a coequal branch of \n     government whose Members take the same oath we do to uphold \n     the Constitution of the United States.''). And in \n     promulgating its rules the Congress must, of course, abide by \n     the Constitution: ``The constitution empowers each house to \n     determine its rules and proceedings. It may not by its rules \n     ignore constitutional restraints or violate fundamental \n     rights. . . .'' United States v. Ballin, 144 U.S. 1, 5 \n     (1892), quoted in Consumers Union of United States, Inc. \n     v. Periodical Correspondents' Assoc., 515 F.2d 1341, 1347 \n     (D.C. Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1051 (1976); see \n     Watkins v. United States, 354 U.S. 178, 188 (1957).\n\n\n                   the command of the first amendment\n\n       The architecture of free speech law--and, in particular, \n     that law placed in the context of access to information as to \n     how and why government power is being exercised--could not \n     more strongly favor the broadest dissemination of information \n     about, and comment on, government. The foundation of the \n     First Amendment is, in fact, our republican form of \n     government itself. As the Supreme Court recognized in the \n     landmark free speech decision, New York Times Co. v. \n     Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964): ``. . . the Constitution \n     created a form of government under which `[t]he people, not \n     the government possess the absolute sovereignty.' The \n     structure of the government dispersed power in reflection of \n     the people's distrust of concentrated power, and of power \n     itself at all levels. This form of government was `altogether \n     different' from the British form, under which the Crown was \n     sovereign and the people were subjects.'' Id. at 274 (quoting \n     Reporting of the General Assembly of Virginia, 4 Elliot's \n     Debates). In Sullivan, a unanimous Court determined that the \n     ``altogether different'' form of government ratified by the \n     Founders necessitated an altogether ``different degree of \n     freedom'' as to political debate than had existed in England. \n     Id. at 275 (citation omitted). It was in the First Amendment \n     that this unique freedom was enshrined and protected.\n       For the Court, the ``central meaning of the First \n     Amendment,'' 376 U.S. at 273, was the ``right of free public \n     discussion of the stewardship of public officials. . . .'' \n     Id. at 275. Thus, the First Amendment ``was fashioned to \n     assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about \n     of political and social changes desired by the people.'' Roth \n     v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 484. ``The maintenance of the \n     opportunity for free political discussion to the end that \n     government may be responsive to the will of the people and \n     that changes may be obtained by lawful means, an opportunity \n     essential to the security of the Republic, is a fundamental \n     principle of our constitutional system.'' Stromberg v. \n     California, 283 U.S. 359, 369. Id. at 269.\\4\\\n       The decision in Sullivan related specifically to libel law. \n     But what made Sullivan so\n\n[[Page S1408]]\n\n     transformative--what made it, as the eminent First Amendment \n     scholar Alexander Meiklejohn remarked, cause for ``dancing in \n     the streets'' \\5\\--was this: it recognized (in Madison's \n     words) that ``[t]he people, not the government, possess the \n     absolute sovereignty.'' Sullivan, 376 U.S. at 274. It \n     emphasized that the First Amendment protected the ``citizen-\n     critic'' of government. Id. at 282. It barred government \n     itself from seeking damages from insults directed at it by \n     its citizens. And it declared that ``public discussion is a \n     political duty.'' Id. at 270.\n       In the decades following Sullivan, these notions became \n     embedded in the First Amendment--and thus the rule of law--\n     through dozens of rulings of the Supreme Court. In \n     particular, and following from, the First Amendment \n     protection of public discussion is the right of the public to \n     receive information about government. The First Amendment is \n     not merely a bar on the affirmative suppression of speech; as \n     Chief Justice Rehnquist has observed, ``censorship . . . as \n     often as not is exercised not merely by forbidding the \n     printing of information in the possession of a correspondent, \n     but in denying him access to places where he might obtain \n     such information.'' William H. Rehnquist, ``The First \n     Amendment: Freedom, Philosophy, and the Law,'' 12 Gonz. L. \n     Rev. 1, 17 (1976).\n       And, indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly affirmed \n     Chief Justice Rehnquist's insight. ``[T]he First Amendment \n     goes beyond protection of the press and the self-expression \n     of individuals to prohibit government from limiting the stock \n     of information from which members of the public may draw.'' \n     First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 783 \n     (1978); Accord Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.S. 753, 762 \n     (1972) (``In a variety of contexts this Court has referred to \n     a First Amendment right to `receive information and ideas.' \n     '').\n       The Supreme Court has thus ruled on four occasions that the \n     First Amendment creates a right for the public to attend and \n     observe criminal trials and related judicial proceedings, \n     absent the most extraordinary of circumstances. Richmond \n     Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555 (1980); Globe \n     Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596 (1982); Press-\n     Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464 U.S. 501 (1984); Press-\n     Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1 (1986). The \n     cases are particularly relevant to this application because \n     they--perhaps more clearly than any others--illustrate the \n     core constitutional principle that government may not \n     arbitrarily foreclose the opportunity for citizens to obtain \n     information central to the decisions they make--and the \n     judgments they render--about government itself.\n       The teaching of this quartet of cases was aptly articulated \n     by another Chief Justice, Warren Burger, writing for the \n     Court in Richmond Newspapers, the first of the four \n     decisions. The First Amendment, he wrote, ``assur[es] freedom \n     of communication on matters relating to the functioning of \n     government.'' 448 U.S. at 575. Noting the centrality of the \n     openness in which trials were conducted to that end, id. at \n     575, the Court stated that openness was an ``indispensable \n     attribute of an Anglo-American trial.'' Id. at 569. It had \n     assured that proceedings were conducted fairly, and it had \n     ``discouraged perjury, the misconduct of participants, and \n     decisions based on secret bias''. Id. Most significantly, \n     open trials had provided public acceptance of and support for \n     the entire judicial process. It was with respect to this \n     benefit of openness--the legitimacy it provides to the \n     actions of government itself--that Chief Justice Burger (in \n     the passage quoted above), observed that ``[p]eople in an \n     open society do not demand infallibility from their \n     institutions, but it is difficult for them at accept what \n     they are prohibited from observing.'' Id. at 562.\\6\\\n       To be sure, the Chief Justice in Richmond Newspapers rested \n     heavily on the tradition of openness of criminal trials \n     themselves--a difference of potential relevance because \n     impeachment debates and deliberation have historically been \n     conducted in secret. But, taken together, Richmond Newspapers \n     and its progeny stand for propositions far broader than the \n     constitutional value of any specific historical practice. The \n     sheer range of proceedings endorsed as open by the Supreme \n     Court suggests the importance under the First Amendment of \n     public observation of the act of doing justice. Moreover, \n     Supreme Court precedent itself suggests that the crucial \n     right to see justice done prevails even where the specific \n     kind of proceeding at issue had a history of being closed to \n     the public. In Globe Newspaper Co.,  the Court ruled that the \n     First Amendment barred government from closing of trials of \n     sexual offenses involving minor victims. It did so despite \n     the ``long history of exclusion of the public from trials \n     involving sexual assaults, particularly those against \n     minors.'' 457 U.S. at 614 (Burger, C.J., dissenting).\n       New York Times Co. v. Sullivan and Richmond Newspapers have \n     significance which sweep far beyond their holdings that \n     debate about public figures must be open and robust and that \n     trials must be accessible to the public. Both cases--and all \n     the later cases they have spawned--are about the centrality \n     of openness to the process of self-governance. ``[T]he right \n     of access to criminal trials plays a particularly significant \n     role in the functioning of the judicial process and the \n     government as a whole. Public scrutiny of a criminal trial \n     enhances the quality and safeguards the integrity of the \n     fact-finding process, with benefits to both the defendant and \n     to society as a whole. . . . And in the broadest terms, \n     public access to criminal trials permits the public to \n     participate in and serve as a check upon the judicial \n     process--an essential component in our structure of self \n     government.'' Globe Newspaper Co., 457 U.S. at 606.\n       The First Amendment principles set forth above lead \n     inexorably to a straightforward conclusion: the Senate should \n     determine as a matter of First Amendment law that the public \n     may attend and observe its debates and deliberations about \n     the impeachment of President Clinton. No issue relates more \n     to self-government. No determinations will have more impact \n     on the public. No judgment of the Senate should be subject to \n     more--and more informed--public scrutiny.\n       We are well aware that it is sometimes easier to be \n     subjected to less public scrutiny and that some have the \n     perception (which has sometimes proved accurate) that more \n     can be accomplished more quickly in secret than in public. \n     But this is, at its core, an argument against democracy \n     itself, against the notion that it is the public itself which \n     should sit in judgment on the performance of this body. It is \n     nothing less than a rejection of the First Amendment itself. \n     What Justice Brennan said two decades ago in the context of \n     judicial proceedings is just as applicable here: ``Secrecy of \n     judicial action can only breed ignorance and distrust of \n     courts and suspicion concerning the competence and \n     impartiality of judges; free and robust reporting, criticism, \n     and debate can contribute to public understanding of the rule \n     of law and to comprehension of the functioning of the entire \n     criminal justice system, as well as improve the quality of \n     that system by subjecting it to the cleansing effects of \n     exposure and public accountability.'' Nebraska Press Ass'n v. \n     Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 587 (1976) (Brennan, J., concurring).\n       That it is the tradition of this body to conduct \n     impeachment deliberations in closed session is not \n     irrelevant. But neither should it be governing. The Senate \n     has, after all, conducted only one presidential impeachment \n     trial before this one. Our society in 1868--and, more \n     significantly still, our law in 1868--was far different than \n     it is today. As we have demonstrated, First Amendment \n     jurisprudence as we know it--as it governs us and binds the \n     Senate--is essentially a creature of the twentieth century. \n     That jurisprudence assures public scrutiny, not public \n     ignorance.\n       There are, to be sure, certain limited instances when \n     closure of Senate deliberations may serve useful purposes, \n     such as when they involve disclosure of matters of national \n     security. But no such concerns are present here. And however \n     proper it may be to analogize the Senate in some ways to a \n     jury, none of the considerations that permits juries to \n     deliberate out of the public eye are present here. The \n     identities of the ``jurors'' her are well known, as, under \n     the Senate rules, will be how each one voted. The \n     Constitution does not offer protection to the ``jurors'' here \n     from the force of public opinion for their votes for or \n     against the conviction of President Clinton. They will face \n     the full weight of public approval or rejection the next time \n     they seek re-election. The Constitution does require that the \n     reasons they give for their votes and other statements made \n     in the course of debate be made in public so that both the \n     debate and the votes themselves can be assessed by the \n     people--the ultimate ``Governors'' in this republic.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       From the time these proceedings commenced in the House of \n     Representatives through the submission of this application, \n     members of the Congress have repeatedly--and undoubtedly \n     correctly--referred to the weighty constitutional obligations \n     imposed upon them by this process. This application focuses \n     on yet another constitutional obligation of the members of \n     the Senate, an obligation reflected in the oath of office \n     itself. it is that of adhering to the First Amendment. We \n     urge the Senate to do so by permitting the public to observe \n     its deliberations.\n\n     Dated: New York, NY, January 29, 1999.\n\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     David Hokler,\n       Senior Vice President and General Counsel, Cable News \n     Network;\n     Floyd Abrams,\n     Dean Ringel,\n     Susan Buckley,\n     Jonathan Sherman,\n       Cahill Gordon & Reindel; Counsel for Applicant Cable News \n     Network.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ Federalist No. 65; see Nixon v.

Mr. President, on January 28, I was the only \nDemocratic senator to cross party lines and oppose the motion to \ndismiss. I felt it would be unwise to end this trial prior to a more \ncomplete presentation of evidence and a final vote on the Articles of \nImpeachment themselves. Nonetheless, I had no doubt that a motion to \ndismiss was a constitutional way to end the trial, if a majority of \nsenators had supported the motion.\n  The Senate must keep in mind at every step in this process that our \nactions will be scrutinized not just by our constituents today and for \nthe rest of the trial, but also by history. If another impeachment \ntrial should occur 130 years from now, the record of this trial will \nserve as an important precedent for the Senate as it determines how to \nproceed. It is our responsibility to abide by the Constitution as \nclosely as possible throughout the remainder of this trial. My votes on \nHouse Managers' motions on February 4 were based on the same concerns \nabout prudence and precedent that motivated my earlier votes on the \nmotion to dismiss and calling witnesses.\n  With the judgment of history awaiting us, I did have serious concerns \nabout the constitutionality of proposals that the Senate should adopt \nso-called ``Findings of Fact'' before the Senate votes on the Articles \nof Impeachment themselves. It now appears that support for such \nproposals has waned, and the Senate will not be called upon to vote on \nthem. Nonetheless, I want to explain my opposition to such proposals \nfor the record.\n  Findings of Fact would allow a simple 51 vote majority of the Senate \nto state the judgment of the Senate on the facts of this case and, in \neffect, to determine the President's ``guilt'' of the crimes alleged in \nthe Articles. But the Constitution specifically requires that two-\nthirds of the Senate must convict the President on the Articles in \norder to impose any sanction on him. The specific punishment set out by \nthe Constitution if the Senate convicts is removal from office, and \npossibly disqualification from holding future office.\n  The supermajority requirement makes the impeachment process \ndifficult, and the Framers intended that it be difficult. They were \nvery careful to avoid making conviction and removal of the President \nsomething that could be accomplished for purely partisan purposes. In \nonly 23 out of 105 Congresses and in only six Congresses in this \ncentury has one party held more than a 2/3 majority in the Senate. \nNever in our history has a President faced a Senate controlled by the \nother party by more than a 2/3 majority. (The Republican party had \nnearly 80 percent of the seats in the Senate that in 1868 tried Andrew \nJohnson. Johnson was at that time also a Republican, although he had \nbeen a Democrat before being chosen by Abraham Lincoln to be his Vice-\nPresident in 1864.) The great difficulty of obtaining a conviction in \nthe Senate on charges that are seen as motivated by partisan politics \nhas discouraged impeachment efforts in the past. Adding Findings of \nFact to the process would undercut this salutary effect of the \nsupermajority requirement for conviction.\n  The Senate must fulfill its constitutional obligation and determine \nwhether the President's acts require conviction and removal. The \ncritical constitutional tool of impeachment should not be available \nsimply to attack or criticize the President. Impeachment is a unique. \nIt is the sole constitutionally sanctioned encroachment on the \nprinciple of separation of powers, and it must be used sparingly. If \nFindings of Fact had been adopted in this trial, it would have set a \ndangerous precedent that might have led to more frequent efforts to \nimpeach.\n  The ability of a simple majority of the Senate to determine the \nPresident's guilt of the crimes alleged would distort the impeachment \nprocess and increase the specter of partisanship. When the Senate is \nsitting as a court of impeachment, its job is simply to acquit or \nconvict. And that is the only judgment that the Senate should make \nduring an impeachment trial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1409-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1409-S1410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MOTIONS PERTAINING TO WITNESS DEPOSITIONS AND TESTIMONY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on Thursday, February 4th, the \nSenate, sitting as a court of impeachment, considered several motions \npertaining to the depositions and live testimony of witnesses Monica \nLewinsky, Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal. I wish to speak briefly \non the important issues raised by several of these motions.\n  First, let me say that I am pleased that the Senate, by a bipartisan \nvote of 30-70, voted not to compel the live testimony of Ms. Lewinsky. \nIn my view, this was a sound decision to support the expeditious \nconduct of this trial, preserve the decorum of the Senate, and respect \nthe privacy of this particular witness.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate retreated from these same worthy aims in \ndeciding to permit the videotaped depositions of Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. \nJordan, and Mr. Blumenthal to be entered into evidence and broadcast to \nthe public. I believe that this decision was erroneous for three basic \nreasons:\n  First, it needlessly prolonged the trial. Prior to February 4th, \nSenators had an opportunity to view the depositions of each of these \nwitnesses--not once, but repeatedly. Numerous times we could have \nviewed the content of their testimony, the tone of their answers, and \ntheir demeanor while under oath. By requiring that Senators view \nportions of these depositions again on the Floor, in whole or in part, \nthe Managers' motion unnecessarily required the Senate to convene for \nan entire day. We learned nothing by viewing excerpts of the \ndepositions on the Floor that we had not already had an opportunity to \nlearn by viewing those depositions previously, either on videotape or, \nin the case of myself and five other Senators, in person.\n  Second, allowing the depositions to be publicly aired on the Senate \nFloor exaggerated their importance. Even Manager Hyde has acknowledged \nthat these depositions broke no material new ground in this case. \nAllowing their broadcast thus was not only an injudicious use of the \nSenate's time. It also elevated the significance of this particular \ntestimony over all other sworn testimony taken in this matter--solely \nby virtue of the fact that it was recently videotaped. Broadcasting \nthese minuscule and marginal portions of the record--while not \nbroadcasting other depositions--does not illuminate the record so much \nas distort it. The distortion is only compounded by broadcasting \nselected portions of those depositions rather than the depositions in \ntheir entirety. The President's counsel obviously had an opportunity to \nrebut the Managers' presentation and characterization of those \nportions. However, that rebuttal only underscores the fact that the \nManagers' motion to use these videotapes gave the videotapes a \nprominence and gravity that they do not merit.\n  Thirdly, under the circumstances, publicly airing portions of these \ndepositions constituted a needless invasion of the privacy of the \nwitnesses whose testimony was videotaped. Let us remember that these \nindividuals are not public figures who have willingly surrendered a \nportion of their privacy as a consequence of their freely chosen \nstatus. They are private citizens, reluctantly drawn into legal \nproceedings. They have attempted to discharge their obligations in \nthose proceedings. But that obligation does not extend to the public \nbroadcast of their videotaped depositions--particularly given that they \nhave testified repeatedly before, and that their videotaped testimony \ncontains no new material information. The privacy rights of these \nindividuals deserved greater consideration by the Managers and by the \nSenate. The Managers did not need to force the images of these \nwitnesses into the living rooms and family rooms of America in order to \npresent their case. And the Senate did not need to allow that to happen \nin order to meet its constitutional responsibility in this matter.\n  For these reasons, Mr. President, I opposed the Managers' motion to\n\n[[Page S1410]]\n\nbroadcast the deposition videotapes. In my view, the time has come to \nbring this matter to an end. The record is voluminous, the arguments \nhave been made. We know enough to decide the questions before us. That \nis why I supported Senator Daschle's motion to proceed to final \narguments and a vote on each of the Articles of Impeachment. I regret \nthat his motion was not adopted, and that instead the Senate decided to \nneedlessly prolong this matter without sufficient regard for the \nprivacy of the witnesses deposed last week. However, that said, I am \npleased that, barring any unforseen developments, this trial will at \nlast conclude later this week. It is time for the Senate to move on to \nthe other important business of the country that we were elected to \naddress.\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/09/senate-section/article/S1409-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}]
