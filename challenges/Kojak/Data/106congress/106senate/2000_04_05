Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey.\n  Let me first of all commend Senator Robb of Virginia. I think what he \nhas done out here on the floor of the Senate is very important for our \ncountry, and not just for senior citizens. He submitted an amendment \nthat would make it out of order for the Senate to consider a \nreconciliation bill that spends on-budget surplus on tax cuts unless \nCongress has already enacted legislation establishing an outpatient \nMedicare prescription drug benefit.\n  I come here to the floor of the Senate to congratulate Senator Robb \nand to speak for senior citizens in Minnesota.\n  If we are about legislation that is important to people's lives, if \nwe want to be here to represent the people in our States, there is no \nmore important amendment for us to pass. This isn't where the rubber \nmeets the road, but it is all about the general direction for the \nSenate, and the direction Senator Robb's amendment calls is to make \nsure we make a commitment to funding prescription drug coverage for \nsenior citizens in this country.\n  In the State of Minnesota, on the basis of hearings I have attended, \non the basis of conversations and meetings--some of them incredibly \nheartfelt and incredibly painful--with elderly citizens in my State, \nthere is no more important thing we can do than to pass this amendment \nand to once and for all cover prescription drug benefits for senior \ncitizens.\n  First of all, in the State of Minnesota, because of a very unfair \nand, I argue, even discriminatory Medicare reimbursement to our \nmanaged-care plans and to our seniors, we have in our State only one-\nthird of senior citizens\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\nreceiving any kind of prescription drug coverage at all. Two-thirds of \nthe senior citizens in Minnesota don't have any coverage whatsoever. I \nthink in the country it is about one-third. But in our State it is an \nacute problem; it is a problem of crisis proportion.\n\n  Second of all, as a result of that, it is not uncommon to meet \nseniors who, even when the doctor gives them a prescription, can't fill \nthe prescription because they don't have the money, or they cut the \npills into thirds or into halves, all of which is dangerous. I have met \nall of those senior citizens. I have been in these conversations with \nsenior citizens about this. It is not uncommon to meet people who spend \n$300 or $400 a month to meet their prescription drug costs and at the \nsame time their total monthly income is $1,000--all the while, in the \npharmaceutical industry, the costs have gone up 17 percent a year over \nthe past couple of years, and they are projected to go up again. The \npharmaceutical industry rakes in record--I argue exorbitant, I argue \nobscene--profits.\n  But for today, what is so important about the Robb amendment is that \nif we want to do something to really make a difference in the lives of \npeople we represent, we must expand Medicare and provide this coverage.\n  My colleagues on the Republican side want to go forward with tax \ncuts, many of which go to higher income people least in need. They seem \nto believe it is not an appropriate role for Government or the Senate \nto provide prescription drug coverage as a part of what Medicare is all \nabout.\n  I think the vast majority of people in the country believe that when \nit comes to certain pressing issues of their lives, there is a positive \nrole Government can play. This is a perfect example to make sure people \ndo not go without the very prescription drugs they need, which is so \nessential to their health. That is what is so important about this \namendment.\n  When my Republican colleagues say they want to limit this to low-\nincome senior citizens, I just want to say what has made Medicare and \nSocial Security work is that it is a universal coverage program. It \ncommands broad support. This is about building on Medicare. This isn't \ngoing back to means-tested programs which quite often become poor \nprograms.\n  Just because a senior citizen in Minnesota or Virginia or \nMassachusetts has an income of $17,000 a year or $18,000 a year, it \ndoes not mean he or she or both of them are not in need of some help so \nthey can purchase the prescription drugs that are so important to their \nhealth.\n  This is a very important amendment. I am tired of the Minnesotans \nhaving to go to Canada to purchase prescription drugs they can afford. \nI am tired of the Minnesota Senior Federation, which is a courageous, \ngutsy grassroots organization, having to raise Cain over and over and \nover again about the fact that so many senior citizens are not able to \nafford the prescription drugs they need for their health.\n  ``All politics,'' Tip O'Neill said, ``is local.'' I argue all \npolitics is also personal. Having been the child of parents, both of \nwhom have passed away with Parkinson's disease, I know what drugs such \nas L-Dopa and Sinemet cost.\n  There is no more important thing we can do if we want to get real, if \nwe want to respond to what our constituents need, than to pass this \nRobb amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Virginia for his leadership. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota is allotted 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this budget is brought to the floor as \npart of an annual ritual. The ritual in the Senate is to debate budget \npriorities. It is about making choices.\n  One hundred years from now we will all be gone. We will not be \naround, but historians can look back at this day, and by evaluating \nwhat we viewed to be important and what we wanted to spend money on, \nthey can evaluate what our priorities were. Did we feel health care was \na priority? Was education a priority? Were tax cuts a priority?\n  Let's look at the choices. This budget is brought to the floor \nsuggesting that a significant priority is to provide tax cuts, the \nbenefit of which go largely to upper-income folks in this country. The \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Robb, offers a different set of priorities. \nHe says: Let's not have these tax cut proposals move forward until and \nunless there is a prescription drug benefit added to the Medicare \nprogram.\n  I happen to think we ought not have tax cuts until we have made a \nsignificant payment toward reducing the Federal debt. I also believe, \nwith the Senator from Virginia, that we ought to have a benefit for \nprescription drugs in the Medicare program.\n  That is what this debate is about--it is about making choices. What \nare the right choices? I have held hearings in six States with the \nDemocratic Policy Committee on the issue of prescription drugs and \nMedicare. Let me tell Members about choices senior citizens are making. \nThe Senator from Virginia suggests we are about to make the wrong \nchoice unless we adopt his amendment. I agree with him. Let's make the \nright choice.\n  Let me describe the choices senior citizens are making. At a hearing \nin Dickinson, ND, Dr. James Baumgartner told me of a patient of his on \nMedicare who had surgery for breast cancer. He told her about the \nprescription drug she would have to take to reduce the chances of \nrecurrence of breast cancer. She said: Doctor, I can't do that. I don't \nhave the money to buy those prescription drugs. I'm just going to have \nto take my chances.\n  That is a choice. Not a good choice, but a forced choice because \nthere is no coverage for prescription drugs in Medicare.\n  How about the choice of buying food? At another hearing in Illinois, \na woman told me that where she goes to the grocery store, the pharmacy \ncounter is at the back end of the store. She must go to the rear of the \nstore to buy her prescription drugs, first, because only then will this \nolder woman know how much money she has left for food. She must buy her \nprescription drugs first because only then will she know what she can \nafford to pay for her food.\n  That is a choice she had to make.\n  At another hearing, a fellow told me that he pays $2,400 for \nmedicine. He is living on a fixed income in retirement. He said: I eat \nspaghetti sometimes 8 and 9 days in a row because I can't afford \nanything else, and still be able to pay for my prescription medicine.\n  That is a choice. Not a good one but a choice.\n  Or transplant recipients at a hearing in Illinois. We had two people \nwith heart transplants and one with a double lung transplant. One of \nthem said her prescription drugs costs $24,000 a year.\n  That person could probably make a choice of having the rejection of \nher transplants, but that is not much of a choice either, is it?\n  Or the woman in New York at the hearing I held. Connie, from Rye \nBrook, NY, has no prescription drug coverage and is forced to pay out-\nof-pocket costs she cannot afford. She said: I cut the pill in half and \ntake half the dosage so it lasts twice as long.\n  That, too, is a choice. Not a good choice.\n  All over the country, senior citizens are having to make these \nchoices. They are not good choices because we don't have a prescription \ndrug benefit in the Medicare program.\n  Senator Robb from Virginia has said in his amendment that we ought to \nmake it a priority to do the right thing. He is dead right. We have a \nresponsibility to add a prescription drug benefit to this Medicare \nprogram. This is the time and the place to make that choice. This vote \nwill determine what that choice is going to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nVirginia. Following his statement, I yield 5 minutes off of our 45 \nminutes, or whatever time is remaining, to Senator Kennedy from \nMassachusetts, and then 5 minutes on the bill for a total of 10 minutes \nto Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I first thank the Senator from Minnesota and \nthe Senator from North Dakota for their statements.\n  The bottom line is this particular provision in the resolution before \nthe Senate locks in as a matter of law a permanent tax cut that would \ngobble up all but 2 percent of the on-budget\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\nsurplus that is available. No matter how much we talk about the desire \nto do something in terms of prescription drugs for seniors, after the \nstories we hear about choosing between food and medicine, the bottom \nline is we lock in a tax cut and we take all the money that would \notherwise be available. Notwithstanding the expressed good intentions, \nit just won't work.\n  This is a matter of priorities.\n  I am delighted to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I express appreciation to Senator Robb \nfor his leadership in bringing the Senate to where we are this morning \nwith an opportunity to vote at 11 o'clock on whether we will put the \nseniors in this country ahead of an unwise tax cut at this time.\n  A budget is about national priorities. This amendment says to the \nAmerican people that prescription drug coverage under Medicare is as \nhigh a priority for the Senate as it is for the American people. This \namendment says health care for the elderly is more important than tax \ncuts for the wealthy.\n  Without this amendment, this Republican budget resolution has its \npriorities backwards. It says the first priority is tax cuts.\n  Yesterday, my friend and colleague, the distinguished chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, and I engaged in a discussion of this point. I \nasked the chairman if there was any guarantee in the budget \ninstructions that we will have prescription drugs on the floor by \nSeptember 31, which is effectively the last week of Congress. This is \nwhat my honorable friend said: No, there is no guarantee.\n  He went on to say that under the resolution a prescription drug bill \ncould be brought to the floor without a budget point of order being \nlodged against it after September 1.\n  That is an empty promise. Such a bill would still be subject to a \nfilibuster. It would still require 60 votes to even get to the floor if \nany Senator objected to its consideration. It would still have to be \ncalled up by the majority leader or offered as an amendment if there \nwas a suitable vehicle. If by some miracle it did get to the floor, an \nunlimited number of amendments could be offered, and it would still be \nsubject to a number of restrictions that I will discuss in a moment.\n  Compare that to the tax bill. It is required to be reported by the \nSenate Finance Committee no later than September 22--not permitted, \nrequired. It cannot be filibustered under Senate rules. Debate is \nlimited, in terms of the total hours, to 50 hours. It requires only 50 \nvotes to pass.\n\n  Of course, we know the majority party is absolutely committed to pass \na tax bill, but this budget resolution makes it abundantly clear there \nis no similar commitment to Medicare drug coverage. It is that plain \nand simple. There are two different standards, make no mistake about \nit--one standard for the tax, and an entirely different one for \nprescription drugs. I daresay the one on the prescription drugs is \nillustrated by the language of the resolution itself. It says that, in \nthe Senate, the budgetary limits may be adjusted and allocated and may \nbe revised by legislation reported by the Committee on Finance to \nprovide a prescription drug benefit. ``May be'' is optional. That is \ndifferent from where it says the Senate Finance Committee shall report \nto the Senate on the tax bill.\n  So we have not only the requirements that it ``may be'' rather than \n``shall'' with regard to prescription drugs, but we have the whole \nprocedure in the Senate that will permit filibusters in bringing it up, \nin debating it on the floor of the Senate. It will require 60 votes to \nbe able to get to a final resolution as compared to 50 votes for the \ntax bill. That is dramatically different.\n  What we are saying with the Robb amendment is let us pass the \nprescription drug bill first and then consider the tax cut afterwards.\n  In the remaining time, I want to mention one additional item. This \nparticular prescription drug proposal, as I mentioned, is a 3-year \nproposal, even if they are able to jump through the hoops that I have \nmentioned. Let's say we are able to consider the bill; let's say we are \nable to get the majority leader to call it up. It is very difficult to \nget any measure that we can amend, as we have seen over the course of \nthis time, but let's say we get the majority leader to call it up. And \nlet's say we have the 60 votes to get cloture. It is only for 3 years. \nBeyond that, you only get a continuation of that program if we find the \nsolvency of the Medicare fund, and there is going to be a complete \nrevamping of the Medicare program without using any general funds in \norder to stabilize the Medicare system. Here we find, again, the \nconditions that have to be realized before we are able to extend it.\n  The tax cut is permanent. Do we understand? The tax cut is permanent. \nIt is virtually automatic. Once this bill passes, there will be a \nrequirement that the tax bill be on the floor of the Senate in \nSeptember. But this prescription drug proposal has to jump through all \nthe hoops for the first 3 years, and even if we jump through the hoops \nfor the first 3 years, we have to go back through the hoops over the \nremaining 2 years. It is not permanent as is the tax bill.\n  Finally, I want to once again review about whom we are talking and \nwhat the costs are in terms of the prescription drugs. Yesterday I \ntried to point out, as has been mentioned here, a third of American \nseniors do not have any coverage and another third are losing it \ndramatically. In the last 3 years, we have seen a 25-percent drop in \ncoverage. If you take the drops in 1998 and 1999, it shows it is going \nright on down, and the costs of Medigap are going through the ceiling. \nThe HMOs are setting limits that make it difficult if not virtually \nimpossible for senior citizens to get the protections they earned.\n\n  Who are these senior citizens? Look at this chart here and we see \nwhat the income is for senior citizens, the retirees, the men and women \nwho fought in the World Wars, brought this country out of the \nDepression, and have made it the great Nation it is. Mr. President, 57 \npercent of them have incomes below $15,000; 21 percent below $25,000. \nThat is almost 80 percent of our senior citizens, those with incomes \nbelow $25,000. Then it continues on with only 7 percent at $50,000 or \nover. Many would say that is just middle income. Certainly, if you have \nsome children at school, $50,000 is considered to be middle income. We \nare talking about individuals who are hard pressed. These are men and \nwomen who made the country and now are dependent upon these \nprescription drugs in order to be able to survive.\n  Finally, we see in this chart what it is costing these elderly \ncitizens. For so many of the moderate-income beneficiaries, typical \ndrug costs versus their income--when you look at about 150 percent of \npoverty, that is almost the median income for senior citizens in this \ncountry. Look at this chart of what it costs for these routine \nillnesses and sicknesses of our elderly people. Every elderly person \neither is in danger of, or fears, or has osteoporosis and heart \ntrouble, high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Massachusetts 2 \nminutes off of the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. High blood pressure, heart disease. This is the typical \ncost in 1 year. This is the percent of their income they are paying: 20 \npercent, 26 percent, 31 percent, 40 percent, 240 percent of their \nincome.\n  This is just for prescription drugs. This is not for any other \nmedical expenses. That is more than they are spending, in many \ninstances, for their rent, their food, their clothing, and their other \nnecessities.\n  As we see this issue, there is nothing more important--preserving our \nSocial Security and preserving Medicare--than prescription drug \nprotection for senior citizens. I believe we ought to be able to shape \na program that will be universal, that will have the catastrophic as \nwell as the basic, and that will be affordable for individuals as well \nas the Federal Government.\n  What we are saying is let's debate that issue. Let's have an \nopportunity for the Senate to take action on that issue prior to the \ntime we go to these massive tax breaks. That is what this Robb \namendment is all about, putting our seniors first. I hope our \ncolleagues will join in supporting it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time this \nmorning that has been charged to the resolution, which I think is about \n7 minutes, not be counted to the 45 minutes of time on the side of the \nminority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I applaud my colleague from Massachusetts \nfor his tremendous leadership on this subject and for having just \npointed out the realities of the situation we find ourselves in on the \nfloor of the Senate. It is hard for anybody, rationally, to think about \nthe problems our seniors face in this country and then measure those \nproblems against what the Republican majority is presenting the country \nin its budget resolution.\n  I do not understand the rationale. I do not understand how they can \ncome to the floor prepared to guarantee the wealthiest Americans are \ngoing to get an extraordinary tax cut. That is absolutely cast in \nstone. That is going to happen. They saw to it in this budget \nresolution that there is a certainty as to the tax cut. But at the same \ntime they saw to it that there is no certainty with respect to senior \ncitizens having an opportunity that we take care of their needs for \nprescription drugs. Their budget pays lipservice to the critical issue \nof helping seniors afford medications that are prescribed by their \ndoctors.\n  If you measure this, the budget resolution provides a tax cut of over \n$150 billion over 5 years. Those tax cuts will require we pay $18 \nbillion more in interest payments. So when you add the interest \npayments to the tax cuts themselves, you have virtually the amount of \nthe entire non-Social Security surplus that is going to be taken off \nthe table and given back. But what is extraordinary is their focus. \nHere is a major problem. There is not one of us, as Senators, who does \nnot go home to our States and find countless numbers of citizens come \nto us and say: I cannot afford to buy drugs. I have to choose between \npaying rent or food and buying the prescription drugs I need to be \nhealthy.\n\n  We have citizens who are piling into buses going to Mexico and Canada \nto buy drugs, and yet ``our'' fixation, the fixation of the majority is \nto absolutely guarantee that the wealthiest people in America who have \ndone the best over the last 15 to 20 years are absolutely going to get \na tax cut, but the neediest people in America who need help with \nprescription drugs, who are paying thousands of dollars a year and are \non a fixed income and cannot afford it, have no guarantee in this \nbudget that they are going to have the Senate produce a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  There is some lipservice to $40 billion, but as my colleague from \nMassachusetts pointed out, there is no guarantee we are ever going to \nsee legislation.\n  Why is it that there is an absolute certainty as to the tax cut, an \nabsolute guarantee that people who have done the best are going to be \nhelped but people who are the most needy are not going to be helped? \nThe Senate ought to be committed to addressing the importance of \nworking families receiving this kind of help.\n  Why is that so important? It ought to be obvious to every Member of \nthe Senate. When Medicare was created in 1965, the biggest cost concern \nfor patients was a long stay in the hospital. Today, particularly \nbecause of the wonders of modern medicine and the biotechnology \nrevolution, patients who once needed surgery now can take drugs; \npatients who once needed extensive stays in hospitals are now able to \ntake wonder drugs of the modern age to lower cholesterol, lower blood \npressure, stabilize weak hearts, and do extraordinary things, but they \ncost a lot of money.\n  There has been a remarkable cost-shifting process. It used to be that \nif one went to the hospital to have an operation and stayed in the \nhospital, insurance took care of the stay. But now the hospital stay \nand the long period of convalescence has been supplanted by the miracle \ndrug, and the cost has shifted from the insurance to the individual, \nand most of these individuals are not able to afford it.\n  Take, for instance, a highly effective drug for hypertension. Sixty \npercent of the people over the age of 65 have hypertension. The fact \nis, highly effective drugs to control this typically cost about $40 a \nmonth. They greatly reduce the potential of stroke. A stroke, \nobviously, requires rehab time in hospitals and a variety of in-house \ncosts and services to the medical system. If we can prevent that from \nhappening, we save the system money. But if that cost shifting is to \nthe individual who is on a fixed income, they get stuck with the \nproblem.\n  Prescription drug expenditures in the United States--and I ask my \ncolleagues to focus on this--have grown at nearly double-digit rates \nalmost every year since 1980, with seniors' drug prices growing at four \ntimes the rate of inflation.\n  In 1997, prescription drug expenditures had the highest growth rate \nof all health and human services and supplies. There was a 14.1-percent \ngrowth in those costs versus the overall health care expenditure cost \nthat rose at only 4.8 percent--14.1 percent for prescription drugs; \nhealth care costs were generally 4 percent.\n  A lot of us will support the increase in the NIH funding because we \nwant to continue this revolution, but the fact is, it does not do a lot \nof good to put on the shelf drugs from the laboratory that are \ncompletely inaccessible to the average American who needs them because \nthey simply cannot afford them.\n  We are missing a historic opportunity in the Senate in terms of our \nlegislating process. The fact is, we have an opportunity to provide 14 \nmillion senior citizens, who lack prescription drug coverage, with that \ncoverage. That is, one-third of all Medicare beneficiaries have no \nprescription drug coverage at all.\n  Three-fifths of all Medicare beneficiaries lack dependable coverage, \nand one-quarter of all Medicare beneficiaries have retiree drug \ncoverage from their former employer, but the number of firms offering \nthat coverage has declined by 25 percent over the last 4 years.\n  In our state of Massachusetts, there are 982,934 Medicare \nbeneficiaries. 45% of these seniors lack prescription drug coverage. \n55% of these seniors have some form of coverage--but, the form that \ncoverage takes is often capped, costly, inadequate or all of the above.\n  Prescription drugs are the largest out-of-pocket health care cost for \nseniors in Massachusetts and throughout the country. More than 85% of \nMedicare beneficiaries take at least one prescription medicine, and the \naverage beneficiary fills 18 prescriptions per year. The average annual \nprescription drug cost for Medicare beneficiaries will reach $1,100 \nthis year. Even beneficiaries with some drug coverage incur high out-\nof-pocket spending, an average of $700 per year. Increasing costs \ncoupled with the lack of coverage force 1 out of 8 seniors in our \ncountry to choose between buying food and medicine.\n  Unless we act, we can only expect these numbers to increase. \nAmericans aged 85 and older represent the fastest growing segment of \nthe population, with expected growth from 4 million people today to 19 \nmillion people by 2050. We cannot afford to allow this problem to \ncontinue.\n  Medicare was enacted in 1965 as a promise to the American people \nthat, in exchange for their years of hard work and service to our \ncountry, their health care would be protected in their golden years. \nMr. President, it is past time we deliver on that promise.\n  My hope is that we will adopt the Robb amendment. I congratulate the \nSenator from Virginia for bringing this amendment to the floor. It \nrequires that we find some methodology by which we will guarantee that \nCongress will pass a prescription drug program. It seems to me it is as \nimperative we do that as give a tax cut, considering the fact that the \nFederal tax burden is the lowest it has been in 20 years. Let's get our \npriorities straight and do what is correct.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the scheduled \nvotes for 11 a.m. today now begin at 10:45 a.m., under the same terms \nas previously agreed to, and that at 10:45 a.m., the majority manager \nbe recognized to make a point of order and then\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\nyield an additional 4 minutes to the minority side from the majority's \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that will give the minority 25 \nminutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. This has been checked with Senator Lautenberg, and we on \nthe minority side agree to this unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to address the underlying amendment \noffered by the Senator from Virginia and his colleagues which links our \nefforts to provide affordable access to outpatient prescription drugs \nfor seniors to the issue of tax relief. I believe this amendment is \nunnecessary.\n  One of the highest priorities in the Republican-sponsored budget is \nto provide outpatient prescription drug coverage for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, something in which I, as a physician who has taken care \nof thousands of Medicare beneficiaries--individuals with disabilities \nand seniors--and my colleagues strongly believe is critical to the \nhealth care security of these beneficiaries. They need and deserve \naffordable access to prescription drugs, and that is an important part \nof our agenda.\n  We reduce the tax burden on hard-working Americans who today are \nbeing taxed more than at any time in the peacetime history of this \ncountry.\n  I simply cannot and will not support any amendment that pits these \ntwo goals, which are inherent and integral parts of this budget, \nagainst one another. It is unnecessary, and it is irresponsible. We can \ndo both in our budget and we provide the means to do so.\n  It is a fascinating time in our history in terms of the evolution of \nhealth care. We are almost where we were in the early 1960s in our \ndiscussion of prescription drug coverage. Before Medicare, we did not \nhave coverage for hospitals and physician services. In the early 1960s, \nwe had the opportunity to shape health care security for seniors, and \nlater for individuals with disabilities, in a way that has been very \nbeneficial. I say that as a health care provider who has been on the \nfrontline.\n\n  In large part as a product of the tremendous research and development \nand the discovery of new drugs, and the application of those drugs in \nrecent years, it is time that we in this Congress address Medicare for \nseniors in a modernized way. ``In a modernized way'' means that we must \nbring prescription drugs into Medicare in an integrated fashion to \ndeliver a full set of comprehensive benefits to beneficiaries. That is \nwhy in this budget we address modernizing Medicare and setting aside \n$40 billion to strengthen the program and include an outpatient \nprescription drug benefit.\n  But something we do that is critical, that is not being addressed by \nthese freestanding drug bills that are being proposed--both in the \nHouse and in the Senate--is that we link that inclusion of prescription \ndrug coverage to the overall modernization of the Medicare system.\n  Although this is a budget discussion, it is not just a matter of only \ndollars and cents. We are talking about health care security for our \nseniors. The physician, the hospital, the health care facility, and the \nprescription drugs all must be a part of one seamless health care \ndelivery program.\n  As good as Medicare is today, it is not as good as most people think \nit is, for lots of different reasons.\n  No. 1, it is a fragmented system. We have a Part A trust fund and a \nPart B trust fund. We have outpatient care and we have inpatient care. \nIt is incomplete. The benefit package is outdated. There is even very \nlittle in the way of preventive services as part of Medicare today, \nservices that seniors desperately need.\n  Preventative care, which is in private health care plans, has \nproliferated. We all know how important it is. Yet there is almost none \nof that in Medicare today.\n  Many people think Medicare is going to take care of our seniors later \nin their lives. It is a fact, of every dollar that is spent for a \nsenior's health care, if you put it all together, only 53 cents is paid \nfor by Medicare. The other 47 cents, that is paid for by that senior or \nthat individual with the disability who has to reach out, scrape \naround, get another insurance policy, pay out of pocket, or ask for \nfree care in order to cover health care expenses. We can do better.\n  Thus, we are absolutely committed to the principle of, yes, including \nprescription drugs into the system, but doing it in such a way that we \ncan improve and modernize Medicare as the whole, to be a seamless \nsystem in the provision of high-quality care for our seniors.\n  I believe it is irresponsible--when you have a Medicare program that \nis threatened in terms of long-term solvency, when you look at deficits \nin cash-flow, when you look at the huge demographic shift that will be \noccurring with the baby boomers coming through the system, with a \ndoubling of the number of seniors over the next 30 years, and a \nlessening of the people who are paying into the system--it is \nirresponsible, unless you address the overall health care system, to \ntake a benefit, a very expensive benefit, and simply set it on top of a \nsystem that cannot be sustained long term. It is deceptive. It is just \nnot right. Our seniors deserve better.\n  Thus, instead of trying to link tax relief to improving health care \nfor our seniors, what we Republicans believe--expressed in this \nbudget--is that the appropriate linkage is providing prescription drugs \nin an affordable way, but linking it inextricably to the modernization \nof the overall Medicare system. That is the most prudent, short-term \nand long-term approach to guarantee health care security for our \nseniors.\n  The principles of prescription drug coverage are, in my mind, pretty \nsimple. I think all of us must recognize that a new drug benefit should \nnot be modeled on Medicare's traditional, out-of-date delivery model. \nWe need a new model. The President's plan does not change the system at \nall, but instead places more financial burdens on an already fragile \nprogram, while at the same time placing Medicare beneficiaries' health \nat risk.\n\n  No. 2, such a benefit should be voluntary. Most would agree on both \nsides of the aisle including the President that it must be accessible \nto all. At the same time, we should not do anything that forces people \ninto HMOs. We should not do anything that forces seniors today, who \nalready have prescription drug coverage, to give up what they have. We \nshould not force seniors today, who are already paying a certain amount \nfor prescription drug coverage, to pay more than what they pay today.\n  The third principle is--this is important--something we have the \nresponsibility to address in the short-term and the long-term; that is, \nthat price controls in prescription drugs will not work. They will \ndestroy the opportunity to develop that new drug, that new \nprescription, that new agent that can be lifesaving, that can treat \nillness and prevent disease. Price controls will wipe out drug \ninnovation.\n  I believe those three principles must be a part of the drug package \nthat we assimilate into a modernized Medicare system. Thus, the long-\nterm goal--again, this linkage in this amendment of tax relief, or \nholding one hostage for the other--is not the right thing to do for our \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  For the 35 million seniors and 5 million individuals with \ndisabilities who are out there, why hold them hostage? Why not go to \nthe underlying budget proposal, which I believe has the more \nresponsible link; and that is, yes, prescription drug coverage--it has \nto be there--it is health care security but linking it to \nmodernization, reform of our Medicare system. That should be our long-\nterm goal.\n  Prescription drug coverage should be brought into the system \nalongside physician services, hospital services, facilities services, \nmedical devices where you can consider them all, not as some \nfreestanding plan saying drugs are over there. Those drugs are just as \nimportant as that surgical knife that I once wielded. We need a \nseamless system, a coordinated care approach.\n  On this issue, again, we are talking about the budget. But it is \nimportant for all of our colleagues to understand\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\nthis linkage that I believe is so important of bringing prescription \ndrugs in, because it is this whole range of tools that physicians and \nhealth care providers need in order to guarantee affordable high-\nquality care.\n  Now is not the time to institutionalize freestanding plans which \nresult in further fragmentation. If we pass a freestanding plan, it is \nlikely to result in further fragmentation of the system when we need \nseamless, coordinated care.\n  We have moved today, in the year 2000, towards disease management and \ncoordinated delivery of health care. We no longer operate under a model \nwhere a surgical procedure is performed and then the patient is sent to \nanother doctor to treat the headache, and to another doctor to give a \ndevice or a pacemaker. We want that seamless management. That is why \nprescription drugs must be made a part of the overall, comprehensive \nreform of our Medicare system.\n  Less than 10 years ago, the Medicare trustees estimated that the \nMedicare Part A Trust Fund, otherwise known as the Hospital Insurance \nTrust Fund, would be insolvent in 1999. Since then, the Trustees' \nsolvency estimates of the Part A Trust Fund have fluctuated \ntremendously. As little as five years ago the Part A Trust Fund was \nexpected to be depleted by 2002. In 1996 and 1997, insolvency was \nestimated in the year 2001, in 1998, it was projected for 2008, in 1999 \nfor 2015, and in the year 2000, Medicare bankruptcy is projected for \n2023. It might seem strange that insolvency dates could fluctuate so \ndramatically--a 21-year range--over a 5-year period. The reason for \nthis is simple. The Medicare Trustees' reports are estimates--estimates \nbased on assumptions regarding growth in expenditures in the Medicare \nprogram, economy, life expectancy, and the like, which are continually \nchanging. Therefore, any interpretation of these reports must be made \nwith the understanding that as early as the following year, program \ninsolvency estimates may look dramatically different. History has shown \nus as much.\n  Equally important, the definition of ``solvency'' itself calls for \nfurther examination. The historic concept of Medicare's solvency is one \nthat has been partially and inappropriately borrowed from Social \nSecurity and has never fully reflected the fiscal integrity of the \nMedicare program. Solvency in Medicare is not the same as solvency in \nSocial Security. The Social Security Trust Funds are funded exclusively \nthrough payroll taxes, so it is relatively easy to determine when \nSocial Security expenditures are projected to exceed income.\n  Medicare, however, is funded by a combination of payroll taxes, \ngeneral revenue, and beneficiary premiums, divided between two separate \ntrust funds--Part A and Part B. Additionally, the ratio of these \nrevenue streams has changed over time such that a greater portion of \nMedicare expenses is now paid by general revenues through the Part B \nTrust Fund, and a relatively smaller portion is paid by payroll taxes \nand beneficiary premiums--than was originally intended when the program \nwas first enacted. The payroll tax supporting the Social Security Trust \nFunds is limited both by its rate and the wage base on which that rate \nis applied. Medicare's funding has an unlimited taxable wage base and \ntherefore no limit on the maximum tax. The Part A Trust Fund is funded \nby a payroll tax of 1.45 percent on all earnings in covered employment \nand 2.9 percent for the self employed. In sum, the sources of funding \nfor the Medicare program are numerous, unlimited and divided among \ntrust funds, making the true test for program solvency much more \ncomplicated than Social Security.\n\n  Today, almost equal numbers of seniors and disabled, about 39 million \ntotal, are enrolled in both Parts A and B of the program. Part B \nspending represents nearly 40 percent of total program expenditures and \nthat number will increase significantly, reaching 50 percent by 2020, \nas Part B spending continues to grow at twice the rate of Part A. So \nwhy is it that only 60 percent of program spending--the Part A Trust \nFund only--is used to determine the financial health of Medicare as a \nwhole?\n  Actually, the notion of Part A ``solvency'', or rather \n``insolvency'', has been used as political leverage to shift more \nMedicare financing to Part B and draw on general revenues. This not \nonly fundamentally alters the way the Part A Trust Fund is financed by \nmoving away from payroll financing toward a formal commitment of future \ngeneral fund revenues, but also sends a false sense of security to the \nAmerican public regarding the true financial health of the program.\n  An example, in is the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, where Congress \npassed legislation that shifted a major portion of home health \nexpenditures--approximately $80 billion--from Part A to Part B. By \ndoing so, the fiction of Part A Trust Fund ``solvency'' was extended \nfrom 2002 to 2008. However, this shift increased the draw on general \nrevenues tremendously. Worse, it continued to mask the financial \ninstability of the program and made it easier to allow fiscal \nimbalances to go unnoticed.\n  In addition, although insolvency dates are often used to determine \nwhen the Part A Trust Fund can no longer sustain the program, there is \nanother important element that must not be overlooked--that is trust \nfund assets. Long before the insolvency date is reached, the Part A \nTrust Fund must draw upon its assets to continue to fund the program. \nThese assets are really a claim on the Treasury. When the trust fund \nruns a cash deficit, like the Part A Trust Fund has been doing since \n1992, these securities are redeemed to pay for program costs. For \ninstance, this year the Medicare Trustees Report indicates that the \nPart A Trust Fund will remain solvent until 2023. This only occurs, \nhowever, because securities are redeemed in order to pay for program \ncosts, beginning in 2015. The reality is in 2015, the Part A Trust Fund \nwill begin a deficit again where program expenditures will exceed \nincome. To redeem the securities necessary to keep the program solvent \nuntil 2023, the government as a whole must come up with the cash by \neither increasing taxes, reducing spending or borrowing from the \npublic. This is all in light of the fact that any small shift in the \neconomy, program expenditures or health care costs could greatly affect \nnot only the date in which the program falls into a cash deficit, but \nalso when insolvency is reached.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reports that Medicare spending will \ngrow at an annual average rate of 7.1 percent over the next 10 years. \nThe Medicare Trustees report highlights the 38 percent growth in the \nPart B trust fund over the past 5 years, with these growth rates \nexpected to continue and even increase. Clearly, addressing \nthe financial health of the Medicare program by looking at \napproximately one-half of the total program expenditures is not only \nmisleading, but also a misrepresentation of the programs financial \nviability--to our nation's Medicare beneficiaries and the public at \nlarge.\n\n  Even the Medicare Trustees acknowledge that future operations of the \nPart A Trust Fund will be very sensitive to future economic, \ndemographic, and health cost trends and could differ substantially from \n2023 insolvency projections estimated this year. Medicare has never had \na trust fund balance at the beginning of any year that could cover much \nmore than one year's worth of expenditures. In 1996, the program was \nable to fund a little more than one year's worth of expenditures, the \nhighest ratio yet, but in 1983 the Part A Trust Fund would have only \nbeen able to fund one-fifth of Medicare program expenditures--and in \n1999 only 92%.\n  You see, we can continue to kid ourselves into believing that \nMedicare is financially stable. We can address only a fraction of the \nprogram and shift numbers until the program looks solvent on paper. But \nthe truth is the Medicare program is in great financial trouble and \nfast approaching a financial crisis. Without addressing Medicare's \nfundamental programmatic and financial problems, combined with the huge \ndemographic shift of baby boomers in a decade, Medicare will go \nbankrupt at the expense of Americans who need and deserve quality, \naffordable health care. As we continue to discuss the addition of a new \nentitlement to Medicare--outpatient prescription drugs--I urge my \ncolleagues to carefully consider the fragile financial condition the \nprogram is in.\n  I believe there is consensus among many of us here this morning--much \nof which has been heard over the last twenty four hours--to include an \noutpatient prescription drug benefit in the\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\nMedicare program this year. I agree completely. More than ever, as a \nphysician, I understand the need to ensure our nation's seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities have access to life-saving drugs. But I \nalso believe that we all have a responsibility to ensure that Medicare \nis viable and can be sustained with any new benefit that is added. I \nwant to be able to guarantee my fellow Tennesseans and every Medicare \nbeneficiary health care security. This is not an easy task--and it is \ntempting to avoid the difficult discussions and decisions that must be \nmade to address the overall programmatic and financial health of \nMedicare. But we owe it to our grandmothers and grandfathers, our \nchildren and even ourselves to be responsible in developing an \noutpatient prescription drug benefit to ensure Medicare will be \navailable now and well into the future.\n  I thank the chairman for bringing forth a budget that sets aside \nfunding specifically for Medicare and outpatient prescription drugs. \nAnd again I reiterate that the amendment put forth by Senator Robb and \nhis Democratic colleagues is unnecessary. The Republican-supported \nbudget resolution sets aside $40 billion over the next 5 years for \nMedicare and the inclusion of an outpatient prescription drug benefit. \nIn addition, it also provides relief to hard-working Americans who are \nbeing taxed at the highest rate in the peacetime history of this \ncountry. Both are high priorities--they are not mutually exclusive. We \nshould not be pitting the health of our nation's Medicare beneficiaries \nagainst tax relief. It is unfair and it is irresponsible to do so. Both \nare critical to this budget and can be done--and we will continue to \nwork hard to reach these important goals.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All the majority's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. May I yield myself 3 more minutes?\n  Mr. REID. As long as we vote at 10:48.\n  Mr. FRIST. I yield myself 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no more time to yield.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Tennessee, we have 5 speakers to \ntake up our time. We have no more time. If he wants to extend the time \nto vote, that is fine with me. That would be 10:48.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have 10 minutes left on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining on the majority \nside.\n  The vote is set for 10:45.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding me 5 \nminutes.\n  It is interesting to hear discussion and debate in the Congress on \nthe question of prescription drugs for seniors and the Medicare \nprogram. There is no one in this Congress I know who is going to come \nto the floor of the Senate and say: I am opposed to giving seniors \nprescription drugs. That is not the issue. I think there is almost \nunanimous agreement by everyone in the Congress that prescription drugs \ntoday are as important as a hospital bed was in 1965 when the Medicare \nprogram was first established.\n  In that period of time, Members of Congress said: We have to pay for \nseniors' hospital stays, and we have to pay for their doctors' \ntreatment. But at that time, prescription drugs was not that big of a \ndeal in the sense of being something that helped people, in fact, stay \nout of hospitals and be cured of what ailed them in medical terms.\n  Today, it is quite different. Today, prescription drugs keep people \nout of hospitals as well as cure them from diseases that formerly were \nthought to be incurable. The question today is not whether Medicare, \nwhich serves almost 40 million seniors, should cover prescription \ndrugs. The answer is, of course, it should. The question is, How do we \ngo about doing it and when do we do it? That is what the subject of \nthis debate is all about.\n  There are some on the Democratic side who make the point with the \nRobb amendment today that we should add prescription drugs to Medicare \nbefore we do tax cuts that are excessive. Excessive tax cuts? What is \nexcessive? One hundred fifty billion over 10 years? How about $25 \nbillion over 10 years? Is that excessive? The point made by many of my \nDemocratic colleagues is, do prescription drugs before you do excessive \ntax cuts.\n\n  On the other hand, Republican colleagues take the approach, let's do \nprescription drugs but make sure we do reform of the program at the \nsame time. In other words, don't put the cart before the horse, as so \nmany of my Republican colleagues have said.\n  I share the concern that just adding prescription drugs to a program \nthat last year spent $7 billion more than we took in is certainly not \nhelping the solvency of the Medicare plan. Does it make people feel \ngood about adding prescription drugs? Yes? But does it do anything to \nfix a program that spent $7 billion more than it took in? It doesn't do \nthat at all. In fact, it makes it more difficult for the program to \nprovide the benefits that are necessary for our seniors.\n  The latest analysis by the Medicare trustees says the program is OK \nuntil the year 2023. Tell that to the nursing homes. Tell them it is \nall right that they are being cut and put into bankruptcy and put out \nof business. Tell the rural hospitals of America the program is in \ngreat shape, when many of them, in fact, do not get enough money to \nstay open and treat the Medicare patients we are talking about. Tell \nthe home nursing facilities that are going bankrupt and being put out \nof business: The program is fine; don't worry.\n  The truth is, the trustees looked only at Part A. They did not look \nat Part B, which is growing at almost 40 percent annually and is \nexpected to increase even further.\n  It is absolutely clear that we make a serious mistake if we do one \nwithout the other. As Senator Moynihan, ranking Democrat on the Finance \nCommittee said:\n\n       Medicare reform is the price you must pay for adding \n     prescription drugs to the program.\n\n  That makes a lot of sense. If we do the dessert before we do the \nspinach, no one is going to be around to eat the spinach. We are all \ngoing to issue a press release and say: We added prescription drugs; \nisn't that a great thing?\n  It is the right thing to do, if we do it in the context of reforming \nthe program and taking it out of the 1960s and bringing it into the \n21st century.\n  Some say: Just add more money to the program and we will fix it. I \nhave drawn the analogy that it is like adding more gasoline to a 1965 \nautomobile. It is still going to run like an old car.\n  The fundamental problem we have is to reform the program, the \ndelivery system. We cannot continue to micromanage Medicare with \n133,000 pages of regulations, three times more than the IRS, where \nevery time someone wants to do something differently, they have to come \nto Washington and get an act of Congress to add a treatment or to \nsubtract a treatment.\n  I conclude by saying, yes, I am for prescription drugs. Yes, we agree \non the amount that needs to be spent. But, yes, we should also do it in \nthe context of reforming the program.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will make a few points about the budget \nresolution.\n  First of all, I am quite concerned that the budget fails to set the \nright priorities. At least when we listen to the American people as to \nwhat their priorities are, this budget resolution before us does not \nfit, does not manage.\n  Once again, this budget resolution emphasizes massive tax cuts at the \nexpense of most everything else. I don't think that is where most \nAmericans are. It might not be readily apparent that this budget \nresolution emphasizes massive tax cuts. For example, last year's budget \nprovided for a tax cut of $792 billion. This year's provides for a tax \ncut of only $150 billion. So at first glance, one might say the tax cut \nthis year is a lot less than one-fifth of the one proposed last year \nand the one that was rejected last year. But that is only at first \nglance. One has to compare not apples with oranges but apples with \napples.\n  Last year's budget was based on 10-year projections; this year's is \nbased on 5-year projections. So if you compare apples with apples, by \nlooking at the 5-year projections, you see that last\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\nyear's budget resolution would have cut taxes by $156 billion, almost \nprecisely the same as this year's budget resolution. In other words, it \nis the same big tax cut, when extended out 10 years as opposed to five. \nIn fact, 98 percent of the projected on-budget surpluses in this budget \nresolution would be used for tax cuts. But the authors of the \nresolution fiddled with the accounting periods to make it look a little \nbit smaller.\n  I don't buy it. I think that is wrong. We should assume that a tax \ncut that has virtually the same effect over 5 years also would have \nvirtually the same effect over 10 years. Therefore, it is the same old, \nexcessive, unpopular, proposal in a new flashy suit, the one the \nAmerican people rejected last year. Once they know what is in this \nbudget resolution, I am sure they will have the same feeling; that is, \nnot be in favor of it. It is the wrong priority. In other words, this \nis a tax cut of about $800 billion over 10 years which will make \nimpossible other popular American priorities.\n  Don't get me wrong. I believe there is room for a reasonable tax cut. \nI think most Americans think there is room for a reasonable tax cut. \nBut it should be targeted and it should be one that provides relief to \nworking families, people who really need the help. The budget \nresolution must leave room for other national priorities.\n  In particular, we must take this wonderful opportunity we have to \nreduce the national debt. I don't know how many times we are going to \nhave this opportunity again. We have it today with a very prosperous \neconomy and with large projected budget surpluses. We should take \nadvantage of this opportunity that we have during this year, and the \nnext couple of years, to dramatically reduce our approximately $7 \ntrillion national debt. That should be a higher priority. It is not a \nhigh priority in this budget resolution.\n  The budget resolution should also clearly provide for full \nprescription drug coverage, as the Robb amendment would do. \nPrescription drugs are more effective than ever before in maintaining \nhealth. They are also much more expensive, leaving many seniors with a \nchoice of either buying groceries or paying for prescriptions.\n  I have seen it, Mr. President. I have worked at a drugstore, and I \nhave seen seniors faced with this choice. It is a very unhappy sight. \nOur elderly need help now. We have heard comments from Senators who \nsay, shouldn't prescription drug coverage be folded into general \nMedicare reform? Ideally, it should be, but we have to do the best we \ncan with what we have. I say it is important because seniors need help \nnow. We can't wait for an abstraction of help in the future. We need it \nnow. Clearly, we should enact prescription drug benefits this year.\n  While seniors make up 12 percent of our Nation's population, they \naccount for only about 30 percent of all prescription drug spending. \nTwelve percent of our population are seniors, but they account for 30 \npercent of all drug spending. And while about a third of seniors lack \ndrug coverage overall, that number increases to nearly 50 percent in \nrural areas. Thirty percent of Americans do not have coverage for \nprescription drugs, overall, in America. In rural America, it is closer \nto 50 percent.\n  In Montana, there is very little employer-provided coverage. \nMedigap--the program which is insurance coverage to pay for the \ndifference between Medicare and the cost--coverage is much too \nexpensive in America, particularly in Montana, and there is no Medicare \nmanaged care in Montana. That is right. Until January of this year, my \nState of Montana had only one Medicare HMO, providing quality care and \ndrug coverage to about 2,600 seniors in Billings, MT. But now that plan \nhas pulled out, leaving those seniors without a drug benefit. So we \nhave no managed care Medicare program in Montana because it is too \nexpensive. We don't have the population to provide it. Our seniors are \nbeing left out in the cold. In my mind, providing seniors with a \nprescription drug benefit is a top priority, and it should be part of \nthis budget resolution.\n  I also want to make a point about the so-called marriage penalty. I \nsupport the Hutchison amendment. I agree that, as that amendment says, \nwe should pass legislation which begins to reduce the marriage penalty. \nBut I would like to add a word of caution.\n  Listening to some of the debate here, it almost sounds as if the \nmajority is for marriage and that anyone who questions their proposal \nis against marriage. Nothing could be further from the truth. Marriage \nis a great institution; I am all for it. It is one of the most \nwonderful institutions devised by the human race. But the proposal \nbefore us and the challenge before us is not quite as simple as some \nmight like it to be. After all, the so-called marriage penalty is not \nsomething that was intentionally cooked up to penalize married people \nand reward sinners. Rather, it is an unintended offshoot of some very \ndifficult, complex decisions that have to be made about our tax system, \nsuch as how to tax individuals compared with married couples, which is \nnot an easy question to answer, and how to tax married couples who have \na different distribution of income between spouses. Sometimes that is \ndifficult to do.\n  We have wrestled with this problem since virtually the inception of \nthe Tax Code. The current system, which sets the ``break points''--that \nis, 15 percent, 21 percent, 28 percent--and the various brackets for \nindividuals at about 60 percent of those for couples filing joint \nreturns, was established in 1969 in the tax reform bill signed by \nPresident Nixon. So the basic concept we have was enacted in 1969, \nagain, and signed in by President Nixon.\n\n  It was set in response to a very legitimate concern at that time. \nThat concern was that previous rates were unfair to individuals. So the \ncurrent system, where we have to correct the mistake that was biased \nagainst individuals, now is the one we are dealing with to make sure \nmarrieds are treated fairly as well.\n  There is no easy, pat solution to this problem that doesn't create \nadditional problems. For example, it is mathematically impossible to \nhave a neutral marriage tax--or it is neutral to all married couples if \nat the same time we want a progressive tax system--and we do--and if at \nthe same time we want all married couples who have the same total \nmarried income to be taxed equally, as we do. It is mathematically \nimpossible to accomplish those objectives altogether. I could insert \nproof of that into the Record. That is to say, when you try to adjust \nthe rates, you are going to cause inequities elsewhere, as to what the \ntaxes might be on marrieds versus individuals. It is not an easy thing \nto do.\n  In fact, the bill reported by the Finance Committee does not \neliminate the marriage penalty; it merely reduces the penalty. At the \nsame time, over half of the total relief the bill reported out by the \nFinance Committee goes to married couples who don't pay any marriage \npenalty today whatsoever.\n  This bill is somewhat a marriage penalty relief bill, but the \nDemocratic alternative proposed by the Finance Committee, particularly \nby our ranking member, Senator Moynihan, is a better approach. Why? \nFirst of all, it is less costly and much more targeted. It targets \nevery dollar to the couples who actually are facing a marriage penalty. \nIn other words, it is more targeted, in my judgment, and more \nresponsible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Might I have 1 more minute?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The time is already allocated. I am sorry. We owe our \nfriends on the other side a couple minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Apropos the discussion we just had about 15 minutes ago.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We had a good advantage of time here, so if the \nSenator might wrap it up.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How about 30 seconds?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. OK.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. To sum up, the budget resolution before us does not \nreflect the priorities of the American people. That is clear. The \nAmerican people do not want 98 percent of the surplus to be allocated \nto tax cuts. I daresay the majority of Americans want a large part of \nit targeted to debt relief, paying off the national debt, something \ntargeted for a marriage penalty, something targeted for prescription \ndrugs, and just to do things right, not make a political statement.\n  I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 4\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator \nfrom Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, budgets aren't just about charts and graphs \nand cold figures on a sheet of paper. Budgets are about the hopes and \naspirations of the American people and our core values. In my view, if \nthe Senate passes the Robb amendment this morning, it will send a \nmessage to the millions of senior citizens and families across this \ncountry that their hope of prescription drug coverage under Medicare is \na priority for the Senate.\n\n  If the Senate passes the Robb amendment, it will be a chance to build \non the progress that was made on the prescription drug issue in the \nBudget Committee. I particularly thank my colleagues, Senator Snowe and \nSenator Smith. In the Budget Committee, we were able to lock in a hard \nfigure of $40 billion to start this prescription drug program.\n  Just as important, in the Budget Committee, there is a stipulation \nthat if the Finance Committee doesn't act on the prescription drug \nissue on or about September 1 of this year, it is possible for any \nMember of this Senate, without points of order, to come directly to the \nfloor. So we have been able to register our commitment behind the \nurgency of prescription drug coverage for older people.\n  The Robb amendment recognizes that the revolution in modern health \ncare has bypassed the Medicare program. Every major private sector \nplayer in the health care field understands that pharmaceuticals are \nessential because they help to keep people well. Medicare Part A, on \nthe other hand, will pay thousands of dollars for senior citizens' \nhospital bills, but Medicare Part B will not pay for outpatient \nprescription drug coverage to help older people stay well.\n  So that is why this is so important to the American people, and the \nRobb amendment says to all of those senior citizens who are breaking \ntheir pills in half because they can't afford their medicine or taking \ntwo pills when they ought to be taking three, who ought to be taking a \ndrug such as Lipitor to deal with cholesterol and blood pressure and \ncan't afford it, we have heard that, we understand how important this \ncoverage is to older people.\n  If we pass the Robb amendment, it will not be possible for Members of \nthis body to get to the end of the session and then say, gee, there \njust wasn't time to deal with this issue that is so important to \nseniors and families.\n  This amendment is critical to the hopes and aspirations of the \nAmerican people. They are asking that prescription drug coverage be \nadded to this program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise on an issue of critical \nimportance to seniors in Maryland and across the United States. That \nissue is the need for Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.\n  ``Honor your father and mother'' is not only a good commandment to \nlive by, it is a good public policy to govern by. It should be a \npriority not only in the federal law books, but in the federal \ncheckbook. And I believe that providing a Medicare drug benefit is a \nperfect way of honoring our fathers and mothers. That is why I'm proud \nto stand in support of Senator Robb's amendment, which says that a \nMedicare drug benefit is more important than tax cuts.\n  The Medicare Program has been a tremendous success story. It has \nreduced poverty among the elderly by almost two-thirds since it was \ncreated in 1965. But the world has changed in the last 35 years. In \n1965, people feared the costs of hospitalization. One major illness, \nwhich years ago often resulted in a hospital stay of several weeks or \neven months, could bankrupt many families. Today, people fear the costs \nof chronic care. They need help with the costs of prescription drugs \nthat control chronic conditions and keep people out of the hospital. \nMany of these life-saving medicines are the result of American medical \nscience and breakthroughs made in this country. I feel very strongly \nthat all Americans should have access to those breakthroughs. We must \nact now to ensure that they do.\n  In my home state of Maryland, almost 560,000 seniors rely on \nMedicare. That number is likely to increase to more than 1 million \npeople by the year 2025. Unfortunately, 3 in every 4 of those seniors \ndoes not have decent, dependable private sector drug coverage today. At \nleast one-third don't have any drug coverage at all, and their options \nfor getting coverage are limited. Joining a Medicare HMO is an option \nfor some, but not for seniors in the 17 rural counties of my state. And \nthe other alternative, which is buying a Medigap policy, is expensive. \nThe monthly premium for a policy with drug benefits averages about $136 \nnationwide, which means that Medigap policies are out of reach for \nmany.\n  One of the most important things I do as a United States Senator is \nlisten to the people and the stories of their lives. And the problems \npeople are having getting the drugs they need is something I've heard a \nlot about lately. In the last 6 months, I've gotten more than 200 \nletters and literally thousands of telephone calls from seniors and \ntheir families about the hardships that the high cost of prescription \ndrugs and lack of insurance coverage are causing them. For example, an \n84 year old woman from the Eastern Shore who is blind and has diabetes \ntold me that she takes 11 medicines every day and is spending $275 of \nher $800 monthly income on prescription drugs. The son of a 91 year old \nwoman wrote me to say that his mother spends one-third of her income on \nher medications, and often takes her daily medicine every other day to \nmake it last longer. This is simply unacceptable. Prescription \nmedicines are now an essential part of modern medicine, and are an \nessential thread that must be woven into the safety net for seniors.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Daschle, Senate Democrats have \ncome together to agree on basic principles that should serve as a \nblueprint for action. We have agreed that a Medicare drug benefit \nshould be:\n  1. Voluntary: Medicare beneficiaries who now have dependable, \naffordable prescription drug coverage should be able to stick with what \nthey've got.\n  2. Accessible: A hallmark of Medicare is that all beneficiaries have \naccess to dependable health care. The same should hold true of a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  3. Meaningful: A Medicare drug benefit should make a difference in \nthe lives of seniors by helping protect them from excessive out-of-\npocket costs.\n  4. Affordable: The benefit should be affordable both for \nbeneficiaries and for the Medicare program. Medicare should contribute \nenough toward the prescription drug premium to make it affordable and \nattractive for all beneficiaries and to ensure the viability of the \nbenefit. Low-income beneficiaries should receive extra help with \nprescription drug premiums and cost sharing.\n  This amendment simply says that we must provide a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit before we provide tax cuts. And I think that \nshows that we've got our priorities in the right order. The \nconstituents who have written and called me to ask why they or their \nparents can't get the medicines they need don't want to hear about a \ntax cut. They want to hear that Medicare covers prescription drugs. \nThat's why I will continue to fight to make access to prescription \nmedicines a reality for seniors in Maryland and across the nation, and \nwhy I urge my colleagues to join me in support of Senator Robb's \namendment. Thank you.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending Robb \namendment to prevent the Majority from spending almost all of the non-\nSocial Security surplus on tax breaks instead of prescription drug \ncoverage for senior citizens.\n  Ensuring that older Americans have access to prescription drugs \nshould be one of our top priorities, but the Majority is clearly more \ninterested in enacting deep and unwarranted tax cuts. The Majority's FY \n2001 Budget Resolution includes a deadline for consideration of their \ntax cut plan, but no date is set for establishing a prescription drug \nbenefit. With this amendment, we would clarify that funding a \nprescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries will be given a \nhigher priority than tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy.\n  Prescription medication is now essential to quality medical care, but \nmany senior citizens cannot afford the\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\nmedicine they need because Medicare does not cover the cost of \nprescription drugs. When Medicare was created, it was modeled after a \nhealth care delivery system focused on inpatient hospital care. Today, \ndrugs are as important as a hospital bed was in 1965, but over 13 \nmillion seniors have absolutely no assistance covering the cost of \nprescription medication. Medicare must be updated to include a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Seniors need prescription drug coverage more than the average citizen \nbecause they generally live on fixed incomes and suffer from chronic \ndiseases requiring drug therapy. To make matters worse, the cost of \nprescription drugs has been rising dramatically over the past few \nyears. In addition, older Americans without any prescription drug \ncoverage pay significantly more than HMOs, insurance companies, Federal \nhealth programs, and other favored customers for the same \npharmaceuticals.\n  Currently, seniors can obtain some coverage for drugs by joining \nMedicare HMOs. But, these HMOs are not available in many parts of the \ncountry, particularly in the rural areas. Moreover, Medicare HMOs are \nsharply cutting back on the drug benefits they offer.\n  Medicare beneficiaries may also purchase drug coverage through \nMedigap insurance policies. However, these plans are extremely \nexpensive and generally provide inadequate coverage. In addition, for \nmost Medigap plans, the premiums substantially increase with age. Thus, \njust as beneficiaries need drug coverage the most and are least able to \nafford it, this drug coverage is priced out of reach. This cost burden \nparticularly affects women who make up 73 percent of people over age \n85.\n  Employer-sponsored retiree health plans generally offer adequate drug \ncoverage. However, only about one quarter of Medicare beneficiaries \nhave access to such plans. In addition, health care coverage for \nretirees is declining dramatically. According to a recent study, only \n23 percent of Maryland firms now offer retiree health insurance.\n  During the Budget Committee's mark-up of the Majority's budget \nresolution, I supported an amendment to make $40 billion available for \na prescription drug benefit. This amendment, which was adopted, will \nhopefully inspire action on this issue during the remaining months of \nthis Congress. But, in the meantime, we must ensure that there will be \nfunds available for this benefit by preventing the Majority's \nunreasonable tax cut plan from consuming the entire on-budget surplus \nfirst.\n  I urge my colleagues to take this opportunity to address one of the \nmost widespread problems facing older Americans today by guaranteeing \nour seniors access to prescription medications instead of squandering \nthe on-budget surplus on excessive tax cuts.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nRobb's amendment to insist that tax cuts do not take priority over \nensuring that tens of millions of seniors receive affordable outpatient \nprescription drug coverage.\n  This is a commonsense amendment about priorities. If we have hundreds \nof billions of dollars in the next several years to spend on tax \nreductions that will primarily benefit the wealthiest Americans--and \nthat's what my Republican colleagues are saying when they voted for \n$250 billion over 5 years in tax cuts for some married people just last \nweek--then we should certainly enact a meaningful Medicare out-patient \ndrug benefit first. It's important to note that when it comes to tax \ncuts for married people, the Republican proposal doesn't even focus on \neliminating the marriage penalty, but rather, gives large bonuses to \nonly certain upper-income married couples. The cost of the Senate \nFinance marriage bonus proposal explodes in the out years. And yet, \nwhen it comes to finding a way to offer Medicare beneficiaries a \nprescription drug benefit there are all kinds of ifs and conditions.\n  Senator Robb is right to say let's do first things first. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for his amendment that makes a statement about our \norder of priority. I know too many West Virginia seniors who too \nfrequently go without food, or heat, or other necessities because they \nare forced to make the terrible choice between the drugs they need and \nother necessities of life. This is just plain wrong. We should provide \nall Medicare beneficiaries with a health care benefit that meets their \nneeds. It is ludicrous that the Medicare program doesn't currently \noffer this critical component of health care today. We should change \nthat, and we have the resources to do it this year. We have the \nresources if we don't fritter them away by picking favored \nconstituencies for special tax breaks.\n  Let's look at the facts about how the Republican budget treats tax \ncuts and how it treats the real hope of many Americans that we will \nfind a way to provide a Medicare outpatient prescription drug benefit. \nThe Republican budget's statement of purpose is to provide $150 billion \nin tax cuts over 5 years. It provides the money to the Senate Finance \nCommittee to do it. It is a certainty. It will have the protection of \nreconciliation.\n  The Republican budget resolution on Medicare prescription drugs does \nnothing more than suspend existing budget rules to allow for a Medicare \ndrug benefit should the Senate meet its moral responsibility to provide \none. It doesn't say do it. It says you can do it. It includes only a \n$20 billion placeholder to finance a drug benefit. Most people agree \nthat won't be sufficient to offer a decent drug benefit to all Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Moreover, the Republican budget resolution puts a 3-year \ntime limit on a possible Medicare drug benefit--with absolutely no \nguarantee that the benefit would be continued after 2005. The \nRepublican budget resolution also conditions 2004 and 2005 funding of a \npossible Medicare drug benefit on Medicare reform. Congress clearly has \nnot reached any consensus on how to approach Medicare reform.\n  Mr. President, we have a unique window of opportunity to do something \ngood for millions of seniors and disabled Americans. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to do what is right and vote for the Robb amendment to \nprovide prescription drug coverage to Medicare.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support the Robb second-degree \namendment to help ensure that Congress acts this year to provide a real \nprescription drug benefit for seniors.\n  Mr. President, prescription drugs are a vital part of health care in \nthis country. In fact, senior citizens spend more of their own money on \nprescription drugs than on any other health care item. If Medicare were \nenacted today, it would be unthinkable to create a benefit package that \ndid not include prescription drugs.\n  The resolution before us claims to provide $40 billion for a drug \nbenefit through a reserve fund for Medicare. But there are no \nreconciliation instructions to make sure that the Congress actually \nacts--unlike the tax breaks, which the Finance Committee is required to \nproduce.\n  Mr. President, this amendment ensures that Congress really will act \non prescription drugs, by requiring that such legislation be enacted \nbefore we take up any tax cut. This makes sure that we keep our \npriorities straight. And that we won't give tax breaks for the wealthy \na higher priority than life-saving drugs for seniors.\n  Why is it so important that we move on prescription drug legislation \nthis year? Unfortunately, three of every four Medicare beneficiaries \nlack decent, dependable coverage for prescription drugs. At least a \nthird of those people have no drug coverage at all.\n  And we're not talking about wealthy people here. Fifty-four percent \nof the people on Medicare without drug coverage earn about $17,000 a \nyear. Most of those people can't afford to pay the high premiums for \nMedigap coverage.\n  We just can't justify a health care system that forces elderly \nAmericans to choose between paying for food and paying for medicine. \nAnd that's what's happening today.\n  Unfortunately, Congress thus far has failed to act to address the \nneed for prescription drugs. And I'm afraid that if we don't force the \nissue forward, it will continue to languish.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. I support targeted tax cuts focused \non the real needs of middle class families. But I'm not for moving \nforward use drain projected surpluses until we've provided seniors with \nthe drugs that could preserve their health, or even save their lives.\n  In my view, before we approve any of these tax cuts, we should do \nfirst\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\nthings first, and pass legislation to provide prescription drugs to \nseniors. It's simply a question of priorities.\n  So, Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague, Senator Robb, for his \nleadership on this issue, and I urge support of his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and one-half minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will take a minute and a half, and then yield to my \ncolleague on the Republican side.\n  Very simply, I fully support this Robb second-degree amendment. We \nwant to be sure that Congress acts this year to provide a real \nprescription drug benefit for seniors. Senator Robb offered an \namendment that very specifically does that. The only problem we have \nthat I am concerned about is there are no reconciliation instructions. \nThat doesn't ensure that Congress will act to put this very important \nbenefit in place.\n  Having graduated to that status of senior citizen, I can tell you \nthis: When I talk to people in that group, the most important and \nworrisome thing they have in front of them is whether or not they are \ngoing to be able to afford the drugs, not only to keep them healthy but \nalso to provide a decent lifestyle.\n  I commend the Senator from Virginia for having developed this \namendment because he knows this is the most critical issue right now \naffecting the senior citizens beyond having to preserve Social Security \nand Medicare.\n  I yield the time remaining to my friend from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank Senator Lautenberg. I yield myself 2 minutes \nand yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from Texas. We have \n3\\1/2\\ minutes. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The only time left is under the control of----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He yielded his time. What is the ruling of the Chair? \nDo we have time or not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has yielded to the \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  This amendment has very little to do with Medicare. The budget \nresolution takes care of Medicare, thanks to a bipartisan \nunderstanding.\n  I call to the attention of millions of newly married couples and all \nof the married couples who are filing tax returns this year that this \namendment says you can't have the marriage tax penalty that Senator \nHutchison recommends on the floor of the Senate, for the adoption of \nthis amendment in the name of not having any tax cuts knocks out the \nmarriage tax penalty provision. I don't think that is what Americans \nwant.\n  Speaking about what Americans want, they want us to get rid of the \nmarriage tax penalty and get rid of it quick. If you adopt this \namendment, that is gone. All of Senator Hutchison's work in trying to \nget us to vote on this is out the window because we will have decided \nthat is not in order. The Senator's amendment will not be in order. \nReconciliation cannot include her marriage tax penalty. That is the \nissue.\n  I believe the Senate will overwhelmingly support Senator Hutchison \nand deny Senator Robb because there is already Medicare in this budget \nresolution--$40 billion worth. Democrats crowed on how good it is and \nall of a sudden went to the White House and invented a new thing.\n  We have taken care of Medicare in this budget resolution.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico is \nabsolutely right. We are going to take care of Medicare. We are going \nto have reform that includes prescription drugs of some kind. But we \nare saying a good idea is in the wrong place, and it is going to \nabsolutely eliminate the ability for us to correct a huge inequity in \nthe Tax Code. This is not a tax cut. It is a tax correction. Twenty-one \nmillion American couples pay an average of $1,400 extra just because \nthey got married. A policeman and a schoolteacher get married and owe \n$1,000 more in taxes. This is wrong.\n  We must go on record saying that we are not going to tolerate it for \none more minute. The Robb amendment eliminates our ability to do that. \nWe cannot allow the Robb amendment to vitiate all the efforts that we \nhave made to correct the marriage penalty tax in this country. We will \ndeal with prescription drugs. We will deal with Medicare. We are \ncommitted to doing that, and we are committed to doing it in this \nbudget.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I urge rejection of the Robb amendment and the passage of the \nHutchison-Ashcroft amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Robb amendment is not germane to the \nprovisions of the budget resolution. I therefore raise a point of order \nagainst the amendment under section 305 (b)(2) of the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the pending amendment, and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Congressional \nBudget Act in relation to amendment No. 2915 to amendment No. 2914.

Res. 281\n\n       Whereas the Michigan State Spartans were Big Ten Conference \n     regular season co-champions, and were winners of the Big Ten \n     Conference Tournament, and, with a 26-7 record, earned a \n     number one seed in the Midwest region of the 1999-2000 \n     N.C.A.A. Tournament;\n       Whereas the Michigan State Spartans proved their dominance \n     over the Midwest Region in reaching the Final Four, defeating \n     Valparaiso 65-38, Utah 73-61, Syracuse 75-58, and Iowa State \n     75-64;\n       Whereas in winning the Midwest Region the Michigan State \n     Spartans reached the Men's Final Four for the second year in \n     a row, last year losing to the Duke University Blue Devils in \n     the semifinals;\n       Whereas the Michigan State Spartans vowed after that loss \n     to return to the Final Four in 1999-2000, and to settle for \n     nothing less than the ultimate prize;\n       Whereas the Michigan State Spartans moved one step closer \n     to their goal when they defeated the University of Wisconsin \n     Badgers 53-41 for the fourth time of the 1999-2000 season to \n     reach the championship game;\n       Whereas in that game, the Michigan State Spartans, with an \n     entire team effort that demonstrated why college athletics \n     are so special, defeated the University of Florida Gators 89-\n     76 on April 3, 2000, and won the N.C.A.A. Men's Basketball \n     Championship for the second time in the history of the \n     program;\n       Whereas Coach Tom Izzo, who hails from Iron Mountain, \n     Michigan, in only his fifth year coaching the team, has \n     proven himself to be one of the finest coaches in Men's \n     College Basketball, and he and his staff instilled into the \n     Spartans a will to win second to none, exemplified by their \n     cutthroat defense, which suffocated many potent offenses \n     throughout the season, and particularly in the second half of \n     N.C.A.A. Tournament games;\n       Whereas Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson, and A.J. Granger, \n     three seniors who have been playing together for four years \n     and who ended their collegiate careers with a win, spurred \n     this team to victory throughout the year, Mr. Cleaves with \n     his incredible leadership, Mr. Peterson with his clutch \n     shooting, and Mr. Granger with his consistent long \n     marksmanship;\n       Whereas Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson, and Charlie Bell, \n     three individuals who hail from Flint, Michigan, and have \n     thus been given the nickname ``The Flintstones,'' have been \n     playing together since elementary school, and whose \n     comradeship and loyalty to one another carried out onto the \n     floor, and made the Spartans team a family off the floor as \n     well;\n       Whereas Mateen Cleaves, the fearless captain of the team \n     and the all-time assist leader in the Big Ten's history, who \n     led not only with words but also with the example he set, who \n     returned to the championship game after sustaining a high \n     ankle sprain to his right leg, led his team to the title and, \n     like a true champion, made good on his word;\n       Whereas Morris Peterson, named the Big Ten Conference \n     Player of the Year, saved the Michigan State Spartans from \n     the clutches of defeat many times this season, and \n     particularly in the tournament, with his laser-like shooting \n     and stingy defense;\n       Whereas Charlie Bell, perhaps the best rebounding guard in \n     the nation, also led the team with his quickness, tireless \n     defense effort, and athleticism, and who will be counted upon \n     for his leadership next year;\n       Whereas A.J. Granger, displayed his awesome variety of \n     offensive skills in both assisting on, and hitting, several \n     big shots when the Spartans needed them most;\n       Whereas Andre Hutson, the man in the middle, who was often \n     called on to shut down the opposing team's top player, \n     particularly in the 1999-2000 tournament, handled his job \n     with a workmanlike skill that defined professionalism, and in \n     doing so provided the Spartans with the whole package the \n     entire year;\n       Whereas Mike Chappell, Jason Richardson, and Aloysius \n     Anagonye, provided the Spartans with quality minutes off the \n     bench all year, and particularly in the championship game, \n     where they held their own against the vaunted Florida bench;\n       Whereas David Thomas and Adam Ballinger, provided valuable \n     contributions throughout the season and the tournament, both \n     on and off the court, often providing the Spartans with the \n     lift they needed; and\n       Whereas the contributions of Steve Cherry, Mat Ishbia and \n     Brandon Smith, both on the court and in practice, \n     demonstrated the total devotion of the Spartans players to \n     the team concept that made the Spartans into the most \n     dominating college basketball team of the new millennium: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate congratulates the \n     Michigan State University Men's Basketball Team on winning \n     the 1999-2000 National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's \n     Basketball Championship.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I will speak briefly about the \nresolution. I know my colleague, Senator Levin, will as well.\n  We rise together today to offer this resolution and to congratulate \nthe Michigan State University Spartans men's basketball team for their \noutstanding victory in the NCAA championships which took place Monday \nnight.\n  As a graduate of Michigan State, I am proud of the skill and \ndedication shown by our Spartans as they defeated the Florida Gators by \na score of 89-76.\n  This was a well-earned victory and the culmination of a splendid \nseason. Their 32-7 record is a sign of hard practice, teamwork and an \noverwhelming desire to excel.\n  It also is the result of a long history of dedication to success on \nthe court. Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson, and A.J. Granger, three \nseniors who have been playing together for four years, spurred this \nteam to victory throughout the year. Mateen with his incredible \nleadership. Morris with his clutch shooting. And A.J. with his \nconsistent long marksmanship.\n  Mateen Cleaves, Morris Peterson, and Charlie Bell, all hail from \nFlint, Michigan. As a result, thousands of fans known them by their \nnickname, ``The Flintstones.'' These three players have been playing \nbasketball together since elementary school. Their comradeship and \nloyalty to one another carried out onto the floor throughout the \nseason, and made the Spartans team a family off the floor as well.\n  Andre Hutson, the man in the middle, was often called on to shut down \nthe teams top player, particularly in the 1999-2000 tournament. He \nhandled his job with a workmanlike approach that defined \nprofessionalism.\n  Mike Chappell, Jason Richardson, and Aloysius Anagonye, each provided\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\nthe Spartans with quality minutes off the bench all year, and \nparticularly in the championship game, where they held their own \nagainst the vaunted Florida bench.\n  David Thomas and Adam Ballinger, provided valuable contributions \nthroughout the season and the tournament, both on and off the court, \noften providing the Spartans with the lift they needed. And Steve \nCherry, Mat Ishbia, and Brandon Smith demonstrated the total devotion \nof the Spartans players to the team concept both on the court and in \npractice.\n  Finally, a special mention must go to Head Coach Tom Izzo, who hails \nfrom Iron Mountain, Michigan, and is in only his fifth year coaching \nthe team. Coach Izzo has proven himself to be one of the finest coaches \nin men's college basketball. He and his staff instilled into the \nSpartans a will to win second to none, exemplified by their cutthroat \ndefense, which suffocated many potent offenses throughout the season, \nand particularly in the second half N.C.A.A. Tournament games.\n  Coach Izzo has served as in inspiration to his team, and to young men \nthroughout Michigan and the nation who share the spirit and excitement \nof the sport of basketball.\n  I acknowledge his and his family's contribution. In fact, I had the \npleasure of attending high school with his wife, Lupe.\n  Mr. President, I had the opportunity to attend the championship game, \nand I want to compliment everyone associated with the Spartans for the \ncourage and class they exhibited throughout the game, and during the \nentire season. Everyone in Michigan--from Copper Harbor to Monroe, to \nNiles--should be proud of what this team has accomplished.\n  In closing, let me say, as a graduate of Michigan State University \nand as one who attended Michigan State at a time when our basketball \nprogram was not as successful as it has been since Magic Johnson's \narrival in 1978 and in the time since, how proud I am of my alma mater \nfor this great victory for the Spartans green and white.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I join Senator Abraham in sponsoring this \nresolution which commends and recognizes the extraordinary successes of \nthe Michigan State Spartans.\n  As we speak today, about 150,000 people are lining the parade route \nin Lansing, MI, after a rally at our capitol, to welcome home and cheer \non our heroes.\n  College athletics is at best about more than winning. It is about \nhard work and determination and relying on teammates to overcome \nadversity. The Michigan State Spartans surely displayed all of those \ncharacteristics in their season-long drive to become the national \nchampions.\n  Coming off a loss to Duke in the Final Four last year, many had \npicked MSU as this year's favorite to win the NCAA Tournament. However, \nwhen star point guard and former Big Ten Player of the Year Mateen \nCleaves was sidelined with a stress fracture on his right foot early in \nthe season, the hopes of a championship season seemed lost. But the \nSpartans never gave up. The rest of the team pulled together to play \nthe first 13 games of the season without their emotional leader.\n  When Mateen returned to the basketball team, MSU went on to win their \nthird straight Big Ten Championship, clinching the top seed in the \nMidwest region of the NCAA Tournament.\n  During the NCAA tournament the Spartans faced many challenges, \nwinning come from behind victories against Utah, Syracuse, and Iowa \nState to reach the Final Four for the second straight year. After \nbeating conference rival Wisconsin in the semifinals, the stage was set \nfor Michigan State to take home their first National Championship title \nsince Magic Johnson led the Spartans to victory over Indiana State in \n1979.\n  Monday night the young Florida Gators played a great game, but their \ndepth and energy didn't quite match the experience and determination of \nthe Spartans. Mateen Cleaves led the team in scoring until five minutes \ninto the second half when he was sent to the locker room with a \nsprained ankle. While many teams would have crumbled under the pressure \nof playing for the National Championship without their star player and \nfloor leader, the Spartans came together like they have done all season \nlong and their lead over the Gators grew. When the injured Cleaves came \nback onto the floor, limping up and down the court, his presence \nprovided the emotional spark that the team needed to win by a final \nscore of 89 to 76.\n  In today's sports world where, where many talented young players \nleave college early or don't go at all, and coaches skip from team to \nteam it is refreshing to see the kind of dedication that these student \nathletes and their coach have shown. ``The Flintstones''--seniors \nMateen Cleaves and Morris Peterson, and junior Charlie Bell, have \nbecome heroes and role models to those from their hometown of Flint. \nSenior A.J. Granger's often unsung heroics have proved how much these \nSpartans value the success of the team over individual accolades. The \nfull roster of that extraordinary team is as follows: Al Anagonye, \nJason Andreas, Adam Ballinger, Charlie Bell, Mike Chappell, Steve \nCherry, Mateen Cleaves, A.J. Granger, Lorenzo Guess, Andre Hutson, Matt \nIshbia, Morris Peterson, Jason Richardson, Brandon Smith, David Thomas, \nand Adam Wolfe.\n  Coach Tom Izzo has spent his entire career in Michigan, including 12 \nyears as an assistant under former Michigan State head coach, Jud \nHeathcote. They have set a wonderful example of what can happen when \nyou are willing to combine patience, hard work, and dedication.\n  Those names belong in the Congressional Record. They are all being \nhonored here for their teamwork, which produced a national champion.\n  Coach Tom Izzo has spent his entire career in Michigan, including 12 \nyears as an assistant under former Michigan State head coach, Jud \nHeathcote. He and his assistants have set an extraordinary example of \nwhat can happen when you are willing to combine patience, hard work, \nand dedication. Indeed, the whole Michigan State family deserves credit \nbecause they truly represent, on and off the court, what we frequently \ntalk about--family values. They believe in family, both at home and on \nthe court. They act as a family and they play as a family. We owe them \nour congratulations and our thanks for that as well.\n  There is going to be a long list of bands in that parade going down \nMichigan Avenue in a few minutes. Many of the high school teams from \naround the State will be there. They have been invited to march. One of \nthe groups, though, that I want to make special mention of in closing \nis the band from Tom Izzo's hometown of Iron Mountain. Tom Izzo is an \n``Upper,'' as we say; he comes from the UP. His heart has always been \nclose to Michigan and Michigan State. He is originally from the UP. It \nis a special treat for him and for all of us that one of the bands \nmarching down Michigan Avenue today will be indeed from his hometown of \nIron Mountain.\n  We also pay tribute to the Florida Gators. It was an extraordinary \ngame. They deserve an awful lot of credit for what they did to bring \nthemselves to the finals. I am sure that in the future their heroics \nwill again prove that they will go far in these NCAA tournaments. \nHopefully, they will again get to the finals and, hopefully, again lose \nto a Michigan team.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two \nSenators from Connecticut be permitted to speak as in morning business \nand that their comments be counted toward the remaining time on the \nbudget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nConnecticut. I appreciate the indulgence of the chairman while I \ndigress for a couple of minutes.\n  My colleagues will understand that there is a sense of collective \npride in the Nutmeg State among the Connecticut delegation over the \nsuccess on Sunday night that brought the NCAA\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\nbasketball championship home to Connecticut for the second time in 6 \nyears. The women did a magnificent job. With all due respect to our \ncolleagues from Tennessee, the Lady Vols and Pat Summit, the wonderful \ncoach there, there has been a wonderful tradition and competition \nbetween these two schools. They have met twice this year--a split \ndecision. The University of Connecticut won its game against Tennessee \nin Tennessee, and only a few weeks later Tennessee brought its team to \nConnecticut, and they won on our home court. So the final game was sort \nof a rubber match between these two very fine programs, wonderfully \ncoached and well-staffed teams, with magnificent players.\n  Senator Lieberman and I feel a sense of pride, obviously, as our \ncolleagues would appreciate, that the women's basketball team at UConn \ncapped a dominating 36-1 season in which they began the season ranked \nNo. 1, and they ran through the entire season ranked No. 1, and now \nfinished ranked No. 1 and national champs, with a decisive victory of \n71-52.\n  All of the years have been memorable for a team which has now \nrecorded 14 consecutive winning seasons and 12 consecutive NCAA \ntournament appearances, including the landmark 1994-95 championship \nseason in which the UConn women never lost a game, and this season in \nwhich they only lost one--a loss avenged on Sunday when they beat \nTennessee in the final tournament game, having lost to them in our home \ncourt.\n  This second national title only seals the legacy of the UConn women's \nbasketball program as one of the best programs of the 1990s. So it is \nappropriate that they mark the turn of the millennium with this \nvictory. For Shea Ralph, the tireless team leader, and the Final Four's \nMost Outstanding Player, the triumph was even sweeter. She returned to \nplay this year after spending last season on the sidelines with her \nsecond knee injury in 2 years. Her dedication reflects the spirit of \nthis entire team. All who watched the tenacity and determination with \nwhich she played will certainly agree with those statements.\n  What stands out about these women is their ability to accomplish just \nas much off the court. Ten players since the 91-92 season have made the \nschool's dean's list, and UConn boasts a 100-percent graduation rate \nfor recruited student athletes. Every recruited freshman who has played \nfor Head Coach Geno Auriemma at Connecticut and completed her \neligibility has obtained her undergraduate degree.\n  Since Coach Auriemma arrived on campus in Storrs in 1985, when the \nteam had seen only one winning season, he has compiled 393 wins and the \nthird highest winning percentage among active Division I coaches: nine \nBig East regular season titles, eight Big East tournament \nchampionships, and two NCAA national championships. Coach Auriemma has \nagain been named National Coach of the Year--for the third time in his \ncareer--and has been honored three times, as well, as the Big East \nConference Coach of the Year.\n  Mr. President, as a fan myself, along with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Lieberman, we want to take a moment to voice the importance of \nthis team to the State of Connecticut. The Connecticut Huskies have \nranked No. 1 in the Nation in home attendance for the past 6 years, \nattracting close to 1 million fans at UConn's Gampel Pavilion. This \nkind of support is exciting, especially in a State surrounded with \ntalented pro sports teams, but with very few of its own.\n\n  This team has reinforced the importance of women's athletics at the \ncollegiate level--including issues such as title IX--and whether it is \nConnecticut or Tennessee or another worthy team, I am pleased to see \nsuch a high level of attention and excitement nationwide for women's \ncollege athletics, and particularly for basketball.\n  It was in 1995 when we last congratulated a national champion UConn \nwomen's team. The future of graduating players that year in the sport \nthey grew up playing was limited to involvement in training or coaching \nat collegiate and high school levels. Today, we should all be proud of \nthe fact that these champions may go on to follow their ``hoop \ndreams,'' if you will, and continue to inspire the dreams of others by \nplaying basketball professionally.\n  I congratulate everybody involved in this great victory on a \nmemorable tournament and season, including All-Americans Svetlana \nAbrosimova and Shea Ralph, as well as Sue Bird, Asjha Jones, Tamika \nWilliams, Kelly Schumacher, Swin Cash, Marci Czel, Stacy Hansmeyer, and \nmany other talented players; Coach Ariemma, Associate Head Coach Chris \nDailey, and Assistant Coaches Tonya Cardoza and Jamelle Elliott.\n  Again, we look forward to a wonderful season next year. We welcome \nthem to Washington, and invite our colleagues to meet them when they \ncome here.\n  At the appropriate time, Senator Lieberman and I will submit a \nresolution regarding this great success the other night.\n  I yield to my colleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague.\n  I am delighted in the midst of this debate on the budget, which \nsometimes lacks exhilaration, to interject, along with our friends from \nMichigan, a note of euphoria. This euphoria, of course, is of the \nbasketball variety.\n  We are just days removed from the completion of that exhilarating \nspring spectacle we've come to know as March Madness--the National \nCollegiate Athletic Association Basketball Tournament. And here in the \nNation's Capital, Senator Dodd and I are very fortunate and proud to be \nestablishing a spring rite of our own: coming to the floor on behalf of \ngrateful fans across Connecticut--and we would like to think admiring \nfans across America--to praise the incomparable University of \nConnecticut Huskies, last year's men's team and this year's women's \nteam champions of the basketball world once more.\n\n  With this victory on Sunday night defeating archrival Tennessee 71 to \n52, the women Huskies not only earned their second national \nchampionship in 5 years, they also managed to set a school record for \nwins with 36 and to overcome what was their only loss in an otherwise \nperfect season to a very good Tennessee Volunteer team.\n  As just one measure of the University of Connecticut's captivating \nrun to the championship, four of the five players named to the All-\nTournament team were Huskies, including the tournament's Most Valuable \nPlayer--the extraordinary and indomitable Shea Ralph.\n  In celebrating this tremendous achievement, we are particularly proud \nof our National Coach of the Year, Geno Auriemma, for whom victory \nserved on Sunday night as something of a triumphant homecoming. Geno \nwas raised in the steel mill town of Norristown on the outskirts of \nPhilly by his parents who brought him and his family from their country \nof birth, which was Italy. He was accompanied to Sunday's game by his \nmother, Marsiella, who watched from the stands. And, as anybody who \nwatched the game on television learned, she was holding a jar of holy \nwater in her lap, which she sprinkled on Connecticut's players for good \nluck.\n  They responded by playing what I would have to call a divinely \ninspired game.\n  It was, if you saw the game, one of those occasions when everything \nseems to come together and go right. It was an extraordinary experience \nfor those of us who are the fans of this team.\n  On Monday, as the dawn came, people across Connecticut bore witness \nto a spectacle that I think few fans of women athletics could have \nenvisioned when Congress first passed title IX in 1972. Across the \nState, from Danbury to Dayville, from Stamford to Stonington, \ncommunities came together and exalted in the accomplishments of this \ngreat Huskies team, a celebration equal in intensity to the one sparked \nby the men's championship last year. The Hartford Courant thought so \nmuch of the Husky victory that it dedicated its entire front page to \ntheir win, and it says it in one word. Here is a great picture of our \ncoach, Geno Auriemma, doing his impersonation of Alan Keyes in the mosh \npit --in this case, the team holding our triumphant coach. The one word \nwhich expresses our attitude in Connecticut about this great team is \n``euphoria.''\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\n  Huskymania, we have come to learn, is an equal opportunity \nexperience. In the town of Storrs, the picturesque, wooded hamlet that \nthe University of Connecticut students, faculty, and administrators \ncall home, more than 5,000 people turned out Monday for a midday pep \nrally of appreciation at the Gampel Pavilion, where sellout crowds \nwatched this great team work their magic all year long. As the \ncelebration grew more and more boisterous and enthusiastic, it seemed \nhard to believe that this was the same part of our State that used to \nbe called ``The Forgotten Corner,'' because these days, if you follow \ncollege basketball, it is an awfully hard place to forget.\n  The fact is, thanks to the Huskies, Storrs is home to the stars now. \nWe like to think of it as the ``College Hoops Capital of America.\n\n  Last year, when we came to the floor to celebrate the men's victory, \nI closed with an impersonation of a University of Connecticut \ncheerleader. I was advised by many people, including my dear friend and \nsenior colleague, not to repeat this performance. But you know that I \nfeel it would be unfair. So very briefly, U-C-O-N-N, UConn.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the last time I saw something like that \nwas when Senator D'Amato did a tune.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Mexico 15 \nminutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have to leave the floor for a while. I \nwanted to indicate that one-half hour of our hour in opposition is \ngoing to be yielded to the Senator from Texas. He will have half an \nhour.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am offering the amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Kennedy, Senator Murray, Senator Dodd, Senator Kerry, \nSenator Daschle, and Senator Wellstone, several of whom will speak.\n  It would increase the national investment in education over the \ncommittee's mark by $5.6 billion in budget authority in fiscal year \n2001.\n  Let me put up a chart that shows the difference between our proposed \namendment and the budget resolution. You can see that the budget \nresolution is $75 billion in 2001. Our amendment will raise that up to \n$80.64 billion.\n  It also would increase over a 5-year period the total amount devoted \nto education by $34.7 billion.\n  This second chart shows the comparison between the budget resolution \nthat came to the floor and what this amendment would do.\n  In our view, this increase is essential if we are going to reflect \nthe priorities of the American people. All of us know that the top \npriority of the people we represent is to see improvements in education \nand to see every child in this country given the opportunity to get a \ngood education. Clearly, the decisions we make in this budget \nresolution will go a long way to determining whether that is possible \nor not.\n  The amendment I sent to the desk would use about 15 percent of the \nproposed Republican tax cut. It would reduce the tax cut by that 15 \npercent in order to guarantee sufficient funding for programs that have \nbeen proven to improve student performance in our public schools and to \nassist students seeking a postsecondary education.\n  What are those programs? That is the subject of our amendment. The \namendment that we are proposing would seek to protect many such \nprograms.\n  First, it seeks to protect a program to increase safety and decrease \novercrowding in our schools by providing $1.3 billion in grants and \nloans for urgent repair of 5,000 public elementary and secondary \nschools in high-need areas and by leveraging $25 billion in interest-\nfree bonds to help build and modernize 6,000 schools.\n  The amendment also demonstrates a national commitment to building and \nrenovating our schools to make sure all children are able to study in \nsafe, modern environments by setting aside $3.7 billion of the proposed \ntax cut, which is just 1.8 percent of the total tax cut, to back those \ninterest-free bonds for school construction costs.\n  These programs I estimate would provide about $200 million in my home \nState of New Mexico where current estimates are that school repair and \nmodernization needs exceed $1.8 billion. Many schools are overcrowded. \nOver 69 percent of our schools in my State report plumbing and \nelectrical problems; 75 percent have problems with environmental \nfactors such as lighting and heating.\n  Another program we guarantee funding in what we believe is a \nreasonable\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\nlevel is the afterschool programs. We expand existing afterschool \nprograms so approximately 1.6 million more school-age children in over \n6,000 new 21st century community learning centers have access to \nafterschool programs in safe and drug-free environments.\n  The amendment seeks to ensure an increase of $547 million in these \nprograms. The estimate for my State would be about $5.3 million of the \ntotal amount. Also, in this amendment we support tough accountability \nstandards for increasing the funding for title I accountability grants \nby $116 million over last year's level, to the level of $250 million. \nThis is essential to accelerate efforts to turn around failing schools \nand to implement tough accountability systems.\n  Under current law, States in districts receiving funding under the \ntitle I program, which is every State and most school districts in the \ncountry, are required to monitor student and school performance on \nState assessments based on State standards. States and districts are \nrequired to take action if schools are failing. In committee, we \nstrengthened the accountability system, but we did not strengthen it \nenough.\n  During the debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, I \nhope to offer an amendment that strengthens it further. Nevertheless, \nno accountability system is going to prove effective without the \nresources to implement. Although most States have adopted statewide \nstandards, they have not directed adequate resources to schools that \nare failing in order to meet those standards. Dedicated funds are \nnecessary to develop improvement strategies which create rewards and \npenalties holding schools accountable for continuous improvement in \ntheir student performance.\n  The Federal Government directs over $8 billion in Federal funding to \nprovide critical support programs for disadvantaged students under \ntitle I. However, the accountability provisions in title I have not \nbeen adequately implemented due to insufficient resources. The \namendment we are offering today provides for this critical assistance \nand the strict accountability measures for improvement in student \nperformance to turn around so-called failing schools.\n  My colleagues and I believe this amendment is necessary because the \nproposed budget we are now considering, if implemented, will make \nadequate increases in education spending virtually impossible. Several \nof my colleagues have already pointed out the proposed budget calls for \nat least $168 billion in tax cuts over 5 years; that is the largest tax \ncut ever proposed. These tax cuts, at a minimum, leave nothing in the \nbudget surplus for education or for the other priorities so important \nto the American people.\n\n  Without cutting other programs or dipping into Social Security, this \nbudget resolution causes Members to choose between tax cuts and \neducation. Unless unrealistic cuts are made to noneducation programs, \nthe Republican budget resolution disregards these and other national \npriorities and exhausts 98 percent of the total non-Social Security \nsurplus on tax cuts over the next 5 years. The budget resolution only \ncovers the next 5 years; over 10 years the tax cuts would cost \nsubstantially more than the projected non-Social Security surplus \nprojected by the CBO.\n  While the Budget Committee's resolution provides increases for \ndiscretionary spending for defense, it cuts nondefense discretionary \nfunds by $105 billion, or 6.5 percent over the next 5 years below the \namount the Congressional Budget Office indicates is necessary to \nmaintain current funding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator from New Mexico, I am proud to be a \nsponsor of his amendment. The Senator goes to the heart of what our \ncountry's priority ought to be--frankly, what all of the Republicans \nand Democrats alike say our priority ought to be. When we look at \nnumbers, we realize the Republican budget is going to be devastating to \neducation.\n  I engage my friend in a question about afterschool programs. The \nSenator and I have worked hard in getting more funding for afterschool. \nThanks to a lot of hard work in this Congress and with the Vice \nPresident's leadership, we have seen spending on afterschool programs \ngo up to about $453 million in the year 2000. By the way, a few years \nago it was $1 million; then it was $40 million. The need is tremendous.\n  The President is asking in his budget to accommodate the waiting list \nof children, which is more than one million children. He envisions \nspending $1 billion on afterschool programs to accommodate that wait. \nIn the Republican budget, that number is cut by $547 million; it \nfreezes the amount for afterschool.\n  I ask my friend, because he works so hard on the issue of school \ndropout rates and helping kids who need a hand, and he does so much \nwork on gang violence prevention, does the Senator think this \nRepublican budget is going to harm these million children? If we go \nwith the President's numbers, they will be included in his programs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator from California for the question.\n  My own view is there are a great many young people out there who want \nto be in these programs. There are a great many parents who want to \nhave their children in these programs. Our estimate is that 1.6 million \nmore of the students nationwide would be able to participate if we are \nable to succeed with this amendment and add the $547 million of \nadditional funds that the President has requested. That is what we are \ntrying to do. Clearly, it is a question of priorities. Where do people \nthink this money should be spent?\n\n  My own view is these programs are extremely effective not only in \nimproving children's performance but in keeping kids out of trouble. \nThe drug problem is real. We all talk about the need to fight the drug \nproblem. We are having a great discussion now in the newspapers about \nhow much should be spent to deal with the drug problem by assisting the \ncountry of Colombia. I support doing something significant there.\n  Clearly, reducing demand through more attention to young people \nthrough afterschool programs is part of the solution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know the Senator is aware, but I want to underscore the \nincredible support afterschool programs have with the American people. \nAsk the American people, and 90 percent of them support safe \nafterschool programs for our children.\n  In addition, is the Senator aware that this is a top priority for law \nenforcement? Look at the FBI statistics. Juvenile crime occurs from the \nhour of 3 p.m., and it starts to go down around 6 o'clock or 7 p.m.\n  If my friend could answer that question, is he aware that this is a \npriority with the American people?\n  Again, I do agree with the Senator from California that this is a top \npriority with the American people and with much of law enforcement. I \nhave had law enforcement officers in my State, police from local and \nState Police organizations, tell me they wish we would do more to deal \nwith juvenile crime in these types of programs so they would not have \nto do so much afterwards, when crimes have been committed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me go ahead and complete the summary of this \namendment, if I could.\n  First, I do recognize the Republican resolution, which we have on the \nfloor, asserts a commitment to increase spending for a few important \neducation programs. We support the committee's decision to commit to \nincreased funding for IDEA and for Pell grants and some other \nelementary and secondary education programs. But we do not support \npitting these programs against other critical programs. We believe the \nmore prudent course would be to guarantee the level of funding required \nto protect the programs that have proven themselves in our efforts to \nreform schools and bring improvements in student performance.\n  Let me just go through this chart to try to clarify my understanding \nat least of the Republican budget resolution that is before us. The \nresolution asserts a $4.5 billion increase for mandatory and \ndiscretionary Department of Education programs. But when you try to \nfigure out how that $4.5 billion is arrived at, the specific elements \nthat are discussed at different parts of the budget add up to more than \n$4.5 billion. For example, there is $2.3 billion set\n\n[[Page S2161]]\n\naside for a new, mandatory performance bonus fund which is established.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 8 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 8 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. When you look at this $2.3 billion the Budget Committee \nreport sets aside for this new, mandatory performance bonus fund, that, \nof course, presumably, should come out of the total amount for \neducation. I believe it does very explicitly. Therefore, when you \nsubtract that, the resolution asserts a $2.2 billion increase for \ndiscretionary education programs. Given the size of the tax cut in \nrelation to the non-Social Security surplus, this increase does not \nseem possible, as I mentioned before. But if we assume it is, it still \nfalls short of covering the priorities specified in their own \nresolution.\n  The resolution earmarks, out of the $2.2 billion that remains after \nyou subtract the $2.3 billion down here--$1 billion for IDEA, it sets \naside $1.6 billion for increases in other elementary and secondary \neducation programs, and it sets aside $700 million for the increase to \nraise the maximum Pell grant by $200. If you add the $700 million, the \n$1.6 billion, the $1 billion, and the $2.3 billion, you get $5.6 \nbillion.\n  So the unfortunate reality is that there is no way to get it all done \nin the $4.5 billion that is permitted in the way of increases for \neducation. Therefore, the $1.1 billion difference between the $5.6 \nbillion and the $4.5 billion needs to be cut from other education \nprograms in order to reach the specified increases.\n  Based on what is outlined in the committee-reported budget, Non-\nelementary and Secondary Education Act or IDEA education programs would \nhave to be cut about 22 percent to meet the assumptions for education \nspending.\n  The funding for fiscal year 2001 for discretionary programs under the \nRepublican proposal is $2.3 billion below what the President requested. \nIf all discretionary education, training, and social programs in \nfunction 500 of the budget are considered, the resolution is $4.7 \nbillion below the President's budget.\n  Our amendment would guarantee real dollars for targeted efforts, for \nprograms that are known to improve student performance. The program \nwould provide increases in funding that would allow for this $1 billion \nincrease in IDEA. As I said before, we compliment the committee for \nagreeing to that. I believe that is very important.\n  Our amendment would also sustain our commitment to the student loan \nprogram and to the impact aid programs. The amendment would provide for \na $400 increase in the maximum Pell grant rather than the $200 increase \nproposed by the President and contained in the committee report.\n  In addition, the amendment would guarantee increased investments in \nprograms that we know are essential to educational reform, including \nthose I mentioned before. Let me mention just a few more of those. \nThere is a $1.5 billion increase in our proposed amendment for teacher \nquality programs. This is $1 billion over the President's proposal, so \nwe can ensure every child is taught by a qualified instructor. Research \nshows that high-quality teachers are the single most important \ndeterminant of student learning.\n\n  This amendment increases resources for schools with high \nconcentrations of poverty. Here we are talking about the title I \nprogram. We would propose to increase funding there by $1 billion, \nwhich, frankly, is not enough. During the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act markup, which we concluded in the Health and Education \nCommittee just the other day, our committee voted unanimously--all \nDemocrats and all Republicans voted unanimously to increase the \nauthorization for title I to $15 billion. I would like to work with my \nRepublican colleagues to ensure we are at least on the path to meeting \nthat goal. At the very least, we need to commit to make a substantial \nincrease next year. All of us know the importance of title I funding. \nAll of us give speeches about how important it is to adequately fund \ntitle I. Here is a chance to actually vote to do that.\n  The amendment we are offering continues our commitment to smaller \nclasses, providing $1.75 billion to hire 100,000 teachers to reduce \nclass size in the early grades. In addition, the amendment expands \nsupport for creating smaller learning communities in large schools.\n  This amendment makes college more affordable for many of our young \npeople. As I mentioned before, we are increasing the maximum Pell grant \nby $400--we are proposing to do that. That would make postsecondary \neducation accessible to 96,000 more recipients than currently have \naccess. The amendment increases the GEAR UP program and the TRIO \nProgram so more disadvantaged children can be given the support they \nneed to attend college. Under the amendment, students in my State would \nreceive an additional $5 million in aid under the Pell Grant Program.\n  Let me just conclude by saying the public does want its schools \nfixed, even if that means somewhat less in the way of a tax cut. That \nis the issue before us. Should there be something in the range of a 15-\npercent reduction in the tax cut in order to adequately fund education \nin this budget? The budget resolution before us does not reflect the \npriorities of the American public. It flies in the face of what \nAmericans say their priorities are in this robust economy. In survey \nafter survey, American voters have not only told us education is the \nmost important issue nationally, but they support action at the \nnational level to improve our country's schools. This sentiment extends \nto the funding of education, just as it extends to other changes in our \neducation.\n  So I believe this is very important. I believe this amendment will \nimprove this budget resolution dramatically and will put it much more \nin line with the interests and priorities of the American people. I \nhope very much it will be agreed to by my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am sure that anybody following this \ndebate might get confused as to what the Democrats are for, but there \nis not any way on Earth they can fail to figure out what they are \nagainst. They are against a tax cut.\n  They are against eliminating the marriage penalty. They are perfectly \nwilling to allow the Tax Code, which penalizes people who fall in love \nand get married, to stand.\n  They are opposed to repealing the death tax. They are perfectly \nwilling to leave in place a Tax Code that says: You work your whole \nlife to build up a family business or a family farm, you pay taxes on \nevery dollar you earn, and when you die, your children still may be \nforced to sell off the business or sell off the farm to give the \nFederal Government another 55 percent of your life's work.\n  They are against those things, and in trying to kill the tax cut, \nthey are for many other things.\n  As to education, there are a lot of reasons for which one can \ncriticize this budget, but not spending enough money on education is \nsimply not one of them. This budget provides $47.9 billion for the \nDepartment of Education, which is $600 million more than the President \nproposed. In fact, last year in our budget and in the appropriations \nprocess, we spent more money on education than the President proposed.\n  Unless we get carried away with euphoria and believe that spending a \nwhole bunch of money on education is somehow going to change anything, \nthat somehow having a smaller class size is going to improve \nperformance--we have been lowering class size since 1965 and \nperformance has been declining.\n  The real debate about education is about whether or not we ought to \nbe the national school board in Congress or whether we ought to let the \nStates decide how to spend this money. That is the real debate between \nDemocrats and Republicans. Democrats believe we ought to have Congress \nsay how the money is going to be spent, and Republicans believe we \nought to let the States say how the money is going to be spent.\n  Mr. President, Senator Domenici yielded me 30 minutes to speak. I ask\n\n[[Page S2162]]\n\nunanimous consent that the 30 minutes come off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to talk about the evolution of this \nbudget. I want to talk about the last 8 years of the Clinton \nadministration and how we came to be where we are today with a balanced \nbudget.\n  The one thing about history is everybody wants to rewrite it to suit \nthemselves, but facts are persistent things.\n  What I want to do today is begin with the first budget President \nClinton ever submitted to the Congress. I want to trace his budgets \nthrough Congress until we get to the last budget he will ever submit to \nCongress, which is the one we are considering today.\n  The objective is to basically try to get a clear picture of what has \nbeen proposed and what has been done.\n  When President Clinton took office, he sent to the Congress on \nFebruary 17 of 1993 a budget entitled ``A Vision of Change for \nAmerica.''\n  I have the budget in my hand today. Many people have made a great \npoint about the fact that the President did impose the largest tax \nincrease in American history, but the result of it was a balanced \nbudget.\n  I begin by noting that on page 22 of the first budget President \nClinton ever submitted to Congress, the deficit he started with was \n$319 billion. His first act as President, in addition to proposing the \nlargest tax increase in American history, was to raise that deficit in \n1993 from $319 billion to $332 billion. He did that by proposing that \nspending actually go up by more than his tax increase in the first year \nand, in fact, he proposed a stimulus package of $16.262 billion of \nbrand new spending.\n\n  Some of my colleagues will remember the proposal was to spend this \nout of a projects book. We were able to defeat this proposal on the \nfloor of the Senate, after it passed the House, by pointing out that in \nthis projects book were such proposals as an ice skating warming hut in \nConnecticut and an alpine slide in Puerto Rico.\n  In the last budget that was adopted when the Democrats had a majority \nin Congress--and I have the conference report from that fiscal year \n1995 budget, which was adopted on May 4 of 1994--that budget has on \npage 4 their deficit for fiscal year 1995 which, not counting the money \nthat was being plundered from Social Security, was $239.5 billion. It \nwas projected to rise in 1996 to $253 billion, in 1997 to $278 billion, \nin 1998 to $281 billion, and finally, the fiscal year 1999 deficit they \nwere projecting in the last budget when the Democrats controlled \nCongress was going to be $300.7 billion.\n  When the American people looked at those numbers and looked at the \nClinton health care bill which proposed having the Government take over \nand run the health care system, they elected a Republican majority.\n  When the Republican majority showed up in January of 1995, it was \ngreeted by the President's fiscal year 1996 budget. This was a budget \nthat Bill Clinton sent to the Republican Congress in February 1995. \nActually he began to write it in large part before he knew there would \nbe a Republican Congress. That budget proposed in January of 1995 that \nwe adopt a budget that had a deficit of $203 billion, and it proposed \nin the year 2000 that the deficit would be $194.4 billion. This was the \nbudget that Bill Clinton submitted to the new Republican Congress.\n  In 1995, Bill Clinton was asked on many occasions, because the \nRepublican Congress started talking about balancing the budget, when he \nthought we could balance the budget. He had many different answers. \nThis is what he said in 1995: How many years will it take to balance \nthe budget? He said: Nine years.\n  Then he was asked the question again, and he said: Well, 10 years.\n  Then he said 8 years.\n  Then he said 9 years.\n  Then he said 7 years.\n  Then he said 7 to 9 years.\n  Then he said 7 years.\n  Then he said 9 years.\n  And then he said 10 years.\n  These are all statements that President Clinton made in 1995 when \nRepublicans on the floor of the House and on the floor of the Senate, \nfor the first time in the modern era, were talking about balancing the \nFederal budget.\n  He was saying: Yes, we might balance the budget. We could balance it \n4 years after I leave office; 5 years after I leave office; 3 years \nafter I leave office. But he never, ever proposed that we balance the \nbudget while he was President. Nor did he ever submit any budgets that \nwould require it, until it had already been accomplished.\n  What happened to the deficit? When Congress arrived in January of \n1995, this was the Clinton budget proposal as it related to the \ndeficit: Basically, it was a $200 billion deficit that went on forever. \nThe American people in 1994 elected a Republican majority in Congress, \nand it took office in 1995. I ask the people to look at what happened \nto the deficit under a Republican Congress. The deficit fell very \nrapidly, and by 1998 we had a balanced Federal budget.\n\n  Let me, if I might, make the following point, and do it in taking the \nPresident's new budget. First of all, there is one thing that is \ntotally consistent in every Clinton budget. For 8 years, he has \nsubmitted budgets, and in every year they have had one thing in common: \nmassive increases in nondefense discretionary spending.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize to my friend from Texas, but I want to say \nthis. I stepped off the floor to take a phone call. In my absence, \nthere was a request to take 30 minutes off the resolution. I am very \nupset about that. There was an agreement made, before we left, with the \nmanager of the bill, that 30 minutes would be taken from your side. I \nask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Taken from the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. That is right. I ask unanimous consent that the original \nunanimous consent agreement be reestablished.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object. I \nwas passed a note saying, given the makeup of time, that it would be \nhelpful if I would ask for 30 minutes off the resolution. I made that \nrequest. If the Senator objects to it, I will be glad to withdraw it.\n  Mr. REID. I will just say this. I appreciate very much the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  I also say this, I am not going to leave the floor anymore. I will be \nhere all day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I suggest, I think this is the \nright decision. We had an agreement. I left the floor and he left the \nfloor. This time should come off the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I was not a party to the agreement. I really did not know \nthe details of the agreement. I was simply trying to accommodate other \npeople who wanted to debate the amendment. I did not get an opportunity \nyesterday, because I was working on a lot of other things, to talk \nabout the budget itself. Normally I resent deals that I am not part of, \nbut in this case I would be happy to try to comply with it.\n  The point I wish to make, in concluding, in looking at the 8 years of \nthe Clinton budget, is that on one point they are totally consistent; \nand that point is, they always proposed dramatic increases in \nnondefense discretionary spending. It is an interesting paradox that in \nthe first budget that President Clinton ever proposed, his first \nproposal was to increase nondefense discretionary by 12.5 percent. We \nrejected it when we rejected his stimulus package. In the last budget \nthat he will ever propose, remarkably, he proposes to increase \nnondefense discretionary by 12.5 percent, which brings me to my final \npoint on the budget.\n  Increasingly, we are hearing from our Democrat colleagues, and we are \nhearing, in fact, from the President and from the Vice President, that \nsomehow our effort to let working people keep more of what they earn is \nrisky, that somehow repealing the marriage penalty is risky, that \nsomehow repealing the death tax is risky. I guess they say it is risky \nbecause that is money that we are giving back to the American people.\n  But I would ask my colleagues to understand and remember that if you \ntake last year's budget, and you take President Clinton's proposal for \nthis year's budget, he is proposing an increase in spending over the 5 \nyears--from 2002 to 2006--he is proposing new\n\n[[Page S2163]]\n\nspending of $494 billion. That is brand new spending in this budget. \nSome 80 new programs in this budget would be funded at a level of $494 \nbillion above the level we are spending now.\n  So what President Clinton is saying, what Vice President Gore is \nsaying, what our Democrat colleagues are saying, is, let us start 80 \nnew programs and let us spend $494 billion.\n  It is interesting. My Governor, who has been criticized by the \nPresident and the Vice President, and many of our Democrat colleagues, \nsaid: No. Let's take $483 billion and give it back to working Americans \nby repealing things such as the marriage penalty and by repealing \nthings such as the death tax.\n  Here is what I do not understand. Why is it risky to give $483 \nbillion of non-Social Security surplus back to working families but it \nis not risky to spend $494 billion on some 80 new programs? Why is it \nrisky to let the American families spend the money and why is it not \nrisky to let the Government spend the money? Do our Democrat colleagues \nbelieve that the Government can spend this money better than the family \ncan spend it? Does anybody believe that if we have a crisis that we \nwill really go back and eliminate these 80 programs and get the $494 \nbillion back? If we did, it would make history because we have not done \nit. There have been numerous occasions that Congress has raised taxes \nafter giving a tax cut.\n  I simply repeat the point that gets lost in all this political \nrhetoric, with all the talk about debt reduction: You have to go back \nto when Jimmy Carter was President to find a budget that spends as much \nmoney as does the new Clinton budget. It spends $494 billion on new \nprograms over the next 5 years. That is more money than anyone has \ntalked about in terms of tax cuts. Why is it risky to give the money \nback to working people and not risky to have Government spend it? That \nis the unanswered question in this whole debate.\n  Let me conclude by making two additional points. We have had a lot of \namendments on Medicare. The President is talking about Medicare. I want \nto remind my colleagues that five Members of the Senate and 12 other \nAmericans who had some knowledge of Medicare and health care in general \nwere appointed to a bipartisan commission where President Clinton \nappointed four of the members; the leadership of both Houses appointed \nsix members each; and they jointly appointed a Chairman, Senator John \nBreaux.\n  With all this talk about Medicare, we had an emerging consensus in \nthe Breaux commission that would have reformed Medicare and would have \nprovided prescription drugs to Americans who had a modest income and \nhad a difficult time paying for their pharmaceutical benefits.\n  We would have done it in the context of reform, where we did not \njeopardize other Medicare benefits, where we did not jeopardize the \npharmaceutical coverage that other Americans had who had the ability to \npay for it; but we had a responsible, bipartisan reform program, and we \nprovided pharmaceuticals for seniors who needed the help. Help those \nwho need the help; do not destroy the coverage of those who already \nhave it--roughly 65 percent of all seniors--and do not jeopardize the \nfuture of Medicare. It was a pretty good proposal.\n  What happened to the Breaux commission report? It failed by one vote \nbecause every single appointee of President Clinton voted no. So while \nwe have all this rhetoric today about Medicare, I think it is important \nto remember that the Medicare commission failed by one vote to reach a \nconsensus, and four of the ``no'' votes were by the four people the \nPresident appointed. At some point, I would like to get that commission \nback together to try again to come up with a bipartisan solution.\n  A final point, and then I will yield the floor.\n  What we have shown on this chart is the history of spending on \nnondefense discretionary spending. This is money that we are not \nrequired by law to spend on things such as Medicare and Social \nSecurity. These are discretionary programs. And we are not talking \nabout defense. We are talking about nondefense programs.\n  What this shows is, over the last 5 years we have done a relatively \ngood job of controlling spending.\n  The President has consistently urged us to start massive new spending \nsprees, but we have refused to do that over the 5-year period.\n  One of the reasons this budget has been difficult to write is that in \nlooking at the last 5 years individually, in 1996, when we had just \nelected a Republican majority, we actually were able to reduce spending \nin real terms by 4.1 percent. Then real spending grew by 1.8 in 1997; \n0.8 in 1998; 3.6 percent in 1999; and then by a whopping real 4.7 \npercent in the year 2000.\n  The point is, there is a real danger that this surplus is going to \nburn a hole in our pocket. There is a real danger that in the midst of \nthis great opportunity to rebuild the base of Social Security, to \nreform Medicare and provide prescription benefits to people who cannot \nafford the benefits themselves, with an opportunity to let working \nAmericans who face the highest tax rates ever in American history keep \nmore of what they earn, unless we are careful, we are going to end up \nspending this non-Social Security surplus.\n  We will have some votes later today or tomorrow where there will be \nefforts to strike points of order in the budget which represent our \ndiscipline in trying to stay with the budget we have adopted. Despite \nall the rhetoric about cuts, there are no cuts in this budget. Defense \nspending grows by almost 5 percent, and nondefense spending grows \nfaster than inflation. How many families in America would say they have \na lower family budget if their income grew by more than inflation did \nthis year? Nobody would say that. But then we are not constrained to \nlogic or reason or fact when we are talking about these budgets.\n  I urge my colleagues, in this golden moment of economic prosperity, \nwhen revenues are gushing into the Treasury, when Americans are working \nand prospering and rejoicing in it, we have an opportunity to fix \nSocial Security forever with an investment-based system so that we \ndon't have to cut benefits of people who are retired today and so that \nyoung people will own their own investments to pay for their \nretirement. We have an opportunity to fix Medicare with reasonable \nreforms that promote economy and efficiency and that help people who \ncannot afford pharmaceuticals to get them without destroying the \ncoverage that 65 percent of our citizens have. And we have a chance to \ndo things that need to be done--repeal the marriage penalty, repeal the \ndeath tax.\n  If we keep this spending spree underway, if we keep spending more and \nmore money, in the end those things are not going to get done. What we \nneed to do is to try to exercise the kind of responsibility that \nAmerican families exercise when they look further than just the moment, \nwhen they look at their future and look at the problems they face and \nopportunities they have.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts to offer a resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the matter that is before the \nSenate at the present time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment numbered 2926 offered by the \nSenator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, to get back to the Bingaman amendment, I \nwill take a few moments of the Senate's time to spell out where we are \ntoday in the area of education. I think most Americans believe there \nought to be a partnership between the Federal Government, the States, \nand local communities. Most parents want to make sure their children \nare advanced in terms of academic achievement and accomplishment. Most \nAmericans want to see opportunities for continued education available \nto their children. Most Americans understand and support programs that \nwill assist gifted and talented needy children who want to continue \ntheir education by getting some help to further their education.\n  It is important, as we are considering the budget amendment of \nSenator Bingaman, that we look over exactly where we are and examine \nwhat has been the record of the Republican leadership on the help and \nassistance to education in recent years.\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\n  The 2001 GOP budget resolution, I believe, deserves a failing grade \non education. It is anti-education, it is anti-children, and it is \nanti-family. The Republicans claim their budget makes a substantial \ninvestment in education, but, as we have had to do every year since the \nGOP took the majority in Congress in 1995, we must be equally vigilant \nof Republicans when it comes to education funding. Over and over, we \nhave heard their rhetoric, but the reality is just the opposite. They \nsay they want to invest in education, but their record shows they won't \nand don't. Year after year it is the same story.\n  If we look back at the contrast between 1980 and 1999, the Federal \nshare of education funding has declined. This demonstrates what percent \nof the Federal budget was going for elementary and secondary education: \n11.9 percent in 1980; 7.7 percent in 1999. In higher education, it was \n15.4 percent, and now we are down to 10.7 percent. This is what we have \nhad over the last few years: a major withdrawal of Federal \nparticipation in the area of aid to both elementary-secondary as well \nas higher education.\n  Having seen the percentage of our budget allocated to education, look \nat what has happened to the enrollment in K through 12. In 1990, 46.4 \nmillion students were enrolled in school. We are up to 54.4 million and \ncontinuing to rise. We have seen this incredible expansion of the \nnumber of children attending K through 12, increasing pressures on \nlocal communities, increasing pressures on the State, and increasing \npressures, obviously, if we are going to meet our responsibility. The \ntotal number of enrollment has been growing steadily--every community \nin this country can tell us that. Talk to the school boards, talk to \nthe parents, talk to the teachers. However, our percent of GNP is \ndecreasing in education.\n  Look what is happening in higher education, the millions of Americans \nwho are attending colleges and universities across this country. It has \ngone from 12.2 million in 1985 up to an estimated 15.6 million in 2005. \nAn increase in the total number of K through 12 students, an increase \nin the number of students attending higher education, and what has been \nthe corresponding Federal response? A decline in terms of helping and \nassisting families across the country.\n  Let's look at the record of the Republican history of cutting \neducation funding in appropriations bills.\n  In 1995, when the Republican leadership took control of the House and \nthe Senate, we had a rescission. The money had already been \nappropriated. The President signed it. We had a request to cut back, \nbut of all the different areas of the Federal Government, we only cut \nfunding in the area of education. This is about the same time the \nRepublican leadership wanted to abolish the Department of Education. \nTheir 1996 budget would have reduced the Federal investment in \neducation by one-third over 7 years, forcing deep cuts in Head Start \nand aid to elementary and secondary education, freezing funding for \nPell grants, and slashing $10 billion from student loans.\n  Their 1997 budget would have slashed education by 20 percent over six \nyears, causing 1.3 million students to lose Pell grants, and 344,000 \nchildren to lose Title I support.\n  Their 1999 and 2000 budgets were no different. They claimed to invent \nin education, but the numbers always added up to a loss for students, \nfamilies, schools, and colleges across the country.\n  This is the fact, Mr. President. We can go through all kinds of \nshenanigans and gimmicks, but these are the facts. They are printed in \nthe Record. The current Republican budget will cut education by $4.7 \nbillion below President Clinton's level. It is no surprise that they \nrefuse to address basic education priorities. Once again, the GOP \nbudget fails to meet the obvious need. Parents want the help today. \nParents want to improve the quality of education now.\n  The Republican budget claims a $4.5 billion increase in Department of \nEducation programs in fiscal year 2001. But, $2.3 billion of that \namount is for a new mandatory program that is not contained in current \nlaw, and if it were, it would not direct funding to states until at \nleast 2005.\n  That leaves an increase of $2.2 billion for discretionary education \nprograms in the jurisdiction of the Department of Education. But, the \nRepublican budget also assumes a $700 million increase in Pell grants, \nto increase the maximum grant by $200 to $3,500--bringing it to the \nPresident's level. In addition, it claims a $2.6 billion increase for \nelementary and secondary education programs. That's a total increase of \n$3.3 billion specified for K-12 education programs and Pell grants. \nBut, the Republican resolution only allows for a $2.2 billion increase.\n  That means the Republican budget robs Peter's education to pay for \nPaul's education. It would force $1.1 billion in cuts, below last year \nfor higher education.\n  Now, the Budget Committee will say: Well, we have $2.3 billion that \nwe may appropriate, and it will be mandatory spending to try to help \nschools improve themselves. We want to try to help improve the schools \ntoday. That is what the President wants--that is what this amendment is \nabout. It is about today and trying to get sufficient resources to try \nto help families across the country.\n  So that is the spread, Mr. President. Look at what happens when we \nlook at the particular expenditures in the areas of higher education, \nas well as in K through 12. With the President's request, we have a \n$500 million increase in the fiscal year 2001. This includes all higher \neducation funding, except Pell grants. The President's would be $500 \nmillion.\n  The Republican's 2001 budget resolution forces $1.1 billion in cuts, \nbelow last year for higher education. Do we understand that? That is \nthe reality. We are talking now about higher education funding, except \nfor Pell grants. Where are these cuts? I haven't heard a great deal of \ntalk from those on the Budget Committee.\n  The College Work-Study program would be cut by $282 million below the \nPresident's request, reducing the ability of 286,000 students to work \ntheir way through college. Massachusetts students would lose $14 \nmillion in funding for college work study opportunities.\n  TRIO would be cut by $222 million below the President's request, \ndenying an additional 195,000 disadvantaged students the opportunity to \nprepare for college and attend college. This is a reduction in the TRIO \nProgram, which is the program to try to help gifted and talented, first \ngeneration college students go on to college.\n  Under the Republican budget, GEAR UP would be cut by $169 million \nbelow the President's request, denying 810,000 low-income middle and \nhigh school students access to academic and support services needed to \nincrease their academic achievement and to prepare them to pursue a \ncollege education. With the money appropriated last year, 80 percent of \nthe seventh graders in the city of Boston will have a chance to move on \nto graduate together and hopefully will be guaranteed, when they do \ngraduate, that they will be qualified and able to go to college.\n  Colleges and middle schools are working together to provide \nadditional help and assistance to students by educating their families \nabout the importance of a college degree. They are getting whole school \ncommunities to think that college is a reality for their children. The \nTRIO Programs have been an excellent model for building cohorts of \nyoung people from different schools. GEAR UP's objective is to build \nthe capacity of under-achieving schools by getting all of their \nstudents to think about college early, prepare for college, and move on \nto achieve the highest education level possible. We have seen \nextraordinary success in different parts of the country where this \nprogram has been implemented. These important programs would be \nsignificantly cut back by the budget resolution.\n  The Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants program would also be \ncut by $199 million below the President's request, reducing support for \n346,000 needy undergraduate students. Massachusetts would lose $9 \nmillion that helps its colleges and universities provide needy \nundergraduate students with additional financial aid. That adds up to a \n$1.1 billion cut.\n  Make no mistake about the great importance of this amendment. If you \nare concerned about the higher education cuts, now look what happened \nhere on K through 12 education programs.\n\n[[Page S2165]]\n\n  The Republican budget cuts K through 12 education programs by $1.4 \nbillion below the President's request. The other side can say they put \non an additional $1 billion in special education. We agree on \nincreasing funding for IDEA--our amendment will match that level. But, \nit's still not enough. All we are trying to do is make sure these other \nprograms are getting adequate funding. The Republican budget does \nnothing to ensure the pressing education needs of families and \ncommunities across the country will be met, and ensure new, substantial \ninvestments in what works.\n  But I remind our friends that when we had the opportunity, even a \nyear ago, when the Republicans had their $780 billion tax cut and a \nnumber of us offered an amendment to try to provide full funding for \nspecial education needs and reduce the tax cut for wealthy individuals, \nvirtually every Member of this side voted in favor of it and there was \nRepublican opposition to it. We are glad we have an additional billion \ndollars. But if we are going to compare apples to apples and oranges to \noranges, we can say this is an increase of $2.6 billion, and that would \nbe $4 billion, but you still have the dramatic spread in the area of K \nthrough 12.\n  The Bingaman/Kennedy/Murray Education amendment would reverse these \nunacceptable cuts in the GOP budget and increase the national \ninvestment in education by $5.6 billion in FY2001 and $34.7 billion \nover 5 years. It will give parents and communities the support they \nneed to provide every child with a good public school education, and to \nsend every qualified student to college. It would reduce the tax cut by \n15% in the first year, and 18% over 5 years. It would use 14% of the \non-budget surplus over 5 years.\n\n  The Republican budget cuts $450 million from the President's request \nfor the bipartisan class size reduction program, preventing the hiring \nof 20,000 additional qualified teachers to reduce class size in grades \n1-3. Massachusetts communities would lose $7.3 million to help them \nfurther reduce class size next year.\n  Our amendment continues the national commitment to smaller classes by \nproviding $1.75 billion to continue the effort to hire 100,000 teachers \nto reduce class size in the early grades. The funding will bring the \ntotal number of qualified teachers hired to 49,000.\n  Research has documented what parents and teachers have always known--\nsmaller classes improve student achievement. In small classes, students \nreceive more individual attention and instruction. Students with \nlearning disabilities are identified earlier, and their needs can be \nmet without placing them in costly special education. In small classes, \nteachers are better able to maintain discipline. Parents and teachers \ncan work together more effectively to support children's education. We \nalso know that overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and decrease \nstudent morale.\n  Project STAR studied 7,000 students in 80 schools in Tennessee. \nStudents in small classes performed better than students in large \nclasses in each grade from kindergarten through third grade. Follow-up \nstudies show that the gains lasted through at least eighth grade, and \nthe gains were larger for minority students.\n  STAR students were less likely to drop out of high school, and more \nlikely to graduate in the top 25% of their classes. STAR students in \nsmaller classes in grades K-3 were between 6 and 13 months ahead of \ntheir regular-class peers in math, reading, and science in grades 4, 6, \nand 8. Michigan, California, Nevada, Florida, Texas, Utah, Illinois, \nIndiana, New York, Oklahoma, Iowa, Minnesota, Massachusetts, South \nCarolina, and Wisconsin have initiated or considered STAR-like class \nsize reduction efforts.\n  Our amendment helps communities modernize their schools by providing \n$1.3 billion in grants and loans for the urgent repair of 5,000 public \nelementary and secondary schools in high-need areas. States will be \nable to issue $25 billion in interest-free bonds to help build and \nmodernize 6,000 schools.\n  Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. 14 \nmillion children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in \nsubstandard buildings. Half of all schools have at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental condition. The problems with ailing school \nbuildings are not the problems of the inner city alone. They exist in \nalmost every community--urban, rural, or suburban.\n  In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, \ncommunities need to build new schools in order to keep pace with rising \nenrollments and to reduce class sizes. Elementary and secondary school \nenrollment has reached an all-time high this year of 53.4 million \nstudents, and will continue to grow. The number will rise by 324,000 in \n2000, by 282,000 in 2001, and by 250,000 in 2002. It will continue on \nthis upward trend in the following years.\n\n  According to a report this year, total unmet school modernization \nneeds, including technology and infrastructure, totals $307 billion--\nalmost three times the amount estimated in 1995.\n  This amendment expands after-school opportunities for children by \nincreasing funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers from \n$453 million to $1 billion for FY2001.\n  Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years old, are \nhome alone after school. Juvenile crime peaks in the hours between 3 \np.m. and 6 p.m. Children unsupervised are more likely to be involved in \nanti-social activities and destructive patterns of behavior.\n  Children who attend quality after-school programs while their parents \nwork have better peer relations, better emotional adjustments, better \ngrades, and better conduct in schools. They have more learning \nopportunities and more enrichment activities. Research also shows that \nstudents participating in after-school programs have higher achievement \nin reading and math, are more interested in learning, are more likely \nto stay in school, and are less likely to be involved in crime.\n  Our amendment supports tough accountability for results, by \nincreasing funding for Title I Accountability grants by $116 million to \n$250 million, to accelerate efforts by states and school districts to \nturn around failing schools.\n  Stronger accountability in education is imperative. Effective \naccountability steps--what business leaders call quality control \nmeasures--can make sure that public tax dollars are used wisely and \nproduce better results for children.\n  Despite concerted efforts by states, school districts, and schools, \nthe accountability provisions in Title I have not been adequately \nimplemented due to insufficient resources. In 1998, only 8 states \nreported that their support teams have been able to serve the majority \nof schools in need of improvement. Less than half of the schools in \nneed of improvement reported that they received additional professional \ndevelopment or technical assistance.\n  We must make all our schools accountable for good teaching and \nimproved student achievement. We cannot turn our backs on low-\nperforming schools. We must do all we can to improve them. Schools, \nschool districts, and states need additional support and resources to \naddress weaknesses soon after they are identified.\n  The amendment increases support for Title I by $1 billion to ensure \nthat the neediest students get the extra help they need to succeed in \nschool. Disadvantaged communities need more help to ensure that all \npublic schools give children a good education. Title I is working in \nmany schools across the country. We should help bring that success to \nevery community.\n  Ninety-nine percent of Title I funds go to local school districts. In \naddition, Title I and other federal programs are much more targeted to \nhigh-poverty districts than state and local funds.\n  More than 80 percent of poor school districts, and almost half of all \ndistricts nationwide, report that Title I is ``driving standards-based \nreform in the district as a whole.'' In addition, Title I funds, as \nwell as other federal education funds, are more targeted to high-\npoverty districts than state and local funds. Title I now supports 95% \nof the highest-poverty schools and is helping these schools to \ndramatically improve student performance.\n  As I mentioned, in the higher education, we are talking about the \nGEAR UP program, which reaches out to low- and middle-income high \nschool students to help them so they can continue on to higher \neducation. The amendment increases funding for GEAR UP by $125 million \nto $325 million, to put more low-income middle\n\n[[Page S2166]]\n\nand high school students on the path to college. This increase will \nsupport at least one state or local partnership in every eligible \nstate. It will also leverage the resources of more than 2,400 community \norganizations and businesses as partners, and provide services to 1.4 \nmillion low-income students.\n  Our amendment would also increase funding for TRIO by $80 million to \n$725 million, to expand and improve postsecondary outreach and student \nsupport programs for 760,000 minority and disadvantaged students.\n  Our amendment increases the maximum Pell Grant by a total of $400--\nfrom the current maximum of $3,300 to $3,700.\n  Pell Grants are the most effective way to make college a reality for \nthe nation's neediest students. Yet, today, the maximum grant is worth \nonly 86% of its 1980 value in constant dollars. Clearly, we have fallen \nbehind. We are failing to maintain our commitment to make college \naccessible to the neediest students.\n  I am pleased that the Committee accepted the Feingold-Smith amendment \nto increase the maximum Pell grant by $200 to $3,500. But it's not \nenough.\n  The average family income of Pell recipients is $14,500. In 1997-98, \napproximately 87% of all Pell Grant recipients had incomes less than or \nequal to $30,000. These students come from working families who \nsacrifice to make sure that their children can go to college. These \nparents understand the importance of education, and they want to make \nsure that their children have every advantage.\n  Opening the doors of college to more students should be a high \npriority for Congress. Nearly 4 million students received Pell Grants \nin 1999. Our $400 increase translates into 96,000 new Pell grant \nrecipients. In Massachusetts, 4,000 additional students would receive \nPell Grants.\n  Our amendment also increases funding for College Work-Study by $77 \nmillion to $1 billion, which will give 1 million students the \nopportunities to work their way through college.\n  Now, Mr. President, finally, I want to mention an extraordinary \nfactor in higher education. Mr. President, we know that 89% of children \nwho come from families with incomes over $74,000 attend college, but \nonly 40% of children from families with incomes below $25,000 attend \ncollege and only 1 in 4 attend a 4-year college. May I have 5 more \nminutes on the resolution?\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 more minutes on the resolution to the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you. Family income should not determine whether a \nchild goes to college--their academic achievement should be the only \nfactor to consider. Let's promise kids a level playing field for \ncollege. Let's make sure that if a student is qualified to attend \ncollege, the money will be there so that they have the credentials that \nthey need to more fully participate in our economy than their parents \nwere able to participate.\n  That is a family value, Mr. President. We hear many around here talk \nabout family values. Minimum wage is a family value--about respect for \nwork and people having an opportunity to live with dignity. A family \nvalue is the quality to be able to succeed and continue their education \nat a time when it is essential if they are going to have any economic \nopportunities. Every year, we cut back on that opportunity and reduce \nand fly-specking this particular budget, and we diminish this country \nand the promise it has for the children of this Nation. That is what \nthis amendment is about. The Democrats believe we ought to invest in \nthe young people of this country. We believe that is a higher priority \nthan tax breaks for the wealthy individuals.\n  We will have an opportunity to call the roll on that. We hope we are \nnot going to be denied that chance by our good Republican friends. \nLet's have a vote on this particular measure. I stand with those who \nsay if you deny us an opportunity with a second-degree amendment, we \nare coming back again and again on this budget resolution until we get \na vote.\n  What are they going to be frightened of in terms of this particular \namendment? We are either going to stand for working families, the \nchildren of working families, and for talented young people to be able \nto have their dream and be part of the American dream, or we want to \nnickel and dime them in order to have a tax break for wealthy \nindividuals in this society. You couldn't have a clearer opportunity on \nthe issue of priorities: Who is going to stand with the young people in \nthis country today, and who is going to stand for a tax cut?\n  I hope when the time comes, this body will support the Bingaman \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend to the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts 15 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Nevada. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, whose passion and \nunderstanding of this issue provide the most important leadership in \nthe country with respect to the question of education.\n  I join him on the floor of the Senate in an absolute state of \nincredulity that the Republicans can turn their backs so brazenly and \nso overtly on the educational opportunities that are needed for young \npeople in our country.\n  We just had a conference in Massachusetts last Saturday with many \nleaders of what is called the ``new economy.'' I think we are getting \nlost in all of this talk about a new economy and an old economy. What \nwe are seeing is an economy in transition. It is in transition because \nwe are moving into a very different world --a world where skills are \nmore needed than ever before. Every single day, we talk about the \neconomy and its changes--about the knowledge-based economy. The \npresumption is that people are able to get the knowledge on which that \neconomy is based, that they are able to get the skills.\n  But at this conference in Boston, which is one of the leading cities \nin the Nation experiencing the changes in the economy today, we had \nleader after leader after leader of new technologies, not just the \nInternet--everybody talks about the Internet and the Internet \ncompanies, but there are a host of companies on which this new \nopportunity is based--but companies in biotechnology, artificial \nintelligence, robotics, advanced materials. You could run down a long \nlist of critical technologies where the United States of America is in \nthe lead today.\n\n  But guess what. We have a bill before the Senate to raise the number \nof visas which permit people to come into the country to fill technical \nslots. They are called H-1Bs. The level of H-1Bs was at 65,000. It was \nas high as 115,000 for a year or so. Several pieces of legislation are \nnow seeking to enable up to 200,000 people to come in. But the leaders \nof the new revolution in our economy tell us that we are anywhere from \n400,000 to 1 million people behind where we need to be in terms of \nhiring.\n  Here we are with a bill that might let in several hundred thousand at \nthe end of this year or next year when the demand is 400,000 to a \nmillion, and when countless numbers of our citizens are facing a \ntransition in their life--movement from the old kind of job to the new \nkind of job or the hope that they are going to be able to find some \nkind of job in the new economy where they can share the higher salaries \nthat so many Americans are beginning to experience.\n  What do the business titans tell us? What are those leaders and \nentrepreneurs who are breaking the ground of the new economy --who, I \nmight add, are in a voracious race with other countries for the market \nshare. We are not the only people experiencing this. You go to Europe; \nyou have all kinds of companies racing to try to grab their share of \nthe markets. You go to Asia; the one thing leaders in Asia will tell \nyou today is that they are focused on education. The one thing leaders \nof Europe will tell you they are focused on--and also in Latin \nAmerica--is education because only by educating Americans ultimately \nare we not only going to provide the labor pool to be able to fill the \njobs of this new economy, but, quite frankly, only by educating \nAmericans are we going to have a citizenry that is capable of managing \nour own democracy and making the difficult kinds of decisions we will \nface in the future.\n  So one would think the Senate in facing this reality--it is not a \npartisan reality. Most of these leaders of industry\n\n[[Page S2167]]\n\nwho are telling us in the Senate to wake up and pay attention to \neducation are Republicans. They will tell us it is long since overdue \nthat the United States make a more pronounced commitment to the \neducation system of the country.\n  I know we don't run the education system at the Federal level, and \nnone of us is advocating that we should. I understand that. I know no \none wants Washington telling the local community what to do. I \nunderstand that. I don't want to tell them what to do. I would like to \nempower them to be able to do what they know they want to do but can't \ndo because they don't have the resources.\n  All over this country, there are communities in rural areas and urban \ncenters of the Nation where they don't have the tax base. In the United \nStates of America, for some reason that is beyond me, we still base our \nschool systems on the property tax, which is part of the old agrarian \nstructure we had when we first founded our public school system. And \nyet, in the urban centers and in many rural centers where they don't \nyet share in the kinds of salaries or the kinds of opportunities as do \nother parts of the country, they don't have a property tax capacity to \npay the teachers more money, put the equipment into the school, have an \nextended schoolday, have the kind of laboratories for language that \nthey need, do the kinds of remedial work with students who are \ntroubled, have dance, arts, music, sports, and the kinds of things that \nare the real stuff of a complete education.\n\n  What do these districts do? In some cases, they have received help \nfrom States because the States have engaged in education reform, and \nthere is a State revenue sharing process. But where is the Federal \nGovernment? Where is the great equalizer which, as a matter of national \npriority, is supposed to help provide the kinds of empowerments to \ncommunities that federalism embraces? That is the whole notion of a \nnational government. It is the whole notion of a Federal system of \nsharing so that all parts of the country are uplifted simultaneously.\n  We have some great public schools in Massachusetts. We have some \ngreat public schools in some urban centers where mayors have paid \nparticular attention to help scrounge up enough money. But even in \nthose areas, they are desperate for additional Federal assistance and \nfor more capacity to do the things they know they need to do. Yet here \nwe are with a budget resolution on the floor of the Senate which gives \na very meager increase to the special needs side of the ledger. We are \nhappy for some increase on the special needs side, but we fundamentally \nreduce the capacity of our schools to face this most important mission.\n  It ought to be an acceptable national priority that our citizens are \nwell educated. It may be a responsibility of the local level to \nactually do it, but it is certainly a Federal priority that it is done. \nIf we have the capacity by leveraging resources to the local \ncommunities to empower those local communities to be able to achieve \nthat national priority, we ought to do it.\n  Americans may not be aware that in the budget we are about to spend \n$1.8 trillion of collected taxpayers' money. People ask, My God, out of \n$1.8 trillion we cannot find $5 billion additional for education?\n  A lot of that budget obviously goes to pay for the entitlement \nprograms, including Social Security, Medicare, military retirement, and \nFederal and civilian disability benefits. We will spend over $1 \ntrillion of the $1.8 trillion on all of the entitlement programs, which \nno one has suggested we will suddenly cut or stop. Then we have the \ndefense spending as well as everything else the Government does that \nwill come out of the remaining $600 or $700 billion. Out of that $600 \nbillion, we have to make interest payments on the national debt, pay \nfor our defense, build our highways, channel our harbors, finance mass \ntransit, pay for housing assistance, nutrition programs, finance health \nresearch, public health programs, fund crime control, drug trafficking, \nand foreign aid, which is minuscule compared to the total budget. All \nof these are by choice of our majority, and when measured against other \nsignificant choices, it leaves precious little money for education.\n  Why? Because they want to give a $150 billion, 5-year tax break to \nthe wealthiest people in America. Every single tax break they have ever \nbrought to the floor of the Senate has been with 60 percent or more \ngoing to the top 20 percent of income earners of America. I have gladly \nvoted for many of the tax cuts we have given over the last years I have \nbeen in the Senate. In the year 2000, we are looking at about a 1-\nmillion-person gap in the high-skilled labor needs of this country.\n\n  Kids in our schools test ahead only of Cyprus and South Africa in \nmath and science. Kids in our country are reading at a 1988 level that \nhasn't progressed since then. Because of the property tax revolution in \nCalifornia, Massachusetts, and a lot of other States, we saw the \nschools decimated over the last 10 years. Programs were cut, libraries \nwere shut, and teachers' pay was not raised. We now need 2 million \nadditional teachers in the course of the next 10 years. We need 1 \nmillion of those teachers over the course of the next 5 years.\n  It is precious hard to find a kid out of most colleges who says, I \nwant to teach, when teaching means starting anywhere from $22,000 \nthough $27,000, and after 15 years of teaching and getting a master's \ndegree you can get into the thirties and the forties, depending on the \nsystem in which you are working in this country. Their colleagues from \ncollege will be earning $40,000 and $50,000 a year within a couple of \nyears of getting out of college. College graduates today have $50,000 \nor $100,000 in loans and have to begin paying back those loans \nimmediately.\n  What kid at the top percentile of their class, with $100,000 in \nloans, will say, yes, I will go into an urban center at $20,000-plus a \nyear, so I never have a chance to send my kids to college unless they \nget a scholarship or I somehow qualify for assistance? If that isn't a \nnational emergency, I don't know what is a national emergency.\n  Yet this budget does nothing to address the question of how the \nFederal Government is going to assist these revenue-starved communities \nto be able to deal with the problem of education in this country. It \ndoes nothing to answer the question of executives across the Nation \nabout how they will have a skilled labor pool in the future that will \nbe able to address the question of education. It goes backwards. Under \ntheir proposal, there will be a cut.\n  The President has proposed a hiring of teachers to reduce class sizes \nso we get a nationwide average of 18 students per class. But what \nhappens? Under their proposal, 20,000 new teachers could not be hired \nin order to do that. It cuts $540 million from the President's request \nfor 21st century community learning centers where approximately 1.6 \nmillion school-age children in over 6,000 new centers would have access \nto before- and afterschool programs. Again, it defies common sense to \nbelieve we are going to continue to turn our backs.\n  I do understand some of it. I understand some of our colleagues on \nthe Republican side of the aisle don't want to put money into the \nFederal education system unless it is done in one way--maybe a big \nblock grant that has no targeting whatever with respect to any of the \npriorities we might embrace as a Federal Government.\n  For instance, if we happen to believe it is important in certain \nStates that Head Start be a priority or that afterschool programs be a \npriority or early childhood intervention be a priority, and we think as \na matter of Federal priorities it is very important that at least the \nFederal Government say, hey, you go decide how you want to spend the \nmoney--if you want to put it into this kind of child care or that kind \nof child care, that is your business; we just want to make sure some of \nit goes to child care; that is all we are looking for--we cannot even \nget that kind of an agreement.\n  The great divide in the Senate is over putting some money into a \ngrant where there is so much discretion that States that have never \nchosen to do any of these things could continue to choose not to do any \nof these things. Is that a smart expenditure of Federal dollars? I \ndon't think so.\n  We are not even going to have an opportunity in this budget \nresolution to guarantee that the kind of dollars that ought to be part \nof that will be part of\n\n[[Page S2168]]\n\nit. So we will see reductions in the total amount of expenditure in \norder to have some huge tax cut as a matter of priority at a time when \nthe Federal component of taxation is at its lowest level since I have \nbeen in the Senate. It seems to me we ought to be measuring our \npriorities a little bit more carefully.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to come \nto the floor and say: We put additional money into the special needs \nsector, into IDEA. They have about $1 billion that goes into IDEA.\n  All the other priorities, the real stuff of educating in America \ntoday, are in the cities and the rural areas that do not have the tax \nbase. No matter what they say about money that will go into education \nspending, there is nothing in this budget that will guarantee those \ncommunities most in need are going to find the additional funding they \nneed to address the needs of education in the country.\n  We should be talking about putting somewhere between $40 billion to \n$50 billion over the next 10 years in additional funding for education. \nWe should probably have a significant separate trust fund that \nguarantees education is going to be the kind of top priority it needs \nto be, so every school in America has the ability to keep its doors \nopen into the evening so parents--who are working extra hours, many of \nthem single parents who have their kids in child care during the day \nand would like to have ongoing education--can participate in the new \neconomy and have the ability to use school facilities well into the \nevening, even while their children may be there also getting their \nhomework done in a secure environment so they can go to school the next \nday ready to learn.\n  In community after community in the United States, there are kids on \nwaiting lists for Head Start, early childhood intervention--for all \nthose programs that bring a child to the first grade ready to learn. I \nhave talked to so many first grade teachers who tell me they have kids \ncoming into a classroom with 25 kids in a class, 30 kids in a class, \nand the kids cannot even do the elementary things kids coming to first \ngrade ought to be able to do such as early numbers or recognizing \nshapes and forms and colors. So they have to step aside and they have \nto deal with the problem of that child, magnified five, six, seven, \neight times over, and try to deal with the mainstreaming of a full \nclass of 25 kids at the same time.\n  We believe the standard of education that requires you have 18 kids \nand no more in a class is appropriate. These are the kinds of \npriorities left out of this budget. I regret that enormously. I regret \nthis budget is a negative against even the rate of growth of inflation. \nI hope we will have a chance to rectify that in the days ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have in opposition to \nthe amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 36 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield up to 20 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I \ncongratulate him on putting together this budget resolution, which was \na very difficult task in the present climate. It is ironic; when we are \nrunning surpluses, it is almost more difficult to put together a budget \nthan when we are running deficits. But through the adept and able \nleadership of the Senator from New Mexico, this budget has come \nforward. It is an excellent effort to address the issues which are \ncritical to our country, especially the issue of protecting Social \nSecurity, as he does in this budget, so no Social Security funds are \nspent for anything other than Social Security, and the effort to \nprotect some of the on-budget surplus so it will be available for debt \nreduction but also for reducing taxes for hard-working Americans who \npay that extra money in that is no longer needed by the Government.\n  The effort we are talking about today is in a number of categorical \nareas, but specifically today we are mentioning the area of education. \nI wanted to speak to the Bingaman amendment and some of the comments \nthat were made, especially by the Senator from Massachusetts, first to \ntheir inaccuracy and second their inconsistency as to how we address \nquality education in this country. In fact, I can speak to the remarks \nof both Senators from Massachusetts who have spoken on this topic \nbecause I tend to disagree rather pointedly with both of them.\n  Let me begin with Senator Bingaman's amendment. He held up a chart. \nIt has been referred to by a number of Senators on the other side. The \nchart showed how much of an increase the Democratic leadership proposed \nin spending, and then they showed the Republican budget on the same \naccount, same chart. They showed our budget being about $5 billion \nbelow what they were. What they failed to put up on the chart--which I \nfound ironic and sort of misleading, relative to the way the debate was \ngoing--is the President's number.\n  What did the President ask for in education? What the President asked \nfor in education, if they had put it on the chart, would look something \nlike this: The President asked for the greenish-blue line here. I am \nnot sure what color you would call that--aqua, I guess. The aqua line \nhere, that represents the President's request in education. Our \nrequest, what we put in the budget for education, is the red line. In \neach of the years of the budget, the Republican budget exceeds what the \nPresident of the United States asked for in education.\n  This yellow insert here--which we had to jury-rig because we did not \nactually have the chart of the Senator from New Mexico--would be the \nSenate Democratic proposal. It is a dramatic increase over what the \nPresident requested and what we have put in our budget, which is an \nincrease over what the President requested.\n  So there is a bit of inconsistency for the Members of the other side \nof the aisle to come to the floor and savage the Republicans in this \nHouse, and the Republican budget, on the issue of education and not \nmention the fact we exceeded the President's request. Why didn't they \nsavage the President's budget, too? Why didn't the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer--she said we did not care about kids--say the \nPresident didn't care about kids? Maybe she just forgot. The \nPresident's budget was actually less--less than what we have put in our \nbudget for education.\n\n  I think what we have is a classic attempt at grandstanding, trying to \nthrow more money at an issue and trying to address a problem, not by \naddressing it substantively but simply by saying: We outspent you on \nthat issue, so you don't do as well as we do on education.\n  Actually, we do very well on education. As I mentioned, we exceed the \nPresident's number in each year. It is not the dollars so much; it is \nthe way we spend the dollars that I think is important to note. This is \nwhere I have disagreements with both Senators from Massachusetts who \nrecently spoke on this matter, because there is a fundamental \ndisagreement of philosophy on how we should address education. It is \nnot a difference over money, really. As I said, our dollars exceed what \nthe President requested for education. It is a difference of \nphilosophy.\n  Stated very simply, there are two philosophical differences. The \nfirst is that on the Republican side of the aisle, we think when the \nFederal Government says to the local school districts, you must spend a \ncertain amount of money on education and we, the Federal Government, \nwill help you by paying a percentage of the cost of that spending, when \nthe Federal Government puts that type of mandate on local school \ndistricts, the Federal Government ought to live up to its obligation. \nIt ought to pay the money it says it is going to pay. Before it starts \nnew educational programs, it ought to pay for the ones it already \nrequires from the States.\n  What am I talking about here? Special education, IDEA. It has been \nalluded to by the other side of the aisle. It is almost a throwaway \nline there, at least from the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry: \nOh, sure, the Republicans will talk about IDEA, but we have done more \nabout education; we don't have to worry about IDEA.\n  IDEA is probably the most significant area you could find where the\n\n[[Page S2169]]\n\nFederal Government has failed to fulfill its obligations to the school \ndistricts of this country. It is the largest unfunded mandate which the \nFederal Government puts on the States and the school districts, and \nwhich therefore causes the States and school districts to have to pay \nfor the Federal share and, as a result, take local resources and \nreallocate them to pay the Federal obligation and, as a result, skew \nthe local budgets.\n  Local school districts, which would probably want to have better \nlanguage courses, better computers, maybe more teachers, better trained \nteachers, smaller classes, can't do any of these things, in many \ninstances, because they are having to take a large amount of their \nlocal dollars to pay for the Federal share of special education.\n  On this side of the aisle, we have said that is wrong. We have said \nit is wrong now for 4 years. Every one of the President's budgets that \nhas come up here over the last 4 years has had virtually no increase in \nspecial education funding, even though the Federal Government, when we \narrived as a Republican Senate, was only paying 6 percent of the costs \nof special ed funding in this country when it originally said it was \ngoing to pay 40 percent of the costs. Even though the Federal \nGovernment was paying such a minimal part of the cost of special \neducation, this administration has never sent us a budget that \nhas significantly increased special education dollars.\n\n  They have always taken the attitude, and it has been supported by the \nother side of the aisle: What the heck, let the local school districts \npick up the Federal share. We are going to start a new categorical \nprogram that says to the local school districts you must, in order to \nget the Federal dollars, start this new program, too, rather than \nfunding the special ed dollars which were originally owed.\n  The practical effect of that, as I have said, is to skew the local \nbudgets, and too many local school districts have been unable to do \nthings they might have wanted to do because they have had to cover the \nFederal share of special education dollars.\n  So what did we as a Republican Senate do? We changed that paradigm. \nIn the last 4 years, we have more than doubled the funding for special \neducation. We have gone from 6 percent up to almost 13 percent of the \nspecial ed dollars. In this budget, we increase it significantly again. \nIt is our No. 1 priority. Yes, it is our No. 1 priority as a Congress, \nas a Republican Congress: Fund special education because that is our \nobligation. We said we would do that back in 1976, when Public Law 94-\n142 was passed.\n  So it is not a throwaway line for us. It is something we should do. \nYes, that is where some of our dollars are flowing. When we exceed the \nPresident's budget in education spending, which we do, some of that \nexcess spending in education goes into special ed, a significant amount \nmore than what the President requested. He requested virtually none, no \nincrease.\n  So that is the first fundamental difference. We believe the special \ned student deserves to get the funds, the funding support to which the \nFederal Government originally committed.\n  (Mr. HAGEL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, why do we believe that? We believe it, \nfirst, because it is an unfunded mandate, but more important, because \nin our school districts across this country, that special-needs child \nand his or her parents are being put in the impossible position of \ngoing into school meeting after school meeting and being told that \nresources are being used to pay for their child that should be used to \npay for other children in the school district.\n  As a result, the special-needs children and their parents are being \nput in an untenable position. They did nothing wrong. The people who \ndid things wrong were the President and this administration for failing \nto fund special ed.\n  We are saying let's give the special-needs children in this country a \nlittle relief, and let's fund special ed.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The Senator from Massachusetts, who just spoke, talked \nabout how their legislation targets those schools in inner cities and \npoor areas that are most in need of this help and that our increase in \nspending will not do that. Can the Senator from New Hampshire tell me \nwhere the highest percentage of populations of IDEA students are \nlocated?\n  Mr. GREGG. Ironically, in Massachusetts, from where the Senator who \nwas just speaking comes, 30 percent of their students are coded as \nspecial needs. If one looks at it across the country, most special-\nneeds children, regrettably, do come from lower income school \ndistricts. They tend to have a higher percentage of kids in special \nneeds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I guess my question is, by putting more money into \nIDEA, are we actually sending more money into the schools on which he \nbelieves we need to be focusing?\n  Mr. GREGG. There is no question about that. As we increase special \neducation funding, the Senator from Pennsylvania is absolutely right, \nmore of that funding will be flowing to schools in lower income \ndistricts and also in rural districts.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. The second philosophical difference we have with the other \nside of the aisle is, again, highlighted by the discussion of the \nSenator from Massachusetts who said essentially there are a lot of \nStates that do not know what they are doing in the area of education \nand we, the Federal Government, do know what we are doing; therefore, \nthe programs from the Federal Government should be categorical so that \nStates live up to their obligations to do what we in the Federal \nGovernment tell them they should do in education.\n  It is essentially the attitude of ``we know best'' in Washington how \nto run the school districts across this country; that the people who \nrun the school districts--the local school boards that are usually \nelected, the local legislatures that are always elected, and the \nGovernors of States who are elected--that these individuals, for whom \neducation is usually their No. 1 priority because it is their No. 1 \nspending issue, as compared with the Federal Government which has other \npriorities like national defense, Medicare and Social Security, these \nindividuals who are almost all elected are not capable of doing their \njob.\n  That is essentially the attitude taken on the other side of the aisle \nwhen they say we in the Federal Government know best how to run \neducation and States do not know what they are doing in education; \ntherefore, our programs must be categorical. They must tell the States \nexactly what they must do with dollars coming to them from Washington.\n\n  It is a little bit of a disconnect, of course, because the dollars \ncoming from Washington did not start in Washington. They started in the \nStates. They came to Washington. Then we took 15 to 20 percent off the \ntop and sent it back to the States. Maybe they got 80 percent back, but \ncertainly not 100 percent. In any event, it is not our money in \nWashington.\n  As a practical matter, we do not know more about running a school \nthan the local school districts. I, for example, do not contend I know \nmore about the Epping School District than the people in Epping or the \npeople on the school board in Epping. When they look at their \nelementary school, they know whether they need another teacher or \nanother classroom, whether they need computers or whether they happen \nto need a new baseball field or language course. I do not know that. It \nis not my purpose to tell them how to run their school district. So our \nphilosophy of education on this side is a little different.\n  They say it is a block grant; just send the money. No, that is not it \nat all. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which we passed in \nthe HELP Committee a couple of weeks ago, will be before the Senate in \na few weeks. That bill has a brandnew approach to education. The theme \nis not that we are going to send the money back in a great big huge \nblock grant and the States can do whatever they want. It is not we are \ngoing to send it back with a targeted proposal and tell people what \nthey must do with it. It is a different approach.\n  The theme is, first, that funds should be spent for purposes of the \nchild. The child is the center of our attention.\n\n[[Page S2170]]\n\n  Second, we will look for achievement on the part of the child to be \nsure they are actually learning.\n  Third, there is flexibility.\n  And fourth, there is accountability.\n  We have reoriented these programs so that we send the money back, \nyes. For example, in our Teacher Empowerment Act, we send the money \nback in a rather large lump sum. We take the Eisenhower grants and the \nclass size money and put it together. Then we say: You can use this \nmoney, local school districts. You do not have to hire a new teacher if \nyou do not need a new teacher. You can use it to hire new teachers if \nyou want to reduce class size. You can use it to improve the ability of \nyour teachers to teach. You can use it to give teachers more support. \nYou can even use it to pay teachers. They cannot keep the really good \nteachers in the classrooms because they are being hired by the private \nsector. This is especially true of our science and math teachers who \nare leaving because the opportunities are so lucrative outside \neducation.\n  You can pay teachers more to keep them by using bonus payments. You \ncan use it for any of those things, but you have to produce results. We \nare not going to tell you how to produce results. We are not going to \ntell you that you must have 17 kids to every teacher. We are not going \nto tell you that you must have a computer in every classroom. We are \nnot going to tell you that you must have a classroom that is 6 feet by \n25 feet or 12 feet by 13 feet. We are not going to tell you how many \nbooks you must have in your library.\n  No, we say: You can get the money and use it for these defined areas, \nand you have flexibility to use it in those areas, but you have to show \nus that the academic achievement of the low-income child--because that \nis where ESEA is basically aimed in the title I funds--is improving in \nrelation to the other kids in the school. You have to have tests--not \ndesigned by the Federal Government; we are not out to design tests \nbecause that means we end up designing curriculum--tests that are \ndesigned by the local school districts and the States. Those tests have \nto ascertain annually whether or not the children in the low-income \ncategories are improving academically.\n\n  What a radical idea--we expect kids to learn. We are not going to \ntell schools how to teach. We are not going to tell schools the ratio \nof their classes. We are not going to tell schools the size of their \nclasses. What we say is take this money and show us that kids are \nlearning something and that they are improving in their academic \nachievement.\n  That is a very radical idea. It is the idea we are pushing forward as \nan approach to education. It is not a block grant. It is not: Here is \nall the money and you can do whatever you want with it. It is: Here are \nthe dollars, but we are not smart enough to tell you, the local school \ndistrict, how to improve your children's education and what you need \nbecause we cannot look into every classroom and guide every classroom, \neven though they would like to do that on the other side of the aisle.\n  On the other side of the aisle, they want to have a string running \nfrom every desk out to every classroom in America; 30,000 strings \nrunning off the desks, and pull a string here and there so every \nclassroom in America has to fall into exactly what we outline in \nCongress. That is not the approach we suggest.\n\n  The approach we suggest is, take the money and use it in a variety of \ndifferent areas; have flexibility, but then show us, prove to us, that \nachievement is improving amongst those children who are targeted with \nthe dollars. That is our approach to education. That is what is funded \nin this bill.\n  Let me remind you, one more time, what the Bingaman amendment fails \nto mention: Our funding in this bill exceeds the President's funding in \nhis budget. Therefore, our proposals in this bill make a lot of sense. \nThey address the IDEA issue; they address special ed; they address the \nneed to fund children in schools at a level that is appropriate and \nactually exceeds the President's level, and, more importantly than \nthat, they expect the kids to achieve. As a result of achieving, we are \ngoing to get a much better return for the dollars we spend.\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GREGG. Sure.\n  Mr. KERRY. It is my understanding, reading the Republican budget, \nthat $2.3 billion of the money that the Senator claims is for an \nincrease----\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will have to reserve my time. If the \nSenator wants to use his time to ask a question, I would be happy to \nyield.\n  Mr. REID. We yield, off the resolution, 3 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. My understanding is, $2.3 billion is for a new mandatory \nprogram that will not even be spent until the year 2005. That leaves an \nimmediate increase of $2.2 billion. But the Republican budget \nresolution also assumes the $700 million increase in Pell grants. That \nbrings it up to the President's level. It claims the $2.6 billion \nincrease for elementary and secondary education programs alone, of \nwhich $1 billion is reserved for the IDEA. That means you have \nsupposedly a total of $3.3 billion specified for K through 12. But the \nresolution only allows for a $2.2 billion increase because you do not \neven have an expenditure permission until 2005 for $2.3 billion. So \nthere is a lot of ``robbing Peter to pay Paul.''\n  Is that not true?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, obviously it is not true. As the Senator knows, this \nis budget authority. Maybe the Senator skipped over that point or maybe \nhe did not understand it. It is possible either way. But in either \ncase, the Senator is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is not an answer to simply say it is \nwrong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to make a comment, if I may.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Massachusetts is yielded 3 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is a classic response to simply say \nthe Senator is wrong. But there is no showing to the contrary. The \nlanguage of the budget is absolutely clear. There is no question it \nforces $1.1 billion in cuts. But the way to have a debate is--to simply \nsay it is wrong, and question whether the Senator's facts or capacity \nto even understand the facts are correct, I mean, we could talk about \nrule XIX here, but I am not going to do that. But I would suggest, we \ndeserve a better debate than that.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished manager.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington is yielded 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to offer \nmy support and thanks to Senators Bingaman and Kennedy for offering \nthis extremely important amendment.\n  Senator Kerry is exactly correct. The budget proposal before us is a \nsleight of hand. We should not be duped by that. It is very clear, in \nlooking at the budget, that it shortchanges America's students.\n  The Republican budget proposal says tax cuts for a few are more \nimportant than a first-rate education for all of our children. Their \nbudget tells students across America a tax cut is more important than \ntheir future.\n  We think that is wrong. We think that is incredibly wrong. We do not \nthink America's students should only get the spare change left over \nafter the Republican tax cut. America's students should not be the last \nin line in this budget. That is why we are offering this amendment \ntoday, to make sure all students get the resources they need to reach \ntheir full potential.\n  The Republican budget that is before us is very crafty because at \nfirst glance it looks as if education funding has been increased. But \nwhen you look closely at the numbers, it is really an empty promise. \nSenator Kerry of Massachusetts pointed that out. The rhetoric of this \nbudget does not meet its reality.\n  I do want to acknowledge one thing. This underlying budget does one \nthing right. It does fund special education programs that the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire talked so eloquently about a few moments ago. That \nis important. We agree with that. Unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S2171]]\n\nthat is the only thing this budget does well.\n  But every other education investment--whether it is reducing class \nsize or improving teacher quality or modernizing our schools--is not \ntreated as a priority in this budget. There are no guarantees in this \nbudget that those other vital education programs will get the \ninvestments they need to continue to help America's students.\n  This budget funds one program and leaves the other programs hanging. \nIt does not have to be this way. That is why I am supporting the \nBingaman amendment.\n  This amendment says we can support special education. In fact, we \nsupport the same level as the Senator from New Hampshire. We are not \ndisagreeing with that. But it says we can fund that and other key \neducation investments at the same time. We should not have to choose \nwhich students get served. We should be serving every student. This \namendment shows us how we can do that.\n  This budget's misplaced priorities will be felt in classrooms across \nthe country. I am very concerned that this budget does not provide the \nresources to help our public schools move forward. I am concerned that \nthis budget abandons the programs we know are working for students \nacross this country.\n  Parents are asking us--pleading with us--to become partners with \ntheir local districts to help them with overcrowded classrooms. This \nRepublican budget fails to make a commitment to reduce class size.\n  Teachers are asking us for more help in mastering the best ways to \nteach our children the basics. The Republican budget fails to make a \ncommitment to teacher quality.\n  Students are asking us for schools where they can feel safe and \nsecure when they get off that schoolbus or walk to school every day. \nThis Republican budget fails to make a commitment to school safety.\n\n  Parents are asking--and pleading--for afterschool programs so their \nchildren will not get into trouble or become victims of violence after \nschool. This Republican budget fails to make a commitment to \nafterschool programs.\n  Teachers and students are asking for school buildings that are \nmodern. This Republican budget fails to make a commitment to \nmodernizing our aging schools.\n  The American people are asking for a stronger commitment to the \nprograms that make a difference in their child's education. But the \nRepublicans are too focused on their exploding tax cut to meet these \nneeds of America's students.\n  This budget freezes our progress. That is why our amendment would put \nthe resources where parents and teachers and students need them the \nmost.\n  The amendment before us will ensure adequate funding for a number of \nkey educational priorities. To reduce overcrowded classrooms, this \namendment will provide $1.75 billion to continue our Class Size \nReduction Program. Any Senator here can go home to their State, to \ntheir local schools that have taken advantage of the class size money \nwe have passed over the last 2 years, and talk to teachers, and hear \nthem say the same things I hear; which is, it has made an incredible \ndifference.\n  I have teachers tell me every time I visit one of these classrooms \nthat, where 5 years ago, 3 years ago, they had 24, 25, 30 kids in a \nclassroom, that today, where they have 16, 17, 18 kids in a classroom, \nthe difference is remarkable.\n  Teachers tell me in the small classes we have provided dollars for, \nin the first, second, and third grades, that those students--every one \nof them--will be able to read at the end of this year because of that \nreduced class size. This is making a difference. We have to keep that \nobligation going. We need to keep that partnership going.\n  Schools tell me every day they could not have done it without the \ncommitment and the partnership of the Federal Government. The \nunderlying budget fails to meet that. With this amendment, we on our \nDemocratic side meet that obligation.\n  Our amendment modernizes school buildings by providing $1.3 billion. \nI was in a school a week ago where kids were in portables with no \nrunning water. In order to go to the bathroom they had to go outside in \nthe rain, which is not uncommon in my State, go to another building and \ncome back soaked. I saw kids in coats in classrooms because there was \nnot enough heat in the school buildings.\n  We recognize we have an obligation, a partnership that we need to \nprovide at the Federal level to meet these basic needs. Our amendment \ndoes that. This amendment looks at improving teacher quality. It \nprovides $2 billion for professional development to recruit new \neducators and reward excellent teachers. We all understand that we need \nto make sure we have young people today committed to becoming teachers \nfor our students tomorrow. We need to provide the dollars to partner \nwith our local schools to make sure that they can recruit those best \nand brightest among our young students to be the teachers for our \nclassrooms tomorrow.\n  This amendment ensures that students have safe educational activities \nat the end of the school day. It ensures adequate funding for \nafterschool programs. I commend Senator Boxer for her tremendous work \non this initiative. We address that in this amendment.\n  To make sure that disadvantaged students have the extra classroom \nattention they need, this amendment will increase funding for title I \nprograms by $1 billion. I have heard a lot of rhetoric in the HELP \nCommittee and on the floor about local control and sending money to the \nStates and that this is somehow miraculously going to happen. Talk to \nyour local schools, as I have; talk to your title I schools. They will \ntell you this program has changed dramatically since its inception. \nThey will tell you they have much more flexibility and local control. \nThey fear us sending a block grant to the State will mean they lose the \naccess and the ability to ensure that the money will be there for \ndisadvantaged students in the future.\n  This amendment recognizes how important title I funding is to ensure \nthat the kids at the bottom get the opportunity to learn as well. We \nincrease title I funding by $1 billion to address the incredible needs \nout there.\n  Finally, this amendment will increase funding for Pell grants, grants \nthat help disadvantaged students go to college, by $400 per year for \neach student. I would guess that my colleagues hear the same thing I \nhear when I talk to young people about the incredible amount of debt \nthey accrue when they go to college, debt they have to pay off. We have \nto make sure we allow the kids at the bottom to have access to higher \neducation. We recognize this in the amendment by increasing the Pell \ngrants for students so we can assure that more young people can go on \nto college and our best and brightest will be encouraged to go on to \ncollege no matter what their income is.\n  These are the types of investments we should be making in America's \nyoung people. Unfortunately, the Republicans have the wrong priorities \nin their budget. They are putting their tax cut ahead of the needs of \nAmerica's students. We know they are wrong, and we have introduced this \namendment to make sure our students don't lose out.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. For those members of \nthe majority who are inclined to oppose it, I want them to know this \namendment would take only 15 percent of the tax cut and put it towards \neducation. I can't think of a better priority for this Senate to \nsupport. I don't think it is too much to ask for America's students. By \nvoting for this amendment, we will be saying that the young people of \nour country are a priority. They deserve a budget that treats them as a \npriority.\n  I thank the Chair and yield my time back to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, is \nyielded 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague from Washington leaves \nthe floor, let me commend her for a very fine and eloquent statement. \nShe brings to this debate not only an intellectual commitment to the \nissue but hands-on experience from her previous life directly involved \nin the education of young children.\n  I think it is valuable for us to pay attention to our colleagues who \nbring their life experiences to this Chamber and can help us be better \nenlightened\n\n[[Page S2172]]\n\nabout what is needed. We certainly listen to our fellow colleague from \nTennessee, a good doctor, when he talks about health care issues. We \nlisten to other Members who were part of the private sector and add a \nsignificant contribution to the debate. It is a fortunate moment, \nindeed, that we have an educator, an elementary and secondary \nschoolteacher who was involved in early education, in our midst. I \nthank her for her efforts not only today but over the years on \neducation issues.\n  I also commend the author of this amendment, our colleague from New \nMexico, Senator Bingaman, and the other cosponsors of this proposal.\n  It has already been pointed out but it is worth repeating: There are \nroughly 55 million children, from Maine to California, every day \ngetting up to go to school. Of that 55 million who went off to school \ntoday, 50 million of them walked through the doors of a public school.\n  Our primary obligation is, obviously, to these students in public \nschools. That is not to say we are uninterested or not involved with \nthe 5 million who go to private or parochial schools or a home school. \nBut our fundamental, basic obligation goes to the public institutions \nthat serve all children no matter their means, needs or backgrounds. \nThat is primarily where our tax dollars flow.\n  Now, the federal investment in schools overall is small, shockingly \nsmall. Seven cents on every dollar that is contributed to the \neducational needs of children comes from the Federal Government; 93 \ncents of every dollar comes from State and local taxes. The lion's \nshare of the cost of education is borne at the local and State level.\n  Historically, we have contributed as much as 12 percent. Today, we \nare down to 7. Although that is better than some recent years when it \nwas even lower. This debate about what we do with our 7 cents may not \nseem like much, but to local communities, to parent-teacher \nassociations, to school boards, to teachers, to superintendents, to \nprincipals at the local level, this 7 cents is important. It helps \ndirect scarce and valuable resources towards those elements of national \neducational need that are most pronounced, most in demand, or should \nbe.\n  For those who argue a block grant approach to the States, we do a \ngreat disservice to our local communities, where the bulk of the \neducation costs are borne. We do a great disservice to them to deprive \nthem of the direct funding in the areas they are crying out for help. \nTo merely send a check back to the States, knowing full well that so \nmany of these local communities lack the kinds of clout and influence \nat the State level, particularly those communities, rural and urban, \nthat are most in need, is to do a great disservice to the parents and \neducators, to the citizens of those communities.\n  Outside of the dollar amounts, block grants also are a step backward \nin time as well as policy. We tried a block grant approach in the past. \nBasically, it was revenuesharing. I think the American public wants \nmore than that. They want us to offer a sense of national purpose, what \nought to be our goals, how best to achieve them, and support the \nefforts of local schools, local communities in meeting these.\n  Our goal is to get the dollars back to the community and the schools \nas fast and in the most direct, targeted way we can and not allow it to \nbe interrupted. I hope as we go through the process this year of \ntalking about the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will keep \nin mind that it is our relationship with our parents, students and \nlocal communities, not with the States, on which we ought to focus.\n\n  Beyond these policy differences, this budget highlights our \ndifferences with the funding approach of the majority. When it comes to \nresource allocation, the majority claims that they have, in fact, \nincreased spending on our schools, but the numbers just don't add up. I \nwill explain why.\n  The No. 1 priority in this budget is a major tax cut. Again, I think \nthe American public has spoken rather clearly on this issue. This \nbudget provides for $150 billion of tax cuts, at a minimum, over 5 \nyears. Paying down the debt, dealing with Medicare, Social Security, \nand improving the quality of education in this country are a distant \nsecond, if even that, to that primary goal--A tax cut. Even though \nthese other needs hold a far greater sense of priority for most \nAmericans than a large tax cut which most people think is not warranted \nin this kind of an economy, the best economy we have had in the history \nof our country. To fund this tax cut, the budget cuts overall \nnondefense discretionary programs by 6.2 percent.\n  On education, this budget claims a $4.5 billion increase in spending. \nKeep these numbers in mind. They say $4.5 billion; $2.3 billion of that \nis for a new mandatory program, a new program--it is hard enough to get \nfunding for existing ones--a new mandatory program that won't be spent \nuntil the year 2005, 5 years from now. That leaves an increase of $2.2 \nbillion of the $4.5 billion.\n  The Republican budget resolution also assumes a $700 million increase \nin Pell grants to increase the maximum grant by $200 to $3,500, and a \n$2.6 billion increase for elementary and secondary education programs \nalone, of which $1 billion of that $2.6 billion is for special \neducation. If you have had your pencils out and added this up, all of \nthese good sounding programs add up to $3.3 billion.\n  That means to simply provide funding for these stated commitments, \nand level fund other programs, this budget should provide $3.3 billion \nmore than what our colleagues said, but this budget only provides for \nthe additional $2.2 billion in spending.\n  This gap can only be filled by cutting other education programs--core \nnational efforts, such as college work-study, campus-based child care, \nTRIO, and GEAR UP would have to be cut by 22 percent to meet these \ngoals.\n  There is no great new deal for education in America in this proposal. \nThis is just another in the string of Republican budgets that undercut, \nundermine, and underfund education. The math is not complicated here. \nThey say $4.5 billion, but this isn't adequate to meet their \ncommitments. So to make up the difference within the Department of \nEducation, you would have to cut at least amount--22 percent--in the \nareas I have described.\n  We have and will continue to take a different approach on education \nfunding. This is a key national priority. In the amendment, we are \noffering we make a simple proposition--a little bit less in tax cuts, \n10 percent, in the first year, and 16 percent over 5 years, for an \nadditional $4.5 billion in education. That means cutting the $150 \nbillion tax cut by about $15 billion--a tax cut nobody wants--and \napplying it to education to make all the difference in the world for \nchildren, families, and educators across this country.\n  Let it be clear, the choice is simple here. This amendment would \nsupport our efforts to accelerate change and improvement in our \nschools. The status quo is unacceptable. Our schools are improving. \nChildren are doing better in many areas. Reading and math scores are \nup--not as high as they should be, but they are up--in nearly every age \ngroup and all the different groups of students across the country, \nparticularly in our poorest schools.\n  Mr. President, but that is not good enough. We need to accelerate the \npace of this change, and change doesn't come inexpensively. Someone \nonce said, ``If you think education is expensive, try ignorance as a \ncost.'' That is what we are going to get if we don't make intelligent \ninvestments in these programs.\n  What we propose is more resources, with more accountability and \nhigher expectation for success. The budget by the majority, which is in \nfront of us, of less funding for education goes right along with their \nproposals for education--block granting programs currently focused on \nareas of national need and concern, and transforming targeted, \nsuccessful programs into vouchers for private schools. Remember, 50 \nmillion of the 55 million students are going in the door of public \nschools. This is a recipe for failure in our public educational \nsystem--dollars frittered away on the status quo, less targeting, less \nfunding, less accountability.\n  If you want no accountability, put dollars into in a block grant. How \ndo you follow that or find out where the dollars have gone if it ends \nup in one big, large block of money that goes back to the States? How \ndo you track that and keep account of it? For those\n\n[[Page S2173]]\n\nof us who care about accountability, one sure way to get less of it is \nto have a block grant approach.\n  So we want to see less of the status quo approach. Their policies and \nfunding for them are tired, timid, and dangerous for our schools. Block \ngrants and vouchers are proven failures; why would we waste more \ndollars on them in the beginning of the 21st century?\n  Instead, our amendment proposes to reinvigorate our investments in \nour public schools--as I said a moment ago--which serve 90 percent of \nthe America's 55 million students.\n  It would provide the needed resources to train teachers across the \ncountry in reading and literacy. It would support local afterschool \nprograms for an additional 1.6 million students. It would assist local \ncommunities as they work to transform school facilities into safe, \nmodern, learning environments for all students. It would ensure smaller \nclass sizes in the early grades, when students are most in need of \nattention as they learn to read. Mr. President, it would support tough \naccountability and results in targeting resources to the schools that \nare most in need. It would also shore up our national commitment to \nsupport students as they move on to postsecondary education.\n\n  This is no litany of Federal programs. These are real initiatives we \ncan afford to do with the 7 cents--our 7 cents on the dollar spent for \nelementary and secondary education--to assist local communities, to see \nthat our towns and counties across this country get the backing and \nsupport they need in the Federal Government.\n  Ask any parent about class size; ask them about afterschool programs \nand about school safety; they are crying out for this help. That is \nwhat they want, and that is what this amendment offered by our \ncolleagues as an alternative to what is in this budget would do.\n  The choice is very clear. Can we afford to take about $10 billion or \n$15 billion over 5 years out of this tax cut proposal and put it into \nthe one area, Education, that Americans all across the economic, \nracial, ethnic, gender spectrum, say they want to see this Congress \nspend time and effort on? They have never spoken more loudly or clearly \non an issue.\n  In light of that, we think this amendment is a responsible, prudent, \nand efficient way to continue to get the accountability and resources \nnecessary to improve the quality of the education of our children as we \nsit on the cusp of the 21st century. With all of the challenges we will \nhave, we should offer nothing less than the very best we can to see \nthat local communities will have the tools to succeed in what will be \nthe most competitive environment any generation of Americans has ever \nhad to face in our 210-year history. For those reasons, I strongly urge \nadoption of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the manager of the bill is on the floor. I \nask to be yielded some time, if he would.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator will be patient a moment, how much time \ndoes the Senator want?\n  Mr. GORTON. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I have listened with great care to the \nSenator from Connecticut paradoxically claiming that to create a half \ndozen new categorical education aid programs and keeping control over \nall of them, to enable the U.S. Department of Education to write a few \nhundred pages more of rules and regulations, somehow or another \nenhances local control.\n  Mr. President, that is an Alice in Wonderland argument. A debate that \nwill be at the heart of education will take place in this body next \nmonth when the Elementary and Secondary Education Act comes to the \nfloor. By a regrettable partisan vote, that committee has proposed an \nElementary and Secondary Education Act renewal that gives more promise \nto increase the academic performance of our students than has any other \neducational debate in this body for a decade or more.\n  On one side, including the chairman of the committee whose bill that \nis before us, are those who believe in true education reform and the \nkind of innovation that focuses not on how well teachers and \nsuperintendents and principals fill out Federal forms but on how well \nour students actually do. On the other side is the attitude that the \nFederal Government knows best and that somehow or other men and women \nall across the United States of America--parents and teachers and \nprincipals and superintendents and elected school board members, most \nof them working without compensation--somehow or other don't know or \ndon't care what is best for their kids and we have to provide them with \nguidance.\n  Recently on this issue, one of my colleagues said that if we give \nthese local communities the right to set their own education \npriorities, they will likely use the money for ``building a new locker \nroom or redecorating office space.''\n  On hearing this charge, one of my superintendents, the superintendent \nof the Oak Harbor School District, had this to say:\n\n       School boards are very close to their constituencies. \n     Probably more than any other type of governing body, they are \n     sensitive to the needs and demands of their communities. \n     After all, they see their constituents on a daily basis at \n     grocery stores, soccer fields and dance concerts. A parent \n     can easily influence all five of our board members. Ten \n     parents can move mountains locally. By contrast, what \n     influence would these same people have on the education \n     department, or even Congress? The best opportunity to avoid \n     wasteful expenditures of education funds is at the local \n     level where individual citizens have the greatest power and \n     influence.\n\n  Yet what do we have from the minority party in the health committee \non this request? Twenty new Federal education programs. We already have \nteacher training programs, to early childhood programs, to programs for \ndelinquent and at-risk youths. They offered these new programs in that \ncommittee even though the General Accounting Office finds that we \nalready fund 127 at-risk and delinquent youth programs in 15 Federal \nagencies and departments, 86 teacher training programs in 9 Federal \nagencies and departments, and more than 90 early childhood programs in \n11 Federal agencies and departments. But, according to them, we need 20 \nmore to be added to all of these.\n  Our view, to the contrary, is just this. We should allow our States \nand local education agencies to make the determinations of how best to \nuse this money, and we should hold them accountable in only one way so \nthe students actually do better.\n  We have offered three alternatives. One is that any State that likes \nthe present system, that believes it is perfectly all right to fill out \nthese forms, that doesn't mind a bureaucracy with hundreds of different \neducation programs, can continue to do it the way they do it today. Any \nState that likes the present system can continue it.\n  Fifteen States will be allowed the opportunity under Straight A's \nsimply to take all of the money, give 95 percent of it to the school \ndistricts in the same proportion they get it today, and be accountable \nonly for the performance of their students. And all of the other States \nwill be allowed the program proposed by the National Governors' \nAssociation, both Democrats and Republicans, that would require title I \nmoney at least to go directly down to the school district in exactly \nthe amounts that it does today.\n  For 35 years under title I, we have attempted to reduce the disparity \nbetween title I-eligible students and the more privileged students who \nare not eligible for title I. That disparity has not increased. For the \nfirst time in these programs, we are actually offering an incentive--\nmore money to those States that work to decrease the disparity and show \nthey have actually been successful.\n  There is, unfortunately, a great gulf between the two sides on this \nissue. The one side likes the present system and, in fact, apparently \nbelieves we need more than 127 programs for at-risk and delinquent \nyouths, more than 90 early childhood programs, more than 86 different \nand distinct teacher training programs, more forms from the Federal \nGovernment and from the bureaucracy, and less trust in the ability and \ninterest of either State officials or local school officials in making \nthe determination as to what our children need to succeed.\n\n  That is simply wrong. The men and women who know our children's names \nknow best what they need to succeed in\n\n[[Page S2174]]\n\neducation. The accountability we set out for them in our proposal is \nthe most fundamental accountability of all. It is: To see to it that \nyour students do better, come up with a system of tests that show \nwhether or not they are succeeding in their academic subjects, and if \nthey do succeed, you will go forward with this flexibility; you will in \nfact get more money.\n  The difference is striking. It is a great contrast. But those who \nbelieve in local control will allow the people in our States and \ncommunities to have that control, and we will not tell them they have \nto spend their time filling out forms and following hundreds of pages \nof Federal regulations.\n  There is a great gulf between the two sides in this debate. But our \nside is the one that believes in the future of our children and \nbelieves the future can best be determined by their parents, by their \nteachers, and by their elected school board members at home.\n  To go down the road putting more money into a failed system is to put \nnew wine in old bottles. The bottles will simply burst and the wine be \nwasted.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gorton for the remarks \nhe made. I don't think people remember that when we first started this \nmovement toward more flexibility and control by local government and \naccountability, Slade Gorton offered the first amendment. And there has \nbeen a constant evolution in that direction. I personally thank him for \nit.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bingaman \namendment. The single most important thing we do as a government is \neducate our young people. What we should be doing and talking about \ntoday in this debate is making this decade ``the education decade.''\n  We have in the United States the best roads, the best technology, and \nthe best economy. But we don't have the best schools. We should be \nworking toward making our schools the envy of the world.\n  I intend to submit a sense-of-the-Senate amendment later during the \ncourse of this debate which provides that 10 percent of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus will be devoted to education. I think it is the kind \nof statement that we as a body need to make to show the American people \nwe are committed to providing the resources that are necessary to \neducate our young people.\n  If I can make just one comment in response to the Senator's remarks, \nwhat we are talking about in this debate is simply providing the \nresources for the programs that are so desperately needed, which I will \ntalk about in just a minute. We are not talking about placing \nbureaucratic restrictions on State and local school districts. I \nbelieve very strongly that we don't want our school systems run out of \nWashington. In fact, we need our school systems to be run at the State \nand local level. We need to be sure they have the flexibility to make \nthe decisions about what is best for their schools. I support that. We \nsupport that.\n  The issue we are debating today is whether we are going to provide in \nthis budget process the resources that are so desperately needed in our \npublic schools today. If we don't provide these resources, it is going \nto be impossible for our children to compete in the world. There is no \ndoubt that they will be required to compete in a global economy. Our \nresponsibility is to give them the tools to compete. They will not have \nthe tools to compete unless we provide the resources that are so \ndesperately needed by our public schools.\n  I would like to talk briefly about four areas.\n  First, afterschool programs: We have thousands and thousands of \nchildren all over this country who are on the waiting list to get into \nafterschool programs.\n  I actually have some firsthand experience with afterschool programs \nbecause my wife and I helped start an afterschool program in Raleigh, \nNC.\n  We have computers, we have technology, and volunteer tutors help \nchildren to learn technology, help them with their homework, help them \nprepare for tests. I have been able to see firsthand what happens when \nkids are put on a level playing field and they are all given a chance.\n  We know the time kids are most likely to get in trouble is between \nthe time they get out of school and the time their parents get home \nfrom work. It is nobody's fault their parents have to work. We ought to \ngive the kids a safe place to go, a safe environment where they can \ncontinue to learn and continue to be productive; equally important, \ngive them a sense of self-esteem and make them believe they have an \nequal opportunity to compete against all the students around them. I \nhave seen firsthand what happens. Their self-esteem grows, their self-\nimage grows; as a result, their engagement grows and their grades \nimprove. It happens over and over and over.\n  That is why afterschool programs are so important. This is not about \na line item on a budget, this is about the lives of our children.\n  Class size: Every teacher I encounter tells me they feel as if they \nare babysitting. It is impossible for them to teach when they have 30, \n32, 33 children in a classroom. We have to do something about that.\n  We have trouble attracting good teachers. We have trouble retaining \ngood teachers. Our responsibility is to give teachers the tools they \nneed to do the job they want to do. They are professionals. They are \nprofessionals who are in this business because they want to educate \nkids. We have to give them an environment that allows them to be \neffective. That is what reducing class size is about. Making our kids \neffective, allowing kids to have access to the teachers they say they \nso desperately want to have access to so they can learn--that is what \nthis debate is about.\n  School construction and modernization: Just a few weeks ago, I was at \nWayside Elementary School in Statesville, NC, a small, overcrowded, \nschool built more than 50 years ago. They have literally put pieces of \ncarpet all over the floor to cover asbestos tiles. The roof is leaking. \nThe children have to go outside in order to go to the bathrooms. There \nare trailers, mobile homes, everywhere. The teachers who teach in that \nschool a couple years ago got an incentive bonus. These are already \nunderpaid teachers, but instead of keeping the bonus money for \nthemselves and their families, they turned their bonuses back in to be \nused at the school. It is obvious these teachers are committed to the \nyoung people whom they are trying to educate. These kids cannot learn \nin a school that is falling apart. They cannot learn when they are \nsitting on top of each other in classrooms.\n  What kind of message does it send to the American people when these \nkids go to the local mall, all the stores are beautiful and shiny and \nnew and well built, and then they go to Wayside Elementary School, the \nbuilding is falling apart, patches of carpet are everywhere, the roof \nis leaking, and in order to go to the bathroom they have to go outside?\n  We need to do something about this. We need to put our kids in good \nquality buildings. We need to modernize the schools. We need to do it \nin a fiscally responsible and sound way. It is critically important we \nput our kids and our teachers in an environment where they can learn--\nthe teachers can teach and the kids can learn.\n  Finally, Title I: Visit the schools in North Carolina, and the one \nthing you learn immediately is, we don't have a level playing field. \nThere are some schools in Wake County and Mecklenburg County, Raleigh, \nand Charlotte that are beautiful and new with lots of technology. Go \nout into the rural areas of North Carolina, and we find schools that \nare falling apart, where they can't keep teachers. These are the \nschools at which Title I is aimed.\n  Title I has not been as successful as we would like in some areas. \nAlthough it has done very good things, there is more that needs to be \ndone. We need to make sure a child living in the country in North \nCarolina has just as good an opportunity to learn as a child who lives \nin Raleigh or Charlotte. There is absolutely no reason that a child who \nis born in Raleigh, NC, should have an opportunity for a better \neducation than a child who is born in rural North Carolina. That is \nwhat Title I is about. It is about leveling the playing field.\n\n[[Page S2175]]\n\n  There is nothing more important we can do in the Senate this year \nthan focus on education. We must send a clear and unmistakable message \nto the American people that we are willing to do whatever is necessary, \nfinancially and otherwise, to support our public school system, to \neducate our children, to give our children a chance to compete against \nevery other child in this global economy. That is what we should be \ntalking about today. That is what we should be debating. More \nimportantly, that is what we should be committing to do in this budget \nprocess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. I thank \nour Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Massachusetts and so \nmany others who have put together this outstanding amendment. This \namendment is one of the most important amendments we will vote on this \nentire year.\n  We have moved into an economy where ideas matter. As Alan Greenspan \nputs it: High value is added no longer by moving things but, rather, by \nthinking things. We cannot afford an educational system that the OECD--\nthe 22 developed nations in North America, Europe, and Japan--ranks, in \nAmerica, 15th, 16th, or 17th.\n  I think Americans have come together on two types of issues: One, \nthat we are willing to spend more money on education. We have to. When \na starting salary for a teacher is $24,000, when we have such shortages \nof classrooms, when we don't have the kinds of things we need for \nafterschool and computers and all the things that make a modern \neducation worthwhile, there is only one answer. It is money.\n  We all know the local property taxpayer who from the beginning has \nfunded education in this country is up to here in property taxes. The \nchoices are simple: Let education stagnate or let the Federal \nGovernment play a more significant role. Most Americans want us to do \nthat. It is unfortunate the budget that is put before the Senate does \nnot do that.\n  The second issue I think we all embrace in general is that we must \nhave standards in education. A student who is not reading at a third-\ngrade level should not be promoted from the fourth to the fifth grade. \nA teacher who is not certified in a subject should not be teaching it. \nWe need real standards and real accountability. Put that together and I \nthink we can come up with a significant education program that can \nbring Americans together and do the job our country needs.\n  Mark my words, if our educational system stays at the present level, \nwe will not be the leading economy in the world in the year 2025 or \n2050. This is a crisis that demands some dramatic urgency.\n  The amendment put forward by the Senator from New Mexico and others, \nincluding myself, makes a difference. Let me go over again what it \ndoes. First, it puts a qualified teacher in every classroom. There is \n$2 billion for recruitment, mentoring, and professional development of \nqualified teachers. Many of the things I have been working on, a \nMarshall Plan for teachers, are included in this amendment. We \ndesperately need it in New York. Nationally, for instance, we face a \nteacher shortage of 2.2 million over the next decade. New York faces a \nteacher shortage of 80,000 men and women over the next 5 years. How are \nwe going to get qualified teachers? Currently, only 10 States require \nand fund programs for new teachers, 12 pay veteran teachers to be \nmentors. This amendment provides those kinds of resources.\n  Second, it helps communities modernize our schools. My children \nattend the public schools in New York City. I will never forget the day \nI went to open school day for my little one, Alison's kindergarten \nclass, a few years back. There were two classes in that one \nkindergarten room. You could not hear above the voice of the teacher of \nthe other class in the other corner of the room; you could not hear \nwhat Alison's teacher was saying to her students.\n  Left alone to the localities, left with the tremendous burden the \nproperty tax puts on so many Americans, we will not modernize our \nschools. But our amendment comes to the rescue. It provides $1.3 \nbillion in grants and loans for the much needed repair of 5,000 public \nelementary and secondary schools in high-need areas. It leverages an \nadditional $25 billion in interest-free bonds to help build schools.\n  New York currently has an unmet funding need for school construction \nof $50.7 billion, one-sixth the national need of $307 billion. We \ndesperately need this part of the amendment.\n  The amendment supports tough accountability for results. To put money \ninto a program without having it be accountable, as it would be in the \nprivate sector, has been one of our failures in education--lack of \naccountability.\n  I disagree with some of my friends on the left who say that \naccountability is wrong or unmeetable. I plead with my colleagues to do \ntwo things. First, keep the bar high. That is the only way we are going \nto stay a leading country. But help provide the resources to let those \nget over that bar. The other two choices are unacceptable: to lower the \nbar or to not help people get over it. Neither is good. The tough \naccountability for results in this amendment--$116 million over last \nyear to $250 million for accountability--is vital.\n  This amendment rejects the cuts that have been proposed in impact \naid. We have, in New York State, districts such as Indian River near \nFort Drum and Highland Falls near West Point which would be devastated \nby the cut actually in the President's budget because he eliminates $94 \nmillion in impact aid. This amendment restores that.\n  Not least important, this supports a commitment to smaller classes; \n$1.75 billion to hire 100,000 new teachers and reduce class size in the \nearly grades. My daughter has seen class size grow in her public \nschool, P.S. 230. She is one of millions of American children who see \nthat.\n  We expand afterschool opportunities for children. I participated in \nafterschool programs and played basketball. It kept me in good shape. \nMany students do not have that opportunity. We increase it.\n  We increase support for children with disabilities, and we make \ncollege more affordable by increasing the individual Pell grant by \n$400.\n  These are all important things to do. Compare this with the budget \nthat has been proposed by my friends. The problem is twofold. No. 1, it \ndoes not provide those resources. We can talk and talk and talk about \neducation, but, unless we provide resources, we are not going to \nachieve our goal.\n  Most Americans support that wish. I think the other side is being \npenny-wise and pound foolish to not support increasing aid for \neducation. Ask Americans what is their No. 1 priority, above any other \nspending program, above tax cuts and above retiring the deficits. It is \neducation. The budget proposed by my friends on the other side of the \naisle does not recognize that need. It is woefully inadequate. It \nactually cuts, by $1.4 billion, from what the President did. I am the \nfirst to say what the President did in his budget was not enough in \nthis important area. It is the spending area where we most need an \nincrease.\n  No. 2, the budget envisions this block grant procedure, which I know \nmy colleagues on the other side want to move forward, in the ESEA bill \non which we will vote. In their budget, under function 500, it says:\n\n       This bill will give States greater flexibility in \n     delivering hundreds of elementary and secondary education \n     programs and will place more decisionmaking in the hands of \n     States, localities and families.\n\n  It is good rhetoric, but I will tell you I don't think we should take \nthe Federal taxpayer dollars and let it be frittered away in the same \nway we have seen money wasted in the past. We in this Congress should \nset our priorities for education. We should certainly not mandate on \nthe locality that they have to take our priorities. But if they want \nsome money, they better improve and reform their systems.\n\n  Crime is the area in which I have the most expertise. I remember when \nwe had a crimefighting block grant very similar to this proposal. One \nlocality bought a tank. Another State bought an airplane so the \nGovernor could fly from Washington to Indianapolis--it was the Governor \nof Indiana--all under the block grant process.\n  I do not get the logic. Our friends on the other side say the system \nis not\n\n[[Page S2176]]\n\nworking well enough. I agree. Then they give money to the same exact \npeople to spend in the same exact way. What sense does that make? We \nare trying to get the localities to reach to a higher goal: Lower class \nsize and we will give you some dollars; increase accountability and we \nwill give you some dollars; make better classrooms and we will give you \nsome dollars. But we are not going to give dollars--I ask the Senator \nfrom Nevada, may I have an additional 2 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New York is yielded 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we set out goals. A block grant is a \ncontinuation of mediocrity. A block grant does not give families the \npower to spend the money. It gives money so the same local \ninstitutions, many that have been mired in mediocrity, can do the same \nthing as they have been doing before. Sure as we are sitting here, if \nwe have a block grant, do you know where it is going to end up? \nAdministrators' folderol.\n  The programs in the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico are \ndesigned to do specific things that all Americans support and, more \nimportantly, even that our educational experts tell us are needed to \nimprove education. So the fact that the budget is pusillanimous, is \nstingy in the area where we most need help--education--and the fact is, \ninstead of laying out a specific guidepost based on careful analysis \nand what the experts say is needed, it just takes a ball of money and \nthrows it to a locality or throws it to a State, separating the taxing \nauthority from the spending authority. That is probably the greatest \nproblem in block grants because when you separate the taxing authority \nfrom the spending authority, you almost always get wasted money. It is \nfree money to others. Those are the two great problems in education, \nour most important priority with the budget that is put before us.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to look at that \nbudget; when they go home and make speeches about how important \neducation is, to then ask themselves how they can vote for a budget \nthat actually cuts from the President's budget by approximately $1.4 \nbillion, not including IDEA.\n  I ask my colleagues on the other side who criticize the present \nsystem, why just give, in a mass block grant, money to the same States \nand same localities that have not measured up now? Why not increase the \namount of dollars but only allow them to go into the classroom, whether \nit be teachers or new classrooms or standards for those classrooms that \neveryone, when they go back home to give speeches, seems to say we \nneed?\n  I salute the Senator from New Mexico, the Senator from Massachusetts, \nthe Senator from Washington, and all the others who have put together \nthis amendment. It is a marvelous blueprint, a well-thought-out \nblueprint of where we need to go in education. Let us stop simply \ngiving the American people rhetoric. Let us put together a concrete \nplan that makes a difference in the areas where we need to make a \ndifference, such as reducing class size, modernizing and building more \nclassrooms, improving the quality of teachers, and improving \naccountability.\n  This amendment does it. I urge my colleagues to support it and reject \nthe present budget. The budget before us is a pusillanimous and \nunfocused approach towards education.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to reserve 2 minutes. I will speak for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. President, this request has been worked out with the minority. I \nask unanimous consent that the vote occur in relation to the Bingaman \namendment at 5:30 p.m. in a stacked sequence, with no amendment in \norder to the Bingaman amendment prior to the vote and, further, that \nthere be 2 minutes for debate prior to each vote for explanation. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding back \nof time on the Bingaman first-degree amendment, the amendment be laid \naside, and Senator Allard be recognized to offer a first-degree \namendment relative to debt reduction. I further ask unanimous consent \nthat following the use of or yielding back of time, Senator Conrad be \nrecognized to offer a second-degree amendment relative to debt \nreduction, and that following the use or yielding back of time, those \nvotes occur in a stacked sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that all votes in the voting \nsequence after the first vote be limited to 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In light of this agreement, the next votes will occur \ntoday starting at 5:30 p.m. I thank all Members for their cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, to alert all Members, especially on the \nminority side, we have been told the majority leader expects to spend a \nlot of time here tonight, and the minority will offer amendments \nthroughout the evening.\n  It is my understanding the majority leader wants to get the time left \non this resolution down to single digits. We are now in high double \ndigits. We will have to work into the evening tonight to eat up some of \nthat time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes, reserving 2 \nminutes.\n  First, wherever the distinguished Senator from New York referred to \nthe Senator from New Mexico, it is more fair he say the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, because I do not want credit for something of \nwhich I am not in favor.\n  I want to make three quick arguments: First, for those who are \nlistening and those in American education who think we are going to \ndecide in detail how the money in this budget is going to be used for \neducation, I assure them the appropriations subcommittee headed by \nSenator Specter and the Senate is going to determine how the money in \nthis budget resolution is spent in education.\n  We can come to the floor and talk about all the problems in education \nand say the Bingaman amendment takes care of these things. The truth of \nthe matter is that is a wish list. That is what somebody hopes will \nhappen. What will happen is what the appropriators decide. Anybody who \nhas a wish for education can come down here today and say the Senate \nbudget resolution is going to take care of this problem in education, \nand if those listening believe it, then wait around for 3 months and \nsee what the appropriators do.\n  My second point is that there is a lot of talk about whether or not \nwe cut the President's budget. I have a Congressional Budget Office \nanalysis of our education numbers. This is what they say: The Senate's \nbudget is $47.877 billion in budget authority, program authority; the \nPresident's is $47.228 billion, a difference of $600 million more in \nthe pending resolution than that for which the President provided.\n  The baseline from which we start this year is $43.3 billion. \nEverybody can do the arithmetic. We have added more than the President \nto this function. Where it goes will be determined by the \nappropriators.\n\n  My other observation is that while in office, this President has \ncalled himself the education President. He has bragged that he has \ngotten Congress to go along with him on education. There are Members \ncoming to the floor saying these are Republican education numbers \nwhile, as a matter of fact, the President is bragging they are his over \nthe last 5 years. I do not know whom to believe, but I think we have \nincreased education significantly over the last 6 years while we have \nbeen in power in the Senate.\n  My last observation has to do with whether or not the new bill that \nis going to be reported out of committee and come to the floor is going \nto do away with categorical programs. To those who love the 300 or 400 \ncategorical programs we have and think they must be helping education, \nI say that is why it has not gotten any better in the last 10 years. If \nthey think that is what the bill says, let me tell them it\n\n[[Page S2177]]\n\nis going to have three menu items. One is if schools like what we have \nnow, they can keep it. They can keep that program everybody thinks is \nso great or they can opt to take a lump sum with strings attached that \nmean performance and accountability. If they take that, they have to \naccount for it; they have to be accountable, and they receive a bonus \nif their accountability is on the plus side. If not, they do not get a \nbonus.\n  Actually, we are going to let the schools decide which way they want \nto go. Republicans are already in the field trying out this idea. To \nthe amazement of some Democrats, school leaders, school boards, \nsuperintendents, and principals are opting our way, saying: Give us a \nchance instead of putting all these strings on our education money.\n  We have done enough. We do not need the Bingaman amendment. I hope it \nis tabled later in the day. I commend my colleague for his interest in \neducation. We have done enough when we do more than the President this \nyear.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina, and \nthis will be off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, upon taking office, President Ronald \nReagan appointed a commission to root out government waste, fraud and \nabuse. Headed by Peter Grace, the Grace Commission reviewed the \nnumerous Federal departments and agencies, and called for the \nelimination of tremendous waste. The commission also called for an \nannual report on the implementation of its recommendations. Eighty-five \npercent of the Grace Commission's recommendations were implemented by \n1989, but today not only has Congress abandoned the Grace Commission's \ninitiative but is racing in the other direction.\n  Section 201 of the Social Security Act requires that Social Security \nsurpluses be invested in Treasury bills so that the trust fund can reap \ninterest and grow. Paradoxically, section 201 requires that the trust \nfund be spent or eliminated. When you buy Treasury bills you give the \nGovernment the money and the Government, in turn, gives you a note or \nbond which amounts to an IOU. The only way to have the trust fund \nreflect a surplus instead of a deficit is to require the Secretary of \nthe Treasury to maintain in the trust fund cash in an amount equal to \nthe total redemption value of its Treasury bills. Today, instead of \ntrust fund surpluses of $1,099 billion, the Social Security ``lockbox'' \nis $1,009 billion in IOUs.\n  The policy of investing in U.S. Government instruments is sound. Some \nthink that the fund could make more money by investing in the stock \nmarket, but this involves risk that the Congress is determined not to \ntake. Fifteen years ago we only owed Social Security $50 billion. We \nwere not worried because we were taking in surpluses each year. In \n1990, we amended the Budget Act prohibiting the President and/or \nCongress from reporting a budget offset by Social Security surpluses. \nWe wanted the people to know the true condition of the Social Security \ntrust fund and the growth of the national debt. Nevertheless, surpluses \ncontinued to be applied against the national debt obscuring its \nelephantine growth. As the debt grows, carrying charges or interest \ncosts grow. Come the year 2013, there will be a day of reckoning. In \n2013, there will not be enough revenue from payroll taxes to pay the \nSocial Security benefits. Congress, for the first time, will look to \nthe trust fund which was supposed to have been saved to take care of \nthe baby boomers. Instead, the Social Security trust fund is projected \nto be in the red $4 trillion. Congress will have two options: cut the \nbenefits or raise the taxes. Looking at the increasing need and already \nshort $4 trillion, Congress will no doubt cut benefits. In the \nmeantime, interests costs on the national debt, the waste that the \nGrace Commission intended to eliminate, grows like ``gangbusters.''\n  When President Lyndon Johnson balanced the budget last in 1968 the \nannual interest cost on the national debt was only $16 billion. Today, \nthe Congressional Budget Office, CBO, estimates it will be $362 \nbillion--almost a billion dollars a day for nothing. No one thinks we \nshould accumulate $4 trillion in the Social Security trust fund by \nrepealing section 201. Yet, the people should be awakened to the fact \nthat Congress hasn't paid for the Government it has been providing for \n31 years. CBO estimated in February that we will spend $58.9 billion \nmore this year than we take in. Looking at the votes in Congress since \nthat time, the deficit will exceed $100 billion. Talk of a surplus is a \ntotal farce. Talk of not spending Social Security is a total farce. \nTalk of a Social Security lockbox is a total farce. And any proposal \nfor a tax cut is no more than an increase in the debt, an increase in \ninterest costs, an increase in waste.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator from Minnesota 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2926\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I \nespecially thank my colleague, Senator Bingaman from New Mexico, not \nonly for his amendment but for his work in education and for children.\n  Quite often, we will come out here on the floor and talk about how \ngreat Senator ``so and so'' is. I am not saying it is not meant because \nI think quite often it is meant. But from my point of view, at least, I \nthink Senator Bingaman's methodology as a Senator is interesting. He \nnever seems to try to claim credit for what he does. He is extremely \nthoughtful. He is very substantive. I believe he is one of the best \nSenators in the Senate. I am proud to support this amendment.\n  Really, what this amendment says, as we look at this overall budget--\nafter all, our budget speaks to our priorities--is that there is a \ndifference between the Democrats and Republicans. It is a difference \nthat makes a difference.\n  Republicans, in their budget proposal, have provided much more \nfunding for IDEA. I thank the Presiding Officer, the Senator from New \nHampshire, for his strong voice on this. Ever since he came here to the \nSenate, he has been talking about the need to live up to what is an \nunfunded mandate and to provide for more resources in this area. I \nthink that is extremely important.\n  I also hear from people at our school district levels: Look, if you \nwould do the job of providing the funding here, that would help us in \nmany important ways. Above and beyond that, what we have done is said \nyes to that. We provide for the same funding, but we go further. We say \nthat we think there is an important choice we need to make as Senators, \nand there is an important choice and decision the country needs to \nmake: Whether we go down the path of the tax cuts--many of them \ndisproportionately flowing to high-income people, to more affluent \ncitizens--or whether, as we look over the next 5 years, we could, in \nfact, do better by our children and do better by education with close \nto an additional $35 billion.\n  I think I heard my colleague, my friend from New Mexico, whom I work \nwith a lot in the mental health area, say: Look, we have done enough. \nBasically, we believe there is enough in this budget.\n  I do not agree. I am in profound disagreement. I am in a school every \n2 weeks, most of the time in Minnesota, although sometimes in other \nStates, as well. I was a college teacher for 20 years. I love to be in \nschools. I love to teach. I love to meet with students.\n  I will tell you right now, in Minnesota, and all across the country, \nwe have a lot of crumbling schools. I think in Minnesota we have well \nover a $1 billion challenge ahead of us.\n  I will tell you this: It is very difficult to tell students and young \npeople we value them and then not invest in these schools to the point \nwhere the infrastructure is crumbling. What we say to students when we \ndo not even invest in the physical infrastructure is: We do not value \nyou.\n\n  We have the task of rebuilding crumbling schools. But don't stop \nthere, I say to Senators. We need to do more. I do not think this \nbudget that our Republican colleagues have presented does near enough. \nI am in profound disagreement.\n\n[[Page S2178]]\n\n  You ask the students--talk to them; in many ways, they are the \nexperts on education--what works and what doesn't? They will all tell \nyou that one of the keys to a good education is good teachers.\n  In the budget proposal that the Democrats have brought to the floor, \nSenator Bingaman taking the lead, we talk about the need to get more \nresources to the school district level so that we can hire more good \nteachers and we can have smaller class size.\n  I would argue today and tomorrow and for the rest of this year and \nfor the next 10 years, that is one of the best things we can do.\n  One of the things we do not include in this budget proposal but \nDemocrats have talked about--I wish we would back it more with \ninvestment--is what we should be doing prekindergarten.\n  But let me go on about what we can do and what is in this proposal.\n  In addition, we are talking about afterschool programs. I have not \nfound any issue where there is a greater community consensus--from law \nenforcement to teachers, to parents, to social workers, to youth \nworkers--that we have to give our children and our young people \npositive alternatives after school: places to go, places to be. We \ninclude that in this proposal. That makes a whole lot of sense.\n  We had a debate--sort of a debate--on the Ed-Flex bill. I will admit, \nI was in a minority of one on that. I think the final vote was 99-1. \nBut one of the arguments I made--which I believe most Senators agree \nwith, I hope--and which is certainly a part of this proposal, is that \nwe are talking about flexibility at the same time we are providing \ntitle I money, which goes to those students who are disadvantaged, \nthose students who need additional support. We are funding it at about \na 30-percent level.\n  In my State of Minnesota--I am in inner-city schools all the time--in \nthe city of St. Paul, after you go below the threshold of 65 percent of \nyour students coming from homes which make them qualified for the free \nor reduced school lunch program, we do not have any funding. Once you \nhave 60 percent of your students low income, you do not qualify. We are \nout of money. We can do much better.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle say we have done enough. \nNo, we have not done enough. It is not enough to give speeches. It is \nnot enough to have photo opportunities next to children. It is not \nenough to say we are all for education. It is not enough to say we are \nfor young people because they are our future. It is not enough until we \nback it up by digging into our pockets and, yes, spending more money \nand making the investment.\n  I think this amendment that we bring to the floor is a ``divide'' \namendment. This is a divide amendment between Republicans and their \npriorities--more tax cuts; more tax cuts disproportionately going to \nwealthy, high-income people, versus more investment in children and \nmore investment in education.\n  Frankly, I would be willing to debate any colleague who says we have \ndone enough, that we should not be making this additional investment.\n  Of course, we should be making this additional investment. We are not \ngoing to provide the best education for every child on a ``tin cup'' \nbudget. This additional $35 billion can make a difference.\n  Let me also point out, since we have this debate on the floor of the \nSenate--and we will have much more of this debate when we get to the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act--that I am deeply troubled by \nall of the Senators--I hope not a majority--who want to talk about high \nstakes standardized tests and want to say we are for rigor and want to \nsay we are for accountability and want to even say that, by gosh, if a \nthird grader, age 8, does not pass this test, then she is going to be \nheld back, but we are unwilling to make the investment and get the \nresources to the local school district level so that every one of these \nchildren have the same opportunity to pass these tests. We hold \nchildren responsible for our failure to invest in their achievement and \ntheir future. We can't have it this way. We ought to be talking about \nhigh standards. We ought to be telling our children we expect the very \nbest of them, but we also need to have the policy integrity, as \nSenators, to provide the resources to our local communities so we can \nmake sure that, as a Nation and as a Senate, we have met the \nopportunity-to-learn standard, that every child in the United States of \nAmerica, regardless of color of skin, rich or poor, low income or high \nincome, rural or urban, or boy or girl, will have the same chance to \nreach his or her full potential.\n\n  This $35 billion is not Heaven on Earth. It doesn't make it perfect, \nbut it makes it a better Earth on Earth for our children. I believe we \nshould support it, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the pending \nBingaman amendment to increase funding for education programs in the \nFY2001 budget resolution--programs that have been proven to increase \nstudent performance. Few of the problems facing us today are as \nimportant as the challenge of educating our children to meet the \ndemands of the future. Yet, the budget resolution put forward by the \nMajority does nothing for key priorities like funding for high-quality \nteachers, smaller class sizes, modern and accountable schools, and \nexpanded and improved technology in the classroom. In fact, total \ndiscretionary spending for education, training and social services \nprograms in the Republican budget plan before us is $4.7 billion below \nthe President's budget request, reducing discretionary education \nfunding to below FY2000 levels.\n  I strongly supported an amendment offered during the Budget Committee \nmarkup to provide increased funding for smaller class sizes, school \nconstruction and renovation, and teacher quality--initiatives that are \ncritical to ensuring an educated citizenry. I regret that Republican \nmembers of the Committee opposed this amendment, resulting in its \ndefeat, and I would strongly urge my colleagues to support the pending \namendment.\n  Mr. President, the quality of teachers and principals is essential to \nstudent achievement. Research indicates that high-quality teachers are \nthe single most important determinant in how well students learn. \nLikewise, research has shown that students attending small classes with \nqualified teachers in early grades make more rapid educational progress \nthan students in larger classes. This amendment would increase funding \nin these critical areas, as well as in other areas such as after-school \nprograms and school modernization, offset by reducing the irresponsible \ntax cuts included in the Majority's proposal. It would also make higher \neducation more affordable and accessible by increasing the maximum Pell \nGrant, and increasing funding for the TRIO and GEAR-UP programs.\n  Throughout my service in the United States Senate, I have been \ncommitted to the goal of ensuring a quality education for all our \nNation's citizens. This amendment would move us in the direction of \nthat important goal and I again urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2928\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if Senator Reid will agree that \nI may offer the Johnson amendment--he asked that it be offered on his \nbehalf--and a second-degree from me, and we vote on both of them by \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Johnson, I send a \nfirst-degree amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration. I ask unanimous consent this be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Mr. Johnson, \n     for himself and Mr. Abraham, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2928.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RESERVE FUND FOR MILITARY RETIREE HEALTH CARE.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, aggregates, allocations, \n     functional totals, and other budgetary levels and limits may \n     be revised for legislation to fund improvements to\n\n[[Page S2179]]\n\n     health care programs for military retirees and their \n     dependents in order to fulfill the promises made to them, \n     provided that the enactment of that legislation will not \n     cause an on-budget deficit for--\n       (1) fiscal year 2001; or\n       (2) the period of fiscal years 2001 through 2005.\n       (b) Revised Levels.--Upon the consideration of legislation \n     pursuant to subsection (a), the Chairman of the Committee on \n     the Budget of the Senate may file with the Senate \n     appropriately revised allocations under section 302(a) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and revised functional \n     levels and aggregates to carry out this section. These \n     revised allocations, functional levels, and aggregates shall \n     be considered for the purposes of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 as allocations, functional levels, and aggregates \n     contained in this resolution.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2929 to Amendment No. 2928\n\n             (Purpose: To limit the amount of the reserve)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time on \nthis amendment be yielded back and that I may send a second-degree \namendment on behalf of myself to the desk, that all time be yielded \nback and the second-degree amendment be agreed to, that the first-\ndegree amendment, as amended, be agreed to, and that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving right to object--I don't know \nwhether I will--could I ask the Senator to again summarize the second-\ndegree amendment. I couldn't hear him.\n  Mr. REID. If I could say to my friend from Minnesota, Senator \nJohnson, the sponsor of the amendment, has worked with the majority. \nThey have worked something out that is to the satisfaction of Senator \nJohnson. This was his amendment. He believes the second-degree \nstrengthens the amendment and that it should be accepted. I personally \ndon't know the subject matter of the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thought the Senator had just summarized it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All it does is, it makes it clear that the bill we are \nrelating to is to be reported out by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is the second-degree amendment. It makes it clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2929) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       In subsection (a), after the words ``may be revised for'' \n     insert the words ``Department of Defense authorization'', and \n     after the word ``legislation'' insert the words ``reported by \n     the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate''.\n\n  The amendment (No. 2928), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the pending amendments--the amendments we \nhave been working on most of the day--the minority has no more \nspeakers. We yield back the time we have on that subject under the \nunanimous consent agreement. I understand the Senator from Colorado \nwill now offer his amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield back the 2 minutes I have on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2906\n\n (Purpose: To protect social security and provide for repayment of the \n                             Federal debt)\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator \nEnzi, and Senator Grams, to offer this very important amendment to the \nbudget resolution. Our amendment concerns the repayment of the $3.6 \ntrillion debt owed to the American public. I am eager to join my \ncolleagues in this important discussion about the Federal budget, the \nbudget surplus, and the American Government's economic future.\n  When I was first elected to Congress in 1990, the discussion was \nradically different. The concept of a budget surplus, let alone long-\nterm projections for a surplus, was foreign. The notion that a national \ndebt measured in trillions could ever be paid off was practically \nscience fiction. While 1990 was only 10 years ago, we stand on the \nfloor of the Senate today a million miles from the bleak fiscal outlook \nof those times.\n  We must be careful. While our present fiscal condition may be rose \ncolored, fiscal irresponsibility and a refusal to wisely use the budget \nsurplus can not only lead us back to our deficit spending ways of the \npast, in my view, it will threaten the fiscal health of our Nation for \nyet another generation of Americans.\n  I am here today to urge my colleagues to address the responsibility \nthat comes with the $5.7 trillion debt. During the 105th Congress, I \nintroduced the American Debt Repayment Act. This legislation provided \nan amortization schedule for the repayment of the national debt.\n  The largest purchase an American family will ever make is the \npurchase of their home, and this expenditure is made possible because \nthey laid down a plan on how to pay off this mortgage. It is a set \nschedule of payments. When I was crafting the American Debt Repayment \nAct, I studied this traditional form of payment and said, why doesn't \nthis apply to our enormous Federal debt?\n  Now, 2 short years later, the outlook has changed somewhat, as the \nFederal Government has run and is estimated to continue to run an on-\nbudget surplus. During the previous two budget cycles, we have \nwitnessed an eagerness to spend more and more money. On-budget surplus \ndollars have become lumped into the appropriations process to allow for \nincreased spending.\n  One result yielded by our time of prosperity has been the use of \nsurplus\n\n[[Page S2180]]\n\nmoney to raise the discretionary spending levels, allowing Congress to \nshy away from making some hard choices. The willingness to spend \nsurplus dollars is so strong, in fact, that when Congress adjourned \nlast fall, there was no real certainty as to whether we would spend all \nof the on-budget surplus dipping into the Social Security trust fund. \nThis, quite simply, is no way to run an enterprise--any enterprise. \nPlowing surplus money back into discretionary spending to the extent \nthat Social Security money would be jeopardized is bad policy.\n  Today, I rise to offer an amendment that would not only provide an \nopportunity to control the impulse to spend surplus dollars but would \neliminate the entire $3.6 trillion debt owed to the public, save over \n$3 trillion in interest, and protect the Social Security program from \nannual discretionary appropriation raids. It is simple legislation in \nthe model of the American Debt Repayment Act, providing dedicated debt \nrepayment over a 20-year period.\n  Beginning with the fiscal year of 2001 and for every year thereafter, \nthis amendment requires that the Federal Government maintain a balanced \nbudget. As most families and business owners know, you must live within \nyour means. It provides this payment schedule I have described--I have \nit on this chart--so that, by 2021, we have paid down the debt using \nthe on-budget surplus dollars. The on-budget surplus dollars have \nbecome lumped into the appropriations process to allow for increased \nspending. And if you can live within your means, then you are assured \nbetter prosperity in the future because it is going to carry you \nthrough the ups and downs of our economy.\n\n  It is fair and equitable that the Federal Government, I believe, live \nunder the same parameters. I believe this is the first and most \nessential step in Federal budget accountability and payment.\n  My amendment further provides that Congress must budget for a surplus \nthat must be dedicated to the repayment of the publicly held portion of \nthe debt. Specifically, again, in fiscal year 2001, Congress will be \nusing $15 billion of on-budget receipts to pay down this debt. Every \nsucceeding year, the amount of debt repayment must increase by $15 \nbillion. So that in 2001 there is $15 billion toward debt repayment, \nthe next year it goes to $30 billion, and then $45 billion. It \nincreases in increments of $15 billion our obligation to pay off that \ndebt, which is looking basically at the surpluses we anticipate over \nthe years in our budgeting as we move forward. Every succeeding year, \nthe amount of debt, again, is increased by $15 billion, so the amount \nCongress must budget for and pay toward the debt in fiscal year 2002 \nwill be $30 billion, and then $45 billion, and so on. In this system, \nif it is adopted, by year 2021, the entire debt owed to the public will \nbe zero.\n  We must have a plan to repay the debt, and we must have a repayment \nschedule, the same as you have on your home mortgage, and we will have \nthe ability to cut taxes. A plan provides certainty and structure. I \nbelieve that anyone concerned with the national debt or tax cuts will \nunderstand the need for a responsible repayment schedule on the \nnational debt.\n  In addition to the on-budget surplus payment required by this \namendment, I have added language to require that until such time as \nserious Social Security reform is implemented, Social Security surplus \ndollars must also be dedicated to the repayment of the debt owed to the \npublic. Every Member of this body is aware of the enormous obligation \nthis country has made to present and future Social Security recipients. \nI believe the policymakers must address the future solvency of Social \nSecurity.\n  I am not here today, and my amendment is not drafted, to address the \nvital issue of Social Security solvency in the long term. What this \namendment will do, however, is dedicate a surplus in Social Security \ndollars to debt repayment until the Congress can generate an \nappropriate long-term fix to the obstacles that stand in the way of \nthis program.\n  I note that the 20-year schedule I have introduced does not account \nfor the inclusion of Social Security surplus money to repay the debt \nowed to the public. I believe the only sensible use for these funds, \nuntil such time as they may be used to reform Social Security, is again \nreducing the debt owed to the public. Directing these surplus funds to \ndebt repayment will only accomplish total repayment at an earlier date.\n  I must stress today, I offer a dedicated repayment schedule to \neliminate the entire debt owed to the public in 20 years, without using \nSocial Security surplus money. The use of Social Security surplus \ndollars will only serve to pay the debt down more quickly, removing the \nburden of the publicly held debt from Social Security in the annual \nbudget process.\n  In recent weeks, the distinguished Speaker of the House and the \nPresident have talked a great deal publicly about seizing this \nunprecedented opportunity that lies before us, and that is to pay down \nthe Nation's debt. Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee in \nJanuary, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan strongly urged \nCongress to use surplus dollars to pay down the debt. Chairman \nGreenspan stated:\n\n       My first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus \n     to flow through into a reduction of debt to the public. If \n     that proves politically infeasible, I would opt for cutting \n     taxes. And under no conditions do I see any room in the long-\n     term outlook for major changes in expenditures.\n\n  I think that very succinctly spells out where we should be. This \ndialog has been tremendously helpful in further drawing the attention \nof the public and elected officials to the importance of debt \nrepayment.\n  As many of my colleagues can attest, and as I have experienced in my \nnumerous town meetings around my home State of Colorado, this is an \nissue that the public understands. It is an issue of basic common \nsense, equity, and responsibility. This amendment is a call to action \nand accountability. It demands that this country and this Congress \nrecognize the debt it has created. It structures a disciplined, \nfiscally responsible schedule for the repayment of our debt. In the \nprocess, it is my view that this legislation will serve to generate \ngreater fiscal responsibility with every appropriation cycle, prevent \nfuture deficit spending, and save the taxpayer more than $3 trillion in \ninterest payments. Now, that is $3 trillion that would be better spent \non necessary expenditures, the strengthening of Social Security, and \ntax cuts.\n  I wish to compliment Senator Domenici, and the Budget Committee under \nhis leadership, for working to pay down the debt. I recognize their \nsincere efforts in that regard. But during a time of unprecedented \ngrowth in our country, I think we need to seize the opportunity to make \na firm commitment to pay down the debt. I am asking that the Senate \ntake us a little step further in that process, and this American Social \nSecurity protection and draft repayment amendment--I haven't introduced \nit as a bill but as an amendment on this Budget Act--deals with several \nissues in order to further our commitment to paying down the debt.\n  First of all, it says we are going to have to balance our budget; \nthat is, we are not going to spend more than what comes in in revenues. \nWe are proposing a plan to reduce the national debt. The amendment I \nhave before you talks about a $15 billion commitment every year in \nadditional obligations to paying down the debt. We have a provision in \nthere to preserve the Social Security surplus and to state, as \nSenators, that we are serious about saving Social Security, and that we \nare going to work hard for the long-term fiscal soundness of a very \nimportant program for our elderly in America, and that we are going to \nhave an option to allow individuals to play a role in their Social \nSecurity accounts.\n  Then, we also have a very important provision that says, look, if the \nrevenue projections don't hold up as anticipated, there is a means \nwhere the Congress will come back on a quarterly review of these \nrevenues. If they don't hold up, we are going to have to cut spending. \nIt is going to help ensure that when we make decisions as we did last \nyear in the budgeting process, where we got to the end of the \nappropriations process last year and we weren't entirely sure whether \nwe would have spent Social Security or not until our final figures \nwould have come before us in February of this year--now, fortunately, \nthose revenue figures held\n\n[[Page S2181]]\n\nup--we do not spend Social Security dollars.\n  I have a mechanism in place which protects our position so that when \nwe say we are not spending Social Security dollars, we will have an \nopportunity to make sure we are protecting the Social Security surplus; \nthat we are staying to our schedule to paying down the debt because we \nin Congress are going to go back and review it on a quarterly basis and \nthen help assure the American people that we will stay on schedule.\n  We are moving into somewhat turbulent times. If you watched the stock \nmarket yesterday and the amount of oscillation it went through, it \nreminds us of how the economy is changing.\n  I am concerned that at some point in time we will be overly \noptimistic about our revenue, and if we don't have this particular plan \nin place we will find ourselves in trouble and back into deficit \nspending, which I think we need to avoid. We need to utilize this \nprosperous time in our country to pay down the debt, which I think is \nextremely important.\n  I think the Congress can do all of those things. We can have a \nschedule to pay down the debt. We can save Social Security. We can also \nhave some provisions for tax cuts.\n  With a three-pronged approach, the American people will understand \nour commitment to their future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend 15 minutes to the Senator from \nSouth Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, now the gamesmanship is revealed.\n  Look at this amendment. It says let's spend Social Security.\n  Let me read that to you.\n  Until such time as Congress enacts major Social Security reform \nlegislation, the surplus funds each year of the Old Age and Survivors \nInsurance trust funds shall be reused to reduce the debt owed by the \npublic. This section shall not apply beginning the fiscal year.\n  They say reduce the debt owed by the public. You are back to playing \nthe game of taking one credit card and paying off the other credit card \nand owing the same amount. It is as if I have a MasterCard and a Visa \ncard. I want to pay off the Visa card with the MasterCard. I say the \nVisa card is the public debt. And I paid it off--$3.6 trillion--never \nmentioning that my MasterCard bill went up by the same amount.\n  My distinguished colleague from Wyoming is a cosponsor. He smiles \nbecause he is a CPA. He knows what we're talking about.\n  As the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, Dr. Rivlin, says, \nyou are just taking the debt from one pocket and putting it in another.\n  I want the distinguished Chair and the Parliamentarian to pay close \nattention because a point of order will be made later.\n  In other words, over on the third page of the particular amendment, \nit reads: No bill to increase revenues shall be deemed to have passed \nthe House of Representatives or the Senate unless approved by a \nmajority of the total membership of each House of Congress by a \nrollcall vote.\n  That is in violation of Section 305 of the Budget Act. It has not \nbeen considered and referred to the Budget Committee. That point of \norder can be made in due time.\n  I refer to what the law says about the public debt, and not what Alan \nGreenspan says. I worked with Alan Greenspan 20 years ago when I was \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee. I have tremendous respect and \naffection for him. But he represents Wall Street. As long as we can \nborrow from ourselves; namely, as long as we can spend surpluses on \ngovernment programs, then we stay out of the stock market. Mr. \nGreenspan doesn't want us coming in with the sharp elbows of Government \ndriving out private capital and running up interest rates.\n  As long as we play the game for Wall Street, Mr. Greenspan is happy. \nWe have had a wonderful economy. Rather than raise interest rates, we \nought to put in a value-added tax allocated to reducing the deficit and \nthe debt. Then we could save trillions of dollars not only in principal \nbut in interest costs. That bill is in the Finance Committee. I \nintroduced it. I had a hearing when Senator Bentsen was the chairman. \nBut I have not been able to get a hearing on it since then. I would be \nglad to start this afternoon with a hearing on that initiative.\n  I think that is what we have to do.\n  This debt goes up, up, and away, as shown by the numbers published by \nthe Secretary of Treasury.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the public debt \nissued by the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      THE PUBLIC DEBT TO THE PENNY\n               [Current 04/04/2000--$5,758,854,640,223.41]\nCurrent month:                                            Amount\n04/03/2000.....................................    $5,750,620,100,381.36\nPrior months:\n    03/31/2000.................................     5,773,391,634,682.91\n    02/29/2000.................................     5,735,333,348,132.58\n    01/31/2000.................................     5,711,285,168,951.46\n    12/31/1999.................................     5,776,091,314,225.33\n    11/30/1999.................................     5,693,600,157,029.08\n    10/29/1999.................................     5,679,726,662,904.06\nPrior fiscal years:\n    09/30/1999.................................     5,656,270,901,615.43\n    09/30/1998.................................     5,526,193,008,897.62\n    09/30/1997.................................     5,413,146,011,397.34\n    09/30/1996.................................     5,224,810,939,135.73\n    09/29/1995.................................     4,973,982,900,709.39\n    09/30/1994.................................     4,692,749,910,013.32\n    09/30/1993.................................     4,411,488,883,139.38\n    09/30/1992.................................     4,064,620,655,521.66\n    09/30/1991.................................     3,665,303,351,697.03\n    09/28/1990.................................     3,233,313,451,777.25\n    09/29/1989.................................     2,857,430,960,187.32\n    09/30/1988.................................     2,602,337,712,041.16\n    09/30/1987.................................     2,350,276,890,953.00\n \nSource: Bureau of the Public Debt.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you will see that when we started the \nfiscal year the debt was $5.656 trillion It has gone up to $5.750 \ntrillion.\n  We have increased the debt. Everyone is talking about ``surplus.'' \nWhat are we going to do with all of these great surpluses?\n  We do not have a surplus. We had a deficit last year of $127 billion.\n  As the debt goes up, I am trying to clear up the confusion in this \nparticular body rather than engaging in this charade.\n  When the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee keeps talking \nabout how he paid down the public debt by $1.1 trillion, here is the \nactual record as provided in the Budget Committee of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus:\n  In the year 2001, $11.1 billion; 2002, $3.2 billion; 2003, $6.5 \nbillion; 2004, $8.7 billion; 2005, $12.7 billion, for a total of $42.2 \nbillion.\n  The distinguished chairman says he pays down the debt $1.1 trillion. \nIt is actually $42 billion in non-Social Security surpluses. And, of \ncourse, the rest of it--over $1 trillion--is Social Security. Yet, in \nthe same breath, he maintains that we are saving Social Security with a \nlockbox.\n  I pointed out a second ago that we have nothing but IOUs in the \nlockbox.\n  Let me refer to the most recent Congressional Budget Office figures \non the Social Security surplus. As of last year, 1999, we had a surplus \nof $125 billion. In this past fiscal year, we expect a surplus of $154 \nbillion; 2001, $166 billion; 2002, $183 billion; 2003, $196 billion; \n2004, $209 billion; and 2005, $225 billion.\n  That is how you may be able to use the expression ``pay down the \ndebt.'' They say pay down the public debt because they don't want to \nsay they are separating, in their minds, the public debt from the \ngovernment debt. You simply can't do that. There is just one debt. We \nowe it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the trust funds \nthat have been looted already to balance the budget.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  TRUST FUNDS LOOTED TO BALANCE BUDGET\n                [By fiscal year, in billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   1999    2000    2001\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSocial Security.................................     855   1,009   1,175\nMedicare:\n    HI..........................................     154     176     198\n    SMI.........................................      27      34      35\nMilitary Retirement.............................     141     149     157\nCivilian Retirement.............................     492     522     553\nUnemployment....................................      77      85      94\nHighway.........................................      28      31      34\nAirport.........................................      12      13      14\nRailroad Retirement.............................      24      25      26\nOther...........................................      59      62      64\n                                                 -----------------------\n    Total.......................................   1,869   2,106   2,350\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this particular chart shows that in 1999 \nwe\n\n[[Page S2182]]\n\nlooted $1.869 trillion from all of the trust funds. This year, we are \non course to loot $2.106 trillion. We have $78 billion in non-Social \nSecurity surpluses. That is tied up in Medicare, military retirement, \ncivilian retirement, the unemployment compensation fund, the highway-\nairport trust fund, railroad retirement, etc.\n  We are beginning to make the record and have it understood.\n  If there is any doubt with respect to the public debt, I refer to the \nparticular budget that is now under consideration on page 5, ``Public \nDebt.''\n  ``The appropriate levels of public debt . . .''--I am referring to \nthe budget; it will get a majority vote. We are going through a little \nexercise. I say ``a little exercise''; it is actually a charade. We \nworked 2 days and nights, and we produced the budget. Upon completion \nof a budget resolution in committee, the chairman is allowed to make \ntechnical adjustments through a unanimous consent. This year the \ntechnical adjustment was $60 billion. Imagine that. Tell the \nappropriators they have to cut some $60 billion in order to fall within \nthe caps.\n  The instrument itself, I refer to S. Con. Res. 101, page 5:\n\n       (5) Public debt.--\n       The appropriate levels of the public debt are. . . .\n\n  And then they list the levels for 2000 through 2005 going from $5.625 \ntrillion to $5.923 trillion. That is without that $60 billion technical \nadjustment. But even there, they list the debt going up $297 billion.\n  This is the overall debt, which is not going down. When they say \n``paying down the debt,'' they are instead referring to the public \ndebt.\n  With the course we are on, by the year 2013 there will not be any \nsurpluses of payroll tax revenues sufficiently large to make the \npayments due on that particular year. So we are going to be running \ninto a wall, and we will have to either cut the benefits or raise the \ntaxes.\n  I ran over what we had done on the Grace Commission about cutting \nspending, but each year the spending goes up because health costs are \ngoing up, the military costs are going up. We have to live in the real \nworld. Everybody understands that. Here is the first frontal assault \naccording to the Allard amendment: You shall spend the Social Security \nsurpluses. Until such time as Congress enacts major Social Security \nreform legislation, the surplus funds of Social Security shall be used \nto reduce the debt.\n  What you are doing is using Social Security moneys to make it appear \nthat the debt is less and some kind of interest cost is saved. The \ntruth is, you have gone from one credit card to the other. That is the \nsort of game we have played each year, making the debt increase from \nless than $1 trillion under President Johnson, when he balanced the \nbudget back in 1968 and 1969, to almost $5.7 trillion now. Interests \ncosts of only $16 billion back then are now $362 billion, or $1 billion \na day.\n  That is a waste. If we had that $200-some billion we are paying in \ninterest costs, I could almost double the defense budget, give you all \nthe research for health, build all the highways, bridges, the \nlibraries, courthouses. We could do everything anybody wanted to do. I \ncould give Gov. George W. Bush's tax cut and Vice President Gore's \nprogram of spending.\n  We are spending the money for nothing. When are we going to get hold \nof ourselves and sober up and cut out this political campaign? The \nworst campaign finance abuse is us. We are using our payroll to run \naround here and give a lark and a story to the American people that we \nare going to save Social Security; no, we are going to pay down the \ndebt, pay down the public debt.\n  I retain the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 45 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment offered by \nmy friend from Colorado, Senator Allard. This is an amendment that will \nkeep our budget balanced. It will protect the Social Security surplus \nby preventing these revenues from being used for additional spending, \nand--this is the important part--it establishes a concrete schedule for \npaying off the publicly held debt payments with non-Social Security \nsurplus. This is a true paydown of the debt.\n  I am pleased we had the comments from the Senator from South Carolina \nto whom I have been paying attention since I got to this body. I am \npleased to say I think this is a bill he could sign onto when we have \nan opportunity to explain all the ramifications.\n  The first year Senator Allard and I were in the Senate, we talked \nabout balancing the budget. It seemed a dream at that time, but it \nhappened. Everybody in this body listened to constituents at home and \nsaid, by golly, they want the budget balanced. And we balanced it.\n  Now, a little fluke in that was that we were partly balancing it with \nSocial Security surplus. The difference between what people paid into \nSocial Security and the amount paid out was a positive revenue; it was \nextra money. And we were spending it.\n  We said: That is not honest. The people of America listened, and they \nsaid: We want some honesty with our Social Security money. Quit \nspending the Social Security surplus. We have done that. Everybody paid \nattention last year. We will have an honest surplus, not counting \nSocial Security surplus for the first time in decades.\n  Now what we are talking about is debt accountability. Honesty with \nthe trust funds is where we are headed. Debt accountability is what we \nneed to get there.\n  There is a fellow in Gillette, WY, who calls me regularly. Steve \nTarver is a fellow accountant, retired now. He says: Congress keeps \ntalking about the debt being paid down, but I call the Treasury \nregularly and I say: How much is the national debt?\n  The debt keeps going up, in spite of the Social Security surplus, \nwhich is supposed to be used to be paying down the public debt already. \nWe are taking the money out of one pocket and putting it in the other \npocket. Debt to the public becomes debt to the Social Security trust \nfund. But it is IOUs. That debt as of 11:51 this morning: $5 trillion, \n730 billion and some-odd change.\n  The U.S. population as of 11:51 this morning was 274,548,318 people. \nA little simple division demonstrates that every man, woman, and child \nin this Nation right now owes, in national debt, each of us, $20,873. I \nlove to go to school classrooms and say: Did you know you already owe a \ntremendous debt? That amount is over $20,000. That is pretty staggering \nto a kid in sixth or seventh grade. He or she doesn't just owe that \n$20,000; every single person in each family owes that $20,000. That is \nhow big the debt is for the Nation.\n  We have gotten some benefits as we have run up the till. But it is a \ndebt. I can say as I have traveled across Wyoming, the people \nunderstand that debt. They don't like the Federal Government being in \ndebt any more than they like being in debt. They recognize the debt is \nsomething you have to pay off sometime. They don't think it is fair \nthat we make our kids and our grandkids pay off our debt.\n  Maybe the portion that attributes down to them, they could; OK, but \n$5.7 trillion is one heck of a package to pay off. It is a staggering \npackage.\n  So how do we do it? We do it by starting sensibly. We start with a \nplan. We put this country on a mortgage program. The mortgage program \nis outlined in the bill. It starts with a payment of $15 billion. It \nsounds like a lot of money. Around here it is not much money--$15 \nbillion. Essentially, the money then that you save in interest, you do \nnot run out and spend; you add that to the principal. And the next year \nyou pay down the $15 billion. We are adding a little bit to it because \nthose surpluses are going up, and it has been predicted, if we pay down \nthe national debt, if we honestly pay down the national debt--and that \nis what we are talking about, debt honesty--there will be an increase \nin the national economy. That is the biggest factor that can increase \nthe national economy. That means we will have a little additional \nrevenue we can add to the $15 billion plus the interest we save. Each \nyear we will escalate that payment so in 20 years we pay off the \nnational debt, not using the Social Security surplus.\n  This is honesty in paying down the national debt. We have to do \nsomething about these trust funds that are IOUs. People keep talking \nabout it. This one\n\n[[Page S2183]]\n\ndoes not add a dime to the IOUs. This one pays down the national debt \nin a very calculated, fashioned program.\n  I do not think we are tied to 20 years on this. I do not think we are \ntied to $15 billion the first year. I do not think we are tied to the \nsame additions each year. It is time this country got on a plan to pay \nthat debt down. You want to make the loan longer? You want to have some \nyears when you have a little flex in it? It does not matter to me. We \njust have to be honest on paying down the national debt. This is one \nthat forces honesty. This is a plan that pays off the national debt \nhonestly over a 20-year period.\n  This amendment makes good economic sense, and it is good for \nAmerica's future. It fulfills our promise to America's seniors without \nsavaging our grandchildren's future. For too long, Congress has \nfollowed the path of reckless abandon in spending money we didn't have \nfor programs with short-term benefits and long-term burdens. We have \nleft our children and grandchildren holding the mortgage on this $5.7 \ntrillion Government mansion that they may not even be able to visit. \nThat is right. If we fail to rise to the challenge of eliminating the \nFederal debt, we leave our children shackled to the high interest \npayments that were mentioned earlier, and the looming debt created by \nthe last 40 years of big Government programs, while the benefits of \nthat spending fade into the sunset of history.\n  This Congress is in the best position of any Congress in a generation \nto eliminate the debt held by the public--honestly. In 1999, after only \n4 years of a Republican Congress, we were able to balance the budget. \nWe have now projected budgeted surpluses beyond the next 10 years, and \nevery year those are recalculated and become considerably greater.\n  Given this unique opportunity made possible by the ingenuity of the \nAmerican people and the hard work of a Republican Congress willing to \ncontrol Government spending to reduce it from an annual growth of about \n20 percent a year, down to about 2 percent a year--it is still \ngrowing--we should get our financial house in order by setting up a \ndefinite repayment plan to eliminate the $3.6 trillion of publicly held \ndebt, while ensuring Social Security remains strong for future \nretirees.\n  This amendment contains three main provisions that have been \noutlined, three main ones that start out easy and build as we go and \nthen continue to pay down the debt, even if Congress enacts meaningful \nSocial Security reform next year. It creates a responsible, concrete \nmethod of paying off the debt while ensuring the future solvency of \nSocial Security.\n  I have been listening to the budget debate. I found it interesting to \nhear the number of people on the Democratic side of the aisle talk \nabout the budget resolution before us being irresponsible because it \nallows for a modest tax cut over 5 years. They argue we could be using \nthat money to pay down the debt.\n  This is not the first time I have heard this argument. In fact, I \nhave heard a lot of these same claims as we debated the Taxpayer Refund \nand Relief Act of 1999, which is the best policy discussion and only \npolicy discussion we have had on taxes since I have been in the Senate. \nI think it helped people understand how we could make a more fair, more \nsimple Tax Code. It passed. It was vetoed. During that time, I heard a \nlot of rhetoric about how the most important thing was paying down the \nnational debt.\n  I do not think the people using the rhetoric necessarily believe the \nnational debt would be something we would put up as a project, that it \ncould actually be done. That is what we are doing here. We are giving \neveryone a chance to back up their rhetoric with real action, by voting \nin favor of debt reduction by voting for this amendment.\n  This amendment contains three main provisions. First, it requires \nCongress to continue passing balanced budgets for each and every year. \nSecond, this amendment requires yearly repayments to be made from the \nnon-social security surplus. This schedule would begin a payment of $15 \nbillion in the coming fiscal year, and this amount would increase in \neach succeeding year by $15 billion per-year. Third, this amendment \nrequires that the entire social security surplus would be used for debt \nreduction until Congress enacts social security reform legislation. \nThese last two provisions are essential, because they ensure that we \nwill continue to pay down the debt even if Congress enacts meaningful \nsocial security reform next year. This amendment creates a responsible, \nconcrete method of paying off the publicly-held debt while ensuring the \nfuture solvency of social security.\n  As the only accountant is the Senate, I spent a great deal of time \nlistening to last year's discussion on tax relief. I was amazed at the \nnumber of my Democratic colleagues who opposed the tax relief bill \nbecause they said the money should be used for debt reduction. This was \nthe same reason the president gave for vetoing our tax cut. When the \npresident submitted his budget to Congress this year, he made clear \nthat his rhetoric on debt reduction was a fleeting facade, behind which \nhe could hide his real desire for countless new government programs, \neach one requiring substantial new government spending which would \nfurther threaten our children's economic future. As soon as the threat \nof a tax cut disappeared, so did President Clinton's commitment to debt \nreduction. This amendment challenges my Democratic colleagues to choose \nbetween a plan that offers real debt reduction or the hollow promises \nof President Clinton which are nothing more than a smokescreen for huge \nnew Government spending.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in rebuilding a financial house of \nresponsibility where our parents and grandparents can retire in peace \nand where our children and grandchildren will be welcomed for years to \ncome. We should join together in laying an important cornerstone in \nthat foundation today by supporting Senator Allard's amendment to this \nbudget resolution.\n  I want to mention a few of the things my colleagues have said. The \nSenator from North Dakota said:\n\n       The first choice, it seems to me, ought to be, during good \n     economic times you pay down part of the Federal debt. That is \n     the best gift we can give the children of this country, and \n     that would also stimulate lower interest rates and more \n     economic growth.\n\n  The Senator from Virginia--this is the Democratic Senator from \nVirginia--said:\n\n       I would rather have nothing, notwithstanding some of the \n     good things upon which both sides agree, and simply begin to \n     pay down the debt.\n\n  The Senator from the other side of the aisle from Michigan said:\n\n       That would be the greatest gift of all that we could make \n     for the American people, the reduction on that debt, because \n     that would be a reduction in the interest rates which people \n     pay on their mortgages and cars and credit cards, and that \n     would truly be a contribution to the well-being of our \n     constituents.\n\n  And the Senator on the other side of the aisle from Vermont said:\n\n       I believe Congress should follow three basic principles to \n     continue our strong economy and provide targeted tax relief. \n     First, we must continue to keep our fiscal house in order and \n     pay down the national debt. The national public debt stands \n     at $3.6 trillion. That's a lot of zeros. Like someone who has \n     finally paid off his or her credit card balance but still has \n     a home mortgage, the Federal Government has finally balanced \n     its annual budget but we still have a national debt to pay \n     down. Indeed, the Federal Government pays almost $1 billion \n     in interest every working day on the national debt.\n\n  The Senator from California said:\n\n       Debt reduction is the external debt, the debt that is owed \n     to private people, Americans and those around the world who \n     picked up our bonds. We owe them debt. I see my friend from \n     South Carolina has pointed this out. Because of that debt, we \n     are paying over $300 billion a year in interest payments \n     which, as my friend said, is bad for the economy, it's \n     wasteful, it does no good to anyone.\n\n  And finally the Senator from the other side of the aisle from \nWashington said:\n\n       We will not be able to pay off our debt, a very important \n     issue that is facing us, which we have not left ourselves \n     room for with a massive cut of this size.\n\n  That is a lot of people encouraging us, giving us an indication that \nthey would like to see the debt paid down. I hope they will follow \nthrough on that and help us do it.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. I am on a limited time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will do it on our time. It is not a question of time. \nI wanted to ask a question because I am referring, on page 2, to line \n12:\n\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\n\n       Until such time as Congress enacts Social Security reform \n     legislation, these surplus funds of Social Security shall be \n     used to reduce the debt.\n\n  So you are using Social Security trust funds to pay down the national \ndebt? And yet you are saying we are saving Social Security.\n  So if I increase the debt for Kosovo or for regular defense or for \nfood stamps or for foreign aid or for your pay and my pay, or whatever, \nthat is the debt of the Government. That is the national debt and you \nuse Social Security to pay it?\n  Mr. ENZI. If I can answer the question, in the State of the Union \nspeech, the President said we are going to use the Social Security \nsurplus to pay off the national debt. Over a 10-year period, we are \ngoing to have $1.8 trillion in money we can use to pay off the national \ndebt. And I said the same thing you did, that is, moving the money from \none pocket to the other. That is not honest. But we have made a \ncommitment that we will protect that Social Security surplus.\n\n  The one thing that is allowed by law to be done with that is to pay \noff bonds in the public debt. The only investment we are allowed to \nhave at the present time for Social Security is bonds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right. Bonds are IOUs, so you just increase the \nIOUs.\n  Mr. ENZI. No, it keeps the IOUs the same. The Social Security surplus \nwill grow; the debt stays the same. Then the interest gets added to the \npublic debt because, again, it cannot be taken out. It has to be \ninvested in more bonds.\n  That is part of the problem with Social Security; the only thing that \ncan be done with the Social Security funds is buy U.S. bonds.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Right.\n  Mr. ENZI. So there are the public bonds out there and the private \nbonds out there. If we wind up with more private ones, we have to buy \nout some of the public ones. It can be done a number of ways. They are \nall exactly the same. They are transferring money from one pocket to \nanother, as the Senator says.\n  Paying down the national debt is a commitment this Congress has made. \nWe are not changing that commitment. We put that in the bill, and we \nare not changing Congress' commitment. We would like to change \nCongress' commitment. If Congress changes Congress' commitment, they \ncan do that. That is what that says.\n  In addition, there is an honest debt repayment in the amendment. The \nSenator is choosing to overlook the honest portion of the debt \nrepayment, which is the focus of this bill. It is the focus of the bill \nthat Senator Allard and I introduced the first year we were here: \nPaying down, with true surplus, the public part of the debt. We are \ngoing to do that part and another part.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator from South Carolina yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator does not have any time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Our time has expired. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, has the Senator used the full hour? He \nhad a full hour.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am sorry, the time I yielded to the Senator from \nWyoming has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am opposed to the amendment, so I \ncontrol the time. Does the Senator from South Carolina want some \nadditional time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Two minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield as much time as the Senator wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the Senator from Wyoming talked about \nthe commitment to pay down the national debt, but on page 5, the \nnational debt is listed beginning on line 20, fiscal year 2000, as \n$5.625 trillion going up to, on page 6, $5.923 trillion. It's an \nincrease in the debt of $297,712,000. Here is the Senator's commitment \nto reducing the national debt.\n  There is no commitment that I have seen. I ask unanimous consent to \nprint in the Record a listing of the national debt as it has gone up \nsince the days of President Truman.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           HOLLINGS' BUDGET REALITIES\n                                            [In billions of

CBO's 2001 Economic and Budget\n  Outlook, Feb. 16, 2000.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, one can see how that debt has gone up. \nOne can see we were doing pretty good under the Budget Act, which was \nthe solution we had in 1993 under President Clinton. We came from a \n$403.6 billion deficit. We were spending over $400 billion more than we \ntook in, until 1993 when we reduced it to $349.3 billion. And in 1994, \nit went down to $292.3 billion. Then in 1995, it went down to $277 \nbillion. In 1996, it went down to $260.9 billion. In 1997, it was \n$187.8 billion. In 1998, it was $109 billion. In 1999, it was $127 \nbillion. It went back up last year.\n  Under this chart, it shows we are going back down. These are CBO \nfigures.\n  As I related a minute ago, with the votes we have had, it is going to \nbe over $100 billion. I am always trying to jump off the Capitol dome \nto emphasize a point. I make that offer again to my distinguished \nchairman--I will jump off the Capitol dome if we balance the budget. \nWatch. Come October, when we adjourn for the year and start the new \nfiscal year, we will be running a deficit again. I yield the floor and \nretain the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nOhio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, earlier \nI offered an amendment to provide for a tax reduction. At this time, I \nspeak on behalf of the Allard-Enzi-Grams amendment because I believe it \nis a responsible way in which to deal with the problem of reducing the \nnational debt.\n  First, we need to pay down our national debt so we can decrease our \ninterest payments on that debt, a debt which stands at $5.7 trillion. \nThe way I calculate it, the interest we'll pay this year comes out to \nover $224 billion. We pay about $600 million a day on interest costs \nalone. Out of every Federal dollar we spend, 13 cents goes to pay \ninterest on the national debt compared, for example, with 16 cents for \nnational defense and 18 cents for nondefense discretionary spending. We \nwill spend more money on interest this year than we do on Medicare.\n  These numbers make me determined to do all I can to decrease our debt \neven further. I believe every fiscal decision we make in Congress \nshould be measured against the backdrop of how it will decrease our \nnational debt. And I am not the only one who believes that. In fact, in \nCongressional testimony in January of this year, CBO Director Dan \nCrippen stated:\n\n       Most economists agree that saving the surpluses, paying \n     down the debt held by the public, is probably the best thing \n     we can do relative to the economy.\n\n  On that same day, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said:\n\n       My first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus \n     to flow through into a reduction in debt to the public. From \n     an economic point of view, that would be, by far, the best \n     means of employing it.\n\n  Lowering the debt sends a positive signal to Wall Street and Main \nStreet and encourages more savings--and we need more savings in this \ncountry--and investment which, in turn, fuels productivity and \ncontinued economic growth. It also lowers interest rates which, in my \nview, is a real tax reduction for the American people.\n  Furthermore, devoting on-budget surpluses to debt reduction is the \nonly way we can ensure our Nation will not return to the days of \ndeficit spending should the economy take a sharp turn for the worse or \na national emergency arise. As Alan Greenspan has testified before \nCongress:\n\n       A substantial part of the surplus . . . should be allowed \n     to reduce the debt, because you can always increase debt \n     later if you wish to, but it's effectively putting away the \n     surplus for use at a later time if you so choose.\n\n  Many in the Senate have argued that putting the Social Security \nsurplus in the lockbox will be enough to pay down the debt. I remind my \ncolleagues, we will have to use some of the surplus everybody is \ntalking about for paying down the national debt in order to fund reform \nof the Social Security system, if we are going to solve the problems of \nSocial Security.\n  We cannot keep putting off our responsibilities. If we have the \nability, as we do now, we have a moral obligation to pay down the debt.\n  When I go back to Ohio, people say: we're not asking for more tax \ncuts; I want you to do something about Social Security, Medicare, \nhealth care, and if you have some money, for goodness sake, pay down \nthe debt.\n  That is what we do in our own families. If we get a little extra \nmoney and we are in debt, we pay down the debt. That is what the people \nwant this Government to do. That is the message I am getting from the \npeople in the State of Ohio. I am sure my colleagues who are supporting \nthis amendment are hearing from the people in their states.\n  Last but not least, I agree with GAO Comptroller General David \nWalker. In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee last \nyear, he said something that is really very important to those of us \nwho have children and grandchildren, as most of us in this body do, \nabout our obligation to future generations. David Walker said:\n\n       This generation has a stewardship responsibility to future \n     generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to \n     provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and \n     to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and \n     affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices \n     today--\n\n  We have to make the tough choices today--\n\n     while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively \n     large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal \n     wave.\n\n  We should support this amendment. It makes sense. It is good for \nAmerica, and it is good for fiscal responsibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does Senator Allard have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Allard has 25 minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 5 minutes. Let's make it 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for Senator \nAllard and all those who are supporting him on this amendment. But I \nsurely did not want the debate to end today without talking about what \nwe have already done and what this budget resolution does.\n  In the last 2 years, we have reduced the debt held by the public. I \nhear people talking about both kinds of debt on the floor. But did I \nhear Senator Voinovich say he was quoting from somebody who stated the \nbest thing we can do is reduce the debt held by the public when we have \na surplus? We have already reduced it by $355 billion. This budget \nresolution--so everyone will know--will reduce the debt by an \nadditional $1.1 trillion.\n  Frankly, I am going to give an estimate, but I think I will be close. \nIf we stay on this path, the interest on the national debt will have \nbeen reduced between $100 billion and $130 billion.\n  I ask, how much is enough?\n  There is an argument being made that since this money is Social \nSecurity trust fund money, it does not really reduce the debt because \nwe may have to use it someday. Right now, as we sit in this Senate, and \nas I stand and talk, there is less interest being paid because the \nSocial Security trust fund money is not being spent; it is being saved, \nwhich means we have that much less IOUs to the public.\n  We are going to have $1.1 trillion more over the next 5 years, making \nthe total, in a period of about 7 years, of almost $1.5 trillion.\n  I think that on my side of the aisle, the same Senators who are \nconcerned about whether this is real, because someday we have to fix \nSocial Security, in my mind's eye I think they are all for personal \naccounts as a solution to the Social Security problem. I suggest that \nif we do personal accounts, then we will not spend this money. In fact, \nit will turn up on the side of the ledger as having been saved rather \nthan having been spent. So it is too early to predict what kind of \nreform will occur, and when it will occur, if it occurs, on Social \nSecurity.\n  What we have to look at is right now and the next 5 years in this \nbudget resolution. Some would make it sound as if $1.1 trillion applied \nto the debt--a portion of which is from the on-budget surplus--isn't \nenough, that we ought to do more.\n  Let me suggest, what is left over after doing that, over the next 5 \nyears, is about $390 billion. That is what is left over in new money, \noff a freeze.\n  You have to take care of defense with that, which I think a fair \nguess would be that by itself it is going to grow at $20 billion a year \nat a minimum. What about all the rest of Government? Are we literally \ngoing to say we are not going to have a single increase in the rest of \nGovernment? Of course, we are going to have some.\n  What about a tax bill of some type? Sooner or later both sides of the \naisle--and we are going to get a new President, but we are going to \nhave some tax relief. That all has to come out of the remaining money, \nsome portion of which they keep saying: Put more on the debt. They can \nargue whichever way they want. Part of it will come out of the tax \nrelief in the future; part of it will come out of spending in the \nfuture; maybe part of it will come out of defense in the future.\n\n  But I do not believe this Budget Committee did anything but the right \nthing in assuming that about $1.1 trillion out of a surplus that is \nprobably totally, for both kinds of surplus, about $1.5 trillion, is \nput on the debt.\n  Everybody claims they want to do more. Everybody quotes Alan \nGreenspan. My friend, Senator Gramm, once said: Quoting Alan Greenspan \nis sort of like quoting the Bible. It depends on whether you are \nreading John or Matthew; you can get a quote in one of them that faith \nalone gets you to Heaven, and you can quote the other one that faith \nand a little work gets you to Heaven. Choose whichever you like. But \nyou can quote either one.\n  I am going to say--to quote Alan Greenspan to my way of thinking--the \nbest thing you can do is put a surplus on the debt that you owe to the \npublic. But then he says, if the next choice is between spending it and \ntax relief, unequivocally, tax relief; and, third, the worst for the \neconomy is to spend more.\n  Frankly, I am amazed that we have Republicans complaining about not \nhaving enough on the debt when all we have left over is used for two \nthings: $150 billion, spread over 5 years, in tax relief, unless we do \nnot do it. If we do not have tax relief at all, it all goes on the \ndebt. That is right in the budget resolution. That is binding. So if \nyou do not do tax relief, it goes on the debt. The rest goes to \ncontemplated increases in defense and a very small amount for the \nmyriad domestic programs that we have in our Government.\n  We have to be both realists and theorists. We have to be \nphilosophical and we have to apply it with some benchmarks to reality.\n  To tell you the honest truth, and to share with my fellow Senators, \nnever in my life--25 years of which was spent with great deficits--did \nI ever assume we would be applying as much as this budget resolution \ncontemplates against the debt. Our interest is going to decline--I am \ncorrected here--from about $224 billion a year to about $166 billion by \nthe year 2005. That is with the tax relief we have and with the defense \nincreases we have. Then, if you want to go out the next 5 years, it \ncomes down precipitously thereafter.\n  Frankly, this generation of Americans, and those working and trying \nto make a living, are all out there saying: We are putting part of our \ntaxes into debt relief. They are asking: How much is enough? Are you \ngoing to have any left over to give us a little tax relief? Are you \ngoing to have any left over so we can have an adequate Defense \nDepartment? Or are you really going to put it all on the debt?\n  I understand I am exaggerating when I say ``all,'' but how much more \ncan we do?\n  I do not believe we ought to go beyond what we have in this budget \nresolution. Democrats will claim maybe $75 billion more ought to go on \nthe debt. Senator Allard has it in some formula by the year we ought to \nhave more. I think they both ought to lose. I hope, before we are \nfinished, they will both lose because the right thing to do is just \nabout what the Budget Committee agreed to: about $10 billion, or so, a \nyear out of the on-budget surplus; and the entire Social Security \nsurplus going unused, staying in the fund.\n\n  When I ask, How much is enough? I suggest that the most significant \nfiscal policy change made to this point--to the benefit of Americans of \nthe future--is something that came from our side of the aisle, and in \nparticular that I thought up one day; and that most significant fiscal \nchange of events is that all the Social Security surplus stays in the \nSocial Security fund.\n  Ask Dr. Greenspan, looking over the last decade, and from what he can \nsee in the future: What is the most significant fiscal policy change to \nthe betterment of America? He will say that one, if you live by it. We \nare living by it right here in this budget resolution, and somebody is \nsuggesting that isn't enough. Somebody such as Dr. Greenspan thinks it \nis a whopping amount. I imagine if he could write it down on a piece of \npaper, he would say: I really never thought Congress would ever do \nthat. If they do it for another 5 or 10 years, what a plus will occur, \nwhat a positive thing to happen for American consumers, the American \nworker, and America's future.\n  I will just summarize by stating a rather unbelievable fact: By the \nyear 2005, interest expenses will have decreased from 13 percent to 8 \npercent of the Federal budget. That is the only significant portion of \nthe budget that has declined, from 13 percent of the budget down to 8 \npercent by 2005. Pretty good work, Congress, pretty good work.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield whatever time the Senator would like.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk two amendments to \nstrike section 208 and section 210, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthey be qualified and temporarily set aside to be called up later. We \nwill have a third amendment pertaining to section 211 to be offered \nlater.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, what was the request?\n  Mr. STEVENS. That these amendments be qualified and put in line.\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will take the opportunity to respond to \nsome of the comments of the Senator from South Carolina and also to \nsome of the comments from the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  We all appreciate the effort the chairman of the Budget Committee has \nput forth in paying down the public debt. I think he is to be commended \nfor his commitment. We have talked about the need to pay down the \npublic debt.\n  What I am saying with this particular amendment is that we need to go \nbeyond 5 years. We need to look at 20 years and put a plan in place. \nThis is a minimal plan. We have over a $1.6 trillion budget. We are \njust taking $15 billion of it and saying let's commit each year an \nadditional $15 billion to paying down the debt and that we ought to be \nable to do that. I don't care whether it is 15 or 10 or 7. Senator Enzi \nfrom Wyoming made the same comment. The important thing is that we have \na plan to pay it down.\n  This is a legitimate plan. This is not just a paper transfer. The \nSenator from South Carolina implied that this is just a transfer on \npaper. It isn't. It is taking the on-budget surplus and using that \ntowards paying down the debt as a minimal plan. If the Budget Committee \ncomes up with more dollars they want to put aside for debt reduction, \nGod bless them. Let's do it. I am all for that. But this doesn't \nprevent them from doing more if they want to do it.\n  In addition to that, we say, instead of taking the Social Security \nsurplus and transferring it over to the general fund where it gets \nspent, hold it in a fund very much like the Domenici lockbox. We put it \nthere, and we don't spend it. It stays in that fund until we have \nserious Social Security reform. Then, when we have changed Social \nSecurity, when we have saved Social Security, then we can relook at \nchanging the law, where we have an automatic transfer of surplus and \nSocial Security that goes to the general fund to be spent. We can look \nat the implications on our total debt figure.\n  What you have here is a minimal plan. If you start including the off-\nbudget surpluses in the year 2001, you have a total debt payment of \naround $152.4 billion because there is $137.4 billion that comes in on \ntop of the $15 billion we have in the minimal plan. Then in the next \nyear, in 2002, we go up to $30 billion that we are using in on-budget \nsurplus to pay down the debt. That is a minimal plan to pay it down by \n2021. We add on top of that another $143.6 billion to bring it up to \n$173.6 billion at the end of the 2002 budget year. That is assuming we \ndon't do anything to reform or change Social Security.\n  I think most of us agree that Social Security is going to have to be \nchanged. We will have to do something to save it. I am saying, in the \nmeantime, instead of leaving the money out there, leaving it \nvulnerable, let's use the money to pay down the public debt an \nadditional amount so it doesn't get built into the spending patterns of \nthe Congress and obligate us to programs we may not be able to afford \nif we go into a time period where our economy is going to turn down.\n  I believe our economy is cyclical. Right now, we are going through \nunprecedented growth. At some point in time, it is going to turn \naround. We are going to regret the day we didn't do more to pay down \nthe debt to get us in a position to ride through those economic \ndownturns when they occur.\n  I think this is an important provision. It is in no way intended to \nbe critical of the efforts of the Budget Committee to date. It says we \ncan do just a little bit more; instead of looking at 5-year increments, \nlet's look at a 20-year increment for paying down the debt. We can do \nthat in 20 years, by 2021. It says that in the process of doing that, \nat a minimum, we will save ourselves $3 trillion in interest payments.\n  It is a concrete plan. It doesn't eliminate the opportunity, if \nMembers of the Senate want to have reduced taxes. It does not eliminate \nthat. It has an enforcement mechanism.\n  Last fall, we got into a discussion in the Senate as to whether or \nnot we were spending Social Security dollars because there was a \ndisagreement on what the revenues were going to be at the first of the \nyear, and we moved into February. We have provided that if our \nprojected revenues don't hold up, we can go in and make adjustments on \nspending so that when we tell the American people we are not going to \nspend Social Security dollars and the revenues don't hold up, we won't \nspend Social Security dollars. We will have saved Social Security. I \nthink it is straightforward budgeting. It is accountable. I think it is \na step in the right direction.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I wonder if we have anyone \nfurther who wants to speak on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  If neither side yields time, the time will be subtracted equally \nagainst both sides.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Does the other side have anybody who cares to speak? If \nnot, I can yield on this side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We do, Mr. President. If, however, the proponent of \nthe amendment wishes to continue addressing the Senate, we have no \nobjection. We are waiting for people to come by.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I think Senator Enzi may want to make a point or two in \nthe debate. I will yield some time to him, unless the Senator has \nsomebody in line to speak.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That would be fine.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I call on the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, and yield \nhim 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, we have been hearing about the Social \nSecurity surplus, and I hate for the debate to really revolve around \nthe Social Security surplus. The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, \ndid come up with a marvelous plan last year--the lockbox for Social \nSecurity--which has been adopted as one of our budget principles now; \nwe lock up the Social Security surplus. I can't give enough credit to \nhim for his effort, along with those of us who joined him to make that \npreservation of Social Security. It is extremely important. That \ncontinues under this bill.\n  The focus of the bill should be a plan to pay down the rest of the \nnational debt over a specified period of time, just as you do a house \npayment. Why is this important? Every family in America will understand \nwhy that is important.\n  I hear some words around here occasionally that if you have extra \nmoney after you do these other things, then you understand you are \nsupposed to pay down your debt. No, that is not how it works, and the \nAmerican people understand that. If you have a debt, you have a payment \nyou have to make, and you allocate that payment before you do anything \nelse.\n  That is what we are talking about here--responsibility, just as you \nhave in a family, for paying down the national debt. It would come \nfirst. It would have to be the first thing we did. We would still find \nthe money to do the other things we thought were important, but we \nwould first pay down this national debt we have accumulated on behalf \nof our kids and grandkids.\n  We have talked about the debt being reduced by $1.1 trillion over the \nnext 5 years. That is marvelous. That is taking the Social Security \nsurplus and locking it up. It is a very important concept. But that \ndoes not pay down the national debt so there is money left with which \nto eventually do additional things.\n  There was a comment that there is $130 billion in interest savings by \npaying that down. Not if we are being honest about Social Security. If \nSocial Security has bonds, Social Security should earn interest. If \nSocial Security earns interest, that also has to go into the account \nbecause we can't spend it. We don't want to spend it, we are not \nsupposed to spend it, and we have made it a principle not to spend it. \nBut we should still pay the interest to Social Security. It will \nincrease the debt reduction on this changing from one pocket to \nanother. But it is still interest that has to be paid.\n  We are talking about a billion dollars a day of interest on the \nnational debt--borrowing from what the Senator from South Carolina used \nas a figure. But I have to tell you, that billion dollars a day is not \nfree to be spent until all of the national debt is paid off--all of it.\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\n When you pay down a house mortgage, you pay it down a little bit and \nit saves you some interest, but you actually apply that interest to \nyour payment because the payment stays constant on a house payment. So \nyou can't spend the interest you save on a house payment. We are \nsuggesting you can't spend the interest you save on a debt reduction \npayment.\n  As the only accountant in the Senate, I spent a great deal of time \nlistening to last year's discussion on tax relief. I was amazed at the \nnumber of my Democrat colleagues who opposed that bill because they \nsaid the money should be used for debt reduction. This is the same \nreason the President gave for vetoing our tax cut. When he submitted \nhis budget to Congress this year, he made clear his rhetoric on debt \nreduction was a fleeting facade behind which he could hide his real \ndesire for countless new Government programs, each one requiring \nsubstantial new Government spending, which would further threaten our \nchildren's economic future. As soon as the threat of the tax cut \ndisappeared, so did the President's determination and commitment to \ndebt reduction--other than moving it from one pocket to the other on \nSocial Security.\n\n  This amendment challenges all of my colleagues to choose between a \nplan that offers a real debt reduction or the hollow promises which \nwere nothing more than a smokescreen for huge Government spending.\n  I urge colleagues to join me in rebuilding the financial house of \nresponsibility where our parents and grandparents can retire in peace \nand where our children and grandchildren will be welcome for years to \ncome. We should join together in laying an important cornerstone in \nthat foundation today by supporting Senator Allard's amendment to this \nbudget resolution.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time on \nthis side.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged equally to \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation \nregarding the time for any opposition to the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous agreement, there are 41 \nminutes remaining in opposition.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will speak off the budget resolution \nitself. I have listened with interest to the comments of the Senator \nfrom Colorado. I salute what he says he wants to do to get the debt \nreduced more than anybody else: Get it lower, bring it down. It doesn't \nmatter how we get it there, if we have to burn the house down to get \nit.\n  There isn't anybody here who doesn't know we are terribly short of \nfunding for programs we need to have in place, that even the Republican \nbudget resolution--and I serve on the Budget Committee--was passed by \nthe majority without any support from the minority. None of the \nDemocrats voted for this resolution.\n  I think it is fair to say the principle of paying down the debt was \nestablished by President Clinton and his administration when they said, \n``Save Social Security, pay down the debt.'' They were almost \nsimultaneous acts. Some disagree and say it is another IOU from the \nGovernment. But it is an IOU from a much stronger balance sheet. I come \nfrom the business world, and that is the way I look at things.\n  I ask the Senator from Colorado, if he will indulge me, what is the \ntotal savings he hopes to have or the total debt reduction he plans to \nhave over the 5-year period?\n  Mr. ALLARD. If we look at it overall, we plan on saving, in interest \nover the 20 year period, $3.2 trillion. Now, if we look at our debt \npayment over 5 years in surplus, then we are going to be paying down \nour trust fund. In 2006, we are going to be looking at--let me get the \nfigure out here--a total of having paid down the surplus in 5 years of \n$982.7 billion and a savings of the interest, which would be that much \nless since we have to pay interest on it.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator be kind \nenough to tell me what the formula says in direct debt repayment over \nthe 5-year period? I understand that it is in increments.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Fifteen billion dollars.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Then $30 billion.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Then $45 billion. Yes. So when we get down here to the \nyear 2006, we would be making a $90 billion payment for the debt \npayment. But $15 billion of that comes out of the spending for that \nyear as new revenues come in. So we are establishing a program.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate the Senator's response. I am trying to \nget it nailed down to a figure so we can discuss it with a degree of \nunderstanding.\n  If it was $15 billion, $30 billion, $45 billion, $60 billion, and $75 \nbillion, it comes to about $255 billion in 5 years.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The program amount paying down the debt would be $90 \nbillion in the year 2006.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. But we are talking about starting in 2001. It comes \nto $255 billion. We don't have to take this much longer. I was \nsurprised to see the Senator introduce a 20-year forecast. Am I \ncorrect? Was that on the chart?\n  Mr. ALLARD. It is not a forecast. It is a plan to pay down the debt \nso we will have completely paid off the debt by the year 2021.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is a mandatory retirement of debt each year \nregardless of the financial condition in this country.\n  Mr. ALLARD. It includes the Social Security surplus. The bill sets \nthe Social Security surplus over here, and says it will not spend the \nSocial Security surplus unless we do Social Security reform. On top of \nthat, you have the Social Security surplus. If we took 2001 and 2002, \nfor example, when you include a Social Security surplus, it is more \nthan $15 billion. It is $152.4 billion in 2001, and $173.6 billion \npaying down the debt in both those years. It is pretty similar to what \nthe Budget Committee is doing right now.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. To be clear, because I think there is perhaps some \nmisinterpretation of what the Senator is looking for, that is pay down \nthe debt as a mandate of the budget process--pay down the debt, and \nthat is regardless of where those payments come from. I understand the \nSenator wants to get the debt paid down. But I just want to be sure I \nam correct in what I understand his intention is, once again to pay \ndown the debt. Regardless, we are going to take $15 billion out next \nyear, and the next year it is $30 billion, and then $45 billion, et \ncetera, among the first things. That is a mandate.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is a priority.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator. I hope it is clear to everybody \nwho is listening that this is a cut taken without regard for the \nconsequences. It doesn't matter where it comes from. It can come out of \nMedicare, based on what we are hearing. It could come out of education. \nIt could come out of COPS. Pull in the FBI, cut the number of FBI \nagents, cut safety programs, cut Coast Guard--cut, cut. It is like the \nharvest at the end of the growing season--just cut it. The only problem \nis we have other obligations.\n  Maybe the Senator from Colorado thinks the principal obligation is \nsimilar to running an accounting office such as H Block, or something \nsuch as that. We cut regardless of the consequences. Take down the \nrespirators. Take down the blood transfusions. If the patient dies, the \npatient dies.\n\n  We can't have that. Forgive me, but everybody knows that this is a \npolitical idea whose time should never come. We cannot plan on \neliminating the debt without establishing where it is that the funds \nare going to come from to pay down that debt. I did not hear the \nSenator say ``only if there is a surplus.'' He didn't allocate the \nresource to the surplus. Even if we are in debt because of an economic \ndownturn of some significance, we will just pay down the debt. We will \ntake it out of programs that are life-sustaining programs in some \ncases--or increasing\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\ntaxes. That is where we have to go if there is no accounting. I know \nthe Senator, in addition to being a professional, is also, if I may \nsay, a businessman. He knows what balance sheets and P statements \nlook like. We are going to just pay down the debt regardless of where \nit comes from.\n  I know the distinguished chairman of the committee on which I serve, \nthe Budget Committee, has a word or two he wants to pass along. I must \nsay that this proposal, unless we know where and how the funds are \ngoing to be generated to pay down that debt, you will forgive me, \nborders on the reckless.\n  I ask the Senator to answer in short form, because it is on \nopposition time, where does the Senator plan to get the funds to pay \ndown this debt?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my response is, we have 4-percent growth \nin outlays projected into the schedule that we have laid out. In \nreality, there are no program cuts. We make provisions for 4-percent \nincreases. There is just a plan. It is similar to an amortization \nschedule for your home. If the family runs into problems, they can redo \nthat plan to pay down the debt. But the key is that we have a plan to \npay down the debt. We have allowed 4-percent growth in spending in that \nplan. I think that is reasonable.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am sure the Senator considers it reasonable.\n  I point out that this cut would be to reduce the Republican budget \nresolution plan for spending by $205 billion.\n  I ask the chairman of the Budget Committee what kind of effect this \nmight have if your budget plan for discretionary spending and \nnondefense was cut, and maybe even throw defense in the $205 billion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator that all good \nintentions are attributable to this amendment. But this amendment \nprejudges everything that we need for the next 5 years, and perhaps 5 \nyears after that. Assuming we know right now about everything we need--\nand we ought to use his number, which is 4 percent for defense and \neverything else--and decide all the rest goes on the debt, then budget \ncommittees will start with those ground rules in the future. Pretty \nsoon, we will just write a budget right here on the floor like this. We \ndon't have to meet. Nothing happens any differently every year. We just \ndetermine this is exactly how much will be left over, and all the rest \ngoes to the debt.\n  I am already against the amendment. I don't think it is the right \nthing to do. I didn't yield time off my amendment, but I would have if \nI had been here.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I could see a hefty tax raise coming to pay off the \ndebt.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It could, and it could be tax cuts in the future, which \nis not what Republicans have been thinking either. The Senator from \nColorado says he doesn't intend to affect them. But the truth is we \ndon't know that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have finished with my remarks.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I regret I will be unable to support the \namendment offered by Senator Allard to provide for budget procedures \ndesigned to reduce our national debt. While I strongly agree with the \ngoal of debt reduction, I cannot support the amendment because of \nseveral important flaws.\n  First, the amendment calls for at least partially privatizing Social \nSecurity as part of an overall reform plan for that program. While I \nbelieve we need to pursue modest reforms to Social Security, I strongly \noppose efforts to privatize that program. For the past seven decades, \nSocial Security has worked to keep retirees out of poverty. Roughly \nhalf of seniors would in live poverty were it not for Social Security. \nIt would be a great mistake to eliminate the fundamental shared \nsecurity that program provides by moving to a privatized system.\n  Second, while a policy of planned debt reduction may be meritorious, \nthere are clearly times when it would be wise to temporarily suspend \nsuch plans. The amendment provides for one exception, namely a \ndeclaration of war. However, there are other circumstances under which \nan exception may be needed, in particular, when there is a severe \neconomic recession. At such a time, debt reduction may aggravate an \neconomic slump. At the very least, the amendment should provide some \nflexibility with respect to the level of debt reduction. Unfortunately, \nit does not.\n  Finally, the amendment may be unconstitutional, as it attempts to \nconstrain the power of the Vice President, provided in the \nConstitution, to break tie votes in the Senate. It is ironic that \nperhaps the most critical vote of the past decade in the cause of a \nlower national debt, the vote to pass the 1993 deficit reduction \npackage, was decided by the tie-breaking vote of the Vice President and \nwould have been precluded had this provision been in effect at the \ntime. That single vote may be more responsible for the record-breaking \neconomic growth we have experienced than any other over the past seven \nyears. More importantly, this provision is almost certainly \nunconstitutional, and on that basis alone, warrants opposition.\n  This budget resolution would certainly look a lot better were it to \nincorporate the levels of debt reduction contemplated by this \namendment, and it is regretful that, thanks in large part to the \nfiscally irresponsible tax cuts in it, the underlying budget resolution \ncould not sustain the level of debt reduction that Senator Allard \nproposes. While I cannot vote for his amendment, I congratulate Senator \nAllard on his effort, for he has certainly helped to raise the critical \nissue of debt reduction, and given it the priority it deserves.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support Senator Allard's \namendment, which would protect Social Security and eliminate the \nfederal debt held by the public. I believe this is a fiscally \nresponsible amendment and it will help us to maintain fiscal discipline \nin an era of budget surplus.\n  If enacted, this amendment would stop Washington's spending spree and \neliminate the entire $3.6 trillion debt owed to the public, save over \n$3 trillion in interest, and protect the Social Security program from \nannual discretionary appropriations raids.\n  Mr. President, thanks to our strong economy, we will have a $1.9 \ntrillion non-Social Security surplus and a $2.3 trillion Social \nSecurity surplus over the next 10 years.\n  Yet there are many proposals to spend this surplus. If we spend it, \nrather than save it, we will confirm the public's worst fears about the \nirresponsibility of their elected leaders.\n  This budget surplus didn't just fall from the sky. It is working \nAmericans who generated the surplus--not Congress, not the President, \nbut Americans' hard work. And it should be returned to taxpayers in the \nform of debt reduction, tax relief, and Social Security reform.\n  If we don't lock in the budget surplus and return it to the taxpayers \nin these ways, Washington will spend it all. Last year's appropriations \nspending has proven that my fears are well founded.\n  Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has repeatedly advised the \nCongress and the administration that we should use the surplus for debt \nreduction or tax relief, rather than increasing government spending. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       Saving the surpluses--if politically feasible--is, in my \n     judgment, the most important fiscal measure we can take at \n     this time to foster continued improvements in productivity.\n\n  The Allard amendment would achieve this goal by dedicating some of \nthe non-Social Security surplus to retire the debt. It also locks up \nthe entire Social Security surplus for debt reduction, so we can have \nmore cash reserves to save and reform Social Security, and to ensure \nSocial Security will be there for our seniors, baby boomers, and future \ngenerations.\n  I am pleased that under this budget resolution, we dedicate the $1.1 \ntrillion budget surplus to reduce the debt. This is a move in the right \ndirection. We should now accelerate and continue the debt repayments.\n  The Allard amendment will just do that. Starting in fiscal year 2001, \nthis amendment requires Congress to use $15 billion of non-Social \nSecurity surplus receipts to pay down the debt. Thereafter, in every \nsucceeding year, the amount of debt payment must increase by $15 \nbillion. Under this amendment, we will do more to pay down the debt.\n  Futhermore, the Allard amendment leaves plenty of room to provide tax \nrelief for working Americans, while protecting the Social Security \nsurplus.\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about debt \nreduction, but what they really want is to use debt reduction as an \nexcuse to deny working Americans tax relief and to increase government \nspending. When I offered an amendment in the Budget Committee to \ndedicate this fiscal year's $26 billion on-budget surplus to retire the \nnational debt, all of the Minority party members voted against my \namendment, claiming that it would cut government spending too much.\n  Mr. President, our economy has greatly improved our short-term fiscal \nsituation, and we will have a significant budget surplus over the next \n10 years. However, our long-term fiscal condition, such as the \ninsolvency of Social Security, still constitutes the primary threat to \nthe health of our future economy.\n  We must seize the opportunity presented by this budget surplus to \naddress our long-term fiscal imbalances caused by the astronomic \nunfunded liability of Social Security. Without reform, the long-term \nfinancial imbalances will crowd out all of our discretionary spending. \nIt will create fiscal hardship for millions of baby boomers and impose \na heavy burden on future generations.\n  The Allard amendment offers us the opportunity to fix the problem.\n  The Allard amendment maintains the fiscal discipline we need in an \nera of budget surplus. It requires Congress to budget for a surplus \nthat will be dedicated to the repayment of the publicly held portion of \nthe debt, while maintaining a balanced budget.\n  As I have repeatedly warned, without returning this budget surplus to \nthe taxpayers in the form of debt reduction and tax relief, Washington \nwill spend all of it. Let's pass the Allard amendment to stop that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the manager of the bill has been \ntalking on this most important issue, I have been meeting with staff \nand some others to try to get the remaining time lined up before 5:30.\n  I say to the manager of the bill on the majority side that Senator \nConrad is here and would like to offer an amendment. He can either do \nit when time runs out or he could do it now.\n  If the Senator from Colorado wishes to offer an amendment, we could \ntake 5 minutes before 5:30.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Bingaman would also like 5 minutes to \nspeak before the vote takes place. The Senator from North Dakota, who \nis going to offer the amendment, needs about 12 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have been working very well together on this but I \ndon't want to agree to that. That means on your side you have 10 \nminutes to speak on the education matter and you have not yielded \nanything to us in opposition.\n  Mr. REID. I have no problem with you having whatever time. I am \ntrying to protect Senators Bingaman and Kennedy because they requested \ntime a long time ago.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The unanimous consent said each of them can speak 2 \nminutes before the vote. That is agreed to in the unanimous consent; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So they have 2 minutes each.\n  Mr. REID. If they are here and I get the floor I will yield them some \ntime.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am ready to let the Senator proceed with his \namendment although there is time remaining. I want to yield my time. If \nthe Senator will yield his time, he will not have time left except the \n2 minutes for each side.\n  Mr. REID. I think the two leaders would not agree to that because \nthey have alerted everybody the vote is going to take place at 5:30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Under my proposal, we yield back our time on Allard, he \nyields back his time, and we are finished with Allard except for the 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. REID. And then the rest of the time we talk on debt reduction.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Up until the time we allow 2 minutes for each \namendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I want 2 or 3 minutes to summarize. I can do that and \nthen yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Wouldn't you rather speak before your amendment is \nvoted on?\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator has 2 minutes under the unanimous consent \nto do that.\n  Mr. ALLARD. That is fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back the time and assume the time has been \nconsumed on the Allard amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2935 to Amendment No. 2906\n\n  (Purpose: To increase the amount of debt reduction contained in the \n                resolution by $75 billion over 5 years)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering is simple. It \nreduces the proposed $150 billion tax cut in the Republican plan. It \ncuts it in half and dedicates the savings to debt reduction.\n  The U.S. economy is stronger than it has ever been. We have now had \nthe longest economic expansion in our history. The question before the \nSenate is: What is the best strategy for keeping this extraordinary \neconomic expansion underway? That is the question before the Senate.\n  Virtually every economist who came before the Budget Committee, \nvirtually every economist who came before the Finance Committee on \nwhich I also serve, has said the highest priority ought to be the \nfurther paying down of the national debt. That is what my amendment \naddresses.\n  I believe rather than some ambitious, new spending scheme or some \nambitious, new tax scheme that our priority ought to be paying down the \nnational debt. Why? Because that is what has triggered this enormous \neconomic expansion, getting our fiscal policy in order.\n  In 1993, we had a $290 billion deficit, a deficit as far as the eye \ncould see. We were running up the national debt. In fact, we quadrupled \nthe national debt in about a 10-year timeframe. That would put this \neconomy in the tank. In 1993, when we passed a plan to bring down the \ndeficit, a 5-year plan that brought down the deficit each and every \nyear, that put us on a course to lower interest rates and of higher \nrates of economic growth, to get the crowding-out factor removed from \nthe marketplace so the Federal Government wasn't in competition with \nthe private sector for scarce resources.\n  The result has been reduced interest rates. The result has been more \nmoney available for productive investment in this economy. The result \nhas been the lowest unemployment in 30 years, the lowest rates of \ninflation in more than 30 years, and the longest economic expansion in \nour history. Those are the facts. The critical component, according to \nevery economist that has come before us, is to continue that strategy, \ncontinue to pay down the debt, lift this debt burden off of the \neconomy, pay off this publicly held debt by the year 2013 or before so \nthat we have as big an economy as we can possibly grow before the baby \nboomers start to retire. That is the wisest course.\n  It is not just the opinion of the Senator from North Dakota; that is \nalso the opinion of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who says: Pay \ndown the debt first. The best use of the surplus is to reduce red ink.\n  Chairman Greenspan said on debt reduction: Saving the surpluses, if \npolitically feasible, is, in my judgment, the most important fiscal \nmeasure we can take at this time to foster continued improvements in \nproductivity.\n  Listen to Mr. Greenspan on this question:\n\n       . . . there are limited fiscal resources in this country \n     and until we have strong evidence that there is a major \n     structural increase in the surplus, that trying to commit it \n     to various different programs or even tax cuts, I think, is \n     unwise.\n\n  The alternative budget we are offering on our side dedicates 82 \npercent of the projected surpluses to debt reduction. This is what we \nare proposing over 10 years; 82 percent of all of the surpluses \ndedicated to paying down the debt. We leave 14 percent for tax cuts and \nother high priority domestic needs such as prescription drug benefits.\n  The vast majority of what we are proposing in our substitute is to \npay down the debt. This includes every penny of the Social Security \nsurplus, and it includes the biggest percentage of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus for paying down the debt.\n  I know this is a conservative approach and some are surprised we are\n\n[[Page S2191]]\n\nadvocating it, but this is our position. We believe it is the best \nstrategy for the economy. We believe it is the best strategy for the \ncountry, and it is the strategy we are strongly supporting.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle primarily advocate tax \ncuts. Virtually all of the non-Social Security surplus in the plan on \nthe other side of the aisle goes for tax cuts. Our alternative is to \nsay, yes, there is room for tax cuts, but it ought not to be the first \npriority out of the non-Social Security surplus. The first priority \nought to be further debt reduction. We dedicate 36 percent of the non-\nSocial Security surplus in addition to 100 percent of the Social \nSecurity surplus. In addition, we advocate 36 percent of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus to debt reduction, the biggest percentage.\n  The next biggest percentage is for tax cuts. Yes, tax cuts are called \nfor with this prosperity. Yes, we ought to address the marriage \npenalty; we ought to solve it. Yes, we ought to deal with some of the \nother things in the Tax Code that are unfair. For example, I believe 39 \nyears of depreciation for leasehold improvements makes no sense when \nthe economic life of those improvements is 10 to 15 years. We ought to \nchange that, too. We ought to change the estate tax. The current \nunified credit is out of date. We ought to update that. We ought to \ndramatically increase what we are doing in terms of relief for people \nwith an estate tax problem.\n  The top priority ought to be debt reduction. That is what we have \nmade the top priority in our proposal. Mr. President, 36 percent of the \nnon-Social Security surplus is for debt reduction; 29 percent for tax \ncuts; 23 percent for prescription drugs and other initiatives, and, of \ncourse, 11 percent for interest costs.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Would a debt reduction be a tax decrease for everybody in \nAmerica?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Absolutely. That would reduce interest costs over time. \nOf course, we are burning up a lot of money in the Federal budget in \ninterest costs.\n  The other thing I think is often missed in this whole question of \ndebt reduction, Lloyd Bentsen when he was Secretary of the Treasury \ncame to a meeting of the Finance Committee and said the best bang for \nthe buck, the biggest bang for the buck is to take measures that reduce \ndebt, that reduce deficits, that as a result take pressure off of \ninterest rates.\n  For every 1 percent we save on interest rates, we lift a $128 billion \ndebt burden off this economy, every year--every year. That is bigger \nthan any tax cut anybody has come up with, in terms of relief to our \neconomy, by lifting the debt burden on this economy.\n  The proof is in the pudding. What happened in 1993, when we cut \nspending and, yes, raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent so \nwe could reduce the deficits, balance the budget, and get us on a \ncourse that could be sustained financially? We triggered reduced \ninterest rates, increased rates of savings, societal savings that made \nmore money available for productive investment that kicked off the \nlongest economic expansion in our history. That is what is working. We \nought to continue that course.\n  We ought to stay the effort, continue the effort to pay down this \ndebt, relieve the debt burden on the economy, take Government out of \ncompetition for scarce resources so the private sector has more money \nto invest, so we are better able to grow the economy, so we have a \nbigger economy when the bills of the baby boom generation start to come \ndue. That is what every economist has told the Finance Committee. It is \nwhat they have told the Budget Committee. We have the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve telling us that is the wisest course. Let's do it. \nLet's take some of this tax cut, half of it, and use it to reduce the \ndebt. That is the wisest course.\n  We know there are things that need to be done on tax relief. I \nmentioned the marriage tax penalty. We ought to eliminate the marriage \ntax penalty. We ought to eliminate that. We have enough money in our \nproposed tax cuts to take care of that problem and also to address \nother serious needs in the tax arena. But when I talk to my \nconstituents, they say to me: Senator, pay down the debt. That is \nreally the crying need in this economy.\n  We know; we have seen the reports in the Washington Post, that \nindividuals' taxes have gone down. That is the finding of the \nCongressional Budget Office. That is the finding of the Tax Foundation, \nthat taxes on individuals have gone down because we have expanded the \nearned-income tax credit; we provide the $500 tax credit for children. \nAs a result, we have provided tax relief, very meaningful tax relief. \nThat is one reason people are not clamoring for the additional tax \nrelief.\n  What they are clamoring for is a continuation of the economic \nstrategy that has made us the wonder of the world. It has created the \nlongest economic expansion in our history. Whatever we do, we should \nnot put that economic expansion at risk. And the best way to foster a \ncontinuation of this economic expansion is to continue the strategy of \npaying down debt.\n  Might I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has not sent up his amendment, so \nthe time has not begun to run on his amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself, \n     Mr. Kohl, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Harkin and Mr. Robb, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2935 to amendment 2906.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment strike all after the first word and add \n     the following:\n       Notwithstanding any other provisions of this resolution the \n     following numbers shall apply:\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $6,579,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $12,427,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $15,376,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $18,775,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $21,724,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $6,579,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $12,427,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $15,376,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $18,775,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $21,724,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, increase the amount by $6,579,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, increase the amount by $12,427,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 17, increase the amount by $15,376,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 18, increase the amount by $18,775,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 19, increase the amount by $21,724,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 23, decrease the amount by $6,579,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 24, decrease the amount by $12,427,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 25, decrease the amount by $15,376,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 1, decrease the amount by $18,775,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 2, decrease the amount by $21,724,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 6, decrease the amount by $6,579,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 7, decrease the amount by $12,427,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 8, decrease the amount by $15,376,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 9, decrease the amount by $18,775,000,000.\n       On page 6, line 10, decrease the amount by $21,724,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 3, decrease the amount by $6,579,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 4, decrease the amount by $74,881,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thought we had an implicit \nunderstanding when I yielded back all my time on the amendment that \nSenator Conrad would offer his amendment, it would be a half-hour on \nhis side on his amendment and a half-hour on our side. That is what \nsecond-degree amendments carry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thought we had 12 minutes on our side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Twelve only? Whatever anyone wants to do, we have to \nleave some time.\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield? I say to the Senator from North \nDakota, I offered a unanimous consent agreement to give him 12 minutes. \nHe thought that had been agreed to. It had not been. That is why he \nasked the Chair how much time he had left. He offered his amendment. I \nguess the time will just be split now; is that right?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He has used 12 minutes. How much time has he used on \nhis amendment?\n  Mr. REID. How much time has the Senator used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator spoke for 11 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. So, 45 minutes, approximately, would be remaining?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. At what time are we supposed to vote?\n  Mr. REID. We are to vote at 5:30; there are 35 minutes left.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We need 2 minutes to talk about the amendment that is \nup, that is going to be called up. Why don't we split the remaining \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. That will be fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So we need 4 minutes before we vote at 5:30, and the \nrest of the time will be divided equally, which is giving him a very \nbig break, but I am glad to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleagues. We are \nglad to split the remaining time.\n  I think the point has been made and hopefully clearly made. I am \noffering a second-degree amendment to the amendment of the Senator from \nColorado. Let me just speak, if I may for a moment, about the amendment \nof the Senator from Colorado because there is something in his \namendment that also should concern my colleagues.\n  Right at the beginning of the amendment of the Senator from Colorado, \nhe defines a balanced budget as one that includes all budgeted outlays \nand budgeted revenues. He says, ``budgeted outlays shall not exceed \nbudget revenues.'' That sounds like a balanced budget but, \nunfortunately, under the legal terms to which we have to hold, that is \na definition of a balanced budget that includes the Social Security \nsurpluses.\n  We have all pledged here not to do this. We have all pledged not to \nuse Social Security surpluses to balance the budget. Now the Senator \nfrom Colorado comes in here and defines a balanced budget as one that \nuses Social Security revenues to balance. That is precisely----\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, I will not. That is precisely what we should not do. \nThat is going back to the bad old days around here of using Social \nSecurity money to balance the budget. That is going back to the bad old \ndays of raiding Social Security, of looting Social Security to make it \nlook as if we have balanced the budget.\n\n  Why ever would we want to go back to that approach? We have just \nspent years convincing our colleagues and the American people that we \nshould not count Social Security surpluses to balance the operating \nbudget of the United States. Now we have an amendment from a colleague \nthat suggests we ought to go back to the bad old days and we ought to \nraid Social Security to balance the budget.\n  I hope we will not go in that direction. I hope we will continue on \nthe path of reserving every penny of Social Security for Social \nSecurity. Let's not, please, colleagues, go back to defining a balanced \nbudget as one that raids the Social Security surpluses in order to \nachieve balance. That would be a profound mistake.\n  Instead, I hope we take the second-degree amendment I have offered \nthat says let's make the top priority debt reduction, let's take every \npenny of the Social Security surplus and dedicate it to Social \nSecurity, and let's take the biggest chunk of the non-Social Security \nsurplus and use it to pay down debt. That is the best game plan for \nmaintaining economic prosperity in the country, for extending this \nremarkable period of economic expansion, for broadening and deepening \neconomic opportunity in this country.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time does Senator Conrad have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not want to provoke a long argument \nabout who did the most to cause America to have these years of \nprosperity. I will summarize what I think.\n  Frankly, I do not believe it is rational to say the Clinton tax \nincrease of $290 billion is what caused this American economy to go \nbuoyant and produce strong growth rates for the last 7 years. \nEssentially, that is what happened in that first year. Some say it \nadded some credibility. To the extent it added credibility, it probably \nshould have been taken off after the next year we had credibility.\n  In any event, I want to talk about what we are doing here. I do not \nknow why it is, with the surpluses we have, that we cannot get to the \npoint where those on the other side of the aisle--at least almost all \nof them. They really do not want to have very much tax relief, if any, \nfor the American people. When we boil it right down, the difference is \nnot paying off the debt --there is a slight difference there--but the \ndifference is spending, and that is it. They want to spend more, and we \nsay let's give back more to the American people in tax relief.\n  This is about as dramatic as I can give it, and it is a pretty honest \ninterpretation of the Democrats' budget--that is what the Senator \nalludes to--versus our budget.\n  The committee's resolution has 11 percent of the surplus going to tax \nreductions. They have 4 percent. In the committee's resolution, \nspending gets 17 percent of the surplus--this is the total surplus--and \nwe put 72 percent of that surplus on the debt. The Democratic plan says \nlet's do 4 percent in tax relief and 22 percent in spending.\n  If one wants to quote Alan Greenspan correctly--as I said, it is like \nthe Bible: It depends on how one wants to read him. But Alan Greenspan \nwould say: Do not spend any of it; put it all on the surplus. And if \nyou cannot put it all on the surplus, do not spend it; put it on tax \nrelief. That is what we did.\n  Essentially, when the argument is finished, for some reason, even \nthough we get our tax relief down to a small amount--$1 in tax relief \nfor $13 in debt reduction in the first year; over 5 years it is $1 in \ntax relief for $8 in deficit reduction--that is not good enough. We \ncannot even give back to the taxpayers $1 out of $9--8 plus 1; $8 in \nreduction of the debt. Here is the difference: We would spend 17 \npercent; they would spend 22 percent. It seems to me we are following \nthe admonition of the distinguished Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard and they are not.\n  On the other hand, we can argue all day who is closest to what he \nsays. The Republicans are being realistic. Out of these huge surpluses, \nwe ought to give a little back to the American people sooner or later, \nand if we spend it, we do not have it to give back. That is just the \nway it is. That is the difference between the two.\n  I do not believe I will need all of my half hour. I assume I have \nused 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield to me? Will the \nSenator from New Mexico give me some time to respond to the comments of \nthe Senator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on the Senator's amendment or in \nopposition to the Conrad amendment?\n  Mr. ALLARD. In opposition to his amendment. He made some comments I \nwant to clarify for the record.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will give the Senator from Colorado 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota indicated \nthat we include Social Security in our provision when we say we have to \nbalance the budget. That is correct. But he did not read the whole bill \nbecause if he had read another section of the bill, it shows we set \naside the Social Security surplus and do not spend it. We do treat \nSocial Security as an off-budget item, and we keep it there. It stays \nthere until there is Social Security reform or we do something to save\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\nSocial Security. We all agree Social Security is headed for trouble. I \nwanted to clarify for the record that we do protect Social Security.\n  I point out in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota that my amendment does more than what he is proposing. We have a \nplan in place that specifically saves Social Security, and we have an \nenforcement mechanism in there.\n  I plan to vote against the amendment of the Senator from North Dakota \nbecause I believe that unless we have the enforcement mechanism, all of \nthis is a sham. We need to have the enforcement mechanism that says if \nour revenues do not measure up, we do not spend Social Security.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for yielding to me so that I \ncould clarify the record. I yield back any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with the 10 minutes we have remaining, I \nyield 4 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota, 2 minutes to the \njunior Senator from North Dakota, and 4 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts. Senator Bingaman will use our 2 minutes in wrapup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Colorado, I \nread his amendment. His amendment defines a balanced budget as one that \nincludes all receipts and all outlays. That includes the Social \nSecurity surplus funds as a definition of a balanced budget. That, in \nmy judgment, is not a balanced budget. It is exactly the mistake we \nmade around here for 30 years. Defining a balanced budget as one that \nincludes Social Security surpluses is to set up the circumstance in \nwhich we could go back to the bad old days of raiding and looting \nSocial Security for operating expenses, and that is something we have \nall pledged not to do.\n  Maybe the intention of the Senator from Colorado is to protect Social \nSecurity, but when he defines a balanced budget in the amendment he has \noffered as one that raids Social Security surpluses to accomplish \nbalance, he has turned back the clock to the bad old days. That is a \nmistake. That should not happen. We should not vote for it.\n  Instead, I say to my colleagues, we should vote for the second-degree \namendment I have offered that says let's put debt reduction as the \nfirst priority of this Government; that says we are going to reserve \nevery penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security; and \nthat says of the non-Social Security surplus, instead of making a tax \nreduction, a tax-cut scheme virtually the only priority of the non-\nSocial Security surplus, we ought to adopt a plan that says, no, we \nought to make the top priority of the non-Social Security surplus debt \nreduction.\n  That is the proposal before the Senate: to cut in half the proposed \ntax cut and dedicate the money to debt reduction. That is what the \neconomists have told us should be the highest priority for these funds. \nI believe that is the case. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been listening to this debate, and \nit is fascinating. Some things that are debated in the Senate are \ncomplicated. This is not.\n  The question proposed by Senator Conrad is: Will we devote more money \nto reducing the debt? If during good economic times we have a surplus \nand we cannot reduce the debt we have accumulated during tough economic \ntimes, when are we going to see real debt reduction? I do not think \nthere is any Senator who ought to be voting against Senator Conrad's \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  With respect to the point he made about the use of Social Security \nfunds, he and I, the Senator from Nevada, and others have been on this \nfloor for, I guess, 5 or 6 years talking about this very issue. We \ncannot use these funds as offsets for something else and then say: No, \nwe didn't use them; in fact, we created a lockbox. Some lockbox. \nSomebody got away with the key in the middle of the night, apparently.\n  Back to the point. The issue here, offered in the second-degree \namendment, is, if during tough economic times we ran up this Federal \ndebt to $5.7 trillion, will we, during good economic times, when we \nhave a surplus, begin to make significant payments to reduce that debt?\n  Is there any greater gift we can give to America's children to reduce \nthat burden on their shoulders of this Federal debt? The answer is no.\n  This second-degree amendment is an amendment every single Senator \nought to be supporting if they believe in basic conservative principles \nof, during good times, paying back what you had to borrow during tough \ntimes. That is what this second-degree amendment is all about. It is \nvery simple. As I said when I started, there are a lot of things that \nare frightfully complicated on which we vote on the floor of the \nSenate. This is not. This is incredibly simple. We ought to support the \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the Senator, do you want to use some of your time? We \nonly have 4 minutes left. You have 15 minutes or thereabouts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do we have anybody else here?\n  Mr. President, I said about as much as I can say about the difference \nbetween the budget resolution and Senator Conrad's approach. I think it \nis shown right behind me on this chart. Essentially, it does not have \nvery much to do with who brings the debt down quicker. It has more to \ndo with who wants more money for spending?\n  I want to repeat that I am firmly convinced that, for some reason or \nanother, the other side is not frightened by the idea of spending the \nsurplus but somehow they are very frightened about giving some of it \nback to the citizens of the United States. I know Senator Conrad has a \ntax plan also. He is on the Finance Committee.\n  But I submit, if we were to adopt his amendment, any realistic change \nin the marriage tax penalty over the next 5 years to make it more fair, \nso millions of newlyweds will not come into April finding out they are \npaying an average of $1,400 a year more in taxes because they are \nmarried than they would if they were single, filing separately--we \nthink that will cost, over 5 years, somewhere between $60 billion and \n$65 billion.\n  There is some education tax relief that has passed with rather \nsubstantial margins. That is about $8 billion. There is health care tax \nrelief that is about $13 billion.\n  That leaves small business provisions for which both sides have \nvoted. They are very good provisions for small businessmen, such as one \nthat says anyone who works for an employer that does not have \ninsurance, if they buy their insurance as an employee, they can deduct \nit. Isn't that something? I assume Americans thought that was the case \nalready. But unless your employer deducts it, employees cannot. So two \npeople working for different employers, neither of whom has health \ncare, if they pool their resources and buy a health care plan for \nthemselves and one child, they cannot deduct a nickel of it.\n  But there is some relief we propose here on the floor of the Senate \nthat ought to get done, and a number of small business provisions.\n  The minimum for those kinds of reforms is somewhere between $100 \nbillion and $130 billion. We are led to believe we are going to grant \nall kinds of tax relief to the rich people of America, when the plan \nencompasses these ideas because that is what we have been talking \nabout. That is what the Finance Committee is going to consider.\n\n  If you take that much of the surplus and say, we are going to put \nthat much more on debt, you cannot accommodate these kinds of tax \nrelief measures.\n  Last but not least, I repeat, how much debt reduction is enough?\n  Frankly, I would like to get rid of the whole debt. But we \naccumulated it over 30 years. How in the world we expect one generation \nof Americans to pay that whole debt down is beyond me. I think the $400 \nbillion we have already done plus the $1.1 trillion in this budget \nresolution in the reduction of debt is pretty good.\n  As a matter of fact, I think we will substantially reduce interest \npayments. That ought to permit lower interest rates in this country. \nAlthough Dr. Alan Greenspan insists on raising interest rates to solve \nother problems, maybe it will not have an impact for some time.\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Kennedy is now recognized for 4 minutes, with the \nChair's permission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes of the 4 \nminutes.\n  I think this chart really tells what is happening in the area of the \nFederal share of education funding. It demonstrates the very \nsignificant decline from 1980 to 1999.\n  The blue on the chart indicates what was being spent in elementary \nand secondary education in 1980. Here we see it was 11.9 percent in \nelementary and secondary education and 15.4 percent in higher \neducation. Now we are at 7.7 percent in elementary and secondary \neducation and 10.7 percent in the area of higher education. There has \nbeen a significant decline in terms of the money that is being spent in \neducation.\n  Look at what has happened in the area of higher education, where you \nsee a continuing expansion of enrollment in terms of higher education. \nAnd it is going to continue. There is an important need in the area of \nhigher education, as there is in K through 12. This chart shows the \nenormous rise in the total enrollment in schools all across this \ncountry. Every parent, every school board, every local group can tell \nyou that.\n  It is against that background that we find in the President's budget \nthere would be $6.9 billion. This increases $2.2 billion. That reflects \nthe difference in the Bingaman amendment. We say allocate that money \nbefore we are going to have a tax break.\n  There was a question raised earlier about whether this was an \naccurate portrayal. I will put in the Record the CBO figures, as \nprepared by OMB, that give the whole function that lists education, \ntraining, and the Head Start programs. The bottom line shows there is \n$4.7 billion less, according to CBO, than the President's budget. Those \nare the figures. Those are the figures in the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that table printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                            FY 2001 SENATE BUDGET RESOLUTION\n                                                        [Budget

If we are speaking about education--not AmeriCorps; \nthat is not part of education; some might think it is, but it isn't--\naccording to the CBO, our budget resolution provides $47.877 billion \nfor education. The President had $47.228--slightly less, $600 million \nless. What we are spending this year is 43.3.\n  To get up and say all these groups support this--of course, if we ask \nthem, do you want more money, they will say, of course, we want more \nmoney. Right? I don't think anybody in the education field, whether it \nis at the State level, the district level, or the national level will \nnot affirmatively answer a questionnaire, will you support more money \nfor education?\n  The question is, Are we treating it with the priority that it \ndeserves in this budget? There are two parts to ours. One is the sense-\nof-the-Senate language that says we need reform in education, not only \nmore money. We don't need to try the same old things we have been \ntrying, the so-called status quo, more targeted programs telling them \nprecisely what to do, such as we did with special education. Then we \ndidn't even fund special education to the amount we promised them, and \nthey had to take it out of their regular budgets. We set the standard \nand we told them how to do it. I guarantee you, they would say, give us \nmore funding in that program. They would answer yes across America. And \nwe do provide more funding. In fact, since the Republicans have been in \nleadership, we have been trying to play some catchup on special \neducation funding for the schools across America.\n  Everyone should know our history has been for many decades, the \ncities, the States, and the counties pay for education essentially, not \nthe Federal Government. So to make this out as a debate on what happens \nto public education in America is to ignore the fact that for most of \nour history we have paid between 6.5 and 8 percent of the total cost of \nkindergarten through 12, somewhere between 6.5 and maybe 8.5 percent. \nThe rest is paid by whom? The taxpayers of the sovereign States of \nAmerica.\n  We are suggesting that a new program ought to come into being where \nthey have more say-so, rather than less, about how our money is used, \nmore flexibility and accountability. We have both suggestions in our \nbudget resolution.\n  I will take 1 additional minute. In every function in this \nGovernment, even the Economic Development Administration, where we \nunderstand there are 334 different activities in the Federal \nGovernment, they want more, not less. In a buoyant economy, growing \nwith less than 5-percent unemployment, America putting money into \neconomic development so people can run around acting as if they are \ncreating jobs, of course they want more money. But the point is, don't \nthe American taxpayers in a surplus of this size deserve some \nconsideration? Shouldn't they be given an opportunity to say maybe we \nought to get a little tax relief such as the marriage tax penalty.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will respond briefly to my colleague from New Mexico on \nthe question of our plan and what it can accommodate and what it can't. \nI start by saying I have great respect for the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  With respect to the marriage tax penalty, we do have sufficient \nresources to address the marriage tax penalty. The tax cuts we have \nprovided out of the non-Social Security surplus are net tax reductions \nof $265 billion over 10 years. The plan we offered to address the \nmarriage tax penalty in the Senate Finance Committee costs $150 \nbillion. It is a very simple plan. It says we are going to give people \nthe choice of filing as a married couple or filing separately. They can \nfile and pay whichever is less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I say to my friend and colleague, who is \nchairman of the Budget Committee, money may not be the answer to all of \nthe problems. Just throwing money at a particular problem isn't going \nto be all of the answer. But we do know that in the budget, this \nallocation is a clear indication of what a nation's priorities are \ngoing to be. That is the decision we are making. We say we ought to \ngive a higher priority in the area of education than we should in tax \ncuts. That is what the Bingaman amendment is doing, and that is why I \nbelieve we should support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from New Mexico \nhas 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is very interesting; the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts says this is going to show our \npriorities. We have more than the President of the United States in \neducation. So one would think that he would have more money available \nfor tax reduction. But guess what. He found there are a lot of other \npriorities. So he has a 14-percent increase in domestic programs, all \nwith high priorities equivalent to education--increase them all. \nActually, in truth, the difference is, do you want to spend more money \non the domestic programs of America, even though we are increasing \neducation more than the President, do you want to spend more and not \neven give the taxpayers a shot as to whether or not they should get \nsome tax relief via the marriage tax penalty, some small business help \nand those kinds of things?\n  That is essentially the difference in priorities. We think ours are \nvery good priorities. There is a lot of money in here for education. To \nthe extent the Federal Government can be helpful, I believe we will be \nhelpful.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2926\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on this amendment has expired. There \nare 4 minutes evenly divided on the Bingaman amendment. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will use the 2 minutes we have to \nsummarize the amendment.\n  I agree with Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts that this is a simple \nchoice we have to make. Is there going to be a reduction in the amount \nof the tax cut? The proposed tax cut is the largest on the Senate floor \nwith which I am familiar. And the proposal is to reduce that tax cut by \nabout 15 percent and commit 15 percent of those revenues to \nimprovements in education.\n  The argument is that the underlying budget resolution has $1 billion \nfor IDEA, which we support. Our amendment has that, too. There is no \ndifference on that issue.\n  The argument is that their budget resolution asks for more than the \nPresident's proposal. The truth is, their budget resolution says that \nof the increase in education, $2.3 billion of it needs to be spent on a \nso-called performance bonus fund. It is committed to that. It is \ndedicated to that. It can't be spent for 5 years. So no school is going \nto see any benefit from that. If you take that out, there is a cut in \neducation in the budget resolution on which we are voting.\n  Our amendment tries to restore those funds and get the funds up to \nthe level in the programs that have been proven to work, programs that \nmatter to people all over this country. We believe those programs \nshould be adequately funded: programs to improve the quality of \nteachers in the classroom, programs to modernize our schools, programs \nto increase accountability for the expenditure of funds, particularly \ntitle I funds, programs for after school. Those are the types of \nprograms we are trying to see are adequately funded.\n  We do not believe those programs should suffer in order that we \ncreate a new mandatory performance bonus. That is the issue before us \ntoday.\n  I hope Members will support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is not often that we are on the floor \nin this mode, where I am opposing my junior Senator's request. On this \none, I am in opposition and will shortly move to table.\n  I suggest the Congress of the United States is going to have an \nopportunity before the year is out to vote on a new Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. That act, as passed, plus the appropriations \ndecisions made by Senator Specter and his Democratic minority member, \napproved by the appropriations in the Senate, will determine\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\nwhere the specific money goes--not what we are saying on the floor that \nwe assume is in our number.\n  I believe we are going to reform the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, and it is not going to be filled with targeted programs \nas it is now, or at least the States will have an option to do \notherwise, to approach this from ``we will receive the money, we will \nsign an accountability agreement, and let us decide where our \npriorities are.''\n  One shoe doesn't fit every school district in America in terms of \naid. In fact, sometimes we tell them to do the things they don't want \nto do.\n  I don't believe this is a debate over the enumerated tools Senator \nBingaman says he is adding. The issue is, are we adding as much as the \nPresident to a budget of last year, which was $43 billion. The answer \nis, yes, we are. We are going to decide, as the Senate and House, how \nit is spent. We are not deciding that tonight, whether the Bingaman \namendment is adopted or not; It is going to be up to another series of \nvotes.\n  I don't know whether we are going to fund the programs that he thinks \nare great programs. Somebody else is going to decide that. We are doing \nas much as the President in program authority; of that, I am confident.\n  With that, I move to table the Bingaman amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is in order.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2935 to Amendment No. 2906\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Conrad amendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my second-degree amendment is very simple. \nInstead of using $150 billion for a tax cut over the next 5 years, we \ntake half of that money and dedicate it to further debt reduction. \nEvery economist who has come before the Finance Committee and the \nBudget Committee has said the highest priority is to pay down the debt.\n  The question is, What do we do to best secure a continuing economic \nexpansion in our country? Every economist who has come before the \nBudget Committee and the Finance Committee, as well as the Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve, has said the highest priority is to continue to \npay down this debt. We take half of the proposed tax cut and use it for \nfurther debt reduction. That ought to be our priority. That is what \nthis amendment does.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the second-degree amendment and \noppose the underlying Allard amendment which defines a balanced budget \nas one that raids Social Security. Let's not go back to the bad old \ndays. Let's pay down the debt.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I will shortly \nmove to table the amendment. I want to show you a chart that simply \ndepicts the difference in priorities between the two sides. Alan \nGreenspan suggested we should put our surplus against the debt, unless \nwe intend to spend it, in which event we should reduce or reform or \ngive relief to the taxpayer. A big difference between the two is \nexemplified by this. They would give 4 percent of the surplus to the \ntaxpayers.\n  The difference is very easily depicted. They give 4 percent of the \nsurplus to tax relief for the American taxpayer; we would give 11 \npercent. They would spend 22 percent of the surplus; we would spend 17 \npercent.\n  That explains it. Alan Greenspan suggests instead of spending money, \nwe ought to give it back to the taxpayers. That is what we are doing--\nbut a very small amount. As a matter of fact, $150 billion over 5 \nyears, if we pass it, means $13 goes to debt reduction for $1 in tax \nrelief in the first year; 8-1 over the 5 years.\n  How much is enough? It seems to me the taxpayer deserves a little bit \nof it. We shouldn't be spending it. We should give it back to them.\n  I move to table the amendment. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2906\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 minutes debate evenly divided \npreceding the vote on the Allard amendment.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I speak in behalf of the amendment. We are \ngoing through unprecedented good times. We ought to take advantage of \nthis time and put in place a plan to pay down the debt. We do not have \na plan to pay down the debt, and my amendment lays in place a 20-year \nplan to completely eliminate the debt.\n  By doing that, we save over $3 trillion in interest payments, and we \nalso do not eliminate the opportunity to reduce taxes. In fact, I \nbelieve repaying the debt is the first step necessary in providing the \nstructure to make further tax cuts. Repayment of the debt\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\nowed to the public by requiring all Social Security surpluses be \napplied to the debt until we have Social Security reform is the proper \napproach. This is a minimal plan in paying down the debt. It will \nprobably do more because the Social Security surplus will also go \ntowards paying down the public debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First of all, Mr. President, I am sure this amendment \nviolates the Budget Act because it is not germane. I will make that \npoint of order shortly.\n  But I am afraid that if we adopted this amendment, it could, over \ntime, preclude the kind of defense spending we need and the kind of tax \nrelief in which we might be interested. I believe we are doing plenty \nto reduce the debt in this budget resolution: $177 billion in the first \nyear, $1.1 trillion over 5 years. The ratio of tax relief to debt \nreduction, over 5 years, is 8 to 1. In the first year, it is 13 to 1. \nThat is a pretty good game plan.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that this is not germane to \nthe provisions of the budget resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE CONTINUED USE OF FEDERAL \n                   FUEL TAXES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND \n                   REHABILITATION OF OUR NATION'S HIGHWAYS, \n                   BRIDGES, AND TRANSIT SYSTEMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) current law, as stipulated in the Transportation Equity \n     Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), requires all federal \n     gasoline taxes be deposited into the Highway Trust Fund;\n       (2) current law, as stipulated in TEA-21, guarantees that \n     all such deposits to the Highway Trust Fund are spend in full \n     on the construction and rehabilitation of our nation's \n     highways, bridges, and transit systems;\n       (3) the funding guarantees contained in TEA-21 are \n     essential to the ability of the nation's governors, highway \n     commissioners, and transit providers to address the growing \n     backlog of critical transportation investments in order to \n     stem the deterioration of our road and transit systems, \n     improve the safety of our highways, and reduce the growth of \n     congestion that is choking off economic growth in communities \n     across the nation;\n       (4) any effort to reduce the federal gasoline tax or de-\n     link the relationship between highway user fees and highway \n     spending pose a great danger to the integrity of the Highway \n     Trust Fund and the ability of the states to invest adequately \n     in our transportation infrastructure; and\n       (5) proposals to reduce the federal gasoline tax threaten \n     to endanger the spending levels guaranteed in TEA-21 while \n     providing no guarantee that consumers will experience any \n     reduction in price at the gas pump.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this budget resolution do not \n     assume the reduction of any federal gasoline taxes on either \n     a temporary or permanent basis.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that \nthe functional totals in this budget resolution do not assume the \nreduction of any Federal gasoline taxes on either a temporary or \npermanent basis.\n  Mr. President, in 1996, just four years ago, the Senate considered a \nproposal to repeal the 4.3 cent per gallon federal excise tax on \ngasoline. As I recall, the issue was debated in the midst of the 1996 \npresidential election, as gasoline\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\nprices were on the rise. Today, we are considering a similar proposal \nunder almost identical circumstances. American consumers are \nunderstandably upset about the rise of gasoline prices over the last \nyear. In February 1999, average U.S. prices were under a dollar per \ngallon. Since then, the average price for gasoline in the United States \nhas increased by about 55 cents per gallon. To make matters worse, the \nU.S. government has had to go hat-in-hand to the Gulf nations to beg \nthem to produce more oil. Let us all remember that these are the very \nsame Gulf states that the U.S. defended during Operation Desert Storm \nin 1991. In answer to the outrage of the American people over this \nlatest hike in gas prices, we see, yet again, a proposal for a \nreduction in the federal excise tax on gasoline.\n  The repeal of any tax, particularly a tax on gasoline, is always \npolitically popular, and quite a temptation for politicians, especially \nin the midst of a campaign season. Additionally, the temptation to \nremind the electorate of a tax increase approved by a political \nopponent is close to irresistible in an election year. However, in our \nrush to craft a pseudo-solution to a real concern in this election \nyear, I hope that the Senate will carefully consider the long-term \nimplications of its actions. To suggest that the 4.3 cent per gallon \ngasoline tax enacted in 1993 is the precursor of all this pain at the \ngas pump, and that the cure for that pain is a simple repeal of that \ntax, is pure and utter folly.\n  A look at the markets over recent months shows that gasoline prices \nhave risen because of the basic economic forces of supply and demand. \nFirst, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) \nsuccessfully agreed last year to curb crude-oil production in order to \nraise exceptionally low per-barrel prices--such low per-barrel prices \nthat U.S. producers were in danger of being put out of business. \nSecond, U.S. crude-oil inventories were allowed to fall to dangerously \nlow levels in 1999. Because there was no cushion from U.S. inventories \nto respond to the cuts in oil production, gasoline prices, naturally, \nincreased. What we are seeing is classic supply and demand at work.\n  OPEC agreed last week to increase oil production, but that oil will \nnot arrive from the Gulf states for at least another one to two months. \nIn the meantime, there is a more or less fixed supply of oil available \nfor U.S. consumption. This short-supply scenario means that even if the \nexcise tax were repealed, gasoline prices would likely increase again, \nreflecting, guess what, the classic lack of equilibrium between supply \nand demand. In other words, there is no getting around the basic tenets \nof the problem, which are OPEC's cutbacks on production and low U.S. \ncrude-oil inventories.\n  Yet, some of my colleagues would have the American consumer believe \nthat this tax cut proposal will effect a miracle cure. Faith in snake \noil never seems to diminish in the Halls of Congress. They argue that \nwe can get around the laws of supply and demand altogether by simply \nreducing the gas tax. I, for one, am doubtful that consumers would \nsignificantly benefit from this latest attempt to treat a serious \nmalady with a political placebo.\n  As I have said, over the past few months, gasoline prices on average \nhave risen by about 55 cents per gallon across the nation. S. 2285, \nwould roll back the price of gasoline to the American consumer by only \n4 cents, and only until the end of this calendar year. If average U.S. \nprices increase to two dollars per gallon, this proposal would repeal \nthe entire excise tax for this calendar year, which is still a \nreduction of only 18 cents per gallon. Assuming that these prices \nactually filter down to the consumer--a rather large leap of faith--how \nsignificant a difference will a 4 cent decrease be compared to a 55 \ncent increase in gasoline prices? Likewise, if prices reach as high as \ntwo dollars per gallon, will 18 cents make a noticeable difference in \nthe average consumer's weekly expenses?\n  As I mentioned before, supporters of the proposal to repeal a portion \nof the gas tax assume that the tax decrease would filter down to the \nconsumer. But there is no guarantee that any savings whatsoever will be \npassed on to the consumer. Since this proposal does not address the low \nsupply of oil in the United States, the benefits of the tax cut are \nlikely to flow to the coffers of the domestic oil-refinery industry, \nnot to the pockets of the consumer. As I mentioned before, even though \nrefineries would be paying less in taxes to the federal government, \nlower prices at the pump would drive up demand for gas, further \nreducing supply and increasing the price for the remaining scarce \ngasoline. Until oil supplies in the United States increase, gasoline \nwill continue to be scarce and prices at the pump will continue to \nclimb, regardless of whether or not the federal excise tax is reduced.\n\n  OPEC is also more likely to benefit from this proposal than the \nAmerican consumer. Let us consider this proposal from OPEC's point of \nview for a moment. Gasoline prices can only rise so high before \nAmerican demand begins to wane. Decreased demand means lower profits \nfor OPEC, which is why OPEC agreed to increase oil production last week \nin Vienna. Stable prices are in the long-term interest of OPEC. This \ntax repeal proposal, however, would remove the incentive for OPEC to \nmaintain stable oil prices. If the Congress chooses to cut the gasoline \ntax to reduce gasoline prices, it would effectively allow OPEC to \nmaintain artificially low production quotas, and thus support \nartificially high prices, without suffering from the decrease in oil \ndemand that the free market would otherwise dictate. A reduction in the \ngas tax removes the economic incentive for OPEC to keep oil production \nin equilibrium with demand.\n  Mr. President, the economics of this proposal notwithstanding, it is \nalso important to consider the impact it would have on transportation \nspending, since the excise tax revenues are intended to be reserved for \nmaintaining and improving the Nation's highways. Spring is here, and on \nhighways and roadways across the Nation, spring is an event marked by \nthe thump and rumble of tires hitting potholes and crumbling medians.\n  Mr. President, just three years ago, the Senate considered the \nTransportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, or TEA-21. At that \ntime, the Senate debated at length the appropriate mechanism to finance \nthe needs of our Nation's infrastructure. I, along with many of my \ncolleagues, was determined to reverse the trend begun in the early \n1980's of federal disinvestment in our Nation's infrastructure. During \nthe debate on TEA-21, I, along with my colleagues Senator Gramm, \nSenator Baucus, and Senator Warner, championed an amendment that would \nallow the revenue from the 4.3 cent gas tax imposed in 1993 to be used \nfor highway construction. Just the year before, Senator Gramm had \nsucceeded in seeing to it that the 4.3 cent tax was deposited into the \nHighway Trust Fund. The Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment during TEA-\n21 was to ensure that the new revenue to the Trust Fund would, indeed, \nbe spent on highways as it was intended, and as we informed the \nAmerican people it would be.\n  Mr. President, our amendment gathered no fewer than 54 cosponsors on \na broad bipartisan basis--29 Democrats and 25 Republicans. The entire \ndebate on the highway bill was characterized by bipartisanship. Back \nthen, we heard talk about all the highway needs that were going unmet \nacross our Nation and how the revenue of the 4.3 cent gas tax could \nhelp address those needs.\n  Indeed, during the debate on TEA-21, an amendment was offered to \nrepeal the 4.3 cent gas tax. By a vote of 80 to 18, the Senate \nrefused--refused!--to waive the Budget Act to consider that amendment. \nSenator Mack's proposal was appropriately rejected by the overwhelming \nmajority of Republicans and the overwhelming majority of Democrats. On \nthat day, March 11, 1998, the 4.3 cent tax was the difference between a \nhighway bill that continued the status quo of disinvestment and a \nhighway bill that made real progress in repairing our deteriorated \nhighways. With the adoption of the Byrd-Gramm-Baucus-Warner amendment, \nthe final highway bill that passed the Senate two days later was almost \n$26 billion larger than the bill reported by the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. And that $26 billion figure was derived directly from \nthe Congressional Budget Office's estimate at that time of the expected \nrevenue of the 4.3 cent gas tax.\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\n  Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to the budget resolution, \non behalf of several of my colleagues whose names I mentioned earlier, \nwhich states that it is the sense of the Senate that the Federal gas \ntax should not be repealed on either a temporary or a permanent basis. \nI am pleased to be joined in that amendment by five distinguished \nmembers of the Committee on Environment and Public Works; namely, \nSenators Warner, Baucus, Voinovich, Lautenberg, and Bond; and, in \naddition, Senators Reid and Domenici.\n  This amendment provides the Senate an opportunity to vote, up or \ndown, on the continued integrity of the Highway Trust Fund and the \nrelative importance of infrastructure investment versus a short-term \ntax cut that may never be felt by the consumer.\n  The recent effort to repeal a portion of the gas tax attempts to \ncreate a political issue where there really should be none. Thankfully, \nRepublican Senators like John Warner, George Voinovich, Kit Bond, and \nPete Domenici are not being baited by the hook of this foray into \nelection year politics. Nor are senior House Members, including members \nof the House Republican Leadership, such as Richard Armey, J.C. Watts, \nand House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bud \nShuster. The nation's governors, the nation's mayors, the state \nlegislatures, and the nation's county executives are not going for the \nbait either. The national associations representing all those elected \nofficials, both Democrats and Republicans, are all opposed to efforts \nto repeal the gas tax. So is the ``Triple A'' whose sole responsibility \nis to the driving public that is paying the higher gas prices at the \npump every day. So is the Association of General Contractors, the \nAmerican Road and Transportation Builders Association, the American \nPublic Transit Association, and scores of other groups.\n  For those of my colleagues who wish to portray this issue as a \npolitical one, let me remind them that less than a decade ago, a bill \nto raise gas taxes for deficit reduction was signed into law by George \nBush--that is, with George Herbert Walker Bush. I was there at Andrews \nAir Force Base, across the table from OMB Director Richard Darman and \nWhite House Chief of Staff John Sununu. It was at that summit where a \n5-cent gas tax increase was first discussed. I did not participate in \nthe final negotiations over the revenue measures in that agreement \nsince they were handled by the Chairmen of the Finance and Ways and \nMeans Committees and their Ranking Members. At the end of those \nnegotiations, the Bush Administration was supportive of raising the gas \ntax by 5 cents--with 2\\1/2\\ cents being deposited into the Highway \nTrust Fund and 2\\1/2\\ cents going to deficit reduction. So it was the \nBush/Quayle Administration that first laid the groundwork for using gas \ntaxes for deficit reduction in 1990. Thankfully, today, every penny of \nthe federal gas tax is deposited in the Highway Trust Fund and spent on \ntransportation investments across the nation.\n  Mr. President, S. 2285, as introduced by the Majority Leader, \nproposes to repeal 4.3 cents of the 18.4-cent federal gasoline tax. \nSince every penny of the gas tax is now distributed to the states in \nthe form of annual obligations from the Highway Trust Fund, that repeal \nwill put at risk more than $7.1 billion in transportation funding \nbeginning in 2002. Now, $7.1 billion will fill a lot of potholes and \nfix a lot of crumbling roadways. Under this bill, if the average price \nof gasoline reaches $2 or higher, then the entire 18.4-cent federal gas \ntax will be repealed, putting more than $30 billion in transportation \nfunding at risk.\n  Additionally, there is some very unique language in S. 2285 that \nseeks to mandate that spending from the Highway Trust Fund be \nmaintained at the levels authorized in TEA-21, notwithstanding the fact \nthat this bill will keep revenue from coming into the Trust Fund. Does \nanyone truly believe that this is a workable approach? The Chairman of \nSurface Transportation Subcommittee, Senator Voinovich, clearly does \nnot. Senator Warner and Senator Baucus, who joined me in restoring the \n``trust'' to the Highway Trust Fund, certainly do not. I implore all \nMembers on both sides of the aisle to join us in rejecting a plan which \nwill compromise that trust which would take the ``trust'' out of the \nHighway Trust Fund.\n  Mr. President, our highway and transit infrastructure can ill afford \nto forego several billion dollars in annual investment. Let me remind \nmy colleagues that we have no reason to be proud of the current \ncondition of our highways. According to the Department of \nTransportation's most recent figures, the condition of our nation's \nhighways and bridges continues to deteriorate by many measures. Daily \nusage of our highway system has continued to grow each and every year, \nsuch that more than half of our nation's urban interstate miles are now \nperpetually congested--more than half! Less than half of our rural \nhighway miles and less than half of our urban highway miles are \nconsidered to be in good or very good condition. That means that more \nthan half of our nation's highway miles are considered to be at some \nlevel of disrepair. So when you look at the condition of our nation's \nhighway bridges, the situation is no better. Roughly one-third of our \nurban highway bridges are either structurally or functionally \ndeficient. The same is true for roughly one-quarter of our rural \nhighway bridges. This is not just a matter of insufficient capacity. \nThis is a matter of safety. The Senate must not turn its back to these \ntroubling facts.\n\n  It is quite appropriate that we are debating this issue as part of \nthe budget resolution. Indeed, the Committee report accompanying the \nbudget resolution parrots the assumptions contained in S. 2285. The \nreport states that ``as part of a five year, $150 billion tax reduction \npackage, the Committee-reported resolution could accommodate a \nsuspension or repeal of the Clinton/Gore 4.3 cent tax increase on \nfuel.'' Mr. President, I believe we have reached the point where we \nmust ask the Senate where it stands on just this question. This \namendment provides that opportunity.\n  This is an election year. I understand that this proposal is being \npresented to the Congress for reasons which just might have very little \nto do with sound fiscal policy. The American people are not foolish. \nThey will realize that this bill would have an unfortunate effect on \ntransportation spending. They will not thank us for handing them more \nof the congested, crumbling commuter routes they must already deal with \nevery day. Likewise, they will realize that such a short-term fix does \nnothing to address the underlying problem of high gas prices--namely \nOPEC and the lack of a national energy policy to protect the United \nStates against the roller coaster ride of gasoline price adjustments. I \nurge my colleagues to reject this voodoo chant remedy. We might as well \nhire a witch doctor to shake a tambourine over the heads of the OPEC \nstates as adopt this approach. Our energy problems demand serious \nremedies, not pseudo-solutions. Vote against this bill for the people, \nthe commuters, the truck drivers and the ambulance and bus drivers, of \nAmerica. We need a serious look at the totality of our national energy \npolicy, not a quick fix non-remedy that will only result in more broken \npromises and broken pavement for the American driving public.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that statements in support of \nthis amendment from the following organizations be printed in the \nRecord: The Associated General Contractors of America, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the National Asphalt Pavement Association, the \nAmerican Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the \nAmerican Public Transportation Association, the National Association of \nRegional Councils, the American Consulting Engineers Council, and the \nAmerican Portland Cement Alliance.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, April 5, 2000.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: The Associated General Contractors of \n     America (AGC) strongly urges you to support the Byrd-Warner-\n     Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond Sense of the\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\n     Senate Amendment to the Budget Resolution. The amendment \n     emphasizes the importance of maintaining the link between \n     highway user fees and highway spending, and opposes any \n     reduction of any federal gasoline taxes on either a temporary \n     or permanent basis.\n       Any reduction or suspension of the federal gasoline tax \n     threatens to erode the spending levels guaranteed in the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). \n     Moreover, the reduction in gasoline taxes provides no \n     guarantee that consumers will experience any reduction in the \n     price at the pump.\n       The United States Senate has consistently opposed repealing \n     the 4.3-cent gas tax. In 1998, 72 sitting Senators voted \n     against repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax. The next day, the \n     entire Senate voted to spend the 4.3 cents for highway and \n     transit improvements. AGC urges you to keep your promises--\n     don't flip-flop on this highway user fee.\n       AGC urges you to vote for the Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-\n     Lautenberg-Bond Sense of the Senate Amendment to the Budget \n     Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Jeffrey D. Shoaf,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Congressional Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                     Washington DC, April 5, 2000.\n     Re 4.3 cents Federal fuel tax/FY 2001 budget resolution\n\n       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the National \n     Association of Counties (NACo) to urge that you support the \n     Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond Sense of the \n     Senate Resolution for the continued use of federal fuel taxes \n     for the construction and rehabilitation of our nation's \n     highways, bridges, and transit systems which is being offered \n     as an amendment to the FY 2001 Budget Resolution. This \n     resolution conforms with NACo's opposition to any legislative \n     proposals that would interfere or interrupt the current level \n     of transportation user fees being collected which provide \n     dedicated federal funding for transportation programs.\n       At our recent Legislative Conference, NACo adopted a \n     resolution that opposes any legislation that reduces monies \n     coming into the Highway Trust Fund. County governments, which \n     have substantial responsibility for highways, bridges, \n     transit systems, and airports, cannot afford cuts in federal \n     transportation infrastructure funding such as the 4.3 cents \n     reduction proposed in the Budget Resolution. The 4.3 cents \n     tax on gasoline and diesel brings in $7.2 billion annually to \n     the Highway Trust Fund--$5.8 billion for highways and $1.4 \n     billion for transit. According to the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation, if the 4.3 cents were repealed, the highway \n     program would be cut by $20.5 billion through FY 2003, the \n     final year of TEA-21. The Mass Transit Account of the Highway \n     Trust Fund would go broke in 2003. The aviation program, just \n     reauthorized by Congress, would lose $700 million a year, or \n     $2.1 billion through FY 2003.\n       On behalf of the nation's 3066 counties, I urge you to \n     support the Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond \n     Resolution. Thank you for your consideration in this matter. \n     If you have any questions concerning our views on this issue, \n     please contact Bob Fogel of the NACo staff.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   C. Vernon Gray,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  National Asphalt\n\n\n                                         Pavement Association,\n\n                                        Lanham, MD, April 5, 2000.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: The National Asphalt Pavement \n     Association (NAPA) strongly supports the Byrd-Warner-Baucus-\n     Voinovich-Bond amendment to the FY 2001 budget resolution \n     clarifying that Federal fuel taxes are intended to be used \n     for construction of our nations highways, bridges. \n     Furthermore, the amendment clarifies that the FY 2001 budget \n     resolution does not assume the reduction of federal gasoline \n     taxes on a temporary or permanent basis.\n       Repeal of the 4.3 cents would have a catastrophic impact on \n     the highway construction industry including the members of \n     NAPA, and delay--perhaps for years--badly needed highway \n     infrastructure improvement projects that save lives, reduce \n     congestion and improve fuel economy.\n       There is a direct correlation between pavement smoothness \n     and fuel economy according to research recently completed at \n     WesTrack for the Federal Highway Administration under the \n     auspices of the National Cooperative Highway Research \n     Program. According to the study, a vehicle's average fuel \n     economy improved 4.5% after the pavement was rehabilitated. \n     In addition, the study found that an increase in pavement \n     roughness increased the frequency of fatigue failures in the \n     vehicles tested at the track.\n       If a cut in the fuel tax by 4.3 cents was enacted, revenues \n     in the Highway Trust Fund would be reduced by $7 billion \n     annually and delay by one or more construction seasons \n     highway projects that result in smoother pavements. The short \n     term gain in reducing the excise tax on motor fuel by \n     4.3 cents is offset by the additional 6.8 cents in additional \n     costs a typical motorist pays on average to operate their \n     vehicles on rough pavements that are not rehabilitated.\n       While the motoring public might experience a short-term \n     benefit with a 4.3 cents reduction in the price of their \n     fuel, the cost in terms of increased fuel consumption, \n     congestion and safety to the motoring public will quickly \n     erase any benefit and set the highway pavement improvement \n     program back by years.\n       NAPA strongly supports the Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-\n     Bond amendment and strongly opposes a reduction in the \n     federal fuels tax.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Mike Acott,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Association of State Highway and Transportation \n           Officials, American Public Transportation Association, \n           National Association of Regional Councils,\n                                                    April 4, 2000.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: We are writing on behalf of the \n     members of the American Association of State Highway and \n     Transportation Officials, the American Public Transportation \n     Association, and the National Association of Regional \n     Councils to express our opposition to a temporary suspension \n     or permanent repeal of a portion of, or all of, the federal \n     motor fuel tax. Therefore, we respectfully urge you to \n     support an amendment to the budget resolution that will be \n     offered by Senator Robert Byrd and others to express the \n     sense of the Senate that the budget resolution not assume the \n     reduction of fuel taxes on either a permanent or temporary \n     basis.\n       The Highway Trust Fund is the primary funding source for \n     highway, transit, bikeway, pedestrian, and other surface \n     transportation programs authorized under the Transportation \n     Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA 21). Proposals to \n     temporarily repeal 4.3 cents of the federal motor fuel tax \n     would result in a $4.5 billion loss in revenue to the Highway \n     Trust Fund and yet offer no guarantee that the repeal would \n     result in actual cost savings to the motoring public. The net \n     effect of this action would be to seriously jeopardize the \n     continued stability and reliability of the federal surface \n     transportation program while providing no meaningful solution \n     to the effects of the present oil shortage.\n       A 4.3-cent per gallon reduction in the federal motor fuel \n     tax, if passed on to the consumer, would result in about a \n     $13 savings this year, but would at the cost of more \n     substantial tax reductions or of reductions in other domestic \n     programs. Given the intense competition for use of the \n     budgetary surplus, we believe that, absent an ironclad \n     guarantee, it is unrealistic to assume that any portion of \n     the budget surplus to offset the loss to the Highway Trust \n     Fund would necessarily materialize.\n       We respectfully urge you to continue to support TEA 21's \n     reliable and stable funding mechanism, and to oppose proposed \n     legislation that would jeopardize the surface transportation \n     program while failing to offer a meaningful solution to \n     impacts resulting from the current oil shortage.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     John Horsley,\n       Executive Director, American Association of State-Highway \n     and Transportation Officials.\n     William Millar,\n       President, American Public Transportation Association.\n     William Dodge,\n       Executive Director, National Association of Regional \n     Councils.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Consulting\n\n\n                                            Engineers Council,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the American Consulting \n     Engineers Council (ACEC), I urge you to support the Byrd-\n     Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond amendment to the FY \n     2000 Budget Resolution. The amendment could come to the floor \n     as early as April 5.\n       The Byrd amendment would establish the Sense of the Senate \n     that federal fuel taxes should continue to be used for the \n     construction and rehabilitation of our nation's highways, \n     bridges, and transit systems. Congress took the proper step \n     in the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act by moving the last 4.3 cents \n     of the federal gas tax into the Highway Trust Fund and away \n     from general deficit reduction. The following year, Congress \n     passed TEA--21, which guaranteed that all deposits into the \n     Highway Trust Fund will be spent each year for their intended \n     purpose.\n       In response to the recent surge in gasoline prices, \n     however, legislation has appeared on Capitol Hill to repeal \n     or suspend some or all of the federal gas tax and thus de-\n     link the relationship between highway user fees and \n     transportation spending. While the repeal legislation is well \n     intentioned, we believe it will not offer any real consumer \n     relief from high gas prices, and it could devastate \n     transportation improvements and safety programs in every \n     state.\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\n       Even temporarily eliminating the Highway Trust Fund \n     structure is very dangerous because it would become too easy \n     for Congress to eliminate or reduce the proposed transfer \n     from the general fund ``surplus'' in the future. CBO has re-\n     estimated the FY 2000 surplus to be $15 billion. Repealing \n     the gas tax from April 15 to September 30 (as S. 2285 could \n     do) would cost states $15 billion. It is highly unlikely that \n     Congress could spend the entire budget surplus on highways \n     and transit in the face of such competing priorities as \n     general tax cuts, education, and emergency supplemental \n     appropriations.\n       Congress is to be applauded for its efforts to bolster \n     investment in infrastructure and for recognizing that the \n     Highway Trust Fund provides an effective and appropriate \n     stream of revenue for transportation improvements. We urge \n     you to reaffirm these priorities by voting for the Byrd \n     Amendment to the Budget Resolution. Thank you for your \n     leadership on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Leo F. Peters, P.E. FACEC,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            American Portland Cement Alliance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2000.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: On behalf of the American Portland \n     Cement Alliance (APCA), a trade association representing \n     virtually all domestic portland cement manufacturers, I urge \n     you to support the Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-\n     Bond Sense of the Senate amendments to the budger resolution.\n       The amendment expresses that the budget resolution should \n     not assume a permanent or temporary reduction in the federal \n     gasoline tax. The amendment may be considered as early as \n     today.\n       APCA is deeply concerned that any reduction in the federal \n     gasoline tax would undermine TEA-21 and the funding \n     commitment that legislation made to the states for highway \n     and mass transit programs. Any reduction in federal gasoline \n     tax would jeopardize the funding guarantee under TEA-21 and \n     introduce uncertainty for state highway and transit \n     improvement programs, and the construction and material \n     supply industries, such as the cement manufacturers.\n       Again, I urge you to support the Byrd-Warner-Baucus-\n     Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond Sense of the Senate amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Richard C. Creighton,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. As I close, I again thank Messrs. Warner, Baucus, \nVoinovich, Lautenberg, Bond, Reid of Nevada, and Domenici.\n  Let me thank also Mr. Jim English and Peter Rogoff, fine staffpersons \nwho have been so helpful in the work on this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield off his hour, 1 minute to the \nSenator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to explain to the Senate why I am \nsupporting this. The actual sense of this resolution says:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals in \n     the budget resolution do not assume the reduction of any \n     Federal gasoline tax on either a temporary or permanent \n     basis.\n\n  I might say to the Senate, that is already true. The Senate budget \nresolution does not--does not, in the functional totals. So I am \ndelighted to support it. There is some language saying: Within the tax \nprovisions. The tax committee can do a lot of different things. One \nthing suggested was temporary repeal of the gasoline tax. I am pleased \nto have an opportunity to vote on whether or not the Senate would like \nthat to remain even contemplated. Whether they will be precluded \nbecause of a vote, I do not know, but I think we ought to vote tomorrow \non this issue. I support the sense of the Senate that is proposed.\n  I ask Senators how many more want to speak on this resolution because \nwe have two others?\n  Mr. WARNER. I would like to have 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much would the Senator like?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. About 4 or 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Bond, on this subject?\n  Mr. BOND. I would like 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would like about 5 minutes on the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if we could agree, would the Senator object if \nthat be the unanimous consent, those Senators in that order?\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Might I ask, what is the order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is the order you arrived on the floor: Senator \nWarner and then the Senator from Ohio, Senator Bond and----\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have been on the floor since the last vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let the Senator decide.\n  Mr. BYRD. Very well. We can do Mr. Warner and Mr. Bond--Mr. Bond \ntalked with me several minutes ago. He has to go somewhere. Then Mr. \nBaucus and then Mr. Voinovich, if that is all right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is fair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first I commend the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia. I was the chairman of the subcommittee that \nworked on ISTEA--we called it TEA-21. How well I remember that he, \ntogether with the Senator from Texas, fought the battle to take the \n4.3-cent tax out of the general revenues and put it into the highway \ntrust fund. Now our distinguished colleague and former majority leader \nis once again showing that leadership to keep those funds flowing to \nsupport America's highway infrastructure.\n  The economy of this Nation is dependent upon the efficient use of its \ntransportation for people to get to and from their places of work, to \ncarry our goods to the ports and terminals, to get them throughout the \nworld. Now we are faced with this situation. I, from the first day, \nhave resisted--even though I am in opposition to my distinguished \nleadership--the repeal of this 4.3 cents. It was a commitment made by \nthe Senate by a vote, if I recall, I say to the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia, which was in the 80s of Senators who approved the \ntransfer of these funds from general revenue to the highway trust fund.\n  Every Senator understands the highway programs in his or her State. I \nrecognize that. But stability is the key word, stability in funding.\n  We have the former distinguished Governor of Missouri and the former \ndistinguished Governor of Ohio who will address those points. But as \nthey set down their programs for highway improvement, safety and \nconstruction, they needed to have some certainty in the funding. It \ntook almost a decade for the Senate to finally come to the recognition \nwe ought to stop this donor-donee situation, one of the most \ncontroversial things I ever witnessed in my 20-plus years in the \nSenate. We got rid of that.\n  We also, in that bill, made a specific law whereby, when you go to \nthe gas pump in your State and pump that gas, those taxes go to \nWashington and make a U-turn and go back to the State. No State got \nless than 90 percent of the return of those taxes.\n  That is what we are here for, continuity of action and decisionmaking \nby this body, continuity and stability in planning these programs to \nimprove our roads, our infrastructure. There are contracts that reach \nout a year or more, 2 years or more. People have to order materials. \nThey have to do design work. They have to engage labor. That is being \ndone. We see the slow, steady improvement of our infrastructure. Now we \nare challenged by the 4.3 cents. As the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia said, it could have a triggering mechanism where 4.3 cents \ngoes to over 18 cents. As he pointed out, there is no certainty these \nfunds will get back to the pockets of those who put the gas in their \ncar--no certainty. There are many, many levels where various purposes \ncould take off these funds.\n  My distinguished colleague from West Virginia talked about the \ngroups. He put their letters in the Record. This is a group of \norganizations all across this country that support the highway \nconstruction program, whose efforts led to the passage of the ISTEA \nlegislation in this Senate and eventually had it enacted into law.\n  The distinguished Governor from Ohio, who will soon speak, was very \nactive in the National Governors' Association and the Association of \nHighway Administrators, which had given sound support through that \nlegislation. He did not come by it by accident. It took absolutely \nyears to build up to get this done.\n  The National Governors' Association, National Conference of State \nLegislatures, Council of State Governments, U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nNational League of Cities, National Association\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\nof Counties--these are groups that visit us every day on various \nissues. They write:\n\n       Proposals that would interfere with or reduce revenues \n     coming to either trust fund by suspending or repealing any \n     portion of Federal transportation taxes would undercut \n     critical commitments to the nation's public infrastructure \n     and potentially threaten the credit quality of state and \n     local bonds already issued to finance highway, bridge and \n     airport construction and repair.\n\n  Already the contracts are out. The revenue bonds are out. Even the \nAmerican Automobile Association, one of the most valued organizations \nin the history of this country, stated as follows:\n\n       AAA has serious concerns about efforts to suspend or repeal \n     any portion of the federal gas tax. While attractive at first \n     glance, this course of action will do little to address the \n     root cause of our gasoline price problem today, which is a \n     shortage of supply caused by curtailed production of crude \n     oil by [primarily the] OPEC states.\n\n  Our distinguished senior colleague covered that.\n  To reiterate, this Sense of the Senate amendment is critically \nimportant because of legislation that is pending before the Senate to \nsuspend 4.3 cents of the federal gas tax until next January, and \nbecause of the instructions this resolution gives to the Finance \nCommittee to report legislation to repeal the 4.3 cents tax.\n  The budget resolution before the Senate indicates that the \nreconciliation instructions to the Finance Committee provide $150 \nbillion over 5 years in tax cuts that ``could accommodate'' the repeal \nof 4.3 cents of the federal gas tax.\n  It is unsound budget policy for this budget resolution to assume that \na portion of the gas tax will be repealed.\n  It is unsound for several reasons, and today I will share with my \ncolleagues the reasons for my concerns.\n  I join with my colleagues in their frustration with the rising price \nof gasoline. It is too high and threatens the continuation of our \nrobust economy.\n  In our efforts to respond to OPEC's choking off of supply and the \nabsence of leadership by this administration, we must not promise \nAmerican's tax relief that they may not get. The entire proposal to \nrepeal or suspend the 4.3 cents gas tax and replenish the Highway Trust \nFund with general revenues is fraught with uncertainty.\n  I ask the question, is the repeal, or temporary suspension of 4.3 \ncents of the federal gasoline tax going into the pockets of American \ndrivers? What is the guarantee that this tax cut will be passed on to \nconsumers at the pump?\n  How are they protected from the oil refiners and wholesalers chipping \noff their share? Will the free marketplace enable them to charge the \nsame price at the gas pump?\n  Just last week the Congressional Research Service issued a new \nanalysis entitled ``Transportation Fuel Taxes: Impacts of a Repeal or \nMoratorium,'' which stated:\n\n       Current market conditions and the small amount of tax \n     relief incorporated into most proposals, however, raise \n     uncertainty as to whether prices to individuals and \n     businesses would fall and whether any price decline would be \n     meaningful to consumers.\n\n  If it is not passed on to consumers, and the high prices continue, \nAmericans will feel betrayed.\n  The impact of a repeal on the 4.3 cents is significant on our budget \nsurplus. According to the Department of Transportation, this repeal \nwill result in a loss of $20.5 billion to the Highway Trust Fund for \nthe remaining years of TEA-21--until 2003.\n  Efforts to repeal or suspend the 4.3 cents gas tax has generated \nstrong opposition from the National Governors' Association, the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures, the Council of State \ngovernments, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of \nCities, and the National Association of Counties. They write:\n\n       Proposals that would interfere with or reduce revenues \n     coming into either trust fund by suspending or repealing any \n     portion of federal transportation taxes would undercut \n     critical commitments to the nation's public infrastructure \n     and potentially threaten the credit quality of state and \n     local bonds already issued to finance highway, bridge and \n     airport construction and repair.\n\n  Even the American Automobile Association with millions of members \ndedicated to highway maintenance and safety write:\n\n       AAA has serious concerns about efforts to suspend or repeal \n     any portion of the federal gas tax. While attractive at first \n     glance, this course of action will do little to address the \n     root cause of our gasoline price problem today, which is \n     shortage of supply caused by curtailed production of crude \n     oil by OPEC states.\n\n  The Small Business Legislative Council joins those views with the \nfollowing:\n\n       While small businesses are clearly suffering as a result of \n     the high gasoline prices, we are long time staunch supporters \n     of preserving the integrity of the highway trust fund and \n     making sure that we have the proper infrastructure to deliver \n     our goods and services.\n\n  My colleagues who support this repeal will tell you that the Highway \nTrust Fund will not be harmed--that general fund monies will be used to \nreplace lost revenue to the Highway Trust Fund. This replacement, if it \nactually occurs, will be $20.5 billion.\n  And, where will this $20.5 billion come from? It will come from our \nlimited budget surplus--and it will drain the limited dollars available \nfor lasting tax cuts to Americans.\n  This budget resolution provides for $150 billion for tax cuts to be \ndefined through the reconciliation process by the Finance Committee. I \nsupport this level of funding to relieve the tax burden on Americans. \nBut, do we want to use the on-budget surplus to give a tax cut to \ngasoline wholesalers? Or, do we want to use the funds in the budget \nresolution for other, more certain, tax legislation providing real and \nlasting tax relief.\n  That is the course I want to take.\n  The budget resolution assumption that the Congress will repeal 4.3 \ncents of the gas tax comes to pass, it will have a lasting, negative \nimpact on the Highway Trust Fund. The Highway Trust Fund is the sole \nsource of revenue available to maintain and upgrade our nation's \nhighways, transit systems and highway safety programs.\n  We are in only the second year of the 6-year TEA-21 legislation. Now \nis not the time to take a step backward on the important investments we \nare making in our nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  For over a decade in the Senate, I, along and many others, worked to \nrestore faith with drivers who were promised that gas taxes they pay \nwhen buying gasoline would be used to maintain and modernize our \nhighways and transit systems.\n  Finally, in 1997, with the steadfast, leadership of Senator Byrd, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Bond, and others, we achieved success. TEA-21 \nguarantees that all of the gas taxes motorists pay at the pump will be \nplaced in the Highway Trust Fund and spent--100 percent--on highways, \ntransit, and highway safety.\n  Before TEA-21, the gas tax was increased by 4.3 cents in 1993 to pay \nfor spending on many programs other than transportation or deficit \nreduction. I opposed this tax increase, but it passed.\n  Later, while debating TEA-21, this body voted 80 to 18 not to repeal \nthis tax, now that it was going to the Highway Trust Fund.\n  As our nation's transportation infrastructure aged and crumbled, it \nwas imperative we transfer the 4.3-cents tax from general revenues to \nthe Highway Trust Fund in 1997.\n  The TEA-21 spending guarantee reforms resulted in a 40 percent \nincrease in transportation spending for each of the next 6 years. We \nare only in the second year of TEA-21, yet we can see in every state \nthe transportation construction that is moving forward. We are just \nbeginning to see the benefits of TEA-21 with more projects under \nconstruction, jobs being created, products moving more efficiently \nacross the country, and most importantly, improvements in highway \nsafety.\n  Do we want to turn back the clock and inject uncertainty again into \nour nation's highway program.\n  We are being asked to rely on future legislation that will have an \nuntested triggering mechanism to restore general revenues to the \nHighway Trust Fund. What happens if it doesn't work.\n  Again, this uncertainty will jeopardize the safety of the driving \npublic and the thousands of jobs that are now at work under TEA-21.\n  We all know that it takes years--far too long--for highway and \ntransit projects to make it from the drawing board to construction. \nSevere swings, or even the uncertainty as to the availability of funds, \nin transportation spending will make it nearly impossible for states to \neffectively manage their highway programs.\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\n  Consistent funding levels are critical to the seamless steps of \nplanning, design, engineering, permitting, contract selection, \nmaterials orders, and construction. A stable program, where states, \nlocal governments, and contractors have the benefits of a long-term \nfunding cycle ensures a reliable supply of materials and an \nexperienced, ready workforce.\n  Do we want to stop the modernization of our nation's transportation \nsystem to give the gas middle-man a few more pennies in his pocket? Or, \ndo we keep on course to improve transportation and highway safety for \nall Americans?\n  Lets use wisely our limited budget surplus for meaningful and lasting \ntax relief--not on promises that Americans may never see.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letters to which I referred be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Governors' Association, National Conference of \n           State Legislatures, Council of State Governments, The \n           U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, \n           National Association of Counties, International City/\n           County Management Association,\n                                                    April 5, 2000.\n       To All Senators: We are writing on behalf of the elected \n     leaders of the nation's state and local governments to urge \n     support for the Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond \n     Sense of the Senate Resolution for the continued use of \n     federal fuel taxes for the construction and rehabilitation of \n     our nation's highways, bridges, and transit systems, which is \n     being offered as an amendment to the FY 2001 Budget \n     Resolution.\n       This resolution conforms to state and local leaders' strong \n     opposition to any legislative proposals that would interfere \n     or interrupt the current level of transportation user fees \n     being collected that provide dedicated federal funding for \n     transportation programs. It supports the critical commitment \n     to transportation infrastructure, and the funding mechanism \n     to support that commitment, made in the Transportation Equity \n     Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).\n       Our state and local government members are responsible for \n     almost all the nation's highways, bridges, and transit \n     systems. We cannot afford cuts in federal transportation \n     infrastructure funding such as the 4.3 cents reduction \n     proposed in the Budget Resolution. The 4.3 cents tax on \n     gasoline and diesel brings in $7.2 billion annual to the \n     Highway Trust Fund--$5.8 billion for highways and $1.4 \n     billion for transit. According to the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation, if the 4.3 cents were repealed, the highway \n     program would be cut by $20.5 billion through FY 2003, the \n     final year of TEA-21. The Mass Transit Account of the Highway \n     Trust Fund would go broke in 2003.\n       Again, we urge your support of the Byrd-Warner-Baucus-\n     Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond Resolution.\n           Sincerely,\n     Raymond C. Scheppach,\n       Executive Director, National Governors Association.\n     William T. Pound,\n     Executive Director, National Conference of State \n     Legislatures.\n     Daniel M.

John W. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: AAA encourages you to cosponsor and \n     support an amendment to the Senate budget resolution being \n     offered by Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV). The ``Sense of the \n     Senate'' amendment will put the Senate on record in \n     opposition to any repeal or suspension of the federal \n     gasoline excise tax.\n       AAA has serious concerns about efforts to suspend or repeal \n     any portion of the federal gas tax. While attractive at first \n     glance, this course of action will do little to address the \n     root cause of our gasoline price problem today, which is a \n     shortage of supply caused by curtailed production of crude \n     oil by OPEC states.\n       The benefits to motorists from reducing the gas tax are, at \n     best, minimal--repealing 4.3 cents would amount to about $1/\n     week for the average consumer. However, the resulting loss of \n     revenue to the Highway Trust Fund would be disastrous to the \n     important work of fixing the nation's highways and bridges \n     and improving safety.\n       It is highway and traffic safety that is of most concern to \n     AAA. Lower receipts to the Highway Trust Fund compromise the \n     safety of the traveling public. We take these roads back and \n     forth to work and on vacations, our children take these roads \n     to school, and our public safety officials use these arteries \n     to respond to emergencies.\n       Asking Americans to choose between a gas tax reduction and \n     safety is posing the wrong question. The right question is: \n     How should Congress and the Administration manage an energy \n     strategy that reduces dependence upon a foreign cartel? That \n     way motorists would have the safe highways they've paid for \n     through their gas taxes and an oil supply they can rely on. \n     Short-term fixes, while politically popular, are not in the \n     best interests of highway safety and the overall economic \n     well being of the nation.\n       Congress made a very important decision by creating the \n     Highway Trust Fund and establishing the direct link between \n     user fees paid by motorists and trust fund monies being \n     dedicated to improving the nation's surface transportation \n     infrastructure. Because of TEA-21, the trust fund is now \n     dedicated to providing Americans the safe and efficient \n     transportation system for which they have paid and on which \n     they rely.\n       AAA urges the Senate to recognize that a gas tax \n     reduction--though well-meaning--will (1) provide little, if \n     any, actual relief to motorists; (2) not solve the real \n     problem, which is supply; and (3) cause real problems as our \n     highways and bridges continue to deteriorate and with that, \n     the safety of the motoring public.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Susan G. Pikrallidas,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Public & Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Small Business Legislative Council,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 29, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: On behalf of the Small Business \n     Legislative Council (SBLC), I want to indicate that we must \n     object to the initiative to temporarily roll back the Federal \n     gas tax. While small businesses are clearly suffering as a \n     result of the high gasoline prices, we are long time staunch \n     supporters of preserving the integrity of the highway trust \n     fund and making sure that we have the proper infrastructure \n     to deliver our goods and services.\n       We understand that you intend to pay for this roll back \n     using the ``surplus.'' Right now we have many priorities for \n     the use of that surplus. Repeal of the death tax, increasing \n     direct expensing, full deductibility for the self-employed's \n     health care costs, FUTA tax relief, repeal of the installment \n     sales repeal and national debt reduction to name just a few.\n       As you know, the SBLC is a permanent, independent coalition \n     of nearly 80 trade and professional associations that share a \n     common commitment to the future of small business. Our \n     members represent the interests of small businesses in such \n     diverse economic sectors as manufacturing, retailing, \n     distribution, professional and technical services, \n     construction, transportation, tourism and agriculture. Our \n     policies are developed through a consensus among our \n     membership. Individual associations may express their own \n     views. For your information, a list of our members is \n     enclosed.\n       We appreciate your outstanding leadership on behalf of \n     small business. We believe there must be a better way to \n     provide relief for small business from rising gasoline prices \n     without jeopardizing other small business priorities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  John S. Satagaj,\n                                    President and General Counsel.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia. It is an honor to be on the floor to join with him \nand Senator from Virginia to make the point very strongly that \nsuspension or repeal of the gas tax would be a grave error. Although \nall of us, as Senators, are aware of consumer complaints about the high \ngasoline prices we are facing in our States, we also should keep in \nmind that this is due primarily to factors other than the level of the \ngas tax, as the Senator from West Virginia has pointed out.\n  Our declining production of petroleum and the constriction by OPEC of \nthe supply of gasoline on the world markets is the most significant \nfactor in determining the price at the pump. Cutting the tax would \nmerely reduce the revenues available for improving highway safety \nwithout producing real savings that would be passed on to the \nconsumers. Because of the imposition of tax at the refinery level, \nthere is no\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\nassurance it would come to the gasoline purchaser, the automobile \nowner, or the truck or bus driver.\n  The CRS has issued a report saying there might not be any appreciable \nevidence of a reduction in tax. The consumers would never see it. Who \nwould see it would be those people who are committed to repairing and \nrebuilding our inadequate roads, bridges, and highways.\n  In 1998, I worked hard with our friend and dear colleague, the late \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. John Chafee, on the Bond-Chafee \nguarantee that was incorporated into TEA-21 with the help of the \nSenators who spoke before me--Senator Domenici, Senator Byrd, and \nSenator Warner. That provision created for the first time a real \nguarantee that revenues collected and earmarked for the highway trust \nfund would, in fact, be used for transportation purposes. If we collect \na dollar gas tax, that dollar must be credited to the highway trust \nfund. This guarantees that for the first time highway users will get \nthe transportation benefits in return for the user fee they pay through \nthe gas tax.\n  We cannot have a guarantee if we continue to change the way the \nprogram is funded. To hold the trust fund harmless, supposedly by \nhaving money come from general revenue and projected surpluses, will \nput us back in the same sinking boat--more appropriately, crumbling \nhighway--that we were in before. That position was one where off-budget \nor turnbacks were advocated. This amendment makes clear the budget \nresolution does not assume the reductions of any Federal gasoline tax.\n  We need a Department of Energy that makes energy policy, not the EPA. \nThe administration policy has been no policy. We can stop the raid on \nthe highway funds, and we must not repeal or roll back the gasoline \ntax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, what is at issue is very clear. I hope my \ncolleagues pay attention. The issue is whether this Congress is going \nto break the trust the American people have in the highway trust fund. \nThat is the issue.\n  Dollars going into the Federal highway trust fund are locked in. \nThere is a trust that those dollars are then distributed back to the \nStates. The revenue in the trust fund goes back to the States. It is a \ntrust, an understanding. That is why we have a highway trust fund.\n  We cannot go down the slippery slope of opening up the trust fund and \nreplenishing it with general revenue or using general revenue to pay \nfor highway allocations because once we start down that slippery slope, \nwe will then have broken the trust. We will have sprung a leak, which \nwill grow into perhaps a creek or a river, and will drain the highway \ntrust fund, as the trust is broken. It is that simple.\n  I very much thank the Senator from West Virginia for drawing this to \nthe Senate's attention. Not only is it the resolution before us, but it \nis also any potential revenue matters that might come up in this body. \nThe essential point is the linkage.\n\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to continue the trust this Congress \nmade with the American people when it passed the last highway bill, \nTEA-21. That bill was heralded as a landmark piece of legislation, \noverwhelmingly passed by both bodies. We all touted it, not only \nbecause of the revenues and dedication to the infrastructure so \ndesperately needed but also because of the trust; that is, the \nassurance that the gasoline tax and the diesel fuel tax people pay at \nthe pump will come back to the States; that it will not be tampered \nwith by the Congress; it will not be changed by the Congress. That is \nsomething on which the people could count, of which they could be \nassured. It is something that is certain, something they can trust.\n  I very much hope we resist the temptation, we resist the siren song \nfor a short-term political change, to jigger around with the 4.3 cents, \nrepealing it and adding the difference to the surplus or revenue. It is \nan exercise that is not only futile; it is an exercise that is a \nmisrepresentation of what we did in TEA-21, and it will be an exercise \nwhich begins to break the trust.\n  Either we keep the trust or we do not. There is no halfway here. \nThere is no little breaking of the trust. Either we keep it or we do \nnot. I submit the American people want us to keep the trust. They will \nbe very upset if we break it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print a letter in the \nRecord from various organizations--the National Governors' Association, \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures, the Council of State \nGovernments, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, \nNational Association of Counties, International City/County Management \nAssociation, all in favor of the amendment offered by the Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         National Governors' Association, National Conference of \n           State Legislatures, Council of State Governments, The \n           U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, \n           National Association of Counties, International City/\n           County Management Association,\n                                                    April 5, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: We are writing on behalf of the elected \n     leaders of the nation's state and local governments to urge \n     support of the Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond \n     Sense of the Senate Resolution for the continued use of \n     federal fuel taxes for the construction and rehabilitation of \n     our nation's highways, bridges, and transit systems which is \n     being offered as an amendment to the FY 2001 Budget \n     Resolution.\n       This resolution conforms to the strong opposition that \n     state and local leaders have to any legislative proposals \n     that would interfere or interrupt the current level of \n     transportation user fees being collected that provide \n     dedicated federal funding for transportation programs. It \n     supports the critical commitment to transportation \n     infrastructure, and the funding mechanism to support that \n     commitment, made in the Transportation Equity Act for the \n     21st Century (TEA-21).\n       Our state and local government members are responsible for \n     almost all the nation's highways, bridges, and transit \n     systems. We cannot afford cuts in federal transportation \n     infrastructure funding such as the 4.3 cents reduction \n     proposed in the Budget Resolution. The 4.3 cents tax on \n     gasoline and diesel brings in $7.2 billion annually to the \n     Highway Trust Fund--$5.8 billion for highways and $1.4 \n     billion for transit. According to the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation, if the 4.3 cents were repealed, the highway \n     program would be cut by $20.5 billion through FY 2003, the \n     final year of TEA-21. The Mass Transit Account of the Highway \n     Trust Fund would go broke in 2003.\n       The nation's state and local leaders look forward to \n     working with you on this very important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         Raymond C. Scheppach, Executive Director, National \n           Governors' Association; Daniel M. Sprague, Executive \n           Director, Council of State Governments; Donald J. \n           Borut, Executive Director, National League of Cities; \n           William H. Hansell, Jr., Executive Director, \n           International City/County Management Association; \n           William T. Pound, Executive Director, National \n           Conference of State Legislatures; J. Thomas Cochran, \n           Executive Director, The U.S. Conference of Mayors; \n           Larry E. Naake, Executive Director, National \n           Association of Counties.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor offering this amendment. He knows and the rest of us know that \nrepeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax is not going to solve the problem of \nhigh gasoline prices which today confronts this country. In my opinion, \nthe administration's lack of an energy policy and total inability to \nreact to OPEC's production cut has pushed gasoline prices to $2 per \ngallon in some places in the nation.\n  The fact of the matter is, the American people are angry, and I share \ntheir frustration. The real problem we have today is that we do not \nhave an energy policy in this country.\n  Two weeks ago, when Department of Energy officials testified before \nthe Governmental Affairs committee, I asked them whether or not they \nhad an energy policy. I asked them if we were too reliant upon foreign \noil. Their answer to that was yes we are too reliant on foreign oil.\n  I said: Your department is predicting that in the next 10 years we \nare going to be 65-percent reliant on foreign oil. How reliant should \nwe be? Is it 45, 50 percent?\n  They had no answer.\n  I said: As a former Governor, if I had a problem, I would set a \nnumber and say it is going to be 45 or 50 and then put a plan together \nand move forward and get it done.\n\n[[Page S2205]]\n\n  I hope in this debate over whether or not we ought to reduce the gas \ntax, the administration and Members of Congress take advantage of this \nwonderful opportunity to come together to look at the environmental \nconcerns, look at the issue of exploration, look at the problems of the \nstripper well producers in this country who are out of business because \nthe cost of a barrel of oil has been too low. We need to get it all on \nthe table so that we do not have a repeat performance, and so that we \nare not at the mercy of foreign oil producing nations, some of whom are \nactually avowed enemies of the United States of America.\n\n  I've said many times the price is going to go down because the \nadministration is going to put the pressure on these nations. But what \nI would like to know is, what are the promises they are going to be \nmaking in order to get the price down? We ought not to be in this \nposition.\n  I happen to have been chairman of the National Governors' Association \nwhen Congress did TEA-21. Most Governors were opposed to the 4.3-cent \ngas tax in 1993 but we came back and said: If you move that from \ndeficit reduction to the highway trust fund, we will support it.\n  I want everyone to understand that for the donor States--and Ohio is \na donor State--without that 4.3 cents, we would not have a guarantee of \n90.5 percent of the money we are sending to Washington. This is the way \nwe helped get some of our money back into our State.\n  I think if you ask most of the highway directors of the States in \nthis country, they will tell you that without that 4.3-cent gas tax, \nthey are not going to have any new construction programs. All of the \nrest of our gas tax money goes for the maintenance and repair of our \nhighways. The new construction is being paid for by that 4.3-cent gas \ntax.\n  There are some people who say: Don't worry about it because the money \nwill come from the on-budget surplus or from someplace else. My answer \nto that is, we have a users' tax. The people who use the highways pay \nthe tax for the highways. I do not think it is fair that we should say \nto the people of the country what we are going to do is reduce the \nhighway users' tax and we are going to make everyone else pay to make \nup for the tax reduction.\n  I would like to say I am just prayerful that this amendment passes, \nthat it passes overwhelmingly, that we send the message that we are not \nfor repealing the 4.3-cent gas tax and that we take advantage of this \nwonderful opportunity to come together and develop an energy policy for \nthis great Nation of ours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if Senator Byrd could yield me 3 minutes off \nhis time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I yield whatever time the Senator wishes to consume.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to argue in two parts.\n  My first part has to do with the highways and byways and freeways of \nAmerica and our home cities across this land. I think there is no one \nin this Chamber who has not been home to their State and found that \npeople somewhere in their State are frustrated because we do not have \nadequate roads to handle the traffic.\n  No, I am not suggesting I know how to do that in terms of these very \nheavily congested areas. But there is no doubt, we are way behind the \ncurve in terms of supplying highways, freeways, and arteries in our \ncities.\n  You are not going to tell the American people they can't have their \ndream. I mean, their dream is to own a house and own a car or cars. One \nof their big dreams is to have that place where they want it. We are \njust never going to succeed in telling the American people: You cannot \nlive 5 miles from your employment, as they did in Russia. They had it \nall figured out: They all worked; they all got on one train; and they \nall went to work. In fact, they told them in high school what they were \ngoing to be.\n  That is not America. So we are behind. In fact, I am not sure in most \nplaces we are gaining on the congestion and traffic. Frankly, I could \ncome down here and say I am pretty satisfied that repeal of the 4.3-\ncent tax would not hurt next year, but in 7 years actually it would \nhurt.\n  The truth of the matter is, we should not deceive anybody. The \nproblem we have is the problem that America uses more crude oil and \ncrude-oil products than we are now producing.\n  Frankly, we have an American policy, I regret to say--especially \nsince President Bill Clinton has been in office and Vice President \nGore--of taking more and more of America, the public lands, out of \nproduction that you cannot use; you cannot get on it to find oil, even \nif it is there, all under some mystique that on ``public domain'' we \nshould not be looking for oil, that we ought to be saving it for \nsomething.\n  Then tonight we are going to have a debate, I say to the Senator. I \nam not sure where everyone is going to be on it. But actually one one-\nhundredth of 1 percent of the Arctic wilderness, called ANWR, one one-\nhundredth of 1 percent is a little strip of land that they are trying \nto say: Why don't we try to find out if there is oil there?\n  You know what they think might be there? Sixteen billion barrels of \noil. Pretty much. It is as much as we will import from Saudi Arabia \nover the next 5, 6, 7 years. That would be the amount. That is pretty \ngood. That is a pretty large amount of oil. All of it would be owned by \nAmericans. All of it would be drilled by Americans. Americans would \nhave jobs.\n  Instead, we say it is just going to ruin that wilderness. Somebody \nwho is neutral ought to pass on that, not somebody who wants to save \nthis wilderness, including one one-hundredth of 1 percent of the land \nsurface.\n  If I had my notes from my desk, I would tell you how much we have \ntaken out of production in America. We have taken lands on which people \ncould find oil, and we have said: You cannot get on it to find oil.\n  We have regulations, through the Department of the Interior, that \ninstead of saying, hey, get out here and find your oil, they make it \ntough. It is sort of like: Boy, do we have to put up with you? It is \nnot like: Boy, I hope you find oil.\n  It is American oil. It is sort of like: Maybe it is OK, but it is \njust too bad that we have to do this. What is too bad about it? We are \ngoing to buy this oil someplace. We have less American oil, fewer rigs \nproducing oil, and we are getting more dependent.\n  The last point is, according to the independent institute within the \nDepartment of Energy, the one that is supposed to do analysis of \nsupply, they tell us--I hope they are wrong--they cannot find out how \nmuch the production of the world is. That sounds incredible. If they \ncannot, somebody in our Government should. We should not be surprised \nall of a sudden if somebody says: You know, they are producing 4 \nmillion barrels less. We are hurting.\n  We ought to know; there is no way to keep this a real secret. If we \nset out to find it, I am sure we could. In fact, I think there are \nprobably some parts of the American Government we do not know about \nthat might already know that. But that is very important.\n  To summarize, my last point is, we need to build more roads for \nAmerica's congestion, not less. Secondly, we need to take a positive \napproach. If the President does not want to, we will not get it done \nfor a while. But we have to decide what are our goals as Americans in \nterms of producing energy? How much should we be conserving? Let's get \nserious about it.\n  This will not happen with a bunch of Government regs. This will \nhappen when the marketplace of America is opened up to oil and gas \nproduction. I am even wondering whether the largest supply of natural \ngas is offshore in some parts of America. We have said: No more \noffshore drilling.\n  It isn't environmentally dangerous. In fact, I submit to the Senate, \nit is more dangerous to increase our reliance and thus bring more \ntankers into American ports than it would be to seriously consider \ndoing more offshore drilling.\n  But, of course, for some people what I am speaking about is kind of \nradical. I think it is really kind of common sense about America's \ngrowing dependence. I am not ashamed or embarrassed about saying I \nwould change it drastically. I would recommend that somebody change it \ndramatically. Tell the world we are going to try. We are not going to \ngive in.\n  We currently think it is an American energy policy to send the \nSecretary of\n\n[[Page S2206]]\n\nEnergy--one of New Mexico's sons; my friend--around to make a deal. \nThat is America's energy policy? Have you ever heard of anything like \nthat being the policy of America? What if they said no?\n  In this case, they started asking a few questions and said: Maybe we \ndon't want to hurt your economy. Kuwait does not know what we want of \nthem. We saved them from the invasion. They do not know whether we want \nto dance on a barrel of oil or what we want. They already said: Look, \nAmerica, you send us so many signals, we don't know what to do. But we \nare on your side.\n  I think we ought to be very clear, it is not this 4.3-cent tax. What \nit is, we do not have a policy to produce more and tell the world we \nare growing more independent rather than dependent.\n  Whatever time I have, if I have any, I yield back.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nvery enlightening statement. I have listened to him on this floor many \ntimes over the years. I do not think I have enjoyed more any statement \nof his than I have this evening.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bingaman, Senator \nRobb, and Senator Lincoln be added as cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I see no other Senator asking for time on \nthis side.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under terms of the unanimous consent \nagreement on the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia, the \nagreement said we would use all time tonight on this amendment. Is \nSenator Lautenberg wishing to speak on the amendment of Senator Byrd \ndealing with gas tax repeal?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. While I wasn't present to hear Senator Byrd's \npresentation, there is no doubt in my mind that the Byrd proposal is \none we have to support. The last thing we want to do now is to reduce \nthat tax in order that we might give OPEC or the distributors, \nwhomever, a chance to boost the price for the difference.\n  One of the toughest things we have to do is to try to meet our \nobligations with the resources we have available. The American people \nknow very well that one of the most important things we do is to \nmaintain our transportation infrastructure. I plan to do whatever I can \nto see that that is done.\n  My remarks are short, but they are very supportive. I congratulate \nSenator Byrd for his usual wisdom in presenting something that we have \nto think seriously about and, frankly, I support fully. I thank him for \nthat.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nkind and supportive statement. I thank all Senators who have spoken on \nthis subject for their remarks. I thank them for their support, and I \nhope all of our colleagues tomorrow will vote in favor of the amendment \nI have offered on behalf of myself and the other Senators named \nthereon.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the next amendment in order \nwill be offered by the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is my understanding. Senator Roth is on the floor, \nI believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2955\n\n(Purpose: To strike the revenue assumption for ANWR receipts in fiscal \n                               year 2005)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Boxer, Baucus, Jeffords, Schumer, Dodd, Feingold, \nLieberman, Murray, Chafee, Robb, and Torricelli.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], for himself, Mrs. \n     Boxer, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Lieberman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. L. Chafee, Mr. \n     Robb, and Mr. Torricelli, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2955.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 27, line 20, increase the amount by $1,200,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 21, increase the amount by $1,200,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 20, decrease the amount by $1,200,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 21, decrease the amount by $1,200,000,000.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the gentleman from Delaware consent to \nthe Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg, and the Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid, being added as cosponsors of the amendment?\n  Mr. ROTH. I am happy to have them join as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, the Senator from New \nMexico, for what I consider to be an excellent budget resolution. Over \nthe next 5 years, the Budget Committee chairman has protected Social \nSecurity, funded our priorities such as defense and education, and \nprovided for a $150 billion tax cut--something I look forward to \ncrafting in the Finance Committee.\n  However, there is one point at which I respectfully disagree with my \ndistinguished colleague's work. It is in the assumptions of allowing \nleasing for oil exploration and production in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. This budget resolution assumes that $1.2 billion would \nbecome available in fiscal year 2005 from the bids for such leases.\n  My amendment would simply remove that assumed revenue from the budget \nresolution and thereby protect this wilderness area.\n  My reason for offering this amendment is based on beauty, not on \nbudgets. I do not want to see us make an irreparable mistake in one of \nAmerica's remaining natural treasures. We can afford to forgo this \nmomentary revenue, but we can't afford not to protect this Arctic Eden.\n  Mr. President, in 1960 President Dwight Eisenhower had the wisdom to \nset aside a portion of America's Arctic for the benefit and enjoyment \nof future generations. His Arctic Range protected the highest peaks and \nglaciers of the Brooks Range, North America's two largest and most \nnortherly alpine lakes, and nearly 200 different wildlife species, \nincluding polar bears, grizzlies, wolves, caribou and millions of \nmigratory birds.\n  Eisenhower's Secretary of the Interior, Fred Seaton, called the new \nArctic Range, ``one of the most magnificent wildlife and wilderness \nareas in North America . . . a wilderness experience not duplicated \nelsewhere.''\n  The Alaskan wilderness area is not only a critical part of our \nEarth's ecosystem--the last remaining region where the complete \nspectrum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems comes together--but it is a \nvital part of our national consciousness.\n  The Alaskan wilderness is a place of outstanding wildlife, wilderness \nand recreation, a land dotted by beautiful forests, dramatic peaks and \nglaciers, gentle foothills and undulating tundra. It is untamed--rich \nwith caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolves, musk oxen, Dall sheep, \nmoose, and hundreds of thousands of birds--snow geese, tundra swans, \nblack brant, and more. Birds from the Arctic Refuge fly to or through \nevery state in the continental U.S. In all, Mr. President, about 200 \nspecies use the coastal plain.\n  Mr. President, there are parts of this Earth where it is good that \nman can come only as a visitor. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \none of those places. These are pristine lands that belong to all of us. \nAnd perhaps most importantly, these are the lands that belong to our \nfuture.\n  In essence what I am asking my colleagues to support is an \nenvironmental stewardship that protects our important wilderness areas \nand precious resources, while carefully and judiciously weighing the \nshort-term desires or our country against its long-term needs.\n  Considering the many reasons why protecting this area is so \nimportant, I came across the words of the great Western writer, Wallace \nStegner. Referring to the land we seek to protect, he wrote that it is \n``the most splendid part of the American habitat; it is also the most \nfragile.'' We cannot enter this land ``carrying habits that [are] \ninappropriate and expectations that [are] surely excessive.''\n  An industrial zone and wilderness cannot occupy the same space. The\n\n[[Page S2207]]\n\nsimple fact is that no matter how well done, oil exploration and \ndevelopment would have significant and lasting impacts on this \nenvironment.\n  In closing, I want to remind my colleagues that when the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge was formally created under the 1980 Alaska \nNational Interest Lands Conservation Act, it was to conserve fish and \nwildlife populations in their natural diversity. Oil development on the \ncoastal plain of the refuge is prohibited without the enactment of \nlegislation authorizing development.\n  I urge my colleagues, to support my amendment and reject the budget \nresolution's assumptions on oil drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. Let us reconfirm to protect today what can never be \nregained tomorrow if we make the wrong decision now.\n  I hope that we can forever protect the coastal plain from \ndevelopment. It is certainly premature at this time to assume revenue \nfrom oil development there.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to support the Roth amendment, \nwhich expresses the sense of the Senate that we should maintain the \nlongstanding ban on oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n  We have heard a lot of concern lately about the cost of gas at the \npump.\n  I share that concern. I represent Montana. The Big Sky State. Vast \nopen spaces. We often drive long distances just to get to the grocery \nstore.\n  Prices at the pump in Billings have gone from $1.18 in April of 1999 \nto $1.59 today. We need to get the price down. The administration has \nmade some progress, with the OPEC countries. We may need to do more. \nFor example, we may need to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But we \nshould not respond to high gas prices by opening the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. That would be shortsighted, ineffective, and \nenvironmentally harmful.\n  Proponents of oil drilling make three main arguments. They imply it \nwill lower the price at the pump. They argue that it will enhance our \nenergy security. And they argue that it won't really pose a significant \nenvironmental risk to the refuge.\n  I disagree. Let me take the arguments in turn.\n  First, the cost at the pump. Opening the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge will have absolutely no impact on gas prices, now or in the \nforeseeable future. Think about it. Assume that we pass a law \nauthorizing drilling. Assume the President signs it. First, companies \nwill need to conduct exploration to determine where to drill. Next they \nwill have to build the infrastructure, the roads, drill pads, drill \nrigs, pipelines, gravel pits, waste pits, and living and working \nquarters. This could include hundreds of miles of roads and pipelines, \nproduction facilities, increased traffic at loading ports, and housing \nand services for thousands of people.\n  This work will take years and years. Senator Murkowski himself said, \nin 1998, that ``a future decision on ANWR is one which will take about \n10 years to produce any results in the way of any increased production \ncontribution to our current flow of domestic oil.'' Ten years, before \nwe see any impact on the price at the pump.\n\n  Let me turn to the longer term issue. Energy security. Let's look at \nwhat the potential oil of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge means in \nthe big picture. At best, the economically recoverable oil would \nrepresent 2 percent of our daily needs. As a result, oil drilling in \nthe Arctic Wildlife Refuge has little, if anything, to do with long-\nterm energy security.\n  Another point. It does not make good strategic sense to use our \nreserves, which account for only 12 percent of the crude oil available \nin the world, while we have access to other sources. After all, once \nour reserves are used up, we will be totally at the mercy of OPEC.\n  Instead of continuing our unhealthy dependence on OPEC, we should \ndevelop a comprehensive energy strategy. We should improve energy \nefficiency. We should diversify our energy sources.\n  What are we doing here in Congress? Virtually nothing.\n  We continue to prevent an increase in corporate average fuel economy. \nWe routinely underfund the development of solar and renewable energy. \nAnd we fail to seriously consider tax legislation that rewards \nefficiency and increases our energy security.\n  In the absence of a comprehensive national energy strategy, drilling \nthe refuge is just a band-aid. A quick fix. It's no substitute for a \nreal, comprehensive, strategy.\n  Putting this all together, drilling in the Arctic Refuge will not \nreduce prices at the pump anytime soon, if at all. And it will not \nsignificantly enhance our energy security.\n  Now consider the environmental impact. The Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge is truly unique. It is the only refuge of its type in the world. \nI've been there. It has been referred to, for good reason, as \n``America's Serengeti.'' It's the nation's largest and most northerly \nwildlife refuge. It includes a full range of arctic and subarctic \nhabitats. Vast herds of caribou migrate to the refuge, bearing their \nyoung on the coastal plain. Muskox use the area year-round. The refuge \nis the most important polar bear land denning area in Alaska. One \nhundred eighty bird species migrate there, from throughout the \nhemisphere. Eighteen major rivers contain 36 species of fish.\n\n  Let's look at what development might do. What happens when the \nconstruction of, say, a pipeline and road forces wildlife away? Take \nthe caribou hers. Female caribou seek out the best foraging areas as \ncalving areas. These areas change each year. If, in any given year, the \nbest foraging and calving area is a site for development, the caribou \nwon't use it and fewer calves will survive. Development can also force \nfemales into areas where there are more predators, or block them from \nclimbing onto ridge tops to avoid swarms of insects. Again, fewer \ncalves will survive.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service has concluded that the cumulative \nimpacts of these effects could significantly reduce the size of the \ncaribou hers. The Service has expressed similar concerns about \nmuskoxen.\n  What about disturbances from road building? There is not enough water \nto build only ice roads. You'd have to build gravel roads, even for \nexploration. Gravel roads will alter the natural flow of water during \nspring breakup, will melt permafrost, and will otherwise damage the \nenvironment. Taken together, this could harm the habitat for more than \n100 species of birds. This, in turn, will have effects way beyond the \nrefuge itself. All of these birds are migratory. They nest and rear \ntheir young in the Refuge in the summer, then migrate throughout the \nentire hemisphere, including virtually every state.\n  Now, the proponents of drilling say that the environmental impacts \nhave been exaggerated. They say that the ``footprint'' of development \nis no larger than Dulles Airport. In fact, the development will not be \nconcentrated in a small area.\n  This map, based on projections by the Fish and Wildlife Service, \nshows potential pipelines, drilling pads, roads, and other facilities. \nAs you can see, the roads and pipelines stretch across the entire \ncoastal plain, bisecting migration paths and stream channels. What's \nmore, recent reports by the U.S. Geological Service show that the oil \nreserves in the Refuge are smaller and more widely dispersed than \npreviously thought. As a result, oil development will require more, and \nmore widely dispersed, roads, pipelines, and other infrastructure. \nFinally, accidents.\n  If the Exxon Valdez taught us anything, it is that humans working in \na cold, harsh environment can make mistakes, and that the environmental \ncosts in a fragile ecosystem can be extraordinarily high. Our \nexperience elsewhere on the North Slope confirms this. There has been a \ngeneral increase in the number of spills. At least two well-blowouts \nhave occurred. At least 76 areas have been contaminated by oil \ndevelopment from the Prudhoe Field. Things usually don't go as smoothly \nas we plan.\n  That brings me to my final point. It may be that, someday, the need \nwill be so great, and the technology so sophisticated, that we decide \nthat the benefits of exploration and development of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge are worth it. But we should only make that decision \nafter careful deliberation,\n\n[[Page S2208]]\n\nafter exhausting all reasonable alternatives, and after assuring that \nthis fragile ecosystem will, in fact, be protected. Because there's no \nmargin for error. If we make a mistake, and allow development that \ndestroys the unique character of this special place, the mistake will \nbe permanent and, perhaps, unforgivable.\n  Mr. President, pulling all of this together, the benefits of drilling \nsimply are not worth it. They are not worth the environmental risks.\n  Therefore, I urge Members to vote to maintain the longstanding ban on \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, by voting for the Roth \namendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator \nRoth's amendment to the budget resolution, and I thank the Senator for \nhis leadership on matters relating to the future of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, or ANWR. The purpose and rationale behind the Roth \namendment is simple: We should not include revenue assumptions in the \nbudget based on oil development that will not, and should not, occur. \nSuch faulty assumptions make poor fiscal policy and poor environmental \npolicy. The Arctic Refuge is a national treasure. I support Senator \nRoth's efforts to designate the area as wilderness, and I am pleased to \nadd my name as a cosponsor to the Roth wilderness bill.\n  The crux of this debate is on our values, our legacy, and what we \nwant to pass on to future generations. Senator Baucus mentioned the \nSerengeti National Park in Africa, an area immortalized in the human \nimagination for its beauty and majesty. This amazing park exists \nbecause previous generations had the foresight to preserve and protect \nthis area from development. As Senator Baucus said, the Coastal Plain \nof the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is referred to as the ``American \nSerengeti.'' And like its counterpart in Africa, this area deserves to \nbe protected for us, our children, and our grandchildren.\n  In 1980, in recognition of the area's immense environmental value, as \nSenator Roth said, Congress formally established the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. At that time, and after much debate and deliberation, \nCongress made the wise decision to prohibit drilling in the Coastal \nPlain pending further review.\n  Now, only a short 20 years later, efforts are underway to open this \narea to development.\n  I urge my colleagues to resist these efforts, to look past our short \nterm needs, and designate the area as wilderness for future \ngenerations. The very definition of a ``refuge'' means an area of \nsanctuary, shelter and protection. In the case of our wildlife refuges, \nthis means protecting nature from drilling, road construction, \ncombustion engines and all of the other harmful effects of human beings \nand their machines. A large portion of the Alaskan North Slope is \nalready open to oil exploration or drilling; we should not subject ANWR \nto the same fate.\n  Some have voiced concern at our increasing dependence on foreign oil, \nand our lack of a coherent national energy policy. I share these \nconcerns, and agree completely that our country must take steps to \nimprove our energy security. But the solution to our energy problems \ndoes not lie underneath the coastal plain of ANWR, and drilling there \ncannot become our energy policy. Remember, by definition, a refuge is a \nplace providing protection or shelter--it is a haven, a sanctuary--we \nmust make sure that ANWR remains a haven, a sanctuary.\n  I thank my colleagues for their consideration, and I respectfully \nurge them to support the Roth amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator for \nyielding. I stand in complete support of his amendment, an amendment \nvery similar to the one offered by my colleague, the Senator from \nCalifornia, in the Budget Committee.\n  It should be kept in context that this budget resolution, without the \nRoth amendment, assumes $1.2 billion in royalties from the sale of oil \nfrom drilling in the Arctic Wildlife National Refuge.\n  I want to say to Members of the Senate that the reason we are \ndebating this is because the price of gasoline is increasing in the \nUnited States. People are more sensitized to the cost of fuel and \nenergy and the impact it has on businesses, families, and individuals.\n  Those who have been salivating for decades for an opportunity to \ndrill in this wildlife refuge in Alaska have jumped at the chance to \nassume that we are so consumed by the increase in energy prices that we \nwill cast aside any concern for the environment and the legacy which we \nshould leave to future generations.\n  Senator Roth is right. We should not be drilling in ANWR. We have to \nconsider the fact that on the North Slope, 95 percent is already open \nto exploration. The 5 percent on the Coastal Plain that we have set \naside is to protect what we have identified as a legitimate, important \nwildlife refuge.\n  Oil companies and their supporters can't wait to drill in that \nwildlife refuge. I think it is wrong. I think Senator Roth is right, as \nSenator Boxer was in committee.\n  We should say unequivocally in a bipartisan fashion on the floor of \nthe Senate that we need an energy policy, but we do not need to walk in \nand desecrate a wildlife refuge designed to be preserved for future \ngenerations.\n  This last Saturday in Belleville, IL, I paid $1.39 a gallon for \nregular gasoline. I then drove 100 miles to Springfield, IL, and paid \n$1.49. Yes, prices have increased. Yes, I am sure for families of \nlimited means and some businesses there is sacrifice attached to it. \nBut we shouldn't use this as a catalyst or a reason to run headlong \ninto this effort to desecrate this important environmental refuge.\n  We need to face the reality that America needs an energy policy, and \nwe shouldn't wait for a gasoline price crisis to drive us to the point \nto develop one. Such an energy policy is going to include a lot of \nthings, such as looking for responsible areas for oil exploration and \ndevelopment; also, of course, energy efficiency not only in our \nautomobiles but in virtually everything that we use involving energy. \nOf course, it will lessen our dependence on foreign oil sources. We \nneed to look for alternative fuels.\n  This is an important, complicated but a necessary national debate.\n  This quick fix of drilling in ANWR in the belief that it is going to \nbring down gasoline prices is wrong on two counts.\n  First, it is not likely to bring them down, if at all, until years \nfrom now.\n  Second, it really avoids the obvious responsibility we have to \npreserve this important refuge.\n  Senator Roth is offering an amendment which is consistent with a \nmember of his party who served in the United States as President many \nyears ago by the name of Theodore Roosevelt, who said in his efforts to \npreserve the environment:\n\n       We must ask ourselves if we are leaving for future \n     generations an environment that is as good or better than \n     what we found.\n\n  Senator Roth's amendment says this Senate will go on record leaving a \nlegacy for future generations in the name and in the memory of Theodore \nRoosevelt, ``as good or better than what we found,'' that we will not \nallow this exploitation and exploration of this valuable and fragile \nnatural resource.\n  I stand in complete support of this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Roth for offering this \namendment. I offered almost an identical amendment in the Budget \nCommittee, and it failed on a tie vote. I am very hopeful that we will \ndo better on the floor of the Senate. We were able to pick up one \nRepublican in the committee. We had all the Democrats. I think we have \na good chance of picking up, with the help of Senator Roth and Senator \nChafee, some more on their side of the aisle.\n  This amendment would strike from the budget $1.2 billion in receipts \nthat\n\n[[Page S2209]]\n\nthe budget resolution assumed would be received from oil exploration or \ndrilling operations in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  I stand with those who have spoken very eloquently tonight, and say \nthat we cannot allow that beautiful, pristine sanctuary--one of the \nmost remarkable wildlife habitats in the world--to be spoiled.\n  We have a beautiful picture, with which I am sure Senator Murkowski \nis familiar.\n  The wildlife refuge was established in 1960 by a Republican \nPresident, President Dwight D. Eisenhower. And it was for the benefit \nof his generation and future generations; that is, all of us. I think \nwe have an obligation to keep that going, just as he kept it going for \nus.\n  From the very beginning, support for this refuge has been bipartisan. \nThank goodness we see evidence of that on the Senate floor. Too few \ntimes, I am sad to say, do we see such bipartisanship. That is why I am \ndelighted to work with Senator Roth on this.\n  This land that President Eisenhower set aside in the Arctic \nwilderness is ecologically unique. It is the last remaining region \nwhere the complete spectrum of Arctic and sub-Arctic ecosystems can be \nfound. It includes the highest peaks and glaciers of the Brooks Range.\n  President Eisenhower's Secretary of the Interior, Fred Seaton, called \nthe new Arctic Refuge ``one of the most magnificent wildlife and \nwilderness areas in North America . . . a wilderness experience not \nduplicated anywhere else.''\n  Nothing has changed since then. It is still there. But we can destroy \nit here.\n  I am stunned that the Budget Committee let this go. I am stunned the \nmajority on the Budget Committee put in $1.2 billion as if we were \ngoing to allow this to happen next year. We are not going to allow this \nto happen.\n  I would like to say tonight to my good friend from Alaska, whom I \nrespect--we have some good arguments now and then, and we probably will \nhave them again--that we are going to fight this out. To put $1.2 \nbillion in as if we were going to start getting receipts from this next \nyear makes no sense at all.\n  I can guarantee--I shouldn't say that because you never can guarantee \nanything around here, but I believe we will have more than 41 people \nwho will stand on their feet as long as it takes to stop that from \nhappening.\n  To put it in the budget resolution, No. 1, is wrong because it is \npresuming the Senate is going to approve this when I don't believe it \nwill happen.\n  This area is tremendously rich with nearly 200 different wildlife \nspecies including polar bears, grizzlies, wolves, caribou, and a whole \nlist of others, including millions of migratory birds. Amazingly, birds \nfrom the Arctic Refuge fly to or through every State in the continental \nUnited States of America. This is not only an Alaska issue. We all \nbenefit from this refuge. I cannot reconcile the concept of drilling \nwith a wildlife refuge. It seems to me they don't go together. If you \nare going to set aside a wildlife refuge, you should not allow drilling \nthere at all. Drilling will raise disturbing questions about what our \nrefuges are for. If wildlife are not guaranteed protection from oil \ndrilling, where are they safe?\n  My colleague, Senator Roth, has introduced legislation, of which I am \na cosponsor, which would forever safeguard this great national treasure \nby designating it wilderness area. This permanently protects it from \noil exploration and development. That protection is warranted and \nreasonable. As Senator Durbin has pointed out, nearly 95 percent of the \narctic slope is available to industry for oil and gas development. It \nmakes sense to shield this last remaining piece. I hope Chairman Roth's \nwilderness proposal will get full consideration.\n  Instead, what are we seeing? Instead of moving forward with that \nwonderful piece of legislation that has bipartisan support, we have a \nbudget resolution that essentially slaps its hand at Senator Roth's \nlegislation and includes $1.2 billion, as if we will open it up without \na fight.\n  It isn't going to happen. It is not realistic. It is funny numbers. \nIt isn't going to happen. We are not going to let it happen. What we \nshould be doing is passing Senator Roth's legislation for our \nwilderness instead of plugging in a number.\n  It reminds me of the fight over the Presidio. Senator Murkowski from \nAlaska helped me save the Presidio. One year, I say to Senator \nMurkowski, there was a plug put in the budget of $1 billion for selling \nthe Presidio. As I explained to my friends, that will never happen; the \ncity and county of San Francisco would not allow this magnificent \nformer military base to become anything other than a park; you are not \ngoing to get $1 billion there. Finally, I prevailed on my colleagues. \nThey backed off and we never put the plug in.\n  And we are prevailing tonight. Don't put that $1.2 billion plug in \nbecause it is not real. It is wrong. It goes against what we ought to \nbe doing.\n  I understand the rising gas price phenomenon because I am in a State \nthat has some of the highest gas prices. Believe me, it hurts at the \npump. We are looking at $2 a gallon where I come from.\n  My constituency wants me to do something about it, and I have come up \nwith a plan. The plan is pretty straightforward. No. 1, why are we \nexporting gas from Alaska to other countries when we need to use it \nhere? That is 68,000 barrels a day. Second, why don't we increase the \nenergy efficiency of SUVs and light trucks? That will bring 1 million \nbarrels a day. We can do that to get them up to 27 miles per gallon. \nThat can be done.\n  Why don't we say there should be a moratorium on the oil company \nmergers? We know less competition brings higher prices. It is the rule \nof a capitalistic system. We need more competition. That is what we \nought to be doing. We ought not be drilling in a wildlife refuge on the \ncoast of California or any of our magnificent offshore areas.\n  The American people realize this. I have letters favoring Senator \nRoth's bill. Tonight I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord letters from several environmental organizations, including the \nLeague of Conservation Voters, that will use this as a scored vote.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         League of\n\n\n                                          Conservation Voters,\n\n                                                    April 4, 2000.\n     Re Protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--Vote ``YES'' \n       on the Roth Arctic Wilderness Amendment to the 2001 Budget \n       Resolution\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is \n     the bipartisan political voice of the national environmental \n     community. Each year, LCV publishes the National \n     Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of \n     members of Congress on environmental legislation. The \n     Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters \n     nationwide, and the press.\n       The League of Conservation Voters urges you to protect the \n     biological heart of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by \n     supporting an amendment offered by Senator Roth (R-DE) to the \n     2001 Budget Resolution that opposes opening the Refuge to oil \n     drilling. Currently the budget resolution assumes revenues \n     from drilling in the Refuge.\n       Some members of Congress are using the current high price \n     of gasoline as a pretext to open the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge to oil drilling. The current price of gasoline in no \n     way justifies destroying this national treasure. Development \n     of the Refuge's coastal plain will not impact oil supplies \n     until far into the future, and the amount of oil that lies \n     beneath it is minimal compared to our national energy needs.\n       The Arctic Refuge is home to wolves, polar bears, caribou \n     and millions of migratory birds. It is also the last 5% of \n     Alaska's vast north coastline that remains off-limits to the \n     oil companies. And the Refuge plays an integral part in the \n     lives of the Gwich'in people who depend on the seasonal \n     migrations of the caribou for both survival and cultural \n     identity.\n       Protecting the wilderness values of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge is one of the top priorities of the national \n     environmental community. LCV urges you to vote ``YES'' on \n     Senator Roth's amendment to protect the Arctic Refuge.\n       LCV's Political Advisory Committee will consider including \n     votes on this issue in compiling LCV's 2000 Scorecard. If you \n     need more information, please call Betsy Loyless in my office \n     at (202) 785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deb Callahan,\n                                                        President.\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                            Natural Resources Defense Council,\n\n                                                    April 4, 2000.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the more than \n     400,000 Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) members from \n     across the country to respectfully urge you to oppose any \n     legislative provisions that would open up the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil exploration. As you know, the \n     FY 2001 Budget Resolution that the Senate Budget Committee \n     reported to floor includes damaging language that assumes \n     revenues from oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge.\n       Under the guise of combating high gas prices, some \n     legislators are pressing to open the Arctic Refuge's 1.5 \n     million-acre coastal plain to oil exploitation. The coastal \n     plain is often called. ``America's Serengeti'' because of its \n     abundant caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolf and other \n     wildlife populations, and represents the last five-percent of \n     Alaska's Arctic Slope not already open to development. It \n     would be ill-advised to open up our nation's Arctic \n     wilderness for a questionable, short-term supply of oil.\n       We respectfully encourage you to oppose any bill or \n     resolution that would open up the last pristine wilderness in \n     the Arctic to oil and gas development, and urge you to \n     support Senator Roth's amendment to the 2001 Budget \n     Resolution to strike Arctic Refuge drilling revenues from the \n     federal budget.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John H. Adams,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    National Parks\n\n\n                                     Conservation Association,\n\n                                                    April 4, 2000.\n\n     Re Oppose degradation of the Arctic Coastal Plain\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our 400,000, the National Parks \n     Conservation Association strongly urges you to oppose efforts \n     to include projected revenues from oil drilling in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain in the pending \n     Budget Reconciliation bill.\n       The Arctic coastal plain has long been recognized as a \n     spectacular national gem because of its spectacular scenery \n     and diverse and abundant wildlife. The coastal plain richly \n     deserves its tag of ``America's Serengeti,'' as over 130,000 \n     caribou of the Porcupine herd migrate there every spring to \n     their calving grounds, and more than 300,000 snow geese are \n     found there in the fall.\n       Attempts to open the coastal plain for drilling for oil \n     have reared their head in Congress over the past three \n     decades. Recent increases in gasoline prices have renewed the \n     call to open the plain for oil production, resulting in an \n     ``assumption'' of revenue from drilling in the Arctic Refuge \n     in the Budget Reconciliation bill.\n       Opening up the coastal plain would not be a solution to the \n     short-term increases in gasoline prices, nor would it address \n     the nation's long-term energy strategy. In fact, the United \n     States Geological Service estimates that even if oil were \n     found in the coastal plain, production would never meet more \n     than two percent of our nation's oil needs at any given time. \n     This supply would hardly justify the production facilities \n     and related infrastructure that would destroy the unique \n     character of the coastal plain.\n       Your support in opposing efforts to promote oil development \n     and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \n     critical. Thank you for your attention to these concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Tom Kiernan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Public Interest Research Group, National Association \n           of State PIRGs,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: The United States Public Interest Research \n     Group (U.S. PIRG) urges you to support an amendment to the \n     Budget Bill to protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. \n     Senator Roth, the sponsor of the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge wilderness bill, will offer an amendment today to \n     strip language from the Senate Budget bill that would allow \n     leasing and drilling on the coastal plain of the Arctic \n     Refuge.\n       The coastal plain is one of the last unspoiled areas left \n     in the United States. Caribou, muskoxen, wolves, polar, black \n     and brown bears, and thousands of migratory birds rely on the \n     pristine habitat the Refuge provides. The annual migration of \n     the 129,000 member Porcupine river caribou herd evokes images \n     of the long-gone buffalo herds of the Great Plains. Most \n     states, and a number of nations in South America, throughout \n     the Pacific Rim and beyond are visited each year by birds \n     from the Arctic coastal plain.\n       The Arctic Refuge is also home to the Gwich'in, the people \n     of the caribou. The Gwich'in have lived in and around the \n     Refuge for thousands of years. To them the coastal plain is \n     sacred. Oil drilling will damage the coastal plain's \n     environment and therefore jeopardize one of the last native \n     subsistence cultures in North America.\n       Allowing oil drilling and development in the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge would destroy the wilderness, yet \n     would do virtually nothing to ease our energy problems or \n     lower gas prices. A national energy policy that emphasizes \n     energy efficiency, increases auto fuel efficiency standards, \n     and promotes renewable energy would save more oil than \n     thought to be in the coastal plain, preserve sensitive areas \n     like the Arctic Refuge, and reduce pollution.\n       U.S. PIRG urges you to support the Roth Arctic amendment to \n     the Budget bill and to Save America's Arctic.\n                                                     Athan Manuel,\n     Director, Arctic Wilderness Campaign.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Friends of the Earth,\n\n\n                                        1025 Vermont Ave., NW,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the thousands of members of \n     Friends of the Earth, we urge you to support efforts by \n     Senator Roth (R-DE) to protect the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge (ANWR) from being opened for oil exploration. \n     Currently, the FY 2001 Budget Resolution (S. Con. Res. 101) \n     includes language that assumes receipts from the sale of oil \n     leases in ANWR. Seismic exploration and oil drilling in a \n     national refuge is an unacceptable short-term approach to the \n     problems associated with the current oil crisis, and one \n     which would have long-term devastating consequences.\n       ANWR encompasses 19 million acres of pristine wilderness. \n     Created by President Dwight Eisenhower in 1960, ANWR is \n     sanctuary for nearly 200 species of wildlife including polar \n     bears, grizzlies, wolves, caribou and millions of birds. The \n     area under consideration for oil exploration--a 1.5 million-\n     acre coastal plain--is referred to by many scientists as the \n     ``biological heart'' of the Arctic Refuge and represents the \n     last five percent of Alaska's Arctic slope not already open \n     to drilling. Though some maintain that modern technology \n     allows clean exploration, many scientists have noted that \n     today's seismic oil exploration, consisting of large crews \n     with bulldozers, ``thumper'' trucks, fuel supply vehicles and \n     a variety of other tracked vehicles, is even more damaging to \n     the landscape than it has been in the past.\n       Drilling in ANWR would do little to reduce U.S. dependency \n     on foreign oil. In fact, the U.S. Geological Survey has found \n     that ANWR would provide us with less than six months worth of \n     oil. A more responsible solution to the problem is to develop \n     and promote sustainable forms of clean energy.\n       We should not sell off this priceless wildlife refuge for a \n     short-term energy fix. Support Senator Roth in his efforts to \n     defend the one of the few remaining natural treasures in the \n     United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Courtney Curf,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  The Izaak Walton\n\n\n                                            League of America,\n\n                                                    April 4, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: At the IWLA convention in 19u8, IWLA members \n     from all over the United States passed a resolution in favor \n     of Wilderness protection for the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge. In June of 1978, I visited Anchorage, Valdez and \n     Prudhoe Bay with seven IWLA board members, as guests of \n     Arctic Power and the State of Alaska--who wanted us to change \n     our policy.\n       After a grueling four-day schedule, during which our \n     members interviewed hundreds of Alaskans, we sat together \n     quietly together and unanimously agreed that our policy \n     should remain unchanged. Our decision was reaffirmed by our \n     1998 convention. While we did not presume to know what the \n     future might bring, and did not go so far as to say that the \n     Refuge should never be opened to oil development, we were \n     certain that it should not be developed today.\n       Any oil from the Refuge will have an imperceptible impact \n     on our nation's dependence on foreign oil. Almost any \n     adjustment in CAFE standards would do more. As time passes \n     and technology improves, more oil can be recovered at \n     significantly less impact to the environment if it is indeed \n     needed for national security.\n       The 45,000 members of the Izaak Walton League of America \n     support full Wilderness protection for the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge and oppose any oil development in the Refuge \n     at this time.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Paul W. Hansen,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  Sierra Club,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 2000.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: Oil prices are arising because OPEC--the \n     cartel of oil exporting countries--is manipulating the market \n     to drive up petroleum prices. Many in Congress are seeking \n     legislative redress for Americans who face higher prices at \n     the pump. But some in Congress are using the oil price hike \n     to renew their call to open the coastal plain of the Arctic \n     National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas development. \n     Consumers are seeking answers, but drilling the Arctic Refuge \n     is not the solution.\n       America cannot drill its way to energy independence. We \n     import more than half of our oil, 56% at present, and the \n     United States contains less than 3% of the world's known oil \n     reserves. Any way you look at it, increased domestic \n     production does not add up to energy independence. Though \n     some say the answer to our nation's energy needs lie below \n     the surface of the coastal plain, the Sierra Club believes \n     that this spectacular landscape should not be sacrificed.\n       No one knows how much, if any, oil lies beneath the coastal \n     plain. In 1998, the United States Geological Service (USGS) \n     published a determination of the mean estimate of \n     economically recoverable oil as 3.2 billion barrels of oil. \n     That's less than a six-month supply at current consumption \n     rates and even at peak production, arctic oil would represent \n     only 2% of total U.S. daily demand.\n\n[[Page S2211]]\n\n       95% of Alaska's vast North Slope is already available for \n     oil and gas exploration and leasing. The coastal plain of the \n     Arctic Refuge represents the last 5% that remains off-limits \n     to drilling.\n       The coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \n     America's serengeti. Nestled between the towering mountains \n     of the Brooks Range and the Beaufort Sea in northeast Alaska, \n     the narrow 1.5 million acre coastal plain in the biological \n     heart of this untamed wilderness. It is home to unique and \n     abundant wildlife: wolves, polar bear, musk ox and wolverine. \n     A myriad of bird species rely on the coastal plain for \n     breeding, nesting and migratory stopovers on trips as far \n     away as the Baja peninsula, the Chesapeake Bay, and even \n     Antarctica. The coastal plain is also the calving grounds for \n     the 129,000 member Porcupine River Caribou herd, which \n     migrates over 400 miles each year to this same place to give \n     birth to their young. It is a migration reminiscent of the \n     buffalo that once roamed the great plains.\n       It doesn't matter how much or how little oil may lie \n     underneath the coastal plain. Drilling the Arctic Refuge \n     would be as shortsighted as damming the Grand Canyon or \n     tapping Old Faithful. More drilling isn't the answer--\n     reducing our dependency on oil is the solution. America needs \n     a long-term energy strategy that is based on conservation and \n     renewables, alternative energy sources, and raising the \n     Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for automobiles and \n     light trucks. Such a long-term strategy will help America \n     ultimately decrease its dependency on oil and allow us to \n     protect our national treasures like the Arctic Refuge for \n     future generations.\n       We urge you to oppose legislative attempts to open the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic Refuge to oil and gas \n     development. The Sierra Club opposes S. 2214, Senator Frank \n     Murkowski's development bill, and will strenuously oppose \n     attempts to insert arctic drilling revenue assumptions in the \n     Budget Resolution.\n       Instead, we urge you to support a bill, S. 867, authored by \n     Senator William Roth of Delaware and cosponsored by 24 other \n     Senators, that would grant permanent protection to the \n     coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. OPEC's \n     manipulation of oil prices is no excuse to drill in our last \n     great wilderness. Thank you for your consideration of this \n     very important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Carl Pope,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I also have a letter written by the Ambassador from \nCanada saying that it is very important we support Senator Roth's \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 Canadian Embassy,\n\n\n                                         Ambassador du Canada,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2000.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer, I am writing to express Canada's \n     concern with the proposal in the budget under consideration \n     by the Senate to seek revenues from prospective lease sales \n     in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Any decision to \n     proceed with oil and gas development in the Arctic Refuge \n     will have serious implications for Canada.\n       Canada joins with many Americans in the belief that opening \n     up the Arctic Refuge to hydrocarbon development will cause \n     major disruptions in the sensitive calving grounds and will \n     affect migratory patterns of the Porcupine Caribou Herd on \n     which thousands of Canadian and American native peoples \n     depend.\n       In signing the 1987 Canada-United States Agreement on the \n     Conservation of the Porcupine Caribou Herd, both governments \n     recognized the transboundary nature of these wildlife \n     resources and our joint responsibility for protecting them.\n       In 1984, Canada gave permanent wilderness protection to its \n     portion of the caribou calving grounds by creating the \n     Ivvavik National Park. The critical calving grounds in the \n     United States, however, do not have formal protection and \n     remain vulnerable to development, as evidenced by the recent \n     budgetary proposal.\n       Canada has consistently stated that the best way to ensure \n     the future of the shared wildlife populations of the Arctic \n     Coastal Plain is to designate the ``1002 Lands'' as \n     wilderness, thereby providing permanent, equal protection on \n     both sides of the border to these irreplaceable living \n     resources.\n       I very much appreciate your support for wilderness \n     protection for all of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. I \n     hope that you find Canadian views helpful in your \n     deliberations with your colleagues on this matter.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                                 Raymond Chretien,\n                                                       Ambassador.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. They say we need to do this in order to uphold our \nagreement with Canada to protect the Porcupine caribou herd which \ndepends upon the refuge for its survival.\n  In closing, I am very pleased to join with Senator Roth. I thank my \nranking member, Senator Lautenberg, for being so supportive of this \namendment when I offered it in the committee. We delivered every single \nDemocrat for the environment. I was proud of that. I was very pleased \nwe had an additional vote in the committee from the Republican side, \nSenator Snowe. I thank her from the bottom of my heart.\n  Again, this is a bipartisan issue. It dates back to the Eisenhower \nadministration. Let us stand together across party lines. Let us get \nrid of this $1.2 billion revenue. It is wrong to put it in there \nbecause it is wrong to drill in this refuge. It is wrong to put it in \nthere because it, frankly, isn't going to happen.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield on your time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I note that the picture my friend from California \nidentified--and that is an extraordinary picture of the Brooks Range, \nas she may not know--is nowhere near the Coastal Plain, the 1002 area \nabout which we are talking. It is probably somewhere between 80 and 100 \nmiles away. That is the wilderness we are committed to support and does \nnot represent at all the Coastal Plain which is the issue before us.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We were given it from people in your State supporting it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is a beautiful picture of Brooks Range, but it is \nnot the 1002 area.\n  Mrs. BOXER. They sent it directly from your State.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wouldn't want the Senate to be misled.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It comes from your people from your State. If they were \nmisleading, I am surprised about that.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the budget resolution assumes revenues \nfrom leasing the lands in the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge for oil drilling.\n  I, too, support the efforts of the senior Senator from Delaware to \nensure that drilling in the Arctic Refuge is not used as a revenue \nassumption. I have also long been a cosponsor of his bill to designate \nthe Coastal Plain of the Arctic Refuge as a wilderness area.\n  Not only do I support this amendment along with many Members of this \nbody, but also I support this amendment along with Members of the other \nbody who have worked so hard on this issue. I particularly recognize \nthe efforts of my colleague in the other body, Mr. Vento, who so long \nand so well has led the fight to designate the refuge as wilderness.\n  I am concerned this assumption obligates Congress to decide whether \nor not to drill on the Coastal Plain refuge before we decide whether or \nnot it should be designated as wilderness. Drilling on the Coastal \nPlain allows an activity that is generally considered to be \nincompatible with designated wilderness areas.\n  In addition, I am concerned about the potential impact drilling would \nhave upon the existing wilderness, the area that was just being \ndiscussed, existing wilderness in the Arctic Refuge. Eight million \nacres south of the Coastal Plain are already designated as wilderness. \nI want my colleagues to be aware the drilling question does not only \nimpact our ability to make future wilderness designations in the refuge \nbut also may impact areas that we have already protected in the public \ntrust.\n  I suggest even if the previous portrayal by the Senator from \nCalifornia was of an area that is already protected, that is part of \nthe point. Drilling in this area could have an impact on the already-\nprotected area. I want to speak to my colleagues who may be considering \nallowing drilling in the refuge in light of current high oil prices. \nSupporters of drilling argue that the Arctic Refuge has the potential \nof yielding 16 billion barrels of oil. That figure, I am afraid, \nrepresents the outside limit of probabilities for an assessment area \nthat includes the Arctic Refuge, Coastal Plain, plus adjacent areas \nwhere exploration has already taken place. When you look at just the \nCoastal Plain, the correct low-probability estimate of oil is 11.8 \nbillion barrels of undiscovered oil; 25 percent less than the 16-\nbillion-barrel figure. Moreover,\n\n[[Page S2212]]\n\nUSGS assigns a probability of 5 percent, or 1 chance in 20, to the \npossibility that a field of that magnitude will be discovered. The mean \nestimate for technically recoverable oil is considerably lower, and the \nfigure for oil that is economically recoverable is lower still. In \nfact, USGS concluded that the refuge is capable of producing, \naltogether, approximately 3.2 billion barrels of oil. That is only one-\nfifth the amount of oil we have heard might be available.\n\n  If including this assumption in the budget resolution may impair our \nability to make a decision about the wilderness qualities of the refuge \nin the future, and if the refuge does not contain as much oil as we \nthought, why are we considering drilling? Consider this: Oil companies \nwith an interest in drilling in the refuge poured millions of dollars \nof soft money into the coffers of the political parties in 1999; \nmillions of dollars in just 1 year, and it was an off-year election at \nthat. I would like to briefly call the bankroll on just a few of the \noil companies that would profit from opening the refuge to drilling so \nmy colleagues and the public can have a fuller picture of what is at \nstake.\n  Last year, giant political donor Atlantic Richfield, its executives \nand subsidiaries, gave more than $880,000 in soft money to the parties. \nThe recently merged Exxon-Mobil, its executives and subsidiaries, gave \nmore than $340,000 in soft money in 1999. And in 1999, BP Amoco, the \nresult of another oil megamerger, gave over $361,000 in soft money, \nalong with its executives and subsidiaries.\n  This is quite an influx of cash. In a day and age where wealthy \ninterests drop $100,000 checks to the parties on a regular basis, the \nhuge donations of the oil and gas industry are still remarkable. As we \nexamine this issue closely, I think we have to keep the industry's \ndonations and the resulting political clout in mind as we debate this \nlegislation.\n  As I have said, the facts do not point toward drilling in the refuge. \nThe refuge does not contain as much oil as we thought. What is more, \nincluding this in the budget resolution may cause problems down the \nroad as we decide about the wilderness qualities of the refuge in the \nfuture.\n  For these reasons, I support the amendment proposed by the Senator \nfrom Delaware. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Roth \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me for 1 minute?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, I just got a call from the \nAlaska Wilderness League. I want to tell Senator Murkowski what they \nsaid. They said that photograph was taken by a biologist from the \nAlaska Fish and Game Department, and it is from the 1002 area in the \nCoastal Plain. So that biologist was contacted. I just wanted to \ncorrect the Record. If Senator Murkowski wants to call that biologist, \nI will get his name, but it is, in fact, a photo----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would appreciate it if the Senator will get his name \nso we can contact him.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Adam Kolton is the individual who just talked to the \nbiologist. I will get the phone number.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. He is a photographer for the Alaska Wilderness----\n  Mrs. BOXER. No, he got the picture I showed from the area you \ndisputed from a biologist from the Alaska Fish and Game, and he can \nprovide you the name of that individual.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The photograph was provided by whom?\n  Mrs. BOXER. A biologist from the Alaska Fish and Game Department.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. They gave it to you?\n  Mrs. BOXER. They gave it to your people in Alaska, the Alaska \nWilderness League.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Thank you.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee. I \ncongratulate Senator Roth for this amendment because this is not an \neasy one for him to do. The fact of the matter is, there is an \nassumption that there would be $1.2 billion in revenues resulting from \nthis. But the question is, What is the appropriate thing to do? Again, \nSenator Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, knows only too well \nhow difficult it is to raise revenues, but I wanted to make sure we do \nthe right thing.\n  So I am pleased to support Senator Roth's amendment. It expresses \nvery clearly the sense of the Senate that these provisions, those that \nallow drilling in the ANWR, are not to be included in this resolution.\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the second largest wildlife \nrefuge in the United States. It takes in a lot of territory, 19 million \nacres of mountains, forests, wetlands, wild rivers, tundra. It is home \nto a spectacular variety of plants and animals--caribou and polar \nbears, grizzly bears, wolves, quantities of migratory birds, the things \nthat everyone of us would like our children and grandchildren to be \nable to see, to be able to believe that the animals that were here when \ntheir father or grandfathers or great grandfathers came on this Earth--\nthat they will be able to see them as well; not just in picture books, \nbut in real life--grizzly bears and polar bears, wonderful things.\n  A legacy is more important, frankly, than some of the money we are \ntalking about to fund programs. The most important legacy we can leave \nour children and our grandchildren is a natural condition that enables \nthem to see the animals, see the forests, go fishing in the streams, \ndrink the water. That is the issue. The presence of these migratory \nbirds, and grizzly bears, so many other species, in a nearly \nundisturbed state, have led some to call the area America's Serengeti.\n  I have been to the Serengeti and I have been to the ANWR. I flew up \nthere right after the Exxon Valdez ran aground. I was up there within 2 \ndays of the time the Exxon Valdez ran aground. I was chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Transportation, which had the Coast Guard as one of its \nresponsibilities. The Coast Guard airplane picked me up and flew me up \nthere immediately. I wanted to see what was happening.\n  I will never forget the sight of that oil sheen floating across \nPrince William Sound. By then, very good people in our Government, the \nForest Service and others, were up there picking up birds, seals--oil \ncovered, couldn't breathe--on these tiny little islands, put there by \nhelicopters. It looked like a dangerous assignment. But you could see \nthe reach of the oil just fingering out all across Prince William \nSound. It was a devastating thing to see.\n  I was an environmentalist before I came here and I still am. By \nenvironmentalist I don't mean I just contribute to the environmental \norganizations or anything like that. I genuinely love the environment. \nIt is the one thing that gives continuity through the ages that perhaps \nwe can protect.\n  The nearby Continental Shelf provides the coastal waters with a rich \nnutrient base, allowing the region high productivity which in turn \nsupports an unusually wide variety of marine mammal diversity--ANWR.\n  I flew across the ANWR in a single-engine airplane when I was up on \nmy visit to Prince William Sound because I wanted to see what the area \nwas like. What I saw were abandoned oil rigs in an area called Dead \nHorse, the Prudhoe Bay area.\n  I saw rusting derricks and abandoned junk lying there. It was a \npitiful blight on that beautiful expanse of nature.\n  I then flew over the ANWR, this snow desert. I saw signs of some \nanimals. It was a breathtaking sight. I then made a pledge to myself \nthat I would do whatever I could to protect this pristine area. I owed \nit to my children who may never get up there to see it, but they have a \nrelationship with that area that is inexplicable but nevertheless real.\n  I returned from the South Pole in January. I am not an adventurer, \nbut I am interested in what happens in our world. I went down there to \nsee what was happening with climate change and the National Science \nFoundation. I went there to see whether or not there were things we \ncould discover about our climate change and our environment about which \nwe could do something.\n\n[[Page S2213]]\n\n  Scientists are still trying to search out what it is that is causing \nthe ice melts in the South Pole that causes--I address myself to \nSenator Roth--a piece of the ice continent to break up, as they \ndescribed it, twice the size of the State of Delaware and before that a \npiece the size of the State of Rhode Island. The next thing we know, we \nare going to see a piece floating out there the size of Texas, and then \nwe will hear a squawk in here because that ice is melting rapidly. \nSeventy percent of the world's fresh water is stored in the South Pole.\n  I relate the North and South Poles to our existence, and that \nenvironmental paradise called ANWR is part of that.\n  Arctic ecosystems are delicately balanced and are some of the most \necologically sensitive ecosystems in the world. The harsh climate and \nshort growing season leave very little time for species that have been \nharmed to adequately recover. The system's short food chains make a \nloss of a portion of the chain even more significant. This delicate \nbalance can easily be disrupted by human intrusion.\n  Oil exploration threatens the ecosystems that surround it through \nnoise pollution, air pollution, on and offshore oil spills, and the \ndestruction of the natural habitat. We all remember the horror of the \nExxon Valdez spill--the images of the birds and seals and other animals \ncovered in oil, their life literally being choked out of them. We \nremember the wide eyes on our children's faces as they watched the \nnatural beauty of Alaska being destroyed. We saw it on television.\n  According to the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, many of the natural \nresources injured in that spill still show little, if any, sign of \nrecovery. The danger is real. The Exxon Valdez spill took place in \n1989. There was a lawsuit against Exxon. It was resolved in a damage \nsuit which awarded $5.3 billion. Of that, $300 million has been paid--\n$300 million in a $5.3 billion award. That was over 10 years ago.\n  What restitution was given to the fishermen and those who depend on \nthe area for their livelihood? What restitution was made to those \nspecies that were endangered, whether it was eagles, seals, ducks, you \nname it? Some of them suffocated because of the film of oil that \ncovered their natural structure.\n  Here we are. That is what happens when the environment is damaged.\n  We are all aware of the problems this country is facing from higher \noil prices, and our people should not have to pay for profiteering by \nOPEC, especially those people in the modest income category who depend \non oil to heat their homes.\n  Prices at the pump have risen dramatically in the last year. My own \nState of New Jersey was hit hard by extremely high prices for home \nheating oil during a surprisingly cold winter, as it was throughout the \nNortheast. The occupant of the Chair who is from the State of Rhode \nIsland knows about what we are talking.\n  We should use this wake-up call to increase our efforts in \nconservation. I have not heard two words about conservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from the \nresolution.\n  We have to talk about energy conservation. We have to work at it, and \nwe need the cooperation of everybody--citizens, automobile \nmanufacturers, all of us. We need to be energy efficient and explore \nthe use of alternative sources of energy, instead of just falling to: \nWell, let's drill in the ANWR.\n  We should also strongly encourage our friends in OPEC, as President \nClinton has, to significantly increase production. I will tell my \ncolleagues straight out, I believe they owe it to us. Although I think \nthe increase that was just enacted should have been larger, I was \nslightly encouraged by OPEC's decision to increase production which \nwill help to stabilize our prices.\n  It is essential we continue our efforts on this front, and I look \nforward to another OPEC production increase at their June meeting. We \nhave to remind the oil-producing nations in the Middle East that when \nthey dialed 911, we answered the phone with over 400,000 of our young \npeople put on their soil to defend Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and the \nsurrounding area. We placed our young people in harm's way to protect \nwhat was interpreted to be a global interest.\n  We sent our young people far from home, into danger, causing a lot of \ndisruption in their lives. We are still not sure of the consequences of \nexposure to a polluted environment. Our citizens are suffering, and it \nis time for them to return the favor. Friendship is a two-way street. \nWe have to ask for favors as easily as we dole them out.\n  I am pleased to tell the American people that some relief is in \nsight. I look forward to more positive news in June. What we cannot do \nis use this situation as an excuse to endanger even more of our \ndwindling natural resources.\n  I speak as the ranking member of the Budget Committee. While I \ndisagreed with the outcome of the budget resolution, the fact of the \nmatter is, we worked diligently to fashion a budget resolution on which \nwe could agree.\n  One of the things that passed with a majority vote was to gain $1.2 \nbillion in revenues from drilling in ANWR. Senator Boxer, so eloquent \nin her response, reminds us that even in the Budget Committee there was \ndoubtful about whether or not this source of revenue ought to be \nallowed. It was an 11-11 tie. It took a bipartisan effort, even though \nthere was only one Republican. It is significant that this Republican \nSenator was voting with the Democrats because that is almost a no-no, \nas we say, but it happened.\n  Senator Roth is making an earnest appeal to save a wildlife preserve, \nnature's bounty, for all of us. It is not simply an Alaskan problem, it \nis a national problem. It is a global problem, and we must not allow \nthat drilling to take place.\n  I commend the Senator from Delaware for his amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will support it. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask my colleague from Alaska to yield me up to 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield my friend from Oklahoma 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I want, one, to compliment my \ncolleague from Alaska for his statement on this amendment.\n  I would like to make a couple comments in general about our energy \npolicies. There has been somewhat of an oil shortage, so there has been \nan increase in gasoline prices. A lot of Americans, a lot of our \nconstituents, have said: Well, what are you going to do about it?\n  Gasoline prices are going up. OPEC is strengthening their hand. The \nadministration has sent Secretary Richardson to go over and beg OPEC \ncountries to please increase their production.\n  Some of us on this side have complained about the administration not \nhaving an energy policy. I have tried to correct them. I think the \nadministration has an energy policy. I have looked at and reviewed the \nClinton-Gore administration's energy policy for the last 7 years. It is \nfairly consistent.\n  In 1993, they came up with a Btu tax. They were going to have a tax \nsurcharge on Btu's. In 1993 the Democrats controlled both the House and \nthe Senate, but that did not pass anyway. We defeated it.\n  They did pass a gasoline tax increase. As a matter of fact, Vice \nPresident Gore broke the tie. They increased gasoline taxes. You might \nthink that was for roads and highways and infrastructure. No. It was \nfor general revenues. So they could spend more money and it passed by \none vote, the Vice President's vote. In addition, the administration \nhas done nothing to increase domestic oil production. So our reliance \non imports has grown significantly. It has grown very dramatically.\n  They did sign the Kyoto accord. Though it is truly a treaty, they \nwill not call it a treaty and they have not sent it to the Senate for \nratification. One of the reasons is, in the Senate we had a vote of 95-\n5 that said we would not ratify a treaty that was particularly punitive \nto this country and did not apply to many countries, ``little'' \ncountries like China, Mexico, and India. It is a very poorly thought \nout agreement that Vice President Gore is very proud of and that this \nadministration wants us to comply with, but they will not send it to us \nfor ratification. It\n\n[[Page S2214]]\n\nis the equivalent of increasing costs on all fuels, particularly oil-\nrelated fuels.\n  The administration, likewise, has had the policy of restricting \naccess to public lands as far as drilling. They want to expand the \nmoratorium on offshore drilling. That is the administration's position.\n  Vice President Gore, in a political speech in New Hampshire, said he \nwanted to ban offshore drilling. I guess that sells well in New \nHampshire. But that would mean our reliance on imported oil would grow \neven more.\n  They have a policy, but their policy has been a disaster. As a result \nof that policy we are much more dependent on foreign sources.\n  What has happened? I mentioned the administration and the Secretary \nrunning around begging OPEC countries to produce more oil.\n  Frankly, one of the biggest increases in oil production of any \ncountry worldwide is Iraq. What has the administration done with Iraqi \noil? We have had an embargo on Iraqi oil production since the war in \n1991 where we lost about 147 American lives, where we spent billions of \ndollars, where we had 550,000 troops in Iraq. We fought a war to get \nIraq out of Kuwait, to stop their aggression, and their efforts to take \nover not only Kuwait but probably to expand throughout the Persian Gulf \nregion. We stopped that.\n  We also wanted to stop their aggression in building weapons of mass \ndestruction. So we set up a compliance regime that said: We are going \nto have onsite inspectors to make sure Iraqis were not building nuclear \nweapons, chemical weapons, or biological weapons. We are going to \nenforce that. Those inspectors are going to make sure they are not \nbuilding those weapons so they could not continue to threaten their \nneighbors.\n\n  Saddam Hussein threatened to burn Israel with the use of chemical and \nbiological weapons.\n  We had arms control inspectors, and said: We are going to keep the \nstrangle hold on their exports, including oil, unless they allow an \narms control regime. We had arms control inspectors for years in Iraq.\n  What has this administration done? Year after year, the \nadministration allowed the Iraqis to produce more with less access for \ninspectors.\n  Today, Iraq can produce all the oil it wants, thanks to support from \nthe Clinton-Gore administration. And there are no arms control \ninspectors--none, zero--in Iraq today. None.\n  We have not had an arms control inspector in Iraq for over a year. \nKeep in mind that we have bombed them. This administration has bombed \nIraq time and time again. Yet, we have no arms control inspectors \nthere.\n  The real leverage, aside from bombing, was the fuel export valves. \nThe administration just said: Open up. As a matter of fact, they just \nsupported a resolution that said: We want to assist them in making \ntheir production facilities grow even more. So now they are producing \n700,000 barrels of oil and we are going to help them produce a lot \nmore, but we still do not have one arms control inspector in Iraq.\n  I think the administration's policy dealing with energy, dealing with \nIraq, has been a disaster.\n  What can we do? One of the things the administration is supposed to \nbe doing is opening up ANWR.\n  I saw this beautiful picture shown by my colleague from California of \nthis pristine area of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. I do not \ndoubt that it is absolutely gorgeous. I have been there where they are \ngoing to drill, hopefully, eventually, in the ANWR area, and it is not \nthat picture, unless it has changed dramatically--and I do not see how \nit could in the area I saw. Don't get me wrong, I think Alaska is one \nof the most beautiful States anywhere in the country. It is one of the \nmost beautiful places anywhere in the world. It is beautiful, gorgeous. \nBut Alaska is a great, big State.\n  ANWR covers a lot of land. ANWR, is approximately 19 million acres, \nabout the size of South Carolina, a little less than about half the \nsize of my State of Oklahoma. That is ANWR, the Alaska National \nWildlife Refuge. That is a big area: 19 million acres. That is a lot of \nland. That is a big refuge. I am sure it has some beautiful areas in \nit.\n  Where they are proposing to drill comprises about 2,000 acres; and \nthat area is not at all like the picture just shown. While most of \nAlaska is gorgeous, this area is not the most prestine.\n  Drilling can be accommodated there without hurting the environment. \nThere are people who say: Wait a minute. Drilling in Prudoe Bay, that \nhas been disastrous for the environment. Drilling in Endicott Field, \nwhich is not too far away from there, has been disastrous for the \nenvironment.\n  I disagree. That is not the case.\n  They say: Drilling in that area would be bad for the caribou. That is \nnot factually borne out. The caribou around the Alaska oil pipeline has \nbeen a very big plus. The only place we really have not seen a lot of \ncaribou is in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge; they are all over by \nthe Alaska oil pipeline. There are a lot of caribou.\n  I am all for the caribou. I am strongly in favor of wildlife \ndevelopment. We have more visitors in the Oklahoma Wildlife Refuge than \nany other wildlife refuge in the country. We are proud of it. It is a \nbeautiful area and a treasure in our state. I want to encourage that. I \nwant to encourage it in Alaska. But you can do this in a sound, \nenvironmental way, and also reduce our dependence on foreign oil \nsources. We can do this and increase production domestically so we will \nnot be so dependent, so our Energy Secretary will not have to have to \nhold a tin cup saying: Please give us more.\n\n  We can do so much more. We can do so much better. We can do it in an \nenvironmentally sensitive manner. We can do it in a way that is \ncompatible with the caribou, compatible with wildlife, compatible with \nall the beautiful scenery that we have in Alaska, and not do any damage \nwhatsoever to the environment.\n  We can have a more sensible, sane energy policy where we are not just \nspending billions and billions of dollars overseas. Our dependence on \nforeign sources has grown so dramatically that we are a lot more \nvulnerable than anyone realizes.\n  We had shortages in 1973 and 1979. We were importing something like \n36 percent in 1973. Today we are importing 56 percent. That number is \ngrowing every year. We will be at two-thirds probably in another 10 or \n15 years.\n  We had shortages in 1973 when we imported 36 percent. Today we are \nimporting 56 percent.\n  In 1979, we had a shortage, and the shortage was significant. That \nmeant we had brownouts. That meant factories had to close. That meant \nthere were gas lines galore. People were lined up. Their biggest \nproblem was getting through gas lines in their cars so they could get \nto work, if their factories were opened because there was an energy \nshortage.\n  We do not want to replay that. We do not want to become that \ndependent. Yet we are marching on a dependency line that is \nunbelievable. We can do things to prevent it.\n  One of things we could do is supplement Alaska production, which has \nbeen declining dramatically. I am sure every person who has been \nspeaking about how bad it would be to drill in ANWR would also be \nopposed to Prudhoe Bay.\n  Prudhoe Bay was at one time producing 2 million barrels of oil at its \npeak. Today, it is declining. Now it is down to about 1.2 million \nbarrels of oil a day and continues to decline. We need to supplement \nthat or else we will have an even greater dependency. As Alaska \npipeline Prudhoe Bay production continues to decline, our dependency \nwill only rise.\n  We can open up ANWR to help prevent this. I urge my colleagues to \nthink about the future. It is going to take years to get this on line, \nto alleviate some of the shortages and curtailments and dependency we \nwill have 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 15 years from now. If we \nstay on this present course, we will be importing 60 percent or 70 \npercent of our oil needs and be very dependent, frankly, in some cases \non unreliable, unstable sources such as Iraq, such as Iran, some of the \nother Middle East countries that may get mad at us for whatever reason.\n  Again, I compliment my colleague from Alaska. I urge our colleagues \nto vote no on the underlying amendment, the Roth amendment, tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ENZI). The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S2215]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to the majority whip, we have others waiting to offer \namendments. Have you completed your time on this amendment? I ask the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask how much time remains on the \nother side as controlled by Senator Roth?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes under the control of Senator \nRoth.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And I believe there is an unlimited time, for all \npractical purposes, on the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining on the resolution is 10 \nhours 58 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The division of that time, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all under the control of the minority.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And the remaining time on this side relative to the \nRoth amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think that may clarify the time. I am sorry, but I \ndid not hear the question posed by the minority whip.\n  Mr. ROTH. I say to my friend from Alaska, the majority whip put in a \nquorum call. I was just saying that if you have completed your \ndiscussion on this amendment offered by Senator Roth, then we would go \nahead and offer another amendment. The majority leader has told us to \nstay around until we are down to about 8\\1/2\\ hours. So that is going \nto be another couple of hours.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I don't intend to yield back. Mr. President, I have \nnot addressed this matter yet. I yielded to my colleagues on the other \nside, so I am prepared to talk at some length. But out of courtesy, if \nthey want to proceed, I will wait.\n  Mr. ROTH. We are anxious to hear the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is always amusing to me to learn the \nfacts about my State, things I didn't know. I was 6 or 7 years old when \nmy family moved to Alaska, and I have lived extensively throughout the \nState and believe I have some knowledge of facts and some knowledge of \nfiction.\n  I again refer to the picture my good friend from California \nportrayed. Those mountains are the Brooks Range. As this will show you \nclearly, the Brooks Range is an area we are committed to protect. As a \nmatter of fact, it is the wilderness. The wilderness is not in \njeopardy, in spite of what we have been led to believe by most of the \nspeakers who have never been to Alaska in spite of the invitations \nextended over the years.\n  There are 19 million acres, as my friend from Oklahoma accurately \npointed out. What we have done with this, the vision of Congress, was \nto establish both a wilderness and a refuge. The wilderness is \napproximately 8 million acres. The refuge is 9.5 million acres, leaving \nthis 1002 area, the Coastal Plain area, which has been referred to as \nthe Serengeti of North America.\n\n  Let me tell you what is in it because no one has attempted to \ndescribe that. I find that extraordinary. It is treeless. It has no \nmountain. I think the hills are 1,100, 1,200 elevation. But those are \nfound 20 to 30 miles from this coast. In this area, there are 92,000 \nacres of private native land. In the area of Kaktovik, Kaktovik is a \nnative village. It has 223 residents and their attendant housing, their \nschools, their stores, their boats, their airstrips, their power lines, \na variety of other modern-day facilities. The military's Barter Island \nDEW Line radar station is also nearby. It is hardly accurate to portray \nthis unique area as the Serengeti of North America. It is unique, there \nis no question about it.\n  Now there have been many statements, and unfortunately there is just \nnot enough time to respond to all of them. I think we should be \nsensitive to recognizing the reality that OPEC is watching this debate \ntonight. Saddam Hussein is watching this debate tonight. This debate \naddresses whether we are committed to reduce our dependence on imported \noil or increase it.\n  The administration, when it made its profound announcement that they \nhad been successful in convincing OPEC to increase its production by \n1.7 million barrels, really left out a few interesting facts. It wasn't \na net of 1.7 million barrels. It was actually a net of 500,000 barrels. \nWe know that because OPEC had been committed to a production level of \n23 million barrels a day in March 1999, but they had been cheating. \nThey had been producing 24.2 million barrels a day. So the acknowledged \ndifference between the announced 1.7 increase and the 1.2 cheating is \nonly a 500,000 increase. To suggest that is all going to the United \nStates is a fallacy. We get about 16 percent of it. As a matter of \nfact, the arithmetic suggests it is somewhere in the area of 121,000 \nbarrels of oil, which is the amount, interestingly enough, that is \nconsumed in the greater Washington metropolitan area every day. The \npercentage the United States would get out of that 500,000 barrels is \nsomewhere in the area of 78,000 barrels per day. So we don't even stand \nstill, if you consider our increasing demand. It is little or nothing \nin comparison to what our needs are.\n  Consider some of the facts associated with the lack of an energy \npolicy in this administration. You can't help but be overcome by the \nreality that we have learned little from history. We were 37-percent \ndependent in 1973.\n  We are 56-percent dependent on foreign oil. The administration \nacknowledges that we are going to be about 64-percent dependent on \nforeign oil by the year 2015 to 2020. What does that mean to the \ncoastline of California, New Jersey, or other areas where these tankers \nare going to come? The oil is going to come in, Mr. President. Well, it \nis estimated that that will mean about 30 giant--foreign, I might add--\nsupertankers, each loaded with about 500,000 barrels of crude oil, will \nhave to dock at U.S. ports every single day of the year. That is about \n10,000 ships--as I have indicated, most are foreign flag--unloading in \nour harbors each year. I think this indeed creates a substantial \nenvironmental risk because you are not going to have many of these \ncompanies having the deep pockets of Exxon.\n  You speak of environmental issues. Isn't it better to promote \ndevelopment domestically when we know the global environment is going \nto be protected than to encourage development from Iraq or the Russian \nArctic, where development is done without regard to the environment? \nThink about that, Mr. President. Think about the environmental \ncommunity's attitude. They don't care where the oil comes from, as long \nas it doesn't come from up here in Alaska. If it comes from the \nColombian rain forest, that is OK. If it comes from the dilapidated \ninfrastructure of Russia, where there are leaks all over, no \nenvironmental enforcement, that is OK with them. It can come from Iraq, \nand that is OK.\n  I find that very ironic. We lost 147 American lives over in Iraq in \n1991. We had nearly 300 wounded and 23 taken prisoner. The American \ntaxpayers paid $10 billion to keep Saddam Hussein fenced in; that is \nenforcing the no-fly zone. We have military people stationed over there \nto ensure that he doesn't break out and invade Kuwait or threaten \nIsrael. Yet our newest and fastest growing source of oil imports is \nIraq. It was 300,000 barrels last year; it is 700,000 barrels this \nyear.\n  I could go on and on, but clearly Saddam Hussein takes this revenue--\nand to suggest that he somehow uses it for the benefit of his people is \nobviously misleading. He uses it to keep the Republican Guard, which, \nin turn, keeps him in office--maybe keeps him alive, for all we know. \nDo you know what else he is doing, Mr. President? He is working with \nthe North Koreans to build missile technology. What kind of a threat is \nthat to Israel, or the United States, or the free world, for that \nmatter? We are rebuilding Iraq's cash-flow, which sustains their \neconomy.\n  I happen to believe charity begins at home when it comes to our \nenergy security. We have the technology. We can do it right. Let's look \na little bit at a map of Alaska. Before we do, I see I have a chart \nhere that reflects Iraq's oil exports to the United States. The exports \nwere virtually nothing in 1997, and now it is 700,000 barrels a day. \nWhat the administration did the other day regarding Iraq is, they had \nthe Department of Commerce lift the export ban on technology, which \nwill allow Saddam Hussein and Iraq to increase their production \ncapacity. So the answer of this administration to address our energy \nneeds is simply to import\n\n[[Page S2216]]\n\nmore oil. Don't worry about any domestic development, we will get our \noil from overseas.\n  There are a lot of politics in this issue, the issue of the 1002 Area \nof the Arctic Coastal Plain. The politics of America's extreme \nenvironmental community is evidence on this floor; it is evidence with \nthe pictures and with the dialog and with the Members. I wish to God \nthe environmental community would come to grips with reality and \nrecognize the dependence we have on imports and what it is doing to our \nnational energy security--come to grips with it and help us develop \ndomestic energy sources with their recommendations, with attention to \ntheir environmental concerns, and help us to do it right.\n  So we attempted to do it right in Alaska. The Congress has attempted \nto do it right. We have 56 million acres of wilderness in my State. As \nI have said, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is an area the size of \nthe State of South Carolina; it is 19 million acres. We have set aside, \nas I have indicated, 9 million acres in refuge, 8.5 million acres in a \nwilderness. But Congress, in its wisdom, left this area aside to \ndetermine its management status at a later time, with the belief that \nthe national energy security of the country might necessitate its \ndevelopment.\n\n  Let's look at some factual pictures of what is going on in the real \nAlaska. Here is the real Alaska. Clearly, this is not in the 1002 area \nbecause there is no exploration activity allowed there. But I defy you, \nMr. President, or any Member in this body, to look at this area and see \nany difference--you can see the ocean out here--but any difference with \nthe general area of the Coastal Plain in the wintertime. This is a \ntough area, with winter 8 months of the year.\n  We have heard a lot about pipelines and a lot about gravel roads. \nThis is the technology that is used in Alaska today. That is an ice \nroad there. It is built up with ice and snow, and sometimes water is \nadded. This is a drill pad. That is a factual picture of the technology \nused today. Let me show you what it looks like in the summertime on the \ntundra with that same well capped. That is it. That technology is \nutilized in Alaska today because it is the right thing to do. It is the \nenvironmentally compatible thing to do. You will not see that in any \nother oil field in the world. It is a long winter up there, Mr. \nPresident.\n  We have capabilities, obviously, to address some of the wildlife \nconcerns we have heard so much about tonight. Well, you have seen this \nbefore. This is a picture in Prudhoe Bay, but you would never know the \narea from the Coastal Plain, with the exception of the pipelines in \nPrudhoe Bay. Here are three bears going for a walk, walking on the \npipeline where it is warm. It sure beats walking on the snow. Nobody is \nshooting those bears; nobody is running them down.\n  We have a picture of some caribou. We have heard a lot about them \nfrom our experts who have never been to this area. This is in Prudhoe \nBay. This is an oil field, and this is 35-year-old technology. These \nare some live caribou. I can assure you that those are not stuffed, \nlike some of the conversation we have heard tonight. This is factual.\n  We have a herd of Caribou called the Porcupine herd and a legitimate \nconcern about that herd because the Gwich'in people are dependent on \nit. It is kind of interesting to look at the history of this because as \nyou look at Alaska, you also have to look at Canada because we abut. We \nhave an interesting issue here. The Canadians, about 20 years ago, were \nvery interested in drilling in the Mackenzie Delta, thought there was a \ngreat opportunity for oil and gas. So they drilled some 89 holes here \nin this area on the Mackenzie Delta, and they also built a highway \ncalled the Dempster Highway. The interesting thing is that this line on \nthe map represents the path of the Porcupine caribou herd. Not only has \nit maintained its general stability during the time these areas were \ndrilled extensively by the Canadians, but the caribou cross the \nhighway. Now, it is not the beltway--I grant you that--but it is a \nhighway that goes up into the Canadian Arctic. They wander into Alaska \nand go into the Yukon, where the Gwich'ins make a substantial take for \nsubsistence purposes.\n  It is significant that these animals are adaptable; if you don't \nshoot them or run them down with a snowmachine, they can flourish. Now \nwe have heard from the Senator from California, mentioning a letter \nfrom the Canadian Ambassador opposing development of the 1002 area. Yet \nthey thought it was OK to drill their area. Maybe they are in a little \ncompetition between Canada and the United States for energy. We buy a \nlot of energy from them--a lot of electrical energy--particularly in \nthe Northeast corridor. They are happy to do that; Alberta is happy to \nsell us gas. Maybe they don't want us to compete. I wonder if that \ncould be the motivation of the Canadian Ambassador.\n  As we look at our concern over the Porcupine caribou herd, it is \nlegitimate and the people associated in these areas are legitimately \nconcerned. But we have been able to protect the caribou in Prudhoe Bay \nwith 30-year-old technology. The herd has grown from 3,000 when \ndevelopment began to over 18,000 caribou. You can't take a gun in. You \ncan't shoot them.\n  It is the technology that we have going for us now that offers us \nsuch a tremendous opportunity to develop this resource. If we were back \nbefore this body some 30 years earlier, we would have heard the debate \non the appropriateness of opening up Prudhoe Bay. Prudhoe Bay was the \nlargest oil discovery in North America, and it still is. There was a \ngreat deal of debate over how to develop it, and what the impact would \nbe, because to get this oil out, we had to build an 800-mile pipeline \nacross the length of Alaska.\n  We have a chart for those of you who wonder where that might be. It \nruns from the Arctic Ocean clear down through Fairbanks on to Valdez, \nwhere the oil is then shipped down to the west coast where it is \nprimarily processed.\n  We had a terrible accident. The Senator from New Jersey was there. He \nknows that tanker ran aground in a 10\\1/2\\ mile wide channel with \nabsolutely no excuse. But the accident happened. But that wasn't the \nfault of the pipeline. That wasn't the fault of the oil field. It was a \nhuman error involving a supertanker, and it was inexcusable.\n  But the reality is we have been able to build this pipeline. It has \nwithstood earthquakes. It has been shot at. It has been dynamited. It \nis one of the wonders of the world.\n  But 35 years ago or so, when we were arguing about this issue, we had \nthe same arguments we have today. The doomsayers were saying: You are \ngoing to build a pipeline, a hot pipeline. It is going to take hot oil \nand pump it through a permafrost area; because that is what the Arctic \nis--permafrost, frozen ice and ground. That hot pipeline is going to \nmelt the ground. You are going to lose the foundation. Your pipeline is \ngoing to break.\n  It didn't happen.\n  They said this 800-mile pipeline is going to be a fence across your \nState, an 800-mile fence. Your moose, your caribou, your animals are \nnot going to be able to cross. It is going to be a calamity. It didn't \nhappen.\n  There is nearly 1,000 miles of Arctic coastline. It is all unique and \nvery much all similar. You look for oil. You find it where you are most \nlikely to find it. The geologists simply tell us that the 1002 Area of \nthe Coastal Plain is the area where we are most likely to make a major \ndiscovery; The USGS says 16 billion barrels.\n  Let me tell you something to factor in because we have heard so much \nrhetoric around here tonight.\n  For Prudhoe Bay, the recovery estimates were 9 billion to 10 billion \nbarrels. Prudhoe Bay has been producing some 23 years. We have produced \nover 12 billion barrels, and we are still producing. It is estimated \nthat we will probably produce for another decade, or maybe two, because \nthe technology is such that we can get greater recovery.\n  When you talk about estimates, you had better be realistic. If there \nis no oil up here, nothing is going to happen, except you might have a \nlease sale. You might get a substantial payment from the oil companies \nthat are prepared to bid on it. That is the risk they take.\n  We don't know what is up there. But the geologists say it is the most \nlikely area for a major discovery. That is why Congress, in its wisdom, \nset this area aside for Congress to address and resolve at a later \ntime. That is why we are here.\n\n[[Page S2217]]\n\n  The Budget Committee took action because we have a crisis in this \ncountry. If you do not believe it, ask the Secretary of Energy. He went \nover to the OPEC countries. He said: We have an emergency. You know \nwhat they said: We are having a meeting on March 27. He said: No. You \ndon't understand, its an emergency. We sent 35,000 troops over here. We \nfought a war to keep Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. We lost American \nlives. We need help now. We need more oil production in those \ncountries. You know what they told him: We are having a meeting on \nMarch 27. They stiffed him.\n\n  He went to Mexico. He told the Mexicans: We need more production. \nMexico said: Fine. But where were you when oil was $11, $12, and $13 a \nbarrel, and our economy was in the sack?\n  We have an emergency. If we don't take steps now to recognize our \nincreased dependence on imported oil, one wonders when we will. What is \ngoing to happen to the security of this Nation from the standpoint of \nenergy as we become more dependent on imports, more dependent on Iraq, \nand more dependent on OPEC?\n  Those are the realities we face today.\n  Let's take a look at something that is very unpleasant. I hate to \nshow you this. But this is a terrible picture that ran all over America \nwhen Saddam Hussein was defeated and when he set the oil fields of \nKuwait on fire.\n  You talk about environmental degradation. That is it. Here you see \nAmericans over there trying to put out the fires and stop the \nenvironmental damage. You can see the burning wells behind him. This is \nreality. This is the kind of individual and the type of country and \nleadership on which we are now depending for our energy security.\n  I find it outrageous and inexcusable. I am very critical of the \nenvironmental community that condones oil coming from a tyrant, one who \nleft an environmental scar of the magnitude that Saddam Hussein left in \nKuwait.\n  Let's look at a couple of others because they are all bad. The only \nproblem is that they get worse. How we can continue to be misled, if \nyou will, through complacency associated with our dependence on Iraq is \nbeyond me. Here we see the burning wells and the terrible mess that was \nleft. Look at the Americans working in those conditions.\n  This Senator is not going to stand by and support increased \ndependency on Iraq when we clearly have an administration whose only \npolicy is more imports. Give us more; give us more. It is like an \naddiction. It is pathetic.\n  You almost forget. And you can very easily forget that we are \ndependent on oil for transportation. Our truckers came to Washington, \nDC, and expressed themselves. They can't pass on the price. Look at \nyour airline tickets. You pay a surcharge now. The consumer--the mom \ntaking the kids down to the soccer game--is facing nearly $1.85 or $2 a \ngallon. It shoots a pretty big hole in a hundred dollar bill if she has \na sports utility vehicle, and many of those aren't paid for.\n  But go a little further. Our farmers are getting geared up for \nplanting season. What is the cost of that going to be relative to their \nproductivity? Can they pass it on?\n  It multiplies. What do the farmers use? They use fertilizer. What is \nfertilizer made of--urea. It comes from gas and oil. The multiplier is \nthere.\n  Look at our balance of payments. One-third of the $300 billion is the \ncost of imported oil.\n  Every time oil goes up $10, inflation goes up half of 1 percent. \nThere are a lot of uneasy people out there.\n  This single issue today is going to send a signal about whether we \nare serious about alleviating our dependence on imported oil and are \ngoing to do something about it.\n  I have heard statements that it will take a while. Yes, it will take \na while. President Clinton vetoed ANWR the last time it went down to \nthe White House. That was in 1995. We would know today if we had oil \nthere. We would be on our way to production.\n  One of the things that bothers me about the environmental community \nis they sell American technology and ingenuity short. We can do it \nbetter. We can make a smaller footprint, given the opportunity. And we \nhave that opportunity before the Senate today.\n  We have heard conversations about oil exports. There has been oil \nexported because there has been excess capacity on the west coast up \nuntil a short time ago. Those who don't recognize and understand oil, \nunfortunately, don't know that oil used to move through the Panama \npipeline, and prior to that in smaller ships through Panama, and to the \ngulf coast to be refined there. That changed when Venezuela came on \nproduction. So we had an excess on the west coast, a modest excess.\n  Now with the takeover of Arco by BP Amoco and the divestiture of the \nArco Alaska properties to Phillips, which has refineries, there will \nnot be a surplus. There will not be a surplus because BP will now have \nrefineries on the West Coast. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter from BP indicating they have no plans to export \noil, once the contracts for the current month expire.\n  As I understand, Phillips has no intention of exporting oil. That is \na bogus argument.\n  How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 17 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If the Senator from New Mexico desires some time, I \nwill yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee. From the first knowledge we \nhad that the OPEC cartel plus their friends had dramatically decreased \nproduction, thus having this terrible impact on American energy costs, \nSenator Murkowski has been trying every day, every time he could, to \ntell us we are doing things exactly the opposite of what we ought to be \ndoing for America's future. I compliment him. He has a lot of people \nwondering about what we are up to. Frankly, I would like to add a \nlittle bit to that.\n  While the United States grows more dependent upon foreign crude oil, \nwe have an administration that, from the first day they went in office \nuntil today, has been engaged in seeing to it that the United States \nproduces less oil--not more--from our own lands by overt, conscious \nacts of withdrawing real estate that we own as a nation on which to \nexplore for oil and gas, to a constant insistence that we cannot solve \nthe little, tiny problem of what do we do with nuclear waste, which \nevery country in the world except America has solved. They have solved \nit at least for 50 to 100 years.\n  We sit around acting as if we can continue to be dependent upon the \nvery limited sources of energy for this great country's future. I will \ngive a couple of facts about what has happened to the American energy \neconomy, the production of oil in America, by Americans for Americans. \nIn 1990, there were 405,000 jobs in America in the exploration and \nproduction of oil and gas. As of last year, there were 293,000, a 27-\npercent decline in people employed in the exploration and production of \noil and gas in America. When you reduce the number of people involved \nin oil and gas exploration by 27 percent, there has been something \nconsciously happening that says we will produce less in America.\n\n  Ten years ago, there were 657 rigs working on oil exploration in the \nUnited States. Everybody understands what that is. Now there are fewer \nthan 175. We did something wrong. Somebody would stand up from the \nadministration and say: The cartel had something to do with that; they \nlowered the price of oil. But we didn't have a policy that said to our \ncompanies, in spite of that, we will help you explore for more. As a \nmatter of fact, we had the opposite policy.\n  New refineries in the United States: It used to be, if you could have \nan oil refinery and attach to it all the refined products that go with \nit, you would be delighted. It would employ your people. They are high-\npaying jobs. Guess what. In the United States, while we grow dependent, \nhere we are with not a single new refinery built in the United States \nsince 1976. That means we have decided other countries ought to produce \nthe refined products we need and we ought to have such strict \nrequirements that it is impossible for Americans to build them with \nAmerican money and American workers to produce more refined products in \nour country--the opposite policy we ought to have.\n  If we had another time and another day, we could discuss why \nAmericans will not invest in oil refineries in the United States. I can \ntell you one of\n\n[[Page S2218]]\n\nthem, and I will use three initials for starters--the Environmental \nProtection Agency of the United States. Unreasonable restrictions, \ncosting billions of dollars, that any neutral party would say are \nunreasonable, we impose them. When they can pay for them, they do; when \nthey cannot pay any longer, they say: We will not refine anymore; we \nwill do it somewhere else.\n  There are Federal lands available for exploration. I suggest we have \ndone it exactly the wrong way since this President has been in office. \nWe have taken lands out of production because we have this kind of \nwhimsical idea, if they are public lands, we sure don't want to find an \noil rig out there. In fact, it is an attitude. We have to put up with \noil rigs, but we really don't want them, even though it is ``black'' \nmoney for American workers. It is oil for American cars. It is \nAmerica's investment. But it is like public domain. Man, we ought to \njust save that and forget about this dirty business of producing oil. \nThat is America's policy today.\n  I wish I could share with you, although I don't have the notes, how \nmany thousands and thousands of acres we have taken out of production, \nout of development, because of what I have been explaining for the last \n3 or 4 minutes.\n  That leads us to tonight. In the past, I have heard Senators on the \nfloor of the Senate talking about their States with great enthusiasm, \ngreat concern about what is happening to their States. I will tell you \nwhy Frank Murkowski and Senator Ted Stevens are concerned. If we were \nto produce oil in ANWR on one one-hundredth of 1 percent of the land, \n2,200 acres is what we would need to explore for oil in a modern way \nand produce it in ANWR.\n  That would produce 16 billion barrels of oil, produced by Americans, \nAmerican workers, American oil for Americans. What does that mean in \ndollars? It means one-half trillion. Think of that, I say to the \nSenator from Wyoming. In the State of Wyoming, we have oil locked up. \nIt is worth half a trillion for your workers, for your companies, for \nyour businesses, and we are locking it up for the reasons Senator \nMurkowski stated, that we wanted to lock up Prudhoe Bay.\n  We found none of the predictions about Prudhoe Bay were true, and \nnone of them will be true about this one either. But it is as if we are \nkind of economically arrogant. We are so powerful and so strong that we \ndo not have to worry about American oil for American people, produced \nby Americans, used for American cars. We just have to say this little \ntiny piece of property, just a strip of ANWR that you could go and \nexplore to find out if it is there and then insist they advise the \nCongress if there is any environmental damage--they will not let us do \nthat.\n  I submit we ought to vote on this. I also submit anyone who votes no \non this ought to be asked: What do you think America's future is? More \noil from the cartel or less?\n  With that, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Alaska. I thank \nhim.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield myself whatever time is \nremaining because I believe we will have some time tomorrow. Might I \nask how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will yield to the other side at this time, if they \ncare to continue the debate,\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I might have a parliamentary review \nfor just a moment, I heard the distinguished Senator from Alaska ask if \nthis debate could not be continued tomorrow. It is my understanding \nthat, once the time is used on both sides, the proponent's and \nopponent's, that time is exhausted and there will not be further \nopportunity to discuss this tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was true for the amendment of the Senator \nfrom West Virginia. But there have been no subsequent agreements.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We are talking now about the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from New Jersey yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There has been no agreement in regard to the \namendment of the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So, as it presently stands, the time once used \ntonight, unless agreed to by unanimous consent for an extension, will \nnot be available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no such agreement on this particular \namendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. There is no agreement. May I be precise? We are \ntalking about 2 hours that was available for the delivery of the \namendment, and an hour--and time for opposition, equally divided; is \nthat right? Two hours?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 hours on this amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Right. And the time used by the proponents and \nopponents as described by the Parliamentarian--there is some 7 or 10 \nminutes for each side? What is the present situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 8 minutes, the \nSenator from Delaware has 11 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So once those 19 minutes are consumed, this \ndiscussion is over and cannot be brought tomorrow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If they are consumed tonight, that is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I just wanted to let the Senator know.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask the President, if they are not consumed tonight, \nwhat is the disposition of the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. For them not to be consumed tonight would take \nunanimous consent.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Unanimous consent to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Have them over until tomorrow.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is there any reason why it would not be consumed \ntonight?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I indicated my interest in reserving \nthe remainder of my time until tomorrow. I would propose that at this \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Therefore, it is the ruling of the Chair, as I \nunderstand it, the time in opposition to the Roth amendment must be \nfully utilized tonight or given up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We have a little more time, I believe. I defer to the \nother side prior to taking up more of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If I may, I ask the Senator from Delaware if I can \nhave 5 minutes of the time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I say to the distinguished Senator from Alaska, \nthere are only two ways I can think of that he could save his time: We \ncould close up shop right now, and we are not going to do that, so \nthere is an hour on each side. You could get consent, and you tried and \nhaven't gotten that. So anybody offering an amendment tonight has an \nhour on each side if they want to use it. If they want to yield it \nback, they can yield back. Any amendment to an amendment has a half-\nhour, and we go that way until we finish tonight.\n  I can tell you, I think you made as good an argument tonight as you \ncan make. I don't think there are many votes going to be changed. I \nalready complimented you immensely. I do it again.\n  There will be 2 minutes before the vote. They will be in your \ncontrol.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield. If the Senator from New Jersey has been \nrecognized, I will keep my remaining time and use it tonight.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have asked for 5 minutes from the Senator from \nDelaware, which has been yielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the \ndebate presented by my distinguished colleagues on the other side who \nare for drilling in ANWR: Don't worry about it. After all, look at what \nhappened in these other places. They are drilling foreign oil for \nconsumption by Americans. We have lost so many jobs in the oil fields.\n  I will tell you about those jobs in the oil fields. You tell me where \nthere is a shortage of jobs in this country, and I will tell you where \nthey can get employed immediately. Tell me where there are people \nlooking for work, I\n\n[[Page S2219]]\n\nwill tell you where they can get employed immediately.\n  The fact is, yes, we are importing more oil. We ought not to be. I am \nno different than anybody else when we talk about those who owe us a \nresponsibility to make sure we have the products that we helped save \nwhen we sent our young people to war in 1990 and 1991. We cannot \ndisagree about that. One is not less patriotic than the other. This is \nnot a question of loyalty. This is a question of how the world \nfunctions.\n  Right now, those of us in the environmental community say we ought to \nbe cautious about the use of our precious, pristine wildlife areas. I \nheard the Senator from Oklahoma say--I do not want to mimic what he \nsaid, but he did say: Well, that area that is reserved for drilling, \nsome 2,000 acres, is not so pretty anyway.\n  It was hard for me to believe my ears. What do you mean it is not so \npretty anyway? We have some areas in our country that are not so pretty \nthat attach to areas that are beautiful. It is the not-so-pretty areas \nthat help keep the pretty areas, and those that are essential for our \nexistence as a species, the human species, to function. So we cannot \ndismiss it like that.\n  With all of the best intentions of managing the way we transport our \noil and we explore for it, it is all subject to human frailties. If we \nhave had a pipeline that has worked well for lots of years, I salute \nit. But, remember this, in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez ran aground--and \nit was human error, there is no doubt about that but you cannot remove \nit. We lost a spaceship with our precious astronauts aboard because of \nsome human error. These things do not happen without human \nintervention. We cannot dismiss this and say: Don't worry about it; \neverything will be all right. We will take care of it.\n  I say that is not so.\n  I wish we could get all our Senators to do a flyover of the ANWR. I \nguarantee there would be a majority voting the other way, saying do not \ndrill there unless there is no other way in the world for us to \nsurvive.\n  We have other sources of oil, other sources of energy being \nconsidered and developed. There is work going on in Azerbaijan. You \nknow, when it is said we should only consume American oil to the extent \nwe need oil, I do not believe that is necessarily so.\n  I would rather save that reserve. Heaven forbid if we need it some \nday in the future. I would like to bring it in from other sources. \nThere are minerals in this country which we do not mine anymore because \nit is cheaper and better on the environment to import some of those \nminerals. That is the way things go.\n  We have become a profligate society in our use of energy. We have \nSUVs popping up everywhere. The automobile companies do not mind making \nthem. The workers of those automobile companies do not mind working \nthere. The guys who work in the gas stations--whether the oil comes \nfrom Saudi Arabia or from Oklahoma or Texas--do not mind their jobs. \nThey have businesses that are based on supplying that energy.\n  We are a society that is overblown with riches, and we are using \nwhatever energy we want. We consume fresh air with congestion. There \nare more cars out there than we know what to do with, but that does not \nstop us from using our cars.\n  We are saying, as long as we are profligate, just wasting it, let's \nget it; let's go up to the ANWR and drill in that pristine area \ndescribed in different fashions as beautiful or not so beautiful or the \nhome for some of the animals; they will survive anyway.\n  I say do not take the risk. I would rather see us practice \nconservation, which we have not done in this society of ours. I have \nnot heard anybody--I am talking about either from the administration \npresently in power or any of us--talk about conservation programs: Save \nit, don't just use it; save it if you are concerned about it. But no, \nlook at the traffic lines. Nobody wants to save oil.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I take 5 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for an additional 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as to this debate about whether or not \nit is American jobs, Americans, thank goodness, are working at jobs \nthat are productive and have given us the strongest economy ever seen \nin the history of mankind. We ought to reduce our dependence. I agree \nwith my friends on the other side, but that does not mean we have to go \nto a source that raises questions about our ability to preserve the \nenvironment.\n  I said it before, when I think of my children, one of the most \nimportant assets I see in this country is a good environment, good \nnatural resources. Even if they never get to visit Alaska, I have done \nit. I do not want to be a ``Johnny's been all over the place,'' but I \nwas also in Kuwait. I saw the situation the Senator from Alaska \ndescribed. I was in an airplane several thousand feet in the air. The \nwindshield was covered with soot from the burning oil fields. It was a \nterrible waste of lives and energy, but it happened.\n  What we have to do is make sure our allies, the people whom we worked \nto save, understand what we mean when we call on them to help us \nthrough a crisis. I could not agree more with my friends on that score. \nI believe we should have gotten much tougher than we did.\n  I had an occasion to speak to a diplomat from one of the Mideast \ncountries. I said: Do you know what you are doing? You may make a \nbetter profit right now, but you are alienating the American people, \nand you are not going to recover from that so easily. Do not depend on \nus when you issue an alarm--``help save our skins; help save us.'' Some \nof them went to other countries to enjoy themselves when we did the \nfighting. That is not going to happen easily again.\n\n  The Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and \nsome of the friends on the Republican side, including Senator Snowe, \nwho voted with Senator Boxer on protecting the ANWR--there was a \ncommentary in the Washington Post from someone who cannot be declared a \ncockeyed liberal or crazy environmentalist. I will read the quote \nbefore I identify who it is:\n\n       I totally agree that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \n     a truly unique pristine ecosystem, and I believe we should \n     not damage it. It should be set aside in wilderness \n     designation in perpetuity, Smith wrote to the New Hampshire \n     Citizens for Arctic Wilderness.\n\n  That is Senator Bob Smith, someone we know well, who is chairman of \nthe environment committee, and we are hearing from the chairman of the \nFinance Committee that we ought not do this. These are people who \ndeserve to be heard, and we know there are other people in the \nRepublican Party who agree with us. We are going to find out when we \nput this to a vote. The vote will come sometime tomorrow.\n  I hope we will close this debate at this point. While everything to \nbe said has been said, not everybody has said everything. I yield back \nany time I requested from the resolution which I did not use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record letters I have \nreceived from many organizations which are concerned about the \nenvironment and support my amendment. These include the Wilderness \nSociety, Republicans for Environmental Protection, the National Parks \nConservation Association, Friends of the Earth, the League of \nConservation Voters, and the National Resources Defense Council.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Friends of the Earth,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the thousands of members of \n     Friends of the Earth, we urge you to support efforts by \n     Senator Roth (R-DE) to protect the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge (ANWR) from being opened for oil exploration. \n     Currently, the FY 2001 Budget Resolution (S. Con. Res. 101) \n     includes language that assumes receipts from the sale of oil \n     leases in ANWR. Seismic exploration and oil drilling in a \n     national refuge is an unacceptable short-term approach to the \n     problems associated with the current oil crisis, and one \n     which would have long-term devastating consequences.\n       ANWR encompasses 19 million acres of pristine wilderness. \n     Created by President\n\n[[Page S2220]]\n\n     Dwight Eisenhower in 1960, ANWR is a sanctuary for nearly 200 \n     species of wildlife, including polar bears, grizzlies, \n     wolves, caribou and millions of birds. The area under \n     consideration for oil exploration--a 1.5 million-acre coastal \n     plain--is referred to by many scientists as the ``biological \n     heart'' of the Arctic Refuge and represents the last five \n     percent of Alaska's Arctic slope not already open to \n     drilling. Though some maintain that modern technology allows \n     clean exploration, many scientists have noted that today's \n     seismic oil exploration, consisting of large crews with \n     bulldozers, ``thumper'' trucks, fuel supply vehicles and a \n     variety of other tracked vehicles, is even more damaging to \n     the landscape than it has been in the past.\n       Drilling in ANWR would do little to reduce U.S. dependency \n     on foreign oil. In fact, the U.S. Geological Survey has found \n     that ANWR would provide us with less than six months worth of \n     oil. A more responsible solution to the problem is to develop \n     and promote sustainable forms of clean energy.\n       We should not sell off this priceless wildlife refuge for a \n     short-term energy fix. Support Senator Roth in his efforts to \n     defend the one of the few remaining natural treasures in the \n     United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Courtney Curf,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Natural Resources\n\n\n                                              Defense Council,\n\n                                      New York, NY, April 4, 2000.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing on behalf of the more than \n     400,000 Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) members from \n     across the country to respectfully urge you to oppose any \n     legislative provisions that would open up the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil exploration. As you know, the \n     FY 2001 Budget Resolution that the Senate Budget Committee \n     reported to floor includes damaging language that assumes \n     revenues from oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge.\n       Under the guise of combating high gas prices, some \n     legislators are pressing to open the Arctic Refuge's 1.5 \n     million-acre coastal plain to oil exploitation. The coastal \n     plain is often called ``America's Serengeti'' because of its \n     abundant caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolf and other \n     wildlife populations, and represents the last five-percent of \n     Alaska's Arctic Slope not already open to development. It \n     would be ill-advised to open up our nation's Arctic \n     wilderness for a questionable, short-term supply of oil.\n       We respectfully encourage you to oppose any bill or \n     resolution that would open up the last pristine wilderness in \n     the Arctic to oil and gas development, and urge you to \n     support Senator Roth's amendment to the 2001 Budget \n     Resolution to strike Arctic Refuge drilling revenues from the \n     federal budget.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John H. Adams,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  REP America,\n\n                                     Deerfield, IL, April 4, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n\n     Hon. J. Dennis Hastert,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives.\n       Dear Senator Lott and Speaker Hastert: This week, Congress \n     takes up the issue of whether potential oil revenue from the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge should be included in the \n     congressional budget. REP America, the national grassroots \n     organization of Republicans for Environmental Protection, \n     opposes this kind of sleight-of-hand accounting as well as \n     development in the Refuge.\n       A strong national bipartisan consensus exists for continued \n     protection of the ANWR. The estimates of finding commercially \n     valuable quantities of oil there are actually quite small. \n     But even if such quantities were found, the oil would not \n     appreciably increase our nation's known reserves or lower \n     gasoline prices. At present, over 90% of America's portion of \n     the Arctic is open to oil and gas exploration and \n     development. Further development within the Refuge is not \n     necessary for the security of our nation, and we should not \n     count unearned and unanticipated revenues stemming from oil \n     that might not exist.\n       Frankly, such budgetary maneuvers are very damaging to our \n     party. We Republicans take pride in our history protecting \n     public lands to Alaska and honor the legacy of past \n     Republican leaders. In 1907, when President Theodore \n     Roosevelt established the Tongass and Chugach National \n     Forests, he faced tremendous pressure from special interests \n     lined up to exploit public lands for short-term gain. \n     Presidents Eisenhower and Nixon used executive authority to \n     protect the Arctic Refuge, and as recently as 1990, many \n     Republicans listened to mainstream America and cosponsored \n     the Tongass Timber Reform Act. President George Bush did us \n     all a great service when he signed this important piece of \n     conservation legislation.\n       As Republicans, the members and directors of REP America \n     urge you and your colleagues to halt these kinds of budgetary \n     charades, if for no other reason than the fact that it is \n     absolutely destroying our party's image with respect to the \n     environment. Inclusion of funds supposedly derived from the \n     Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will hasten the already shaky \n     support our party has for maintaining control of the \n     Congress.\n       Thank you for doing your part to keep the ``conservation'' \n     in ``conservative.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Martha A. Marks, Ph.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Wilderness Society,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a \n     spectacular wilderness on the north coast of Alaska. The \n     refuge protects lands of abundant wildlife and tremendous \n     beauty. Millions of migratory birds nest or feed on the \n     refuge each spring and summer between annual migrations that \n     bring them through the backyards and nearby parks and refuges \n     of Americans throughout the rest of the country. The refuge \n     also contains the calving grounds of the 130,000 member \n     Porcupine River Caribou herd on which the Gwich' in people of \n     northeast Alaska and northwest Canada have relied for some \n     20,000 years.\n       With rising fuel prices, some would have you believe that \n     oil drilling in the Arctic Refuge would somehow lower the \n     price of gasoline. This is a terrible sham. This proposal is \n     not about filling American's fuel talks; it's about lining \n     the pockets of the oil companies in Alaska. We understand \n     that the Budget Resolution that will soon come to a vote in \n     the Senate may assume federal revenues from oil drilling in \n     the Arctic Refuge. This proposal was rejected by the American \n     public and vetoed by President Clinton in 1995. To assume \n     revenues from this highly controversial and currently \n     prohibited activity is a complete hoax.\n       Some have argued that drilling in the Arctic Refuge will \n     somehow eliminate our dependence on oil imports. But just \n     five years ago, Senator Murkowski pushed through a measure to \n     allow oil from Alaska's North Slope to be exported to China \n     and other Asian countries. In it's pending review of the \n     proposed BP/Arco merger, the Federal Trade Commission found \n     that ``BP ships Alaska North Slope crude to Asia to short the \n     West Coast market and elevate prices.''\n       Ninety-five percent of the North Slope is already available \n     to oil and gas exploration and development. Under the Reagan \n     Administration, the Department of Interior determined that \n     there is less than a one-in-five chance of finding \n     recoverable oil there. More recently, the U.S. Geological \n     Survey have said that oil companies could most likely only \n     recover around 3.2 billion barrels--only enough oil to meet \n     U.S. needs for a few months. At no time would oil from the \n     refuge be expected to provide more than 2 percent of U.S. oil \n     supply. Of course, no amount of oil would ever justify \n     destroying this great national treasure.\n       We urge you to listen to the American public and the \n     Gwich'in people and reject efforts to include oil revenues \n     from the Arctic Refuge in the Budget Reconciliation bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William H. Meadows,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    National Parks\n\n\n                                     Conservation Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2000.\n\n             Oppose Degradation of the Arctic Coastal Plain\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of our 400,000 members, the \n     National Parks Conservation Association strongly urges you to \n     oppose efforts to include projected revenues from oil \n     drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal \n     plain in the pending Budget Reconciliation bill.\n       The Arctic coastal plain has long been recognized as a \n     spectacular national gem because of its spectacular scenery \n     and diverse and abundant wildlife. The coastal plain richly \n     deserves its tag of ``America's Serengeti,'' as over 130,000 \n     caribou of the Porcupine herd migrate there every spring to \n     their calving grounds, and more than 300,000 snow geese are \n     found there in the fall.\n       Attempts to open the coastal plain for drilling for oil \n     have reared their head in Congress over the past three \n     decades. Recent increases in gasoline prices have renewed the \n     call to open the plain for oil production, resulting in an \n     ``assumption'' of revenue from drilling in the Arctic Refuge \n     in the Budget Reconciliation bill.\n       Opening up the coastal plain would not be a solution to the \n     short-term increases in gasoline prices, nor would it address \n     the nation's long-term energy strategy. In fact, the United \n     States Geological Service estimates that even if oil were \n     found in the coastal plain, production would never meet more \n     than two percent of our nation's oil needs at any given time. \n     This supply would hardly justify the production facilities \n     and related infrastructure that would destroy the unique \n     character of the coastal plain.\n       Your support in opposing efforts to promote oil development \n     and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \n     critical. Thank you for your attention to these concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Tom Kiernan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2000.\n     Re Protect the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--Vote ``yes'' \n         on the Roth Arctic wilderness amendment to the 2001 \n         Budget Resolution.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is \n     the bipartisan political voice of the national environmental \n     community. Each year, LCV publishes the National\n\n[[Page S2221]]\n\n     Environmental Scorecard, which details the voting records of \n     members of Congress on environmental legislation. The \n     Scorecard is distributed to LCV members, concerned voters \n     nationwide, and the press.\n       The League of Conservation Voters urges you to protect the \n     biological heart of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by \n     supporting an amendment offered by Senator Roth (R-DE) to the \n     2001 Budget Resolution that opposes opening the Refuge to oil \n     drilling. Currently the budget resolution assumes revenues \n     from drilling in the Refuge.\n       Some members of Congress are using the current high price \n     of gasoline as a pretext to open the Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge to oil drilling. The current price of gasoline in no \n     way justifies destroying this national treasure. Development \n     of the Refuge's coastal plain will not impact oil supplies \n     until far into the future, and the amount of oil that lies \n     beneath it is minimal compared to our national energy needs.\n       The Arctic Refuge is home to wolves, polar bears, caribou \n     and millions of migratory birds. It is also the last 5% of \n     Alaska's vast north coastline that remains off-limits to the \n     oil companies. And the Refuge plays an integral part in the \n     lives of the Gwich'in people who depend on the seasonal \n     migrations of the caribou for both survival and cultural \n     identity.\n       Protecting the wilderness values of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge is one of the top priorities of the national \n     environmental community. LCV urges you to vote ``yes'' on \n     Senator Roth's amendment to protect the Arctic Refuge.\n       LCV's Political Advisory Committee will consider including \n     votes on this issue in compiling LCV's 2000 Scorecard. If you \n     need more information, please call Betsy Loyless in my \n     office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deb Callahan,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I want to read from the letter of the League \nof Conservation Voters, which is the bipartisan political voice of the \nnational environmental community. They write:\n\n       The League of Conservation Voters urges you to protect the \n     biological heart of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge by \n     supporting an amendment offered by Senator Roth to the 2001 \n     Budget Resolution that opposes opening the Refuge to oil \n     drilling. Currently the budget resolution assumes revenues \n     from drilling in the Refuge.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Protecting the wilderness values of the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge is one of the top priorities of the national \n     environmental community.\n\n  How true that is. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge contains our \nNation's greatest wilderness. No conservation area in America contains \nas much vast wild land free of industrialization. It is the essence of \nour country's wilderness areas.\n  Consider three or four points. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is \nthe only conservation area that protects a complete spectrum of arctic \nand subarctic ecosystems in North America. The Coastal Plain of the \nArctic Refuge is the only wild stretch of coast on Alaska's North Slope \nthat is off limits to oil and gas exploration and development.\n  President Dwight Eisenhower was the first to set aside the original \nArctic National Wildlife Range in 1960 for the purpose of protecting \nthe wilderness, the wildlife, and recreational values.\n  While many refuges in America have been set aside to protect wildlife \npopulations and habitat, the Arctic Refuge is the only refuge in which \nwilderness was recognized as a purpose for establishment, the \ncontroversial 1002 area proposed for oil development as a part of the \noriginal Arctic range.\n  I could go on. It is critically important that we protect this \nvaluable refuge for future generations. For that reason, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in support of the Roth amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I certainly agree with my friend, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, relative to the interest of America's environmental \ncommunity.\n  This is a big issue for them because it generates membership and it \ngenerates dollars. They have a cause. We have heard from them, the \neloquence expressed by my friend, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  But what we did not hear was any of the 500,000 American men and \nwomen who were sent to the Mideast to fight a war against Saddam \nHussein. They left their loved ones. They risked their lives. What did \nAmerica's environmental community say about that? They did not say a \nword.\n  What are they saying today about our increased dependence on Iraq? \nSeven hundred thousand barrels a day of oil; the fastest growing source \nof oil coming into this country. What is the environmental community \nsaying? What we all believe in: More conservation, more alternative \nenergies, as they drive in their automobile or pick up their plane to \nfly to the next point.\n  Come on, let's get real around here. We talk about ANWR potentially \nhaving a 200-day supply. Under that logic Prudhoe Bay should have been \na 600-day supply. In reality, It has been supplying this Nation with 20 \nto 25 percent of our total crude oil for the last 23 years. That is a \nridiculous comparison. It suggests that all other oil production is \ngoing to stop, all other domestic production is going to stop, and that \nis all you are going to have from one source.\n  Come on, get real. We can come up with better arguments than that. \nThey say 95 percent of the Arctic Coastal Plain is open to oil and gas \ndevelopment. That is false. Try and get a lease up there. Only Fourteen \npercent is open.\n  This map shows the Naval Petroleum Reserve that was dedicated in the \n1900s. You think you can get a lease in there? Try. Go over to the \nSecretary of Interior and see if you can get a lease. They put up a few \nleases, but you cannot go in and even lease where the high potential \nfor oil is in the Naval Petroleum Reserve. If that isn't where you are \nsupposed to find oil, I do not know where is.\n  Where are you going to find oil? The ANWR area isn't open. This other \narea of the State is partially open. But the reality is, the wilderness \nis closed. The Coastal Plain is closed. The Teshepuk Lake area is \nclosed; Barrow is closed. The western portion of NPRA is closed to oil \nproduction. That is the reality. So do not buy their arguments that 95% \nof the Coastal Plain is available for development because it is ``pie \nin the sky.''\n  We are concerned about our Gwich'in people. However, what they \npropose to do is lease their open lands for oil development. They \noffered to lease more than land than the entire 1.5 million acre \nCoastal Plain of ANWR. They offered to lease 1.799 million acres. They \nsigned a lease. Unfortunately, the oil company did not find any oil \nthere. Maybe they should have taken the leases anyway.\n  So we have more myth around here than fiction. No reality. No credit \nfor American ingenuity or technology or the realization that this area \nwe are talking about is the size of the State of South Carolina.\n  Mostly the Members here cannot comprehend size. We had four time \nzones in Alaska during the time I grew up--most of the time I was here. \nWe cut them down to one.\n  If you overlay Alaska on the United States--you know it and I know \nit--we extend from Canada to New Mexico; Florida to California. The \nAleutian Islands go out forever. They almost go to Japan. It is a big \nhunk of real estate.\n  We have heard a lot of romantic and fanciful notions tonight about \nthe Coastal Plain. But we have not discussed and resolved the \nobligation to oversee the national security interests of this Nation. \nThis is the Senate. We make decisions on war and peace.\n  ANWR is a serious issue. It is so serious that I hope you will all \nremember that if this amendment is adopted, I can assure every single \nMember of this body, we will well be on our way to jeopardizing our \nnational security by further increasing our dependence on imported oil.\n  I do not want that obligation on my shoulders. It is time to turn \naround the direction in this country, reduce our dependence on imported \noil, move into the areas where we have potential oil and gas \ndiscoveries in the Rocky Mountains, the overthrust belt, and my State \nof Alaska.\n  We have a Vice President who says he is going to cancel all OCS \nleases. Where are we going to get oil from? Where are we going to get \nthe energy? Where are you going to get the fuel for that 747 called Air \nForce One to fly back and forth to New York or wherever it goes? Are \nyou going to do it with hot air?\n  The Vice President goes around town. Does he drive a battery-operated \ncar with the back seat full of batteries?\n\n[[Page S2222]]\n\n Does he drive an electric car? No. We are not there yet.\n  It is serious. This is an issue of national security. We fought a war \nover oil in 1991. We lost 147 lives. We have $10 billion of the \ntaxpayers' money invested in keeping Saddam Hussein fenced in.\n  It is an issue of the environment. We have the best environmental \nstipulations in the world in the United States. Most of the OPEC \ncountries have the worst.\n  They are drilling in the rain forests of Colombia. We have proven \nwhat we can do it right in the Arctic. We have a record. We have \nproduced between 20 percent to 25 percent of our domestic crude oil in \nthe United States in Alaska for the last 23 years.\n  It is an issue with the economy, sending our dollars overseas, our \njobs overseas. It is a third of our trade imbalance. It is an issue \nthat you--when I say ``you,'' I apologize to my colleagues--but no \nMember has addressed the people of my State, the Eskimo people who \nsupport development of this area.\n  You know what they say? They say, ``please put my people, the Inupiat \nEskimo people, into the picture of ANWR. Stop airbrushing us out.'' Try \nbeing airbrushed out of the picture or out of your State. That is kind \nof the position to which these people feel they have been relegated. \nWhat a tragedy.\n  This is serious. This is not something that should be taken for \ngranted.\n  The Eskimo people support development. One of my Eskimo friends, \nOliver Levitt, to a group of us in Barrow, said: I used to come to \nschool to keep warm. My job every morning was to go out on the beach \nand pick up what little driftwood floated down from the McKenzie River \nto the shores near Barrow.\n  He came to school to keep warm. That isn't the case in Barrow anymore \nbecause not only do they have the revenue from oil, but they have jobs. \nThey have an alternate way of life that used to depend totally on \nsubsistence and following the game herds. That is the record and the \nreality.\n  It was 20 below in Kaktovik yesterday, if it makes those of you in \nthis body who have been listening to a little of my hot air cool off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is the real world we live in.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to \nexpress what I hope is recognized as a reasonable balance, to send a \nsignal to Saddam Hussein, and to say that it is time to turn around \nAmerica's energy policy and lessen our dependence on imported oil. This \nis the place to start. And the time is now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. On behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent the \nvotes relative to the Byrd-Warner amendment and the Roth amendment \noccur at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday, with no second-degree amendments in \norder, and there be 2 minutes for explanation prior to each vote.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we will tentatively accept \nthis. I just need to say this first: I have spoken to the manager of \nthe bill, Senator Domenici. We want to make sure there is an \nunderstanding, however, that the amendments that we finish tonight or \nthat we work on tonight, that there will be a vote on those amendments \nsome time prior to the votes in the vote-arama tomorrow.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Assuming the intention of the majority to work toward \nthat, they would pursue that tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, is all time yielded back?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield back those 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia has an amendment \nto offer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2965\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce revenue cuts by $5.9 billion over the next five \n           years to help fund school modernization projects)\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Harkin, \nLautenberg, Dorgan, Kennedy, Mikulski, Kerry of Massachusetts, \nBingaman, Baucus, and Graham of Florida, I send an amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Robb], for himself, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. \n     Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 2965.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $78,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $521,300,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $1,011,200,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $1,223,400,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $1,361,200,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $78,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $521,300,,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $1,011,200,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $1,223,400,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $1,361,200,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $1,322,100,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $1,344,600,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by $1.,367,400,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $1,390,700,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $78,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $521,300,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, increase the amount by $1,011,200,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $1,223,400,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, increase the amount by $1,361,200,000.\n       On page 18, line 7, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 8, increase the amount by $78,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 11, increase the amount by $1,322,100,000.\n       On page 18, line 12, increase the amount by $521,300,000.\n       On page 18, line 15, increase the amount by $1,344,600,000.\n       On page 18, line 16, increase the amount by $1,011,200,000.\n       On page 18, line 19, increase the amount by $1,367,400,000.\n       On page 18, line 20, increase the amount by $1,223,400,000.\n       On page 18, line 23, increase the amount by $1,390,700,000.\n       On page 18, line 24, increase the amount by $1,361,200,000.\n       On page 29, line 3, decrease the amount by $97,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 4, decrease the amount by $5,938,100,000.\n       On page 29, after line 5, insert the following:\n       ``Not later than September 29, 2000, the Senate Committee \n     on Finance shall report to the Senate a reconciliation bill \n     proposing changes in laws within its jurisdiction necessary \n     to reduce revenues by not more than $19,000,000 in fiscal \n     year 2001 and $1,743,000,000 for the period of fiscal years \n     2001 through 2005.''\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to help ensure \nthat no child attends a school with a leaky roof, or crowded \nclassrooms, or that lacks access to the latest technology and the \nInternet.\n  In the words of Yogi Berra, ``It's deja vu all over again.'' Last \nyear's debate about our Budget Resolution is almost a carbon copy of \nthis year's debate. There are few times in the legislative process that \nthe contrasts between ideologies are more clear than in our debate on \nthe Budget Resolution--and this year is no exception. While some\n\n[[Page S2223]]\n\nwould have us focus on funding a massive tax cut which will likely be \ndirected to those who need it least, others would focus on \nstrengthening Social Security and Medicare, paying down the debt, and \nmaking critical investments in areas like education. While, \nunderstandably, there are bound to be philosophical differences about \nachieving these objectives, I am again disheartened that education is \nnot higher on our list of fiscal priorities. While I compliment the \nChairman for including $2.2 billion dedicated to IDEA funding, I'm back \nagain to urge that more of my colleagues to support an amendment which \nreduces the size of this massive tax cut to help finance school \nmodernization efforts. Mr. President, education should truly be a \ncommon priority--we certainly know that it's a national priority.\n  Mr. President, I'm sure that none of us could imagine holding Senate \nproceedings in a trailer, nor could we imagine having to place buckets \naround our desks to catch rainwater leaking in through the Capitol \ndome. We simply can't imagine what it would feel like to hold our \nsummer debates in a chamber that wasn't air-conditioned. And Mr. \nPresident, if we couldn't stand the heat, we'd get out of the chamber \nand take a recess, but our nation's students simply don't have that \nluxury. A heat-related recess for them means fewer math lessons. It \nmeans less time with a qualified teacher. It means reduced learning. \nAnd Mr. President, I'm sure our dedicated clerks here in the Senate \ncouldn't imagine doing their jobs today without being able to scan our \namendments into a computer, making them accessible to staff and the \nnation at a moment's notice. We shouldn't then expect our nation's \nchildren to master core skills as well as information technology skills \nif we don't give them the keys to the information highway.\n  Mr. President, five years ago, the GAO estimated that our national \nschool modernization needs totaled $185 billion. This year, that figure \nhas risen to $307 billion, according to a recent report by the National \nEducation Association. The report indicates that the State Departments \nof Education across the country are reporting a 65% increase in school \nmodernization needs over the last five years. That translates into \n$66,849,315 a day. Much like our national debt clock, the tape is also \nrunning on our school modernization needs. With record enrollments, \ndeteriorating facilities, and the immense need to modernize our schools \nwith the latest technology, we simply can't afford to sit back and \nclaim that the federal government can't or shouldn't help.\n  There is an often used argument that the federal government should \nhave no role in building or renovating schools. And if you look at last \nyear's federal outlays for capital expenses, school construction \noccupies the smallest slice of that pie. Of the $400 billion the \nfederal government spent on national infrastructure, only one-tenth of \none percent--this little piece right here--went to education, training, \nand employment capital expenses. Roughly 55 percent of our capital \ncosts were spent on highways, 15 percent on housing, 13 percent on \ncommunity and regional development, with the remaining portion allotted \nto mass transit, airports, and pollution control facilities.\n\n  With over $300 billion in unmet needs, Mr. President, I believe we \nneed to expand this pie and invest more in our schools. Our capital \ncosts over the years can vary from category to category, depending upon \nwhat our needs are. Today, the average age of our nation's schools is \n42 years. The last time we made a major investment in our nation's \neducational infrastructure was under the leadership of a Republican \nPresident, Dwight Eisenhower. Over the course of his tenure, we spent \nroughly $1 billion specifically for school construction--due to the \nboom in our student population. Well, Mr. President, we're in the Baby \nBoom Echo now; those children now have their own children in our \nschools. We have a record 53.2 million children now enrolled in our \nschools today and by 2009, we'll add about one million more. We need to \nmake a commitment similar to the one made by our parents and \ngrandparents in the 1950's. A billion dollars in 1953 would be about \n$5.4 billion today, if you adjusted for inflation. This amendment \nmerely seeks to set aside $5.9 billion over the next five years.\n  For every one million students, our nation must build about 1300 \nschools, and at an average cost of over $12 million per school, we're \ntalking about $16 billion. That's on top of the costs to remedy safety \ncode violations, retro-fit schools to accommodate technology, and \nrelieve overcrowding.\n  Mr. President, in Virginia, there are over 3,000 trailers in use. \nThis is a picture of Loudoun County High School in Leesburg, Virginia, \njust 33 miles from here. You see a crane hoisting just one of a whole \nline of trailers that sit in a parking lot of this Northern Virginia \nhigh school. Loudoun County alone needs to build 22 new schools over \nthe next six years to accommodate their skyrocketing enrollments. At an \naverage cost in Northern Virginia of about $18 million per school, \nthat's almost $400 million for just one county!\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield time off the resolution?\n  Mr. ROBB. I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. My friend talked about Loudoun County. Clark County, where \nLas Vegas is located, must build one school a month to keep up with its \ngrowth.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada. A similar \nstatistic could be quoted by any one of our 99 colleagues in this \nChamber. Many of those colleagues have similar stories to tell.\n  This amendment is not an attempt to dictate what kind of school \nmodernization legislation we should pass; it merely reserves enough \nfunding to pay for such an effort. Given the fact that the Chairman of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, Sen. Roth, has reported at least three \ntax bills within the last year or so which contain tax incentives for \nschool modernization and the fact that Republican and Democratic \nmembers alike have various proposals to use discretionary spending as a \nvehicle to finance school modernization, there is clearly an interest \non both sides of the aisle to find a way to do this.\n  Even more illustrative of the momentum to fund school modernization \nlegislation was the introduction last Tuesday of a truly bipartisan \nschool construction and renovation bill in the House. It's sponsored by \nRepresentatives Nancy Johnson and Charlie Rangel and has 130 other co-\nsponsors. School modernization has been a top priority of the education \ncommunity for the past three years. And this community is joined by \nengineers, architects, mayors across the country, civil rights groups, \nand even some religious groups.\n  Mr. President, Let's make it a priority this year. This amendment \nreflects a commitment similar to the one that our parents and \ngrandparents made a generation ago. I hope we can summon similar \ncourage in this generation.\n  Even more illustrative of the momentum to fund school modernization \nlegislation was the introduction last Tuesday of a truly bipartisan \nschool construction and renovation bill in the House.\n  It is sponsored by Representatives Nancy Johnson and Charlie Rangel \nand has 103 other cosponsors.\n  School modernization has been a top priority of the education \ncommunity for the past 3 years. This community is joined by engineers, \narchitects, mayors across the country, civil rights groups, and even \nsome religious groups.\n  Mr. President, let's make it a priority this year. This amendment \nreflects a similar commitment to the one that our parents and \ngrandparents made a generation ago. I hope that we can summon similar \ncourage in this generation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Robb's \namendment which encourages the Senate to make school modernization a \ntop priority by providing $1.3 billion in discretionary spending for \ngrants and loans for the urgent repair and renovation of public \nelementary and secondary schools in high-need areas, and to leverage \n$25 billion in interest-free bonds in FY2001.\n  I also commend Senator Robb and Senator Harkin for their leadership \non this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that \nis necessary to help the nation meet the critical need to modernize and \nrebuild crumbling and overcrowded schools.\n\n[[Page S2224]]\n\n  Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. 14 \nmillion children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in \nsubstandard buildings. Half of all schools have at least one \nunsatisfactory environmental condition. The problems with ailing school \nbuildings are not the problems of the inner city alone. They exist in \nalmost every community--urban, rural, or suburban.\n  In Massachusetts, 41 percent of schools report that at least one \nbuilding needs extensive repairs or should be replaced. 80 percent of \nschools report at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 48 \npercent have inadequate heating, ventilation, or air conditioning. And \n36 percent report inadequate plumbing systems.\n  In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, \ncommunities need to build new schools in order to keep pace with rising \nenrollments and to reduce class sizes. Elementary and secondary school \nenrollment has reached an all-time high this year of 53.4 million \nstudents, and will continue to grow. The number will rise by 324,000 in \n2000, by 282,000 in 2001, and by 250,000 in 2002. It will continue on \nthis upward trend in the following years.\n  For example, in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, enrollments are rising by \n200 students a year. Educators there would like to reduce class size, \nextend special education and bilingual education programs, and hire new \nteachers, but the school system does not have the facilities or \nresources to accomplish these important goals. Instead, Fitchburg has \nbeen forced to construct four portable facilities--and a fifth is under \nconstruction--to deal with overcrowding.\n  According to a report this year, total unmet school modernization \nneeds, including technology and infrastructure, totals $307 billion--\nalmost three times the amount estimated in 1995. Massachusetts has $9.9 \nbillion in unmet technology and infrastructure needs.\n  The time is now to do all we can to help rebuild and modernize public \nschools, so that all children can succeed in safe, technologically-\nequipped schools. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Robb's \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this is a unique moment in our history.\n  We are at the dawn of a new century. And the United States is in a \nperiod of unprecedented economic prosperity.\n  We have the lowest unemployment rate in decades, the number of \nfamilies on welfare has declined and new jobs continue to be created at \na record pace.\n  However, we know that despite the longest economic boom in history, \nsome Americans have been left behind. As we look to the future, one of \nour challenges will be to make sure the rising tide lifts all boats. In \naddition, we also face the challenge of keeping the prosperity going.\n  The pending budget resolution jeopardizes our prosperity. It \njeopardizes the economy, threatens the Social Security surplus, and \nshortchanges Medicare. The resolution does not provide an adequate \nprescription drug benefit, provide sufficient debt reduction or invest \nin education.\n  The budget resolution undermines the public's priorities and will \nimpose deep cuts in domestic programs. Fewer children will be served by \nHead Start, there will be fewer new teachers to reduce class size and \nno additional officers for community policing.\n  Instead, the budget proposes a risky tax scheme that jeopardizes our \nnation's future prosperity and productivity.\n  The GOP's budget plan squanders the entire non-Social Security \nsurplus on a reckless tax cut and provides no funding for national \npriorities such as school modernization. It rejects the President's \nproposal to provide $25 billion in bonds to underwrite construction of \n6,000 new schools. It also rejects $1.3 billion in grants and loans for \nemergency repairs to public schools.\n  This budget sets the wrong national priorities. It chooses tax cuts \nfor the wealthy over modernizing our children's schools. The Robb-\nHarkin amendment corrects this serious shortcoming by providing a \ncomprehensive national strategy to repair, renovate and modernize our \npublic schools.\n  States and local communities are struggling to renovate existing \nschools and build new ones to alleviate overcrowding. School \nconstruction and modernization are necessary to equip classrooms for \nthe 21st Century, improve learning conditions, end overcrowding, and \nmake smaller classes possible.\n  Our school buildings are simply wearing out. Nearly three-quarters of \nall U.S. public schools were built before 1970.\n  According to the National Center for Education Statistics, when a \nschool is between 20 and 30 years, frequent replacement of equipment is \nnecessary.\n  When a school is between 30 and 40 years old all of the original \nequipment should have been replaced, including the roof and electrical \nsystems.\n  After 40 years of age, a school building begins to deteriorate \nrapidly and most schools are abandoned after 60 years.\n  The average school building is 42 years old and technology is placing \nnew demands on schools. As a result of increased use of technology, \nmany schools must install new wiring, telephone lines and electrical \nsystems. The demand for the Internet is at an all-time high, but in the \nnation's poorest schools, only 39% of classrooms have Internet access.\n  In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a report card \non our nation's infrastructure. The report found many problems. \nHowever, the most startling finding is with respect to our nation's \npublic schools.\n  ASCE reports that public schools are in worse condition than any \nother sector of our national infrastructure. This is an alarming fact \nand should be our call to action.\n  The need to modernize our nation's public schools is clear, yet the \nFederal Government lags in helping local school districts address this \ncritical problem.\n  Because of increasing enrollments and aging buildings, local and \nState expenditures for school construction have increased \ndramatically--by 39% from 1990 to 1997. However, this increase has not \nbeen sufficient to address the need.\n  The National Education Association recently surveyed states about the \nneed to modernize public schools and upgrade education technology. \nAccording to their preliminary report, $253.9 billion is needed to \nmodernize the school facilities and $53.7 billion is needed to upgrade \neducation technology. For Iowa--$3.4 billion for school facilities and \n$540 million for education technology.\n  It is a national disgrace that the nicest places that our children \nsee are shopping malls, sports arenas and movie theaters and the most \nrun down place they see is their public schools. What signal are we \nsending them about the value we place on them, their education and \nfuture?\n  How can we prepare our kids for the 21st century in schools that did \nnot make the grade in the 20th century?\n  This amendment provides a comprehensive, two-prong response to this \ncritical national problem.\n  First, we would provide $1.3 billion each year to make grants and no \ninterest loans for emergency repairs to public schools. The Public \nSchool Repair and Renovation Program would help local school districts \nfix the roof that is leaking, repair fire code violations and put in \nnew electrical wiring.\n  Mr. President, 25% of schools in New York City are still heated by \ncoal and 46% of U.S. schools lack adequate electrical wiring to support \nthe full-scale use of technology. Sixteen million children attend \nschools without proper heating, ventilation or air conditioning. Twelve \nmillion students attend classes in schools with defective plumbing. \nThese grants and loans would make it possible to install the modern \nheating systems, plumbing, and new electrical wiring that are \ndesperately needed in schools across America.\n  In addition, these grants and loans could be used to remedy \nviolations of state or local fire codes. The Iowa Fire Marshal reported \na five-fold increase in the number of fires in schools over the past \ndecade. During the 1990's there were 100 fires in Iowa schools. During \nthe previous decade there were 20.\n  It is clear that public schools have an urgent need to make repairs \nnow and these grants and no-interest loans will finance up to 8,300 \nrepair projects in 5,000 schools. We will install modern heating \nsystems, upgrade the electrical wiring, and repair the fire code \nviolations.\n  These grants and loans will address problems that literally endanger \nthe lives and safety of our children.\n\n[[Page S2225]]\n\n  However, some buildings have simply outlived their usefulness and \nneed to be replaced. In addition, enrollment in elementary and \nsecondary schools is at an all time high of 53.2 million and will \ncontinue to grow over the next 10 years. Therefore, it will be \nnecessary for the United States to build an additional 6,000 schools to \neducate the growing number of students.\n  The second part of our comprehensive strategy is to underwrite the \ncost of building nearly $25 billion of new school facilities. Our \namendment provides tax credits to subsidize the interest on new \nconstruction projects to modernize public schools. School districts \nwould be able to replaced outdated buildings or add more class rooms so \nthey can reduce class size. The school modernization bonds would \nfinance modernization projects for 6,000 schools.\n  Our amendment provides a modest national investment to modernize our \nnation's schools and will make a big difference for millions of \nchildren. Further, the amendment is fully offset by reducing the ill-\nconceived tax scheme in the Budget Resolution.\n  I know this kind of approach will work because it is working in Iowa. \nIowa is in the second year of a school modernization and repair \ndemonstration project.\n  Like the Robb-Harkin Amendment, the Iowa demonstration also takes a \ntwo-prong approach toward solving this critical problem. First, the \nIowa project provides grants for the repair of fire code violations. \nSecondly, the Iowa project provides grants to subsidize the cost of \nconstructing new school facilities.\n  In a relatively short period of time, we have already begun to see a \ndifference in Iowa. Over the past two years, 138 grants have been \nawarded for projects to repair fire code violations. The federal \ngovernment provided $6.5 million to install fire alarms, upgrade \nelectrical systems and other repairs to make Iowa schools safer.\n  Last year, six Iowa school districts received grants to underwrite \nthe cost of building new school facilities. Over and over, school \nofficials said the availability of the federal grant was responsible \nfor convincing local citizens to support the school bond issue that \nfinance the bulk of the project.\n  Several school districts passed school bond issues after several \ntries. One superintendent said, ``In the past, our school district ran \nthree bond issues unsuccessfully and it is a credit to the Department \nof Education . . . for providing this Iowa Demonstration Grant funding \nas an incentive to help voters pass bond issues.''\n  Another Superintendent said, ``It is our opinion that both of these \ngrants played a very important role regarding the successful passing of \nthe bond issue.''\n  The most recent competition was just closed and applications for the \nsecond year of funding are being reviewed.\n  The Iowa School Construction Grant is beginning to show the kind of \nmajor impact a modest federal investment can have on improving the \nsafety of schools and spurring construction of new school facilities. \nThe school modernization provisions mirror the Iowa Demonstration and \nwill spur the same kind of activity across the nation that we are \nwitnessing in Iowa.\n  The Iowa School Construction Grant is beginning to show the kind of \nmajor impact a modest federal investment can have on improving the \nsafety of schools and spurring construction of new school facilities. \nOur amendment mirrors the Iowa Demonstration and will spur the same \nkind of activity across the nation that we are witnessing in Iowa.\n  Modern, up-to-date school buildings are essential for student \nachievement. Studies show that students in overcrowded schools or \nschools in poor physical condition scored significantly lower on both \nmath and reading than their peers in less crowded conditions.\n  The General Accounting Office reports that 14 million American \nchildren attend classes in schools that are unsafe or inadequate. This \nis a serious national problem. And, it demands a comprehensive national \nresponse. The Robb-Harkin Amendment provides that effective national \nresponse. I commend Senator Robb for his leadership on this issue and \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I appreciate the Senator allowing \nme, on behalf of the leader----\n  Mr. REID. I could not hear the Senator. Would he start over?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am going to speak on behalf of the \nleader for the wrap-up that has been prepared.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following my remarks, the \nSenate resume consideration of the budget resolution for Senator Durbin \nto offer his amendment and the appropriate debate. I further ask \nunanimous consent that following his remarks, the Senate stand in \nadjournment under the previous order.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object. Somebody was talking to me. \nPlease repeat that last request.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of \nSenator Durbin, the Senate stand in adjournment under the previous \norder.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we don't have a previous \norder. Before we agree to this, why don't we do the rest of the \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will proceed and omit any reference to the previous \norder. I will go to Thursday's consent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate reconvenes at 9:30 on \nThursday, there be 8 hours and 30 minutes remaining on the concurrent \nresolution, and the pending resolution be the Durbin amendment relative \nto tax cuts. I further ask consent that prior to the vote, relative to \nthe Robb education amendment, there be 10 minutes remaining, to be \nequally divided between Senator Robb and Senator Domenici for the \nclosing debate.\n  Mr. REID. The minority has no objection to these last two paragraphs \nthe Senator just read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, there is strong bipartisan support for \nthe Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). To date, 45 \nSenators have signed a letter in support of $1.4 billion in regular \nfunding, and $300 million in emergency funding, for LIHEAP during \nFiscal Year 2001.\n  I, along with my colleagues from the Northeast-Midwest Senate \nCoalition, will offer this Sense of the Senate to demonstrate the broad \nsupport for increased LIHEAP funding. The amendment expresses the sense \nof the Senate with respect to increasing LIHEAP regular funding from \nthe current level of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion.\n  In my home State of Vermont, this past winter brought temperatures of \nfifteen below zero; and home heating oil prices soared to $2 a gallon. \nApproximately 11,400 Vermont families received benefits, which averaged \n$310 in regular funding for the entire season. Emergency funding \ncontributed an additional $50-$135 depending on the fuel source. These \nnumbers reveal the frugalness with which this program now has to \noperate.\n  I am concerned that emergency LIHEAP funding is being used to make up \nfor regular appropriations funding shortfalls. During the first four \nand half months of FY2000, all available emergency LIHEAP funding ($300 \nmillion) was released. There are requests for additional emergency \nfunding. This situation demonstrates the need to increase regular \nfunding to at least the sum of last year's regular and emergency \nfunding amounts.\n  There is no doubt that emergency funding was critical during this \npast winter's severe weather conditions and volatile fuel prices. \nHowever, LIHEAP funding is most effective when states have it in the \nform of regular funding, allowing proper advance budgeting and \nproviding funding assistance to low income households before a crisis \nsituation.\n  In addition, it is critical that we maintain the integrity of the \nLIHEAP program through the regular funding cycle. The decision was made \nlast year to consider the program an additional non-routine expense. I \nam concerned that this designation threatens the foundation of the \nprogram. This amendment seeks to return LIHEAP to its regular funding \nstructure.\n  LIHEAP is an effective tool for maintaining the basic needs of low-\nincome households. Nevertheless, stagnant funding has resulted in a \ngrowing eligible population not receiving benefits\n\n[[Page S2226]]\n\ndue to lack of funding. The safety net for our low-income households is \ngetting ever smaller and ever thinner.\n  The statistics demonstrate the need for LIHEAP best. More than two-\nthirds of LIHEAP-eligible households have annual incomes of less than \n$8,000, approximately one-half have annual incomes below $6,000. It has \nbeen estimated that low-income households typically spend four times \nwhat middle-income households spend on utility services. Middle-income \nhouseholds spend about four percent of their income for energy \npurposes, whereas low-income households spend between 14% and 16%, and \nin many instances up to 25% for utility costs.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to address the funding \nneeds of this important program. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a proud cosponsor of this \nimportant amendment for women who are diagnosed with breast and \ncervical cancer through the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early \nDetection Program (NBCCEDP) at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention (CDC). I am pleased to join Senators Chafee, Snowe, \nGrassley, Harkin, and others in support of this amendment. This \namendment says that we Senators believe that we should pass legislation \nto provide Medicaid coverage for certain women screened and found to \nhave breast or cervical cancer under the CDC screening program.\n  Through March 31, 1999, the CDC screening program has provided more \nthan one million mammograms and almost 1.2 million Pap tests. Among the \nwomen screened, over 6,200 cases of breast cancer and over 550 cases of \ncervical cancer have been diagnosed. Right now, the CDC screening \nprogram does not pay for breast and cervical cancer treatment services, \nbut it does require participating states to provide treatment services.\n  The late Senator John Chafee, Senator Snowe, Senator Moynihan, and I \nalong with others introduced the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment \nAct of 1999 (S. 662) which currently has 57 cosponsors. This bill gives \nstates the option to provide Medicaid coverage for breast and cervical \ncancer treatment to eligible women who were screened and diagnosed with \nthese cancers through the CDC screening program. It is not a mandate \nfor states. It is the Federal Government saying to the States ``we will \nhelp you provide treatment services to these women, if you decide to do \nso.'' I am pleased to be working with the bipartisan team of Senators \nLincoln Chafee, Snowe, Grassley, and Moynihan to pass this important \nlegislation.\n  Women screened and diagnosed through the CDC screening program depend \non staff and volunteer time to find free or more affordable treatment; \nthey depend on the generosity of doctors, nurses, hospitals, and \nclinics who provide them with free or reduced-cost treatment. The \ndemands of managed care can also make it more difficult for physicians \nto provide free or reduced-fee services. In the end, thousands of \npeople who run local screening programs are spending countless hours \nfinding treatment services for women diagnosed with breast and cervical \ncancer. I salute the individuals who spend their time and resources to \nhelp these women. But we must not force these women to rely on the \ngoodwill of others. Right now, the CDC is only screening 12-15 percent \nof the women who are eligible. As more women are screened, treatment \nefforts will become even more difficult. The lack of coverage for \ntreatment services has hurt the program's ability to recruit providers, \nfurther restricting the number of women screened.\n  In short, it is clear that the short-term, ad-hoc strategies of \nproviding treatment have broken down. Because there is no coverage for \ntreatment, state programs are having a hard time recruiting providers; \nvolunteers are spending a disproportionate amount of time finding \ntreatment for women; and fewer women are receiving treatment. We can't \nexpand the program to serve the other 85 percent of eligible women if \nwe can't promise treatment to those we already screen.\n  The CDC screening program is celebrating its 10th anniversary \nin 2000. I am proud to be the Senate architect of the legislation that \ncreated the breast and cervical cancer screening program at the CDC. \nOver ten years ago we saw a need--low-income women were not receiving \nbasic well-woman care--they were not getting their mammograms and Pap \nsmears to detect breast and cervical cancer. At that time, I and others \nwanted to ensure that we not only diagnosed these low-income women with \nbreast and cervical cancer, but that we also provided treatment for \nthose cancers. But 10 years ago, we had great deficits and we simply \ndid not have the money for a treatment component of the CDC screening \nprogram. So we made a down payment. We took the first step with the \nbelief that it would not be the only step. Well, now the time has come \nto take the next step and include Federal resources for treatment for \nwomen who are diagnosed with breast and cervical cancer through the CDC \nscreening program.\n\n  There are three reasons why we should act now to pass this important \nlegislation. First, times have changed since the creation of the CDC \nscreening program ten years ago. We are now running annual surpluses, \ninstead of annual deficits. We have the resources to provide treatment \nto these women. I think we ought to put our money into ensuring that we \nsave lives. Second, prevention, screening, and early detection are very \nimportant, but alone they do not stop deaths. Screening must be coupled \nwith treatment to reduce cancer mortality. Finally, it is only right to \nprovide Federal resources to treat breast and cervical cancer for those \nscreened and diagnosed with these cancers through a Federal screening \nprogram.\n  I am proud that my own state of Maryland realized the importance of \nproviding treatment services to women who were screened through the CDC \nscreening program. Maryland appropriates over $6 million in state funds \nannually for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Diagnostic and Treatment \nProgram for eligible low income Maryland women. The program has \nprovided services to over 15,650 women in Maryland, including eligible \nwomen screened through the CDC screening program and eligible women \nscreened outside the CDC program. The breast cancer mortality rate in \nMaryland has started to decline, in part because of programs like the \nCDC's. But not all states have the resources to do what Maryland has \ndone. That's why this bill is needed.\n  This bill is the best long-term solution. It is strongly supported by \nthe National Breast Cancer Coalition; the American Cancer Society; the \nNational Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems; the \nNational Partnership for Women and Families; YWCA; National Women's \nHealth Network; the American Medical Women's Association, and many \nmore.\n  I urge the Senate Finance Committee to take up this legislation \nbefore Mother's Day and I urge the Senate leadership to promptly bring \nit to the full Senate for consideration. The Breast and Cervical Cancer \nTreatment Act (S. 662) has 57 bipartisan cosponsors. President Clinton \nhas included funding in his 2001 budget to give states the option of \nproviding Medicaid coverage to women who have been diagnosed with \nbreast or cervical cancer through the CDC screening program. The \nCommerce Committee of the House of Representatives has already \nunanimously approved this legislation (H. R. 1070).\n  We must act now to provide a treatment opportunity to all women who \nare diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through the CDC screening \nprogram. Breast and cervical cancer treatment is not a partisan issue. \nIt's a family issue. It affects mothers, sisters, and daughters, and \ntheir fathers, husbands, and children. I can't think of any better way \nto celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Breast and Cervical \nCancer Early Detection Program than by passing the Breast and Cervical \nCancer Treatment Act. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis important amendment.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the amendment that I have submitted is \na simple one. In fact, it's the same one that I offered last year, and \nit takes the tax cuts proposed in this fiscal year 2001 budget \nresolution and uses that money, instead, to pay down the debt.\n  Let me say again: under my amendment, we would take $150 billion that \nis projected to accumulate as a result of our on-budget surpluses over \nthe next five years, and use those funds, not for\n\n[[Page S2227]]\n\ntax cuts, but for debt reduction instead.\n  Why should we do this rather than use this money to reduce taxes?\n  First of all, if we pay down the debt, we are going to decrease our \ninterest payments on the national debt--a debt which stands at $5.7 \ntrillion today. This fiscal year, it will cost us more than $224 \nbillion to service our national debt--more than $600 million a day in \ninterest costs alone!\n  Out of every federal dollar that is spent this year, 13 cents goes to \npay the interest on the national debt.\n  In comparison: 16 cents goes for national defense; 18 cents goes for \nnon-defense discretionary spending; and 53 cents goes for entitlement \nspending.\n  We'll spend more on interest this year than we'll spend on Medicare.\n  When I consider these numbers, it makes me determined to do all that \nI can to decrease our debt even further.\n  That's why I believe that every fiscal decision we make in this \nCongress should be measured against the backdrop of how it will \ndecrease our $5.7 trillion national debt. And I'm not the only one who \nbelieves that.\n  In fact, in testimony before the Senate Budget Committee this past \nJanuary, CBO Director Crippen stated that ``most economists agree that \nsaving the surpluses, paying down the debt held by the public, is \nprobably the best thing that we can do relative to the economy.''\n  And on the very same day, Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan said, \n``my first priority would be to allow as much of the surplus to flow \nthrough into a reduction in debt to the public. From an economic point \nof view, that would be, by far, the best means of employing it.''\n  Lowering the debt sends a positive signal to Wall Street and to Main \nStreet. It encourages more savings and investment which, in turn, fuels \nproductivity and continued economic growth. It also lowers interest \nrates, which in my view, is a real tax reduction for the American \npeople.\n  Furthermore, devoting on-budget surpluses to debt reduction is the \nonly way we can ensure that our nation will not return to the days of \ndeficit spending should the economy take a sharp turn for the worse or \na national emergency arise.\n  As Alan Greenspan has testified before Congress, ``a substantial part \nof the surplus . . . should be allowed to reduce the debt, because you \ncan always increase debt later if you wish to, but it's effectively \nputting away the surplus for use at a later time if you so choose.''\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose the tax \ncuts, preferring instead to use the money to increase spending. I \nbelieve that spending the surplus is an even worse use of the money.\n  Now, many have argued that putting the Social Security surplus in a \n``lock-box'' will be enough to pay down our debt. However, I should \nremind my colleagues that in the near future, we might not have Social \nSecurity surpluses available for debt reduction, because we may need \nthem for Social Security reform, especially if we go to a system of \nprivate accounts.\n  We cannot keep putting off our responsibilities. If we have the \nability--like we do now--we have a moral obligation to pay back our \ndebts.\n  We must face the fact that because of 30 years of irresponsible \nfiscal policies our national debt has increased 1,300%. During that \ntime Congress and our Presidents weren't willing to pay for the things \nthey wanted, or, in the alternative, do without those items they could \nnot afford.\n  I agree with General Accounting Office (GAO) Comptroller General \nDavid Walker, who, in testimony before the House Ways and Means \nCommittee last year, said:\n\n       . . . this generation has a stewardship responsibility to \n     future generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to \n     provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and \n     to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and \n     affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today \n     while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively \n     large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal \n     wave.\n\n  As most of my colleagues know, Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \nfigures show that the United States will achieve a $26 billion on-\nbudget surplus this current fiscal year, FY 2000.\n  However, it is of utmost importance that we oppose the temptation to \nsquander this surplus.\n  In that regard, I have to commend Majority Leader Trent Lott for \nsticking to his guns on not moving forward on a fiscal year 2000 \nsupplemental appropriations bill. He has stated his opposition to a \nseparate bill, preferring instead, to include funding in the regular \nappropriations bills.\n  And we need to get moving on those bills quickly, especially because \nof the need for money to ensure our nation's defense readiness, our \nKosovo peacekeeping mission and Colombia's drug eradication efforts.\n  All we need to do is look at the version of the supplemental that \npassed in the House of Representatives to see why we should not move \nforward with a supplemental bill. Indeed, the House started with the \nPresident's request of $5.1 billion, reported a bill out of the \nAppropriations Committee that was some $9 billion and passed a final \nbill that was $12.7 billion.\n  Imagine the size of the supplemental once the Senate got through with \nit?\n  The worst thing that Congress could do now is throw away any portion \nof that $26 billion on-budget surplus that was achieved in FY 2000 on \nnon-emergency spending.\n  And another reason that we should not pass the supplemental is that \nit can be argued that $22 billion of the $26 billion on-budget surplus \nthat Congress would be tapping into comes from the Medicare Part A \ntrust fund.\n  Instead of squandering this surplus, let's use it to pay down the \ndebt. It will be our first sizable on-budget surplus that we've been \nable to use for debt reduction in 40 years, and a truly historical \naccomplishment.\n  And let's continue to make history by using future on-budget \nsurpluses to pay down our national debt.\n  Mr. President, I believe that if we can pass this amendment, and add \nit to the fine work that the Budget Committee Chairman has accomplished \nin this resolution--and with the promise from the Majority Leader on \nthe supplemental--I believe we will have made a real difference.\n  We will have provided a decent budget that should address some of our \nmost pressing problems, and, we will take whatever on-budget surplus \ndollars that come in and use them to reduce the national debt. Not \nspending increases, not tax breaks, but simply paying down the debt.\n  Mr. President, again, my amendment is simple: it takes the $150 \nbillion in tax cuts assumed by this budget resolution and instead says \nto spend it on debt reduction. I urge my colleagues who believe that we \nshould do all that we can to bring down our national debt to support \nthis amendment.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/05/senate-section/article/S2227-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, it is a great honor for me to represent \nthe people of South Dakota in the United States Senate. They are the \nbest resource in a state with an infinite number of tremendous \nattributes, and the best part of my job is getting to know and work \nwith them on a daily basis.\n  I have often stood before my colleagues here in the Senate to \nrecognize the accomplishments of South Dakotans. Many times, the names \nsound unfamiliar to those in this chamber. Today, however, I want to \ncongratulate a young man who made the country stand up and take \nnotice--and who showed the country how we play basketball in South \nDakota. His name is Mike Miller, and, as every college basketball fan \nknows, he recently led the Florida Gators to the NCAA Division I \nNational Championship basketball game. Although the Gators fell in a \nhard fought battle to the Michigan State Spartans, anyone who saw that \ngame knows that Mike Miller is a very special basketball player.\n\n[[Page S2228]]\n\n  Mike was named Most Outstanding Player in his region for the \ntournament. That is a tremendous feat for any college player and was \nmade possible only because Mike's last-second shot against Butler \nadvanced Florida and kept his team's hopes of reaching the championship \ngame alive. His clutch play continued in every game of the tournament, \nmaking it easy to see why Mike was named the best player in his region. \nRemarkably, Mike did all of this as just a sophomore.\n  Mike Miller is from Mitchell--a leader in South Dakota high school \nbasketball--and as a Kernel he played under the legendary Gary Munsen. \nMike started learning about the game of basketball long before he got \nto high school, however. His uncle, Dakota Wesleyan great Alan Miller, \nis the all-time leading college scorer in South Dakota. And Mike's \nolder brother Ryan, who played for Northern State, currently plays \nprofessionally in Australia. The Millers are a big part of the reason \nthat growing up in Mitchell means growing up around basketball.\n  In a time when too many athletes seem to be more concerned with \nindividual statistics than playing as a team, when the bottom line \nseems to matter more to some professionals than the love of the game, \nit's refreshing to see someone like Mike Miller on the court. Through \nthe course of the tournament and the championship game in Indianapolis, \nMike showed his opponents and the country how basketball is played in \nSouth Dakota--and how it should be played everywhere else. His \nunselfish play makes the players around him better; he has an uncanny \nability to step up his game during crunch time; and he never stops \nworking to improve. That's what he learned in Mitchell--that's what he \nlearned in South Dakota--and that's what he's showing the college \nbasketball world.\n  Although the Gators fell a few points shy the other night in Indiana, \nMike Miller made us proud in South Dakota. He proved to the country \nwhat those at the Corn Palace and at Mitchell High already know--that \nMike Miller is a champion. We are very proud to call him one of our \nown.\n  Let me, of course, congratulate the Michigan State Spartans and the \nUniversity of Connecticut Huskies women's team for their championship \nseasons. But, on behalf of everyone who cheered for him, I would also \nlike to take this opportunity to congratulate Mike, his team and his \nparents--Tom and Sheryl Miller of Mitchell--for the incredible run the \nFlorida Gators had this season. It was fun to watch, and I know we all \nlook forward to seeing more of Mike Miller in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/05/senate-section/article/S2228-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2228]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HEALTH CARE FOR MILITARY RETIREES\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Over the past few weeks, I have had the opportunity to \nsit down and listen to military retirees during their veterans service \norganizations' annual visit to Washington, DC. Without exception, \naccess to health care was a priority for each and every group. As a \nretired officer in the Air Force Reserve, I understand the interest in \nand importance of this issue to those who dedicated a career to serving \nand defending our Nation--I speak not only of the service members \nthemselves, but their spouses and dependent family members as well.\n  After listening to retirees' personal stories and policy \npresentations, as well as reading the numerous letters on health care \nlegislation I receive each week from military retirees across \nWashington State, I am convinced that Congress, the President and the \nDepartment of Defense must address the issue of retirees' access to \nhealth care. In response to the requests of my military retiree \nconstituents, I am cosponsoring Senate bills 915 and 2003, the ``Keep \nOur Promise to America's Military Retirees Act.''\n  In the past several years, I cosponsored and supported efforts to \nestablish the Medicare subvention demonstration program, now known as \nTricare Senior Prime, and the FEHBP demonstration program. The Tricare \nSenior Prime demonstration program allows Medicare-eligible retirees to \nreceive care at military facilities with Medicare paying the Department \nof Defense for the costs of that care. Some retirees in my State of \nWashington have been able to participate in the Tricare Senior Prime \ndemonstration program as Madigan Army Medical Center was one of the \ndesignated test sites. I have spoken with the Commanding Officer at \nMadigan, my staff has met at length with those overseeing the test at \nMadigan, as well as the participating retirees, and it appears the test \nis a significant success.\n  Two concerns I have heard about the Tricare Senior Prime program are \nthat this is a demonstration and is scheduled to end in December of \nthis year, and that Medicare's current reimbursement scheme to the \nDefense Department will not fiscally support a permanent program. \nSenate bill 915 will make the Tricare Senior Prime test program \npermanent and expand it nationwide to facilities not in the test. It is \nimportant for the Defense Department and Congress to act to ensure \nTricare Senior Prime demonstration program does not expire at the end \nof this year and I will be working hard to ensure Tricare Senior Prime \nis maintained. I also intend to work to see that Medicare fairly \nreimburses the Defense Department so that the costs of the Tricare \nSenior Prime program do not impact the services' ability to care for \nactive duty service members and their families.\n  Senate bill 2003, sponsored by Senators Tim Johnson, Paul Coverdell, \nand 24 other Senators, would entitle all retirees, and their widow or \nwidower, access to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP), to \nwhich all federal non-military retirees have access. As I stated \npreviously, I supported establishing the current FEHBP demonstration \nprogram. My support for the demonstration and my decision to cosponsor \nthis bill is driven, to a great degree, by the fact that there are many \nretirees who do not live in close proximity to a military treatment \nfacility, some due to base closures that shut down facilities in their \narea of the country. This legislation would provide retirees access to \nhealth care regardless of where they choose to live. S. 2003 will also \nexpand access to Tricare to allow Medicare-eligible retirees.\n  One other issue that I know is of considerable concern to military \nretirees is the cost of prescription drugs. This concern is heightened, \nin a border State like Washington, by the disparity in drug prices \nbetween the United States and Canada--an issue on which I am working \nfor a common-sense, straight-forward solution. Of interest to Medicare-\neligible retirees is access to prescription drugs from DoD facilities \nor a mail-order program. I believe that it is only fair and appropriate \nfor Congress to consider military retirees when debating the creation \nof a Medicare prescription drug benefit, which I support.\n  My cosponsorship of Senate bill 2003 and 915 is driven by the firm \nbelief that Congress must address the current health care situation of \nmilitary retirees. The President and Defense Department must be active \nparticipants in this matter. Military retirees dedicated their lives to \ndefending our Nation and protecting our interests around the world--\nthey are due a serious legislative response.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/05/senate-section/article/S2228-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2228-S2229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \ndated April 5, 2000, addressed to Senators Lott and Daschle, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       We are writing to lodge our strong objection to \n     consideration of H.R. 2418 by the Senate. This bill would \n     reauthorize the National Organ Transplantation Act (NOTA) in \n     a manner that would adversely affect patients in many states \n     including our own, who are desperately in need of organ \n     transplants.\n       Every year, over 4,000 people die waiting for an organ \n     transplant. The organ allocation policy established by the \n     Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) has been \n     inequitable. Patients with similar severities of illness are \n     treated differently, depending on where they live or at which \n     transplant center they are listed. Patients in some parts of \n     the country wait much longer than patients in other regions, \n     who have the same level of illness. So for some, the chance \n     of dying before they actually receive a transplant is much \n     higher than for others. Over the last 3 years, 97 people died \n     while waiting for an organ transplant at the University of \n     Chicago, 187 died while\n\n[[Page S2229]]\n\n     waiting at the University of Pittsburgh, 99 died while \n     waiting at Mt. Sinai, NY, and 46 children died while waiting \n     for an organ at the Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh.\n       Additional problems occur when hospitals provide large \n     numbers of life-saving transplants to out-of-state patients. \n     Maryland hospitals, for instance, are required to pay back \n     United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) with the total number \n     of kidneys used in transplant operations, even though 40 \n     percent of those transplant are performed on patients from \n     other states. This means that states with small populations \n     and centers of excellence in transplantation more easily \n     build up a so-called ``kidney debt.'' A ``payback'' \n     requirement also applies to livers between some Organ \n     Procurement Organizations (OPOs) or within certain OPOs. \n     Without greater regional sharing of organs, such policies \n     result in longer than the national average wait times and \n     possible sanctions by UNOS, merely because a state provides \n     life-savings services to non-residents.\n       To eliminate these inequities, the Department of Health and \n     Human Services (HHS) issued regulations, which became \n     effective March 16th, that establish a framework for organ \n     allocation policies to be developed by the network. The \n     policies will be based on sound medical judgment and will be \n     fairer for all patients, irrespective of where they live.\n       Regrettably, H.R. 2418 would take us backward and undermine \n     current efforts make the system more equitable. The bill \n     delegates current government authority to a private entity \n     without appropriate standards of Federal review. The bill \n     denies HHS any role in overseeing organ allocation and \n     promoting practices that are in the best interest of the \n     entire public health. The congressionally mandated study by \n     the Institute of Medicine clearly stated that such a role for \n     HHS was both necessary and appropriate. Instead, the bill \n     grants extraordinary powers to a private sector entity to \n     select and approve the Federal controller that manages the \n     OPTN. The manner of such selection does not appear to be \n     consistent with existing principles of the Federal \n     acquisition process, which promote full and open competition \n     in awarding Federal contracts. Furthermore, the bill would \n     not incorporate the Institute of Medicine's recommendation of \n     standardization of patient listing practices and broader \n     sharing of organs.\n       It is our hope that we can work with the committee of \n     jurisdiction here in the Senate, the Health, Education, Labor \n     and Pension Committee, to forge in an alternative \n     reauthorization bill. It is our understanding that Senators \n     Frist and Kennedy are currently working on a bill that would \n     be more in keeping with the IOM's recommendations. We ask \n     that this bill not disrupt the new HHS regulations.\n       Because of our strong objections to H.R. 2418, we request \n     that we be notified and consulted before any unanimous \n     consent agreement is sought for any legislation that seeks to \n     reauthorize the National Organ Transplant Act, to ensure our \n     ability to exercise our rights in the shaping of this \n     important legislation.\n       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Richard J.

Mr. President, I rise today to address a concern I have \nabout the way we run our trade policy.\n  Over a quarter century ago, Congress passed the Trade Act of 1974. It \nwas a monumental piece of legislation which laid the foundation for \nAmerica's current trade policy operations. One of its features was a \nformal system of non-partisan advisory committees. These committees \nwere designed to give the Executive Branch advice from the private \nsector on trade agreements.\n  The Trade Act created two tiers of advisory committees. At the top is \nthe Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN), \ncomposed of 45 people serving for a 2-year term. The members are \nofficers of corporations, trade associations and labor unions. A \nparallel committee known as TEPAC provides advice on trade and the \nenvironment. The next tier contains the Industry Sector Advisory \nCommittees and the Industry Functional Advisory Committees, known as \nISAC's and IFAC's. The Trade Act gives the Executive Branch substantial \nleeway in creating them, chartering them, and choosing their members. \nToday there are more than two dozen ISAC's and IFAC's.\n  Mr. President, the Clinton Administration announced last month that \nit was taking a hard look at the advisory committee process. I support \nthat. In the past year, we've witnessed some unwelcome developments in \nthe advisory committee system that call into question whether its \noperating in the way Congress intended.\n  In May 1999, the head of a prominent environmental group resigned \nfrom the TEPAC. He resigned after his committee was asked to comment on \nregulations only after, rather than before, they were proposed by the \nState Department.\n  In November 1999, the U.S. District Court in Seattle ruled in favor \nof environmentalists who were seeking representation on two of the \nISAC's for paper and wood products. They believed that the trade issues \nunder discussion could have environmental consequences, and they wanted \nthe ISAC's to consider those consequences when providing advice to the \ngovernment. The Court agreed, and the Commerce Department took steps to \ncomply.\n  For reasons I don't understand, the Justice Department appealed the \ndecision after the Commerce Department had taken these steps. I have \nalready said that I will introduce legislation mandating environmental \nparticipation if the District Court decision is overturned.\n  In January 2000, all three labor representatives resigned from the \nACTPN, the top-tier committee. Their complaint was that they had no say \nin shaping the discussion agenda. So now nobody speaks on behalf of \nAmerican workers on the ACTPN.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, this process isn't working the way Congress \nintended. It is time for a fresh look. Let me focus on what I believe \nare the two main issues we should consider: trade agreement compliance \nand open participation.\n  In the 1974 Trade Act, Congress gave the advisory committees two main \ntasks. The first task was to give advice on upcoming and ongoing trade \nnegotiations. The advice they give helps set negotiating objectives and \nbargaining positions. The second task related to existing trade \nagreement. The ACTPN, the ISAC's and the IFAC's were to give advice and \ninformation on compliance with these existing trade agreements.\n  We need more work on the second task.\n  Over the past 20 years, the United States has entered into more than \n400 trade agreements. Last month the GAO issued a report on how well we \nmonitor and enforce them. The answer: not very well.\n  The American Chamber of Commerce in Japan has just released an \nanalysis of our bilateral trade agreements there. They examined over 50 \nseparate agreements, testing them for effective implementation. Of the \nones given a numerical grade, over half flunked the implementation \ntest. That's miserable.\n  What's the problem? The problem is two-fold. First, everyone wants to \nnegotiate agreements, but nobody wants to implement them. That leads to \nthe second problem: too few monitors.\n  With respect to the first problem, Mr. President, it is worth \nremembering that trade policy is carried out by human beings. Like \npeople everywhere, they find that negotiating deals is exciting. \nNegotiating is high-profile work. What about implementation? \nImplementing deals is not nearly as exciting as negotiating them. \nEveryone signs up to negotiate. No one signs up to implement.\n  With respect to the second problem, the GAO cited a widespread lack \nof personnel to monitor and enforce trade agreements. They pointed to \nstaffing gaps at in the U.S. Trade Representative's office, the \nCommerce Department and other agencies. I don't doubt it. President \nClinton and Vice President Gore have worked hard and successfully to \nslim down the federal bureaucracy. So there aren't many extra hands.\n  I don't think this problem can be solved by hiring more people. In \nfact, given the number and complexity of modern trade agreements, I \ndoubt that we even could hire enough government workers to do the job \nright. We've moved far beyond the old-style trade pacts that just \ncovered tariffs, where it is easy to see whether everybody's charging \nthe right rate. Nowadays these agreements cover highly specialized non-\ntariff issues. We have agreements on technical standards for high-tech \nelectronic products. Agreements covering regulatory procedures, such as \napproving new drugs. Understanding these agreements takes very specific \nexpertise.\n\n[[Page S2230]]\n\n  Even though these trade agreements differ widely in scope and in \ncontent, they have one feature in common. Their aim is opening markets \nfor American exports. Who is in the best position to monitor whether or \nnot they achieve that purpose? I submit, Mr. President, that the \ncompanies who are supposed to benefit from the agreements are in the \nbest position, along with their trade associations.\n  We have about 1,000 people from the private sector in the advisory \ncommittee system. They are all volunteers, working free of charge. They \ndo an excellent job on their first task, advising the government on the \nnegotiating end of trade policy. We should get them working on their \nsecond task, monitoring existing trade agreements. And they should do \ntheir monitoring out in the open.\n  Every new trade agreement should be assigned to at least one advisory \ncommittee. That committee should be responsible for monitoring \ncompliance with the agreement. That committee should report regularly \non implementation. It should recommend specific action when it finds \nexamples of non-compliance. Complicated agreements, such as NAFTA and \nthe Uruguay Round, should be parceled out among several committees.\n  Prospective members of trade advisory committees should all meet the \nfollowing test: do they represent an organization willing and able to \nhelp monitor compliance with trade agreements? Only those who answer \nyes should be put on a committee.\n  Mr. President, let me turn now to the second issue we should examine: \npublic participation.\n  I come from a state with a strong tradition of open government. A \nMontanan has the right to attend any meeting that a State official \nholds. No exceptions. The federal government has a tradition of \nopenness too, especially with respect to advisory committees. Congress \nmade openness a statutory requirement with the Federal Advisory \nCommittee Act (FACA) of 1972. When we passed the Trade Act, we \nspecified openness by requiring that all of these trade advisory \ncommittees follow FACA procedures.\n  We left one exception. Meetings could be closed to the public if they \ncovered matters which would seriously compromise U.S. Government trade \nnegotiations. That's a quote from the law. ``Seriously compromise.'' \nAnd only with respect to ongoing active negotiations.\n  Today there aren't many active trade negotiations underway. So there \nis not much to be seriously compromised. Nevertheless, too many \nadvisory committees are still closed to interested observers. That's \nunacceptable. It's illogical. It's illegal.\n  What are the advisory committees talking about in these meetings? \nI've heard from people who attend them that almost all of the \ninformation discussed is pretty straightforward. Nothing very secret.\n  People who are barred from the meetings don't know that. They begin \nto suspect that something's going on in those rooms. Maybe somebody is \ntrying to hide something from them. Closing off these meetings just \nfeeds that feeling of mistrust. It's bad government.\n  In the past, the Administration used to close all ISAC and IFAC \nmeetings, until they lost a 1996 court challenge. It was a blanket \nclosure policy. In arguing this case before the court, the Trade \nRepresentative's office said that Congress agreed with the blanket \nclosure policy, because we never did anything about it.\n  Let's do something about it. The Constitution gives Congress, not the \nExecutive Branch, authority over international trade. I intend to \nintroduce legislation designed to clear up any confusion about what \nCongress expects with regard to public participation in ISAC's and \nIFAC's.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I have found one other feature of advisory \ncommittee that we should change. There is a ``consensus'' mentality. \nSome committees feel that they can only give advice if they reach a \nconsensus. They say that this is why committees can't have members who \ncome at issues in different ways. They'll never get consensus. I see \nnothing wrong with committees sending forward recommendations along \nwith minority viewpoints. We're a democracy. We do this all the time.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and with the \ntrade agencies of the Executive Branch to get the advisory committee \nsystem back on track.\n  Mr. President, I have written to Secretary Daley and Ambassador \nBarshefsky outlining my thoughts on this issue. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         United States Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2000.\n     Hon. William M. Daley,\n     Secretary of Commerce, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Charlene Barshefsky,\n     U.S. Trade Representative, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Daley and Ambassador Barshefsky: Your recent \n     initiative to take a close look at the trade advisory process \n     is right on target. As you know, I am concerned by the \n     resignations by prominent labor leaders and environmentalists \n     from TEPAC and ACTPN, and by the Administration's appeal of \n     the court ruling on NGO participation in ISAC's. It is time \n     to re-examine the process, balancing sometimes conflicting \n     goals.\n       For example, we seek influential leaders on ACTPN and TEPAC \n     who understand trade policy. It is not always easy to find \n     both qualities in one person. As a result, the ability of \n     ACTPN and TEPAC members to contribute to trade policy \n     formulation varies widely.\n       The desire for the ISAC's and IFAC's to foster consensus \n     recommendations leads to excluding certain interested \n     parties. I have heard from business groups and NGO's on this \n     point. Morever, because the advisory process can be rigid and \n     slow, it is tempting to circumvent the ISAC's or IFAC's, and \n     instead use informal groups of trade advisors.\n       Let me offer a few ideas for improving the process.\n       We should give the advisory committees a more active role \n     in monitoring implementation of existing agreements. Their \n     charters include this function, but we don't emphasize \n     compliance monitoring. We should strengthen this function. \n     The private sector can help fill the information gaps which \n     the GAO identified in its recent report on trade agreement \n     compliance.\n       In addition, we should reexamine committee operating rules, \n     such as procedures for choosing members and the role of the \n     designated federal official. This may entail streamlining the \n     system by reducing the number of standing committees. \n     Finally, we have to clarify the relationship between the 1974 \n     Trade Act and the Federal Advisory Committee Act.\n       This 26 year-old system is ready for some fresh eyes and \n     for a legislative remedy. I look forward to working with you \n     to improve the process.\n           Sincerely,\n     Max Baucus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/05/senate-section/article/S2230-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Gil Hodges \non his 25 year career in Major League Baseball. Gil Hodges served 18 \nyears as a major league player and 7 years as a manager, during which \nhe distinguished himself through exceptional performance, success, \nprofessionalism and personal achievement.\n  At the conclusion of his playing career in 1962, Gil Hodges was the \nleading\n\n[[Page S2231]]\n\nright handed home run hitter in National League history; hitting 20 or \nmore home runs in 11 seasons, surpassing the 30 home run mark four \ntimes and the 40 mark twice. For the 11-year period between 1949 and \n1959, he averaged more than 30 home runs and 100 RBIs per season. Those \nare some impressive statistics. A vital part of both the Brooklyn \nDodgers and New York Mets franchises, Gil appeared in 8 World Series, \nwinning 1 as a player and 1 as a manager. During his tenure, Gil Hodges \nled the 1969 Miracle Mets to one of the most memorable and remarkable \nWorld Championships in the history of baseball, bringing pride to Mets \nfans all across the city.\n  Beyond being a great major leaguer, Gil Hodges was a great \nhumanitarian. He played a major role in the success and acceptance of \nhis teammate, Jackie Robinson. Jackie's eventual success was \nfacilitated by the leadership and courage of Gil Hodges. A life long \nNew Yorker, his memory lives on in the minds of the many Dodgers and \nMets fans that got to witness his greatness. His number 14 has been \nretired by the Mets assuring that his legacy will be preserved for \ngenerations. In closing, I would like to say that Gil Hodges was a \ngreat baseball player, a great manager, and more importantly a great \nman. He was a hero to many and I am taking this time to pay tribute to \nhis legacy.

FILIPPO MILONE\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nFilippo Milone, a well-known community leader who was recently given \nthe Republican Congressional Committee's Businessman of the Year Award. \nFilippo runs the highly successful and well regarded Pillars restaurant \nin Mobile, Alabama which serves some of the best cuisine not only in \nthe state, but in the entire country. This award is truly a testament \nto Filippo's reputation in the Mobile business community and to the \nhigh esteem in which he is held by his peers. I want to congratulate \nFilippo and his wife of 27 years, Geltrude, and offer my thanks for \ntheir dedication to the city of Mobile.\n  Born in Italy in 1938, Filippo came to the United States after \nfulfilling his duties in the Italian military. After traveling to \nvarious parts of the country, Filippo chose to settle in the Mobile \narea to establish a business and raise a family. Calling upon his \nextensive culinary training, Filippo opened the Pillars restaurant in \n1975 with the idea of creating a unique dining experience for \ncustomers. Today, the Pillars restaurant continues to thrive. Filippo \nhas 40 employees and enjoys the satisfaction that comes with creating \nopportunities for others. He is active in the community as a member of \nmany local organizations, including the Restaurant Association, the \nChef's Association, and Lion's Club. Indeed, Filippo's many activities \ntruly entitle him to the recognition that comes with being named a \nBusinessman of the Year.\n  Again, I would like to congratulate Filippo and his entire family on \nthis award. I have had the pleasure of eating at the Pillars Restaurant \non numerous occasions and can honestly say I have never been \ndisappointed. Both the service and food are always first class, and \nbeing in the company of someone with such a deep sense of community is \nalways a pleasure.

Mr. President, just a few days ago Arkansas lost \none of its boldest opinion leaders and most respected modern \njournalists, John Robert Starr. I rise today to pay tribute to his \ncareer and to offer my sympathies to his family, friends and \ncolleagues.\n  A journalist of the ``old-school,'' John Robert Starr was dedicated \nto the tradition of his craft even in this day and age of on-line \npapers and 24-hour news channels. He loved his work and once said of \njournalism: ``This is the place to be--reporting, covering the day-to-\nday business. This is where I would like to be. This is where everybody \nought to be.''\n  Ultimately, Mr. Starr would have a dramatic impact on journalism in \nArkansas. But he got his start on the college newspaper at \nSouthwestern, now Rhodes College in Memphis. After college, Starr \ncombined two of his loves, sports and journalism, to join the sports \nstaff at the Memphis Commercial Appeal. He later moved to the \nAssociated Press in Little Rock as the sports editor but soon shifted \ninto the arena of political coverage.\n  Throughout his 19-year career at the AP, including as Little Rock \nbureau chief, Starr covered such infamous political characters as \nGovernor Orval Faubus, as well as various political candidates. After a \nlengthy and successful stint, he then left the AP to teach journalism \nat the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Starr didn't last long on \nthe academic side of things after being recruited to run an afternoon \npaper, the Arkansas Democrat. The Democrat was headed into battle with \na more widely-read morning paper, the Arkansas Gazette, which was the \noldest newspaper west of the Mississippi.\n  As they say, the rest is history. John Robert Starr led the Democrat \nthrough a raucous, public battle against the Gazette for readership and \npower. He became known through a must-read daily column for his sharp \nwit and engaging writing. Ultimately, the Democrat took the Gazette \nhead on with hard news coverage and even harder-hitting opinions. It \nwon, taking over the Gazette in 1991 under the masthead of one combined \ndaily paper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. It has been said that, \ndespite his hand in shutting the Gazette down, Starr mourned the loss \nof the competition and lamented the passing of a major journalistic \ninstitution.\n  After the takeover, Starr stayed at the helm of the Democrat-Gazette \nas managing editor for just under a year, but stayed on to write his \nmuch-beloved daily column until the late 1990's when he cut back to \nthree columns per week. During these years, Starr took on every topic \nfrom politics to travel, from professional basketball to Razorback \nfootball's recent stadium controversy. He always had an opinion and \nexpressed it like no one else could. While his career was not without \ncontroversy, his opinions were always received with respect.\n  John Robert Starr also devoted much time to his wife of 51 years, the \nformer Norma Jeanette Wilson of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, and their family. \nThey traveled extensively over the years and their adventures provided \nmaterial for many touching columns. Starr is survived by two sons, a \ndaughter, and nine grandchildren, whom he loved dearly.\n  Journalism in my home state is forever influenced by the life and \ncareer of John Robert Starr. He was a dedicated Arkansan, with a \npassionate commitment to our state and its communities. With his \npassing, thousands of Arkansans will find something missing as they \npick up their morning papers for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/05/senate-section/article/S2231-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE KOSCIUSZKO FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to permit \nretired members of the Armed Forces who have a service-connected \ndisability to receive military retired pay concurrently with veterans' \ndisability compensation; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n armed forces concurrent retirement and disability payment act of 2000\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation \nalong with my esteemed colleague Senator Inouye that will correct an \ninequity for veterans who have retired from our Armed Forces with a \nservice-connected disability.\n  Our legislation will permit retired members of the Armed Forces who \nhave a service connected disability to receive military retired pay \nconcurrently with veterans' disability compensation.\n  Mr. President, disabled military retirees are only entitled to \nreceive disability compensation if they agree to wave a portion of \ntheir retired pay equal to the amount of compensation. This requirement \ndiscriminates unfairly against disabled career soldiers by requiring \nthem to essentially pay their own disability compensation.\n  Military retirement pay and disability compensation were earned and \nawarded for entirely different purposes. Current law ignores the \ndistinction between these two entitlements. Members of our Armed Forces \nhave dedicated 20 or more years to our country's defense earning their \nretirement for service. Whereas disability compensation is awarded to a \nveteran for injury incurred in the line of duty.\n  It is inequitable and unfair for our veterans not to receive both of \nthese payments concurrently. We have an opportunity to show our \ngratitude to these remarkable men and women who have sacrificed so much \nfor this great country of ours. I hope the Senate will seriously \nconsider passing this legislation, to end at last, this disservice to \nour retired military men and women.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents an honest attempt to \ncorrect an injustice that has existed for far too long. Allowing \ndisabled veterans to receive military retired pay and veterans \ndisability compensation concurrently will restore fairness to Federal \nretirement policy.\n  This legislation is supported by veterans service organizations, \nincluding the Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, and \nParalyzed Veterans of America. This is simply the right thing to do. \nOur veterans have earned this and now it is our chance to honor their \nservice to our nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Armed Forces Concurrent \nRetirement Disability Payment Act of 2000 and attached documents be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2357\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

We consider ourselves an \n     important voice of reason and logic when issues of substance \n     arise regarding legislation and health care. In the tradition \n     of excellence that we acquired during our active military \n     training we continue to strive to maintain the same in \n     promoting quality of life post disability.\n       As President of Nevada Paralyzed Veterans of America \n     (Nevada PVA), I would like to offer my support of your \n     legislation to permit the concurrent receipt of service-\n     connected disability compensation and retirement pay, without \n     deductions. Nevada PVA has consistently supported legislation \n     that would attempt to remedy the unjust disparity in benefits \n     for the men and women who have served in our Armed Services.\n       While Nevada PVA supports these measures, as we have in the \n     past, we must be assured that the other benefits currently \n     being received by veterans are in no way compromised or \n     reduced. VA has just recently begun getting the funding it \n     needs to avoid the devastating effects of past flat-lined \n     budgets.

I have always felt this practice was not fair to \n     our retired veterans. They are in fact funding their own \n     disability compensation.\n       Commander Joe McDonnell and I, First Vice Commander of the \n     American Legion Department of Nevada, support this bill.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto the operation by the National Institutes of Health of an \nexperimental program to stimulate competitive research; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n        NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH EPSCoR PROGRAM ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the National \nInstitutes of Health EPSCoR Program Act of 2000 with my colleague, \nSenator Landrieu of Louisiana. This legislation we are introducing \ntoday, when passed, stands to make a major impact on the scope of \nbiomedical research done in America today.\n  Small and medium sized states, like ours, have been unfairly \ndiscriminated\n\n[[Page S2235]]\n\nagainst in their competition for federal research dollars. In 1978, \nCongress created the EPSCoR program (Experimental Program to Stimulate \nCompetitive Research), to make sure that all states would have the \nopportunity to compete for scientific research funds. Despite this \nintention, the EPSCoR program only served to exacerbate the exiting \nfunding disparity. You may ask, how can this be so? The answer is \nreally quite simple.\n  The EPSCoR program does not extend to one of the biggest sources of \nscientific research--the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We are \nall aware, the NIH budget is growing rapidly; NIH's FY 2000 budget is \n$17.9 billion--up 8.43 percent in the past 5 years. Yet, despite this \ntremendous boom, 24 states receive 93 percent of NIH research grants, \nwhile the other 26 states split the remaining 7 percent.\n  Although the NIH budget has resulted in great scientific gains, the \nresearch divide continues. One-half of the states have seen little \nbenefit in the recent NIH increase. The time has come to correct this \nallocation program, but in a way that insures we have the best \nbiomedical research in the world, and that those benefits are extended \nto the entire country. Research institutes provide a great opportunity \nto improve the health care delivery and quality in their home state, \nbut only limited opportunity exists in half the states, because of the \nexisting funding divide.\n  The legislation we are introducing will provide $200 million to NIH-\nEPSCoR states will enable states that currently receive historically \nlow amounts of NIH grants to participate in two special funds.\n  The first fund is to finance new infrastructure needs in these \nstates. Because of their continued lack of equitable funding, many \nEPSCoR states have fallen behind in their infrastructure needs and are \nunable to compete against non-EPSCoR states. Our legislation will \nallocate $3.5 million each year to every NIH-EPSCoR state, to be used \nfor projects the state EPSCoR committee targets as meeting the state \nbiomedical research committees' goals. Because the state is responsible \nfor choosing its infrastructure needs, we may finally be able to get \naway from the yearly requests for special projects in our states and \nallow federal funds to be spent in the most efficient manner possible.\n  The second fund is dedicated toward research in the new NIH-EPSCoR. \nThis research is for meritorious projects, co-funded by the NIH-EPSCoR \nfund and the NIH Institute or Center. These projects must meet existing \nNIH standards or merit and quality, but will not have to compete \nagainst proposals from the non-EPSCoR states, which already dominate \nthe grant process.\n  Finally, this process will be self sustaining. Because research is \ntypically less expensive to perform in NIH-EPSCoR states, the savings \nin administrative costs are recaptured to fund additional research. In \nFY 1999 we estimate these savings would have added up to $49 million, \nwhich would have flowed back to NIH-EPSCoR states for additional \nresearch projects.\n  In recent years, we have made great strides in biomedical research, \nhowever, that research has been limited to only a select few. I ask you \nto join us in resolving this discrepancy and restore equity to the NIH \nprocess and would invite my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 2360. A bill to amend the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to provide for a \nlimitation on sharing of behavioral profiling information, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n             freedom from behavioral profiling act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Freedom \nfrom Behavioral Profiling Act of 2000.'' This legislation would \ndisallow financial institutions from buying and selling an individual's \nmost personal and detailed buying habits without proper notification \nand without his or her permission. Put another way, financial \ninstitutions would only be allowed to buy, sell or otherwise share an \nindividual's behavioral profile if the institution has disclosed to the \nconsumer that such information may be shared and the institution has \nreceived the consumer's affirmative consent to do so.\n  Technology exists today that allows financial institutions to monitor \nand collect your personal buying and spending habits. According to the \nApril 3 issue of Business Week magazine, Visa International is ``using \nneural networks to build up elaborate behavioral profiles. Over months, \nthese systems . . . track a person's behavior online and off, then \nmatch it against models of similar personality and behavior types . . \n.''\n  What this means is that financial institutions have the ability to \nfollow you to the grocery store to track your purchases--whether you \nare abiding by your doctors recommended diet--and then to the drug \nstore to see what kind of drugs you are purchasing. The institution can \nalso track where you go throughout the day and into the evening, and \nexactly what time you were there.\n  Business Week also reported that such ``far-flung threads'' as your \n``taste in paperbacks, political discussion groups'' and clothing are \nbeing ``sewn into online profiles where they are increasingly \nintertwined with your data on health, your education loans and your \ncredit history.'' What does this information have to do with getting a \nmortgage? More importantly, are these institutions sharing these \nbehavioral profiles? Given the track record of some of the blue chip \nfirms like Chase Manhattan Bank and U.S. Bancorp, I believe the risk is \ntoo great to assume otherwise.\n  Even more important, what happens when these behavioral profiles get \ninto the wrong hands? That rarely happens you say. Guess again. A \nRussian teenager using the name ``Maxus'' stole 350,000 credit card \nnumbers from CD Universe's Web site last December. He then told CD \nUniverse that he would post the numbers on the Internet unless they \npaid him $100,000. When they refused to pay him he posted the credit \ncards numbers and thousands of visitors downloaded more than 25,000 \naccount numbers between December 25 and January 7.\n  A similar case happened on March 24 of this year when two teens in a \nsmall Welsh village hacked into computers of several online merchants \nmaking off with more than 26,000 credit card numbers. The FBI says \nlosses connected to the thefts could exceed $3 million.\n  Mr. President, if teenagers from around the world are gaining access \nto account numbers, there is no question they can steal data banks of \nbehavioral profiles. In fact, they are. A front page article in the New \nYork Times dated April 3, 2000, reports that ``Law enforcement \nauthorities are becoming increasingly worried about a sudden, sharp \nrise in the incidence of identity theft, the outright pilfering of \npeople's personal information and, with that information in hand, \nthieves can acquire credit, make purchases and even secure residences \nin someone else's name.''\n  Mr. President, an important point here is that potential criminals do \nnot even have to steal the information. Due to the significant \nloopholes in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act passed last year, an \nindividual's behavioral profile could legally be passed along without \nthe affirmative consent of that individual. The unchecked growth of \ndata banks and the business of profiling unquestionably facilitates \nidentity theft.\n  Some may suggest that there is no harm in behavioral profiling. I \ndisagree. Despite the fact that consumers are ``shielded'' in \nfraudulent cases, subject to only $50 maximum liability, the burden is \non credit card owners to prove the fraudulent charges are not their \nown. If the fraudulent charge is not found immediately, continued \npurchases or applications for more cards by the criminal can wreak \nhavoc on an individual's credit rating. In fact, one witness recently \ntestified before the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and \nGovernment Information that she spent over 400 hours trying to clear \nher name and restore her good credit.\n  In ``card-not-present'' transactions, that is orders by mail, \ntelephone or Internet where no signature is required, merchants are \nforced to cover the loss. Thus, identity theft and fraudulent purchases \nalso take a toll on the small business man. Reports suggest that one \nout of every ten online purchases is fraudulent. My colleagues know \nthat small businesses do not have the margins to eat the charge on one \nout of every 10 purchases.\n\n[[Page S2236]]\n\n  Mr. President, the American people are only now becoming aware of the \nbehavioral profiling practices of the industry. The more they find out, \nthe more they do not like it. That is why I am offering this \nlegislation . . . to give the consumer the ability to control his or \nher most personal behavioral profile. Where they go, who they see, what \nthey buy and when they do it--all of these are personal decisions that \nthe majority of Americans do not want monitored and recorded under the \nwatchful eye of corporate America.\n  Mr. President, colleagues in the Senate, I hope you will join me in \nan effort to give the people what they want--the ability to control the \nindiscriminate sharing of their own personal, and private, consumption \nhabits.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Inhofe, and Ms. \n        Landrieu):\n  S. 2362. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to direct the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to consider risk \nassessments and cost-benefit analyses as part of the process of \nestablishing a new or revised air quality standard; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n              AIR QUALITY STANDARD IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today with my \ndistinguished colleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux, to introduce a \nbill that will provide a commonsense approach to promulgating \nregulations under the Clean Air Act. We are pleased that Senators \nInhofe and Landrieu have joined us as original cosponsors. We introduce \nthis bill today in a bipartisan manner to increase public health, \nsafety and environmental protection.\n  As a father and grandfather, I understand the importance of ensuring \na clean environment for our future generations. Throughout my 33 years \nof public service, I have demonstrated a commitment to preserving our \nenvironment and the health and well-being of all Ohioans. I sponsored \nlegislation to create the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency when I \nserved in the state legislature, and I fought to end oil and gas \ndrilling in the Lake Erie bed. As Governor, I increased funding for \nenvironmental protection by over 60 percent. While in the Ohio House of \nRepresentatives, I was responsible for creating the Environment and \nNatural Resources Committee and was honored to serve as the first vice \nchairman of that committee.\n  In addition, the state of Ohio has made significant improvements in \nair quality in recent years. When I first entered office as Governor in \n1991, most of Ohio's urban areas were not attaining the 1-hour ozone \nstandard. By the time I left, all but one city was in attainment. \nHowever, the Cincinnati community has worked together, through a \nvariety of programs, to attain the 1-hour standard and is now awaiting \nfinal action by the EPA to redesignate it as in attainment.\n  Overall, the ozone pollution level in Ohio has gone down by 25%, and \nin many urban areas, it has gone down by more than 50% in the past 20 \nyears. Ohio is doing its part to provide cleaner air. Nevertheless, \nover the years, I have become more and more concerned that just in \norder to comply with federal laws and regulations, our citizens, \nbusinesses and state and local governments must pay costs that can be \ninordinately burdensome or totally unnecessary.\n  In the 104th Congress, I worked closely with a coalition of state and \nlocal government officials and members of the House and Senate to pass \neffective safe drinking water reforms. The results of our efforts \nculminated in the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments, legislation which \nwas enacted with broad bipartisan support in 1996. In addition, the \nbill had the support of environmental organizations, and I was pleased \nto attend the President's bill-signing ceremony when these reforms were \nsigned into law. In fact, at that time the President praised the \nbipartisan work and said, ``Today we helped ensure that every family in \nAmerica will have safe, clean drinking water to drink every time they \nturn on a faucet or stop at a public water fountain. From now on our \nwater will be safer and our country will be healthier for it.''\n  This cooperative effort is notable because it showed that a law could \ninclude commonsense reforms that make the government more accountable \nbased on public awareness of risks, costs and benefits. I believe it \nset a key precedent for reform of other environmental regulations.\n  I specifically mention the drinking water program because it is the \nmodel for the bill we are introducing today. This bill includes the \nvery same risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis provisions that \ngovern our drinking water. This bill clarifies EPA's obligation to \nidentify risks, consider costs and benefits of a proposed rule and \nconsider incremental costs and benefits of alternative air quality \nstandards. However, EPA would retain flexibility in making final \nregulatory decisions.\n  If we can agree these tools improve rulemakings for something as \nimportant as the water we drink, where a regulatory mistake could \nendanger millions of lives, they certainly must be good enough to \nprotect the air that we breathe.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, I became more and more concerned that \nthe EPA was not taking into consideration sound science, costs and \nbenefits during the rulemaking process. I was particularly concerned \nabout the standards for ozone and particulate matter. In fact, I was \nvery concerned that the costs to this country to implement the new \nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ozone and \nparticulate matter far outweighed the benefits to public health and the \nenvironment.\n  In fact, according to EPA's own estimates, the costs for implementing \nthe NAAQS standard for ozone exceeded the benefits. The President's own \nCouncil of Economic Advisors predicted that the benefits would be \nsmall, while the costs of reaching full attainment could total $60 \nbillion.\n  Just last spring, a U.S. appeals court remanded EPA's ozone and \nPM2.5 standards, ruling that EPA did not justify its \ndecision with sound scientific evidence. Ohio was a party to this \nlawsuit, which began when I was Governor. The court didn't say that EPA \ncouldn't regulate at these levels, but that EPA didn't give sufficient \njustification for doing so.\n  That has been my point all along. I have argued that the NAAQS \nstandards were going to be costly and that we didn't even know if \nmaking those investments was going to make a difference. I believe this \nbill would help us avoid some of the legal and legislative wrangling \nthat has occurred in the past few years with respect to how we achieve \nclean air.\n  Federal agencies should not force businesses and consumers to throw \nbillions of dollars at a problem without knowing if they're hitting the \nright target. Yet, the EPA is asking all of America to pay for these \nnew regulations simply because the EPA said it is the right thing to do \nand that it has the authority to do so. However, they have failed to \nadequately determine the effects of changing the ozone and particulate \nmatter standards.\n  The challenge facing public officials today is determining how best \nto protect the health of our citizens and our environment with limited \nresources. We need to do a much better job of ensuring that \nregulations' costs bear a reasonable relationship with their benefits, \nand we need to do a better job of setting priorities and spending our \nresources wisely.\n  I believe the bill we introduce today will help achieve these goals \nin air regulations. First, I believe this bill will increase the \npublic's knowledge of how and why the EPA makes air regulations. In \nessence, this bill asks EPA to answer several simple, but vital \nquestions:\n  What science is needed to help us make good decisions?\n  What is the nature of the risk being considered?\n  What are the benefits of the proposed regulation?\n  How much will it cost?\n  And, are there better, less burdensome ways to achieve the same \ngoals?\n  It will also improve the quality of government decision-making by \nallowing the EPA to set priorities and focus on the worst risks first. \nCareful thought, reasonable assumptions, peer review and sound science \nwill help target problems and find better solutions.\n  Mr. President, Executive Order 12866 already requires agencies to \nconduct risk assessment and cost benefit analysis. What this bill will \ndo is clarify\n\n[[Page S2237]]\n\nthat EPA must conduct risk assessment and cost benefit analysis. This \nbill does not mandate outcomes. In fact, it does nothing to \ncircumscribe the EPA Administrator's ability to propose and implement \nregulations to protect public health. Quite simply, it imposes \ncommonsense discipline and accountability in the rulemaking process by \nconfirming that EPA has the flexibility to take risks and costs into \nconsideration when setting standards that are going to affect public \nhealth or the environment.\n  I want to make very clear that this bill does not mandate how EPA \nsets standards. The Administrator will have discretion to set \nappropriate standards to protect human health. EPA would be required to \nconduct an analysis of incremental costs and benefits of alternative \nstandards, but would have the flexibility to choose between a standard \nwhere the benefits justify its cost or, when health considerations \ndictate, the maximum feasible standard.\n  In addition, this bill does not keep information about air quality \nfrom the public. To the contrary, this bill is a public right-to-know \nbill that requires EPA to tell the public what information it \nconsidered before making a final decision.\n  Nor does the bill ``gut'' the Clean Air Act, as some contend. In \nfact, it strengthens it by asking EPA to tell the public what the risks \nare that warrant regulation and what options are available to most \nefficiently and effectively reduce those risks. This bill will ensure \nthat the Agency sets priorities and it makes sure that our limited \nresources are being spent to address the real risks to public health \nand the environment. While many air regulations set by EPA are well \nintended, we want to ensure that these regulations are going to achieve \ntheir purpose and not unnecessarily pass significant burdens onto our \ncitizens and state and local governments.\n  I strongly believe our challenge is to determine how best to meet our \nobligation of protecting the environment and health of our citizens \nwith the limited financial resources we have available and with the \nscientific evidence to back up our actions. It should not be the \ngovernment's policy to initiate or enact regulations simply because it \nsounds like a good idea.

A bill to subject the United States to imposition of fees \nand costs in proceedings relating to State water rights adjudications; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              water adjudication fee fairness act of 2000\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Water \nAdjudication Fee Fairness Act of 2000. This bill would require the \nfederal government to pay the same filing fees and costs associated \nwith state water rights' adjudications as is currently required of \nstates and private parties.\n  To establish relative rights to water--water that is the lifeblood of \nmany states, particularly in the west--states must conduct lengthy, \ncomplicated, and expensive proceedings in water rights' adjudications. \nIn 1952, Congress recognized the necessity and benefit of requiring \nfederal claims to be adjudicated in these state proceedings by adopting \nthe McCarran Amendment. The McCarran Amendment waives the sovereign \nimmunity of the United States and requires the federal government to \nsubmit to state court jurisdiction and to file water rights' claims in \nstate general adjudication proceedings.\n  These federal claims are typically among the most complicated and \nlargest of claims in state adjudications, and federal agencies are \noften the primary beneficiary of adjudication proceedings where states \nofficially quantify and record their water rights. However, in 1992, \nthe United States' Supreme Court held that, under existing law, the \nU.S. need not pay fees for processing federal claims.\n  When the United States does not pay a proportionate share of the \ncosts associated with adjudications, the burden of funding the \nproceedings unfairly shifts to other water users and often delays \ncompletion of the adjudications by diminishing the resources necessary \nto complete them. Delays in completing adjudications result in the \ninability to protect private and public property interests or determine \nhow much unappropriated water may remain to satisfy important \nenvironmental and economic development priorities.\n  Additionally, because they are not subject to fees and costs like \nother water users in the adjudication, federal agencies can file \nquestionable claims without facing court costs, inflating the number of \ntheir claims for future negotiation purposes. This creates an unlevel \nplaying field favoring the federal agencies and places a further \nfinancial and resources burden on the system.\n  For example, in the Snake River Basin Adjudication, which is in Idaho \nand is probably the largest water adjudication proceeding in the \ncountry, the United States Forest Service filed more than 3,700 federal \nclaims. The Idaho Department of Water Resources expended thousands of \ndollars giving notice to all other claimants. Additionally the State of \nIdaho and private claimants spent over $800,000 preparing objections to \nthe Forest Service's claims. On the eve of the objective deadline, the \nU.S. withdrew all but 71 of the claims--the Department of Justices' \nexplanation: litigation strategy.\n\n  This example is not an isolated incident. At best, the taxpayers and \nstates should not be forced to incur these costs simply because the \nagency does not take the time to seriously evaluate its claims. At \nworst, the taxpayers should not bear the brunt of the federal \ngovernment's Machiavellian tactics.\n  I recognize that the federal government has a legitimate right to \nsome reserved water rights; however, the federal government should play \nby the same rules as the states and other private users. The Water \nAdjudication Fee Fairness Act is legislation that remedies this \nsituation by subjecting the\n\n[[Page S2239]]\n\nUnited States, when party to a general adjudication, to the same fees \nand costs as state and private users in water rights adjudications.\n  This measure has the full support of the Western States Water Council \nand the Western Governor's Association. I ask my colleagues to join me \nin supporting water users, taxpayers, the states, and welcome their co-\nsponsorship.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2363\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Water Adjudication Fee \n     Fairness Act of 2000''.\n\n      SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Generally, water allocation in the western United \n     States is based upon the doctrine of prior appropriation, \n     under which water users' rights are quantified under State \n     law. Appropriative rights carry designated priority dates \n     that establish the relative right of priority to use water \n     from a source. Most States in the West have developed \n     judicial and administrative proceedings, often called general \n     adjudications, to quantify and document these relative \n     rights, including the rights to water claimed by the United \n     States Government under either State or Federal law.\n       (2) State general adjudications are typically complicated, \n     expensive civil court and administrative actions that can \n     involve hundreds or even thousands of claimants. Such \n     adjudications give certainty to water rights, provide \n     direction for water administration, and reduce conflict over \n     water allocation and water usage. Those claiming and \n     establishing rights to water are the primary beneficiaries of \n     State general adjudication proceedings.\n       (3) The Congress has recognized the benefits of the State \n     general adjudication system, and by enactment of section 208 \n     of the Department of Justice Appropriation Act, 1953 (43 \n     U.S.C. 666; popularly known as the ``McCarran Amendment''), \n     required the United States to submit to State court \n     jurisdiction and to file claims in State general adjudication \n     proceedings.\n       (4) Water rights claims by Federal agencies under either \n     State or Federal law are often the largest or most complex \n     claims in State general adjudications. However, the United \n     States Supreme Court, in the case United States v. Idaho, 508 \n     U.S. 1 (1992), determined that the McCarran Amendment does \n     not require the United States to pay some filing fees simply \n     because they were misconstrued or perceived to be the same as \n     costs taxed against all parties.\n       (5) Since Federal agency water rights claims are among the \n     most difficult to adjudicate, and since the United States is \n     not required to pay some fees and costs paid by non-Federal \n     claimants, the burden of funding adjudication proceedings \n     unfairly shifts to private water users and State taxpayers.\n       (6) The lack of Federal Government funding to support State \n     water rights adjudications in relation to the complexity of \n     the claims involved has produced significant delays in \n     completion of many State general adjudications. These delays \n     inhibit the ability of both the States and Federal agencies \n     to protect private and public property interests. Also, \n     failure to complete the final adjudication of claims to water \n     restricts the ability of resource managers to determine how \n     much unappropriated water is available to satisfy \n     environmental and economic development demands.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to require Social \nSecurity Administration publications to highlight critical information \nrelating to the future financing shortfalls of the social security \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   SOCIAL SECURITY RIGHT TO KNOW ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague, Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, in introducing the \nSocial Security Right to Know Act of 2000.\n  This legislation is aimed at providing the American people with \naccurate and up-to-date information about the current and future \nfinancial operations of the Social Security program, so that they may \nbe in a better position to understand the choices involved in putting \nour most vital social program on sound financial footing for the long \nterm.\n  I would like to commend the Senator from New Hampshire for his \ninstrumental role in promoting a similar proposal in the form of an \namendment to the Social Security earnings test repeal legislation that \nthis body recently considered and passed. Unfortunately, we did not \ntake advantage of Senator Gregg's tireless efforts to reach across \nparty lines to incorporate improved reporting to the public about the \nSocial Security program as part of the earnings test repeal. This \nlegislation is a complement to Senator Gregg's prior efforts, and I am \npleased to be offering this legislation here today with his support.\n  As Congress continues to consider options to preserve and strengthen \nour Social Security system, it is increasingly important that Americans \nhave access to certain salient information with respect to Social \nSecurity's current and future financial picture.\n  Why is this so important? As all of my colleagues will recall, in his \nState of the Union Address to Congress on January 27, 1998, President \nClinton declared that it was time for the nation to begin a dialogue on \nthe ``necessary measures to strengthen the Social Security system for \nthe twenty-first century.'' He went on to say that the American people \nshould be invited to join in this discussion, facing these issues \nsquarely, and forming a true consensus on how we should proceed. In his \naddress, the president announced a series of public policy forums to be \nheld around the country, and also called for a White House Conference \non Social Security to be held in December, 1998. The president \nindicated that early in 1999 he would convene the leaders of Congress \nto craft historic legislation that would re-create ``a Social Security \nsystem that is strong in the twenty-first century.''\n  I know that there was bipartisan support here in the Senate and in \nthe House of Representatives for President Clinton's calling to make \nlong-term Social Security reform our most important domestic policy \npriority. And two years ago I was optimistic about the prospects for \nenacting such historical legislation, particularly about the \nopportunity to engage the nation in an honest national discussion about \nthe need to reform Social Security, and exchange ideas as to how we \nmight best achieve this. But, as we all know, we held a national \ndialogue on Social Security, and the American people did participate in \nthe policy forums which came to pass, and yet here we are today with \nlittle progress toward a bipartisan consensus on sustainable Social \nSecurity reform.\n  I believe that this is so partly because of the fact that there is a \ntremendous amount of misinformation and lack of understanding among the \nAmerican public about Social Security's financing challenges, and this \nlack of understanding continues to harden popular resistance to long-\nterm Social Security solutions.\n  Case in point: last week, we saw the release of the 2000 Annual \nReport of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \nInsurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds, popularly referred to \nas the Social Security Trustees' Report. The Social Security \nAdministration relayed that this Report revealed that the Social \nSecurity program's long-range financial picture has improved since last \nyear. Specifically, the Board of Trustees announced\n\n[[Page S2240]]\n\nthat the Social Security Trust Fund assets will not be depleted until \n2037--three years later than reported in last year's report.\n\n  At first glance, this statistic might convey an air of reassurance to \nthe public, such to the point in some minds that if we can just \ncontinue to grow our economy at its current rate, we will obviate the \nneed for enacting fundamental reforms to Social Security. Or at least, \nsuch reporting of Social Security's finances might lead to the common \nconclusion that the program is perfectly fine for nearly 40 years.\n  This reliance on the paradigm of trust fund accounting is one of the \nmain reasons that we have not been able to achieve bipartisan consensus \non long-term Social Security reform. There is scarce mention in the \nTrustees' Report that the Social Security Trust Fund balances ``are \navailable to finance future benefit payments . . . only in a \nbookkeeping sense. They do not consist of real economic assets that can \nbe drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims \non the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by \nraising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits, or \nother expenditures. The existence of a large trust fund balance, \ntherefore, does not have any impact on the Government's ability to pay \nbenefits.''\n  Mr. President, if this description of the Trust Funds sounds \nfamiliar, it is because this is the exact wording contained in the \nAdministration's budget up until its most recent submission for Fiscal \nYear 2001. What this means, in other words, is that the trust funds are \nmerely claims on future government revenues, IOUs to be redeemed \nthrough higher taxation, lower spending on Social Security or other \ngovernment obligations, or a return to deficit financing.\n  I think that this is a rather important piece of information for the \nAmerican people to understand in assessing Social Security's future. \nBut it should not be buried in some multi-hundred page budget document \nor 223-page Social Security Trustees' Report. Maybe if we made this \ninformation more accessible and apparent, then we would have more \nconcern for the fact that Social Security's financing problems begin as \nsoon as 2015--when Social Security dedicated payroll tax receipts are \nno longer sufficient to pay benefits--and not in 2037. The Social \nSecurity Trustees last week revealed it will cost $11.3 trillion in new \nmoney between 2015 and 2037 to convert into cash benefits the IOUs held \nby the Social Security Trust Fund. But we have no actual resources \nnecessary to meet these benefit promises between 2015 to 2037.\n  Also not mentioned in the most recent Trustees' Report, Mr. \nPresident, is the fact that the system's unfunded obligations actually \ngrew from the 1999 Report's release by about $1 trillion in constant \n2000 dollars, according to analysis by the House Budget Committee. This \nis because the change in valuation period adds a new, expensive, \nunderfunded 75th year and drops a year when benefit costs are \nrelatively cheaper. This is a paradox of pay-as-you-go financing that \nis not known or understood by most of the public, and is rarely if ever \nreferenced in the media. To be sure, the unfunded obligations of the \nUnited States government are measured and accounted for in some obscure \nDepartment of Treasury publications, but this data should be at the \nfront and center of the Social Security reform discussion, in plain \nview for every American to access.\n  Another information gap which the Social Security Right to Know Act \nseeks to close relates to individual Social Security statements, \nformerly known as Personal and Earnings and Benefits Statements \n(PEBES). This document was conceived by our friend and \nvenerable colleague, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. In \n1989, Senator Moynihan persuaded Congress to adopt the requirement for \nthe Social Security Administration to provide this document as a way \n``to reassure Americans that Social Security will be there for them,'' \nand to help them adequately plan for retirement by indicating that \nSocial Security doesn't fully replace wages or salaries.\n\n  Though well intentioned, the current Social Security statement falls \nshort of its desired goal by glaringly omitting certain information \ncritical to understanding the system's serious future funding problems, \nand the related implications for individual and family retirement \nplanning. To be fair, the statements do make reference to such bland \nphrases as ``changed in the past,'' ``must do so again'' and ``we are \nworking to resolve.'' But the truth is that by 2037, the program will \ncollect sufficient revenues to pay only $0.72 for every dollar of \npromised benefits. Overall, Social Security's deficit that year will \ncome to more than $1 trillion in today's dollars. Again, this is \nimportant information that should be made abundantly clear in order for \nthe American public to assess Social Security's and their own financial \nfutures.\n  This is why this legislation is so important. For too long, the \nnature and scope of Social Security's financing problems have been \nshrouded by inconsistent and incomplete information, which has yielded \npublic confusion and has polarized the Social Security reform debate.\n  The Social Security Right to Know Act would improve the information \ncontained in current Social Security Administration publications, and \nthereby enable Americans to better plan for their own retirement and to \nunderstand the benefits and costs that the current Social Security \nsystem will produce.\n  This legislation will do several things to shed more light on what \nlies ahead for Social Security. First, it will expand the Personal and \nEarnings and Benefits Statements (PEBES), now called ``Social Security \nStatements,'' to include information about the projected date of the \nprogram's first financing deficits as estimated by the Social Security \nTrustees, and also the percentage of promised benefits that can be \nfunded under current law.\n  Second, it will require the Trustees' Report to include an estimate \nof Social Security's aggregate unfunded obligations--i.e., the \ndifference between the program's promised benefit outlays and its cash \nincome over the long-range 75-year evaluation period--and the change in \nsuch amount from the previous year's estimates.\n  Third, it calls on the Trustees to submit to Congress a separate \nsummary publication that highlights salient data pertaining to Social \nSecurity's financing, identifying the first year that Social Security \nis projected to run a cash deficit, as well as the size of projected \ndeficits.\n  Fourth, it will expand the PEBES or Social Security Statements and \nthe annual Social Security Trustees' Report to include an explanation \nof the role of the Social Security Trust Funds as debt owed by the \nfederal government, as opposed to an asset of the federal government.\n  Fifth, it will broaden the public accessibility of the economic \nmodeling employed by the Office of the Chief Actuary.\n  Our bill would introduce no new information that is not already \nacknowledged somewhere in past publications of the Social Security \nTrustees or in previous Presidential budget submissions. However, it is \nour view that the importance of this information is so great that it \nshould be displayed before every wage-earner and beneficiary of the \nSocial Security system, and not buried in documentation that is now \navailable only to policymakers.\n  Americans deserve ``straight talk''--clear and accessible \ninformation--about Social Security's long-term financing challenges in \norder that they might better understand the consequences of a rapidly \ngrowing aging population, and the reality of the choices before us. \nThis is just what the Social Security Right to Know Act is designed to \nprovide. And with these objectives in mind, this legislation is long \noverdue.\n  I presume that we are all in agreement that the federal government \nshould be telling Americans the full truth about Social Security. It is \nmy sincere hope that our colleagues will look at this legislation and \njoin us in building on Senator Gregg's prior efforts and other \nbipartisan ideas to make sure that Americans have as much information \nas possible in our national discussion on how best to save and \nstrengthen Social Security. The Social Security Right to Know Act is an \neffort to continue a process, based on the principle that ``knowledge \nis power,'' and I truly believe that the information that this \nlegislation is seeking to provide Americans in a clear and\n\n[[Page S2241]]\n\nconcise manner is essential for our moving forward toward sustainable \nsolutions to Social Security's funding problems. Though some of our \ncolleagues may have ideas and input as to how best to provide the \nAmerican public with a better understanding of Social Security's \nfuture--and I am open to working with my colleagues to improve this \nbill's specific provisions as we continue this process toward Social \nSecurity reform--it is my firm belief that with the intent and \nprinciples contained in this legislation, we as a nation will be in a \nbetter position to cease assessing Social Security's future in terms of \npreconceived, fixed notions, and take heed of the demographic and \neconomic realities which lie ahead.\n  Mr. President, I again thank Senator Gregg for working with me in \nthis effort, and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I would like to pay tribute to two of this \nChamber's leaders on this issue: The Honorable Daniel Patrick Moynihan \nof New York and The Honorable Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Both Senators \nMoynihan and Kerrey have been truly instrumental in advancing the cause \nof sustainable Social Security reform, and their presence and valued \ninput on this issue will be sorely missed in the next session of \nCongress. I applaud both of them for their leadership in seeking to \nbalance the interests and needs of younger and older Americans, and for \ntheir courage in working toward saving and strengthening Social \nSecurity in a manner that is fiscally responsible, actuarially sound \nand fair to all generations.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of \nthis legislation, and I thank Senator Santorum for his leadership in \ndrafting it.\n  My colleagues in the Senate may recall that last week, I prepared an \namendment to the earnings limit legislation that would have achieved \nmany of the same objectives that are outlined by the Senator from \nPennsylvania with respect to this bill. I believe that we have begun a \nprocess, an important dialogue involving many interested parties in \nboth the executive and legislative branches, and that the result of \nthis process will ultimately be improved information for the public and \nfor Congress regarding the state of the Social Security program, and \nthe benefits that it can finance.\n  I am pleased by the number of important individuals who have \nexpressed interest in this effort. I am especially gratified by the \ninterest of Senator Roth and of Congressman Archer, the two members of \nCongress with principal jurisdiction over the Social Security program. \nThey have each indicated that they are willing to explore these \ninformational issues via various means, and to lend their considerable \ninfluence to the effort.\n  I am further pleased that various individuals within the \nadministration have sought to work with us on our concerns, and to lay \na groundwork for improved reporting to the public regarding the Social \nSecurity program.\n  In that context, I would stress that we are not at the end of this \nprocess, and that we do not have universal agreement on the best way to \nproceed. I do not believe that either Senator Santorum or I would say \nthat the language in either this bill, or the one that I offered last \nweek, is perfect, and cannot be improved upon. Senator Santorum's \ndraft, like my original draft, would seek to include additional \ninformation in the annual Trustees' Reports. I do not know whether the \nTrustees' reports are necessarily the optimal place to report such \ninformation, and to the extent that individuals within the \nadministration may have views as to how and where this information is \nbest presented, I know that Senator Santorum and I would both be \nflexible as to how this is done. The important thing is that this \ninformation is routinely presented to Congress and to the public in a \nclear, understandable, helpful way, and the best time and format for \nthis is certainly a matter where reasonable people can disagree.\n  I do, however, want to review the elements of Senator Santorum's \nlegislation, and to express why I believe that they are so important.\n  First, it would add important new information to the Personal \nEarnings and Benefit Statements that individuals are now receiving from \nthe Social Security Administration. Those statements currently tell \nindividuals how much they are promised in terms of benefits, and about \ntheir earnings history. Taken literally, however, they could provide a \nmisleading picture as to what current law can actually finance. It is a \nmisnomer to say that ``current law'' would provide a certain amount of \nbenefits, when legally, the Social Security Administration does not \nhave the authority to send out checks without financing. What ``current \nlaw'' would literally mandate, according to GAO, according to CRS, and \naccording to everyone else who has studied this closely, is that \nbenefits would be effectively cut sharply beginning in 2037 because \nbenefit checks would have to wait until the available funds came in to \nfinance them.\n  Mr. President, it is unlikely that Congress would permit such a sharp \nand sudden set of benefit cuts to occur. Of course, neither we nor a \nfuture Congress would permit that. But it is also untrue to tell \nAmericans that ``current law'' would provide them with all promised \nbenefits. That is manifestly untrue by any definition. It is neither a \ntrue statement of current law, nor it is a true statement of how tax \nlevels and benefit levels would look after necessary adjustments are \nmade to the program to bring it into balance. Social Security \nbeneficiaries certainly have a right to be told the truth about their \nbenefits--the date through which they can currently be funded, the \nextent to which benefits could be provided under current estimates, as \nwell as the additional revenues that must be collected through tax \ndollars, when the program first begins to experience cash flow \ndeficits.\n\n  Currently, there is a great misperception regarding Social Security \nfinancing that too many individuals are willing to tacitly encourage--\nthe idea that the existence of a positive Social Security Trust Fund \nbalance enhances the ability of the federal government to pay Social \nSecurity benefits. It does not. The Social Security Trust Fund balance \nis actually a debt owed by the federal government, and it does not in \nany way finance benefits without requiring that the federal government \nturn to taxpayers to pay off that debt. Americans deserve to be told \nthe truth about that, and Senator Santorum's language includes a \nstatement that would explain the meaning of the Trust Fund, and the \noptions before Congress when the program enters a phase of cash-flow \ndeficits.\n  Many of the paragraphs in the Santorum language, regarding increased \nclarity in the annual Trustees' report, are somewhat similar to \nlanguage that I sought to pursue last week. Again, I would simply \nreiterate that reasonable people can disagree as to the proper venue \nfor the reporting of this information. I personally am of the view that \nthe annual Trustees' Reports should provide to Congress the relevant \ninformation that Congress, as the body that must budget for the Social \nSecurity program, needs to budget for it in the appropriate way. \nCongress has a right to insist, in my view, not on how these \nevaluations should be made, but that all relevant information be \npresented clearly to the Congress when they are made. However, the most \nimportant thing is that we reach an agreement among interested parties \nwith common goals as to how best to do this.\n  Currently, we receive 75-year actuarial estimates from the Trustees \nregarding the health of the Social Security Trust Fund. We only look at \nits impact on the overall federal budget over 10 years, through \nmeasurements by CBO and other bodies. We don't look out over the long \nterm to judge the larger fiscal problems facing this long-term program \nand the unified federal budget. That is a problem. It tempts Congress \nand the Executive Branch to pursue ``solutions'' to Social Security's \ninsolvency that improve the part of the picture that we see--the Trust \nFund balance--heedless of the consequences for the part of the picture \nthat we do not see--the impact on the unified federal budget. This is \nnot an adequate method of approaching the problem of financing benefits \nover the long term. I believe that Congress should insist that \nportraits of the program's finances evaluate all scenarios on an \nabsolutely level playing field, one that shows all costs borne by the \nsystem,\n\n[[Page S2242]]\n\nand one that judges all possible solutions in terms of what they would \nactually cost and what they could actually pay. I commend Senator \nSantorum for his effort here, even as my mind is open on the best way \nto achieve this objective.\n  Mr. President, I would simply close by saying that the Social \nSecurity program is too important to allow to operate in a fog of \nincomprehension and misunderstanding. There ought not to be resistance \nto efforts to bring additional ``sunshine'' upon the operations of the \nSocial Security system as a whole. We currently operate, too often, in \nan atmosphere of selective information--one that measures only benefit \npromises, and current tax levels, without acknowledging the mismatch \nbetween the two, and what they mean for one another. A view that looks \nonly at the Trust Fund balance, and not at the realities of the \nsystem's cost to future payers of both income and payroll taxes. This \nselective presentation of information encourages Congress to remain \ninactive, because it allows us to pretend that the consequences of \ncurrent law are not actually worse than the choices that would be made \nin the course of reforming the program.\n  We can do better than this, and we must, if we are to meet our \nresponsibilities of stewardship for the Social Security program. I \ncommend Senator Santorum for his effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Mr. Reed, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Abraham, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Cochran, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Hollings, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Murkowski, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \n        Edwards, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Cleland, Mr. \n        Hagel, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Helms, Mr. Allard, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. L.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \neliminate the 15 percent reduction in payment rates under the \nprospective payment system for home health services; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                    HOME HEALTH PAYMENT FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with 35 of my \ncolleagues tonight to introduce the Home Health Payment Fairness Act to \neliminate the automatic 15-percent reduction in Medicare payments to \nhome health agencies that is currently scheduled to go into effect on \nOctober 1 of next year. The legislation we are introducing will provide \na measure of financial relief for home health agencies across the \ncountry that are experiencing acute financial problems that are \ninhibiting their ability to deliver much needed care to some of the \nmost vulnerable senior citizens in our country.\n  America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have \nenabled a growing number of our most frail and vulnerable Medicare \nbeneficiaries to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay where they \nwant to be--in the comfort and security of their own home.\n  Unfortunately, due to cutbacks in the Medicare program, home health \nagencies in my State and others are having a very difficult time \nproviding services, particularly to elderly people with complex health \nneeds. One has only to look at the statistics from my home State of \nMaine to see the impact of these very onerous budget cuts, as well as \nburdensome regulations imposed by the Clinton administration.\n  In Maine, in just over 2 years' time, there has been a 30-percent \nreduction in home health visits, which has resulted in more than 7,470 \nsenior citizens losing their home health services in my State. There \nhas been a 26-percent reduction in the reimbursements that have been \nprovided to home health agencies in Maine. Mr. President, this \nsituation cannot continue. The home health industry has already made an \nimportant contribution to reducing the rate of growth in Medicare \nspending. In fact, the spending cuts have been far beyond what Congress \nintended and what the CBO estimated.\n  In 1996, home health was the fastest growing component of Medicare \nspending. The program grew at an average annual rate of more than 25 \npercent from 1990 to 1997. As a consequence, the number of home health \nbeneficiaries more than doubled and Medicare home health increased \nsoared from $2.5 billion in 1989 to $17.8 billion in 1997.\n  This rapid growth in home health spending understandably prompted \nCongress and the Administration, as part of the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, to initiate changes that were intended to slow this growth in \nspending and make the program more cost-effective and efficient. These \nmeasures, however, have produced cuts in home health spending far \nbeyond what Congress intended. Home health spending dropped to $9.7 \nbillion in FY 1999--just about half the 1997 amount. To cut payments by \nan additional 15 percent would put our already struggling home agencies \nat risk and would seriously jeopardize access to critical home health \nservices for millions of our nation's seniors.\n  It is now clear that the savings goals set for home health in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 have not only been met, but far surpassed. \nAccording to the March 2000 Congressional Budget Office (CBO) baseline, \nMedicare home health payments fell by almost 35 percent in FY 1999, and \nthis was on top of a 15 percent drop in FY 1998. In fact, the CBO cites \nthis ``larger than anticipated reduction in the use of home health \nservices'' as the primary reason that total Medicare spending dropped \nby one percent last year. The CBO now projects that the post-Balanced \nBudget Act reductions in home health will be about $69 billion between \nfiscal years 1998 and 2002. This is over four times the $16 billion \nthat the CBO originally estimated for that time period and is a clear \nindication that the Medicare home health cutbacks have been far deeper \nand wide-reaching than Congress ever intended.\n  Moreover, the financial problems that home health agencies have \nexperienced have been exacerbated by a number of burdensome new \nregulatory requirements imposed by the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, including the implementation of OASIS, the new outcome \nand assessment information data set; new requirements for surety bonds; \nIPS overpayment recoupment; and a new 15-minute increment reporting \nrequirement.\n  As a consequence of these payment cuts coupled with overly burdensome \nnew regulatory requirements, cost-efficient home health agencies across \nthe country have experienced acute financial difficulties and cash-flow \nproblems, which have inhibited their ability to deliver much-needed \ncare, particularly to the very Medicare beneficiaries who need it the \nmost--individuals with diabetes, wound care patients, stroke patients, \nand other chronically ill individuals with complex care needs. Over \n2,500 agencies--about one quarter of all home health agencies \nnationwide--have either closed or stopped serving Medicare patients. \nOthers have laid off staff or declined to accept new patients with more \nserious health problems. In addition, according to a study by the Lewin \nGroup for the American Hospital Association, these cutbacks have \nresulted in a 30.5 percent reduction in hospital-based home health \nservices.\n  The effect of these home health cuts has been particularly \ndevastating in my state. The number of Medicare home health patients in \nMaine dropped from 48,740 in June of 1998 to 41,269 in June of 1999, a \ndecline of 15 percent. This means that 7,471 fewer Maine seniors are \nreceiving home health services. Moreover, there was a 30 percent drop \nin the number of visits, and a 26 percent cut in Medicare payments to \nhome health agencies in Maine.\n  Keep in mind that Maine's home health agencies have historically been \nprudent in their use of resources and were low-cost to begin with. \nUltimately, cuts of this magnitude degrade patient care. The real \nlosers in this situation are our nation's seniors--particularly those \nsicker Medicare patients with complex, chronic care needs who are \nalready experiencing difficulty in getting the home care services they \nneed.\n  The Balanced Budget Refinement Act did provide a small measure of \nfinancial and regulatory relief for home health agencies. It did, for \nexample, delay the automatic 15 percent reduction in Medicare home \nhealth payments for one year. I do not think that\n\n[[Page S2243]]\n\nthis legislation went far enough, however: this automatic reduction \nshould be eliminated entirely.\n  An additional 15 percent cut in Medicare home health payments would \nring the death knell for the low-cost, efficient agencies which are \ncurrently struggling to hang on and would further reduce our seniors' \naccess to critical home care services. Moreover, we have already far \nsurpassed the savings targets set by the Balanced Budget Act. Further \ncuts are unnecessary. I therefore urge all of my colleagues to join \nwith myself and Senators Bond, Baucus, Jeffords, Reed, Santorum, \nAbraham, Murray, Cochran, Feinstein, Hollings, Mikulski, Bingaman, \nMurkowski, Hutchison, Schumer, Torricelli, Edwards, Leahy, Enzi, Lugar, \nCleland, Hagel, Snowe, Bennett, Gorton, Hutchinson, Helms, Allard, \nLincoln, DeWine, Chafee, Ashcroft, Specter, Roberts, Brownback, and \nVoinovich in cosponsoring the Home Health Payment Fairness Act to \neliminate this additional 15 percent cut in Medicare home health \npayments.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join with me in providing \nmuch needed relief to America's home health agencies. Ultimately, if we \ndon't act, the losers will be our senior citizens who depend so much on \nthis important health care service.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to compliment the Senator from \nMaine for this proposal. I am happy to join as a cosponsor of the \nlegislation, as I have on previous efforts on her part to address the \nhome health care issues.\n  I add my support to the legislation and compliment the Senator from \nMaine. I sincerely hope that as it moves forward with a variety of \nproposals before us, in the budget and elsewhere, to address Medicare \nissues we make sure we don't address those reform proposals without \nmaking sure our home health care programs are strong and of high \nquality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Collins to offer a \nbill--the Medicare Home Health Payment Act--that will address the \ncrisis in home health care.\n  The crisis is that far too many seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities can't get the home health care they need. They either go \nwithout needed care, or are forced into a medical facility such as a \nnursing home. This is a travesty, because home health can serve an \nextremely valuable role--it helps seniors get needed medical care while \nretaining the comfort and dignity of living in their own home.\n  We have plenty of data that demonstrates the problem.\n  Over 2,000 agencies driven out of business or out of the Medicare \nprogram. In Missouri alone, over 100 of the 300 agencies that were \naround in 1997 are gone.\n  Independent studies that show that seniors and people with \ndisabilities just can't get access to the home care they need--perhaps \nforcing them into nursing homes or other medical facilities.\n  Reports that home health agencies feel forced to refuse to care for \nseniors because they fear the Medicare reimbursements won't cover their \ncosts.\n  Recent news from CBO that total Medicare home health spending has \nactually fallen by 45 percent in just two years--perhaps the largest \nreduction for a specific type of provider that we have ever seen in \nMedicare.\n  Of course, last year I was also talking about the home health \ncrisis--and Senator Collins and I had a bill to address the issue then \nas well.\n  But I'm here to share bad news with my colleagues--Medicare home \nhealth is still in crisis.\n  While we did address home health in the Balanced Budget Refinement \nAct late last year--which helped--it didn't solve everything.\n  That's because all we did last year to the biggest threat that's out \nthere for home health care providers--the 15-percent across-the-board \ncuts that are in addition to all of the other cuts made thus far--was \npostpone things.\n  What we did not do--except for one minor provision--is increase home \nhealth reimbursement rates. Keep in mind that we did provide relief in \nthe form of increased payments for most other Medicare providers, like \nhospitals and nursing facilities.\n  So what we did is simply postpone further cuts in an already-\ndevastated industry. That cannot be the end of the story.\n  So what should we do? Senator Collins and I--in the bill we are \nintroducing today with 34 of our colleagues--propose to eliminate \npermanently the planned 15-percent home health cuts forever.\n  I think this initial show of support form my colleagues is \ntremendous--and I look forward to working with my colleagues to make \nsure this bill becomes law. The millions of Americans on Medicare--for \nwhom the home health benefit is so important--deserve no less.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Home Health \nPayment Fairness Act. This bill will prevent a 15% cut to home health \ncare agencies and allow them to continue their critical mission of \ncaring for the chronically ill and the elderly.\n  During the first 15 years of the Medicare program, home health \nspending accounted for one to two percent of all Part A expenditures. \nIn 1997, home health expenditures reached 14 percent of Part A \npayments. Congress needed to respond to this growth. And we did so in \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  Congress decided to pay home health agencies under a Prospective \nPayment System. In the meantime, we established an interim payment \nsystem, or IPS, that would move agencies away from the old system.\n  Since then, home care agencies have undergone deep budget cuts. \nRecent CBO projections show that reductions in home health care will be \nabout $69 billion between 1998 and 2002--over four times the original \nestimate for the same time period. Clearly, home health care agencies \nhave had their budgets cut much more severely than Congress ever \nintended.\n  Congress has recognized the severity of the cuts and has twice \npostponed implementing the planned across-the-board 15% cut. Currently, \nthe 15% cut is scheduled to take effect October 1, 2001.\n  So what does the legislation I am introducing do? Simply put, this \nbill takes the necessary step of not postponing the cut, but \neliminating it altogether. The planned cut must be eliminated because \nwe have achieved--in fact, far surpassed--the savings targets set by \nthe Balanced Budget Act. Efficient home health agencies in Montana and \nacross the country have experienced acute financial difficulties and \ncash flow problems, inhibiting their ability to deliver much needed \ncare.\n  Over 2,500 home health agencies nationwide have closed or stopped \nserving Medicare patients, and, according to a study done by the Lewin \nGroup for the American Hospital Association, these cutbacks have \nresulted in a 30.5 percent reduction in hospital-based home health \nservices. Moreover, the Health Care Financing Administration estimates \nthat 500,000 fewer home health patient received services in 1998 than \nin 1997 (the last year for which figures are available), which points \nto the most central and critical issue. The real losers in this \nsituation are our seniors. Cuts of this magnitude simply cannot be \nsustained without ultimately affecting patient care.\n  While patient care across the nation will be impacted if the planned \ncuts are implemented, rural areas will be especially had hit. If the \nplanned cuts are implemented, rural health care providers will be \nforced to find ways to further cut costs. Such cost-cutting measures \ncould include closing branches or limiting services. This means that \nrural patients could face difficulties accessing quality health care. \nThis is especially significant because a high percentage of seniors \nover the age of 65 live in rural areas; in Montana, that figure is 77%. \nThus, any reduction in home health care will directly impact our \nnation's seniors.\n  Eliminating the 15% cut makes financial sense. If home health care \nbudgets are cut further, costs will increase in other areas. If \npatients--especially in rural areas--are not receiving the care they \nneed, they will turn to other resources, such as hospital emergency \nrooms, inpatient cares, and nursing homes. In the long run, this will \nbe more expensive and less efficient. Above all, we must ensure that \nour nation's elderly and ill receive the care they need. We must not \ncreate a situation in which cash-strapped home\n\n[[Page S2244]]\n\nhealth agencies have strong incentives to limit- or even deny-care to \nthe sickest.\n  This bill prevents such a scenario, while respecting Congress' \noriginal intention of reducing home health care spending, I think that \nmost of us agree that our seniors and the ill deserve quality home \nhealth care. This is a common sense measure that will allow us to \nrealize our original intention of reducing home health care spending, \nwhile at the same time protecting the right of our elderly and ill to \nquality care.\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am here today to join in \nintroducing the Home Health Payment Fairness Act of 2000. This \nimportant bill has been crafted to protect the Medicare home health \nservices that our seniors depend upon. I want to recognize the \nleadership of Senators Collins, Bond, Baucus, Reed, and the many others \nwho are original cosponsors of this effort to protect access to home \nhealth services.\n  My own state of Vermont is a model for providing high-quality, \ncomprehensive care with a low price tag. For most of the 1990's, the \naverage Medicare expenditure for home health care in Vermont has been \nthe lowest in the nation. Vermont's home care system was designed to \nefficiently meet the needs of frail and elderly citizens in our largely \nrural state, but it, like home care across the country, has been put \nunder tremendous pressure.\n  Since the enactment of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and \nimposition of the interim payment system (IPS), the Medicare home \nhealth benefit has been seriously eroded. The BBA failed to recognize \nhow the new home health reimbursement would affect small, rural home \nhealth care providers. The IPS has caused such significant cash flow \nproblems, that many agencies are struggling to make meet their payroll \nneeds. Now, because of the BBA, agencies are facing the prospect of 15 \n% cut in Medicare funding in October of 2001. With providers already \nstruggling to survive, any further cuts could spell disaster for low-\ncost, efficient providers, non-profit agencies, and patients.\n  That is why we are introducing the Home Health Payment Fairness Act \nto eliminate the 15% reduction. The original budget target for home \nhealth expenditures from the BBA has already been far exceeded. The \nCongressional Budget Office now estimates that the total home health \ncuts from BBA will total $69 billion in five years. That's more than \nfour times what was originally estimated when BBA was passed.\n  The Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 contained a provision \nrequiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to report to \nCongress in 2001 on whether the 15% reduction is still considered \nnecessary. I think the answer is becoming more and more clear. We don't \nneed it, and the Home Health Payment Fairness Act is designed to stop \nit.\n  Adequate home health care services cannot survive any further \nreductions. Seniors depend on the home health benefit offered by the \nMedicare program, and we must make sure it will be there for them. Once \nagain, I want to thank all the cosponsors for giving this legislation \nsuch broad, bipartisan support. Our seniors are depending on that kind \nof support more than ever before.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Collins, \nSenator Bond, Senator Jeffords and 32 others in introducing the Home \nHealth Payment Fairness Act. The intent of this important legislation \nis quite simple--to eliminate the 15 percent reduction in home health \npayments that is scheduled to go into effect in October 2001. Last \nyear, Senator Jeffords and I introduced a more broad home health bill, \ncalled the Preserve Access to Care in the Home, or PATCH Act, which \namong other things, would have eliminated this potentially devastating \npayment reduction. Although we were not able to get this provision \nincluded in the 1999 Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA), we were \nsuccessful in getting a delay in the implementation of this reduction. \nHowever, we must see to it that the 15 percent cut is eliminated--and I \nhope we can achieve that goal this year.\n  Over the past thirty years, there has been a tremendous shift in the \nlocation where health care is actually provided. Increasingly, older \nand sicker patients are able to receive care in the comfort of their \nown home, instead of a hospital or nursing home. This incredible change \ncan be attributed to four primary causes: greater reliance on \nalternative care settings because of the growing cost of inpatient \ncare; technological improvements that have enhanced the capacity to \nprovide sophisticated medical treatments in the home setting; the \ngrowing aging population; and the increasing popularity of home- and \ncommunity-based care as an alternative to the institutional care of a \nnursing home. Indeed, home health care is an integral part of the \nspectrum of long term care.\n  As a result, by the mid-1990's the average annual growth rate for \nMedicare home health spending was 5.3%. The 1997 Balanced Budget Act \n(BBA) sought to restrain the unbounded growth in outlays for this \nbenefit. Originally, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) anticipated \nthat savings through changes in the benefit would total $16.1 billion \nover five years. In reality, we have saved a total of $19.7 billion in \njust two years, and are expected to reduce outlays by $69 billion over \nthe five year period--four times what was originally projected. Not \nsurprisingly, since the BBA's enactment, there has been a remarkable 48 \npercent decline in Medicare home health expenditures.\n  These dramatic reductions have all too often been borne on the backs \nof small, nonprofit home health agencies and the elderly and disabled \nbeneficiaries they serve. Home health care agencies in my home state of \nRhode Island have been especially hard hit by these changes. We have \nseen a significant decline in the number of beneficiaries served and \naccess to care for more medically complex patients threatened by these \ncuts. These reductions have clearly had negative impact on patients who \nheavily rely on home health services. In one instance, a woman from \nPawtucket, Rhode Island had to wait 112 days after being discharged \nfrom the hospital before getting home health services. In the \nwealthiest nation in the world, this kind of situation is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Mr. President, nationally, between 1997 and 1998, the number of \nMedicare beneficiaries receiving home health services has fallen 14 \npercent, while the total number of home health visits has fallen by 40 \npercent. We have seen a similar trend in Rhode Island, where over 3,000 \nfewer beneficiaries are receiving home health care--representing a \ndecline of 16 percent--and the total number of visits has fallen 38 \npercent. These individuals are either being forced to turn to more \nexpensive alternatives, such as institutional-based nursing homes and \nskilled nursing facilities for their care, or these individuals are \nsimply going without care, which places an immeasurable burden on the \nfamily and friends of vulnerable beneficiaries.\n  I truly do not believe this is the path we want to remain on when it \ncomes to home health care. In light of the impending ``senior boom'' \nthat will be hitting our entitlement programs in a few short years, we \nshould be doing what we can to preserve and strengthen the Medicare \nhome health benefit. We can begin to do this by eliminating the 15 \npercent reduction in home health payments. By taking this step, we will \nalleviate an enormous burden that has been looming over financially \nstrapped home health agencies and the frail and vulnerable Medicare \nbeneficiaries who rely on these critical services.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in enacting legislation that will \nrepeal this unnecessary and inappropriate reduction. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Collins, Senator Jeffords and my other colleagues \non this critical issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Ms. Collins, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hagel, and Mr. \n        Sessions):\n  S. 2366.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to make \nimprovements to, and permanently authorize, the visa waiver pilot \nprogram under the Act; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               TRAVEL, TOURISM, AND JOBS PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Travel, \nTourism, and Jobs Preservation Act. This bill makes the Visa Waiver \nPilot Program permanent and strengthens the documentation and reporting \nrequirements established under the pilot program.\n  This legislation is important not only because it facilitates travel \nand tourism in the United States, thereby creating many American jobs, \nbut also because it benefits American tourists who wish to travel \nabroad, since visa requirements are generally waived on a reciprocal \nbasis.\n  The Visa Waiver Pilot Program authorizes the Attorney General to \nwaive visa requirements for foreign nationals traveling from certain \ndesignated countries as temporary visitors for business or pleasure. \nAliens from the participating countries complete an admission form \nprior to arrival and are admitted to stay for up to 90 days.\n  The criteria for being designated as a Visa Waiver country are as \nfollows: First, the country must extend reciprocal visa-free travel for \nU.S. citizens. Second, they must have a nonimmigrant refusal rate for \nB-1/B-2 visitor visas at U.S. consulates that is low, averaging less \nthan 2 percent the previous two full fiscal years, with the refusal \nrate less than 2.5 percent in either year, or less than 3 percent the \nprevious full fiscal year. Third, the countries must have or be in the \nprocess of developing a machine-readable passport program. Finally, the \nAttorney General must conclude that entry into the Visa Waiver Pilot \nProgram will not compromise U.S. law enforcement interests.\n  Countries are designated by the Attorney General in consultation with \nthe Secretary of State. Nations currently designated as Visa Waiver \nparticipants are Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, \nBrunei, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, \nJapan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Netherlands, New Zealand, \nNorway, Portugal, San Marino, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, \nSwitzerland, United Kingdom, and Uruguay. Greece has been proposed for \nparticipation in the program.\n  The Visa Waiver Pilot Program was established by law in 1986 and \nbecame effective in 1988, with 8 countries participating for a period \nof three years. The program has been considered successful and as such \nhas been expanded to include 29 participating countries. Since 1986, \nVisa Waiver has been reauthorized on 6 different occasions for periods \nof one, two, or three years at a time.\n  The time has come to make the Visa Waiver Pilot Program permanent, \nand, in the process, to strengthen further current requirements. Its \nstatus is no longer truly experimental. No serious disagreement exists \nthat the program should continue in place for the foreseeable future, \nand no significant problems have been raised with the fundamentals of \nhow it has been operating for the past 14 years. To the contrary, \nfailure to continue the program would cause enormous staffing problems \nat U.S. consulates, which would have to be suddenly increased \nsubstantially to resume issuance of visitor visas. It would also be \nextremely detrimental to American travelers, who would most certainly \nfind that, given reciprocity, they now would be compelled to obtain \nvisas to travel to Europe and elsewhere. Finally, there are costs to \ncontinuing to reauthorize the program on a short-term rather than a \npermanent basis, as it periodically creates considerable uncertainty in \nthe United States and around the world about what documents travelers \nplanning their foreign travel have to obtain.\n  Accordingly, I am today introducing the Travel, Tourism, and Jobs \nPreservation Act. This legislation eliminates the need for frequent \nextensions of Visa Waiver by making the program permanent. I am pleased \nto see that the House bill on Visa Waiver also makes the program \npermanent. Second, the current requirement that countries be in the \nprocess of developing a program for issuing machine-readable passports \nwill be replaced with a stricter requirement that all countries in the \nprogram as of May 1, 2000 certify by October 1, 2001 that they will \nhave an operational machine-readable passport program by 2003 and that \nnew countries have a machine-readable passport program in place before \nbecoming eligible for designation as a Visa Waiver country. The bill \nalso establishes a deadline of October 1, 2008 by which time all \ntravelers must have machine-readable passports to come to the United \nStates under Visa Waiver. The judgment of everyone involved in these \nissues is that the technology is now sufficient that it is time for \neveryone to move from the concept and planning to the prompt \nimplementation of these requirements.\n  Finally, under the Travel, Tourism, and Jobs Preservation Act, the \nAttorney General must submit a written report at least once every five \nyears evaluating ``the effect of each program country's continued \ndesignation on the law enforcement and national security interests of \nthe United States.'' This will ensure that the operation of the program \nis periodically reviewed. I should note that under current law the \nAttorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may for \nany reason (including national security) refrain from waiving the visa \nrequirement in respect to nationals of any country which may otherwise \nqualify for designation or may, at any time, rescind any waiver or \ndesignation previously granted'' under Visa Waiver.\n  I think the additions in the bill strengthen the program while \npreserving the significant job creation benefits Americans gain from \nthe Visa\n\n[[Page S2249]]\n\nWaiver program. International travel generates $95 billion in \nexpenditures and created one million U.S. jobs last year, according to \nthe Travel Industry Association of America.

Res. 281\n\n       Whereas the Michigan State Spartans were Big Ten Conference \n     regular season co-champions, and were winners of the Big Ten \n     Conference Tournament, and, with a 26-7 record, earned a \n     number one seed in the Midwest region of the 1999-2000 \n     N.C.A.A. Tournament;\n       Whereas the Michigan State Spartans proved their dominance \n     over the Midwest Region in reaching the Final Four, defeating \n     Valparaiso 65-38, Utah 73-61, Syracuse 75-58, and Iowa State \n     75-64;\n       Whereas in winning the Midwest Region the Michigan State \n     Spartans reached the Men's Final Four for the second year in \n     a row, last year losing to the Duke University Blue Devils in \n     the semifinals;\n       Whereas the Michigan State Spartans vowed after that loss \n     to return to the Final Four in 1999-2000, and to settle for \n     nothing less than the ultimate prize;\n       Whereas the Michigan State Spartans moved one step closer \n     to their goal when they defeated the University of Wisconsin \n     Badgers 53-41 for the fourth time of the 1999-2000 season to \n     reach the championship game;\n       Whereas in that game, the Michigan State Spartans, with an \n     entire team effort that demonstrated why college athletics \n     are so special, defeated the University of Florida Gators 89-\n     76 on April 3, 2000, and won the N.C.A.A.

Granger, displayed his awesome variety of \n     offensive skills in both assisting on, and hitting, several \n     big shots when the Spartans needed them most;\n       Whereas Andre Hutson, the man in the middle, who was often \n     called on to shut down the opposing team's top player, \n     particularly in the 1999-2000 tournament, handled his job \n     with a workmanlike skill that defined professionalism, and in \n     doing so provided the Spartans with the whole package the \n     entire year;\n       Whereas Mike Chappell, Jason Richardson, and Aloysius \n     Anagonye, provided the Spartans with quality minutes off the \n     bench all year, and particularly in the championship game, \n     where they held their own against the vaunted Florida bench;\n       Whereas David Thomas and Adam Ballinger, provided valuable \n     contributions throughout the season and the tournament, both \n     on and off the court, often providing the Spartans with the \n     lift they needed; and\n       Whereas the contributions of Steve Cherry, Mat Ishbia and \n     Brandon Smith, both on the court and in practice, \n     demonstrated the total devotion of the Spartans players to \n     the team concept that made the Spartans into the most \n     dominating college basketball team of the new millennium: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate congratulates the \n     Michigan State University Men's Basketball Team on winning \n     the 1999-2000 National Collegiate Athletic Association Men's \n     Basketball Championship.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/05/senate-section/article/S2250-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2250-S2251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 282--CONGRATULATING THE HUSKIES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF \n    CONNECTICUT FOR WINNING THE 2000 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lieberman) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

More than \\2/3\\ \n     of households eligible for assistance through the Program \n     have annual incomes of less than $8,000, and approximately \n     \\1/2\\ of the households have annual incomes below $6,000.\n       (3) Funding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance \n     Program has declined 48 percent since fiscal year 1985, and \n     as a result many elderly individuals on fixed incomes and \n     working poor families have lost critical assistance.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) an amount of not less than $1,400,000,000 (an amount \n     currently available to carry out the Low-Income Home Energy \n     Assistance Act of 1981 for fiscal year 2000) will be made \n     available to carry out such Act for fiscal year 2001; and\n       (2) $1,400,000,000 of the amount described in paragraph (1) \n     will not be funds designated by Congress to be emergency \n     requirements pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (2 U.S.C. \n     901(b)(2)(A)), regardless of whether any additional funds (in \n     excess of the $1,400,000,000) made available as described in \n     paragraph (1) are funds that are so designated.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       LINCOLN AMENDMENT NO. 2925\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mrs. LINCOLN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by her to \nthe concurrent resolution S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE RELATING TO THE HUMAN GENOME \n                   PROJECT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The human genome project is an international effort \n     lead by the United States and the United Kingdom that will \n     revolutionize the delivery of health care.\n       (2) The National Institutes of Health's National Human \n     Genome Research Institute and the Department of Energy's \n     Human Genome Program together make up the U.S. component of \n     the Human Genome Project, the world's largest centrally \n     coordinated biology research project.\n       (3) The Human Genome Project is determined to complete the \n     nucleotide sequence of human DNA, to localize the estimated \n     50,000 to 100,000 genes within the human genome.\n       (4) In addition, another major component of the human \n     genome research effort is to analyze the ethical, legal, and \n     social implications of genetic knowledge.\n       (5) There are an estimated 3,000,000,000 letters to map and \n     sequence and up to 100,000 genes to identify that makeup the \n     human genetic code. Of the 3,000,000,000 letters, \n     2,000,000,000 have already been mapped and sequenced in \n     working draft form.\n       (6) As a result of the Human Genome Project's efforts, a \n     working draft that covers at least 90 percent of the genome \n     is expected to be released this year.\n       (7) The availability of genetic information requires humans \n     to use the information wisely and appropriately, free of \n     discrimination.\n       (8) The President's fiscal year 2001 budget requests a \n     $1,000,000,000 increase in the biomedical research activities \n     at the National Institutes of Health to support research in \n     areas such as diabetes, brain disorders, cancer, genetic \n     medicine, disease prevention strategies, and development of \n     an AIDS vaccine.\n       (9) The Senate has previously passed a sense of the Senate \n     that expresses support for the doubling of funding for the \n     National Institutes of Health over 5 years.\n       (10) The completion of the Human Genome Project will have \n     profound impacts on the way health care is delivered. It will \n     provide information that constitutes a basic set of inherited \n     instructions for the development and functioning of a human \n     being.\n       (11) This data will be primarily used to create medications \n     that can prevent genetic disorders from surfacing and allow \n     treatment to begin at earlier stages.\n       (12) Genomics should allow us to live not only longer but \n     healthier lives. By identifying the genetic causes of \n     terminal illnesses, genomics may make it possible for a child \n     born today to have a long and healthier life.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels underlying this resolution assume that the \n     efforts of the National Institutes of Health and the \n     Department of Energy in the Human Genome Project will be \n     recognized and strongly supported to advance the world's \n     understanding\n\n[[Page S2253]]\n\n     of the genetic make-up of humans and develop one of the most \n     profound scientific discoveries of our time, and to support \n     swift advancement in this area.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 JOHNSON (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO 2934\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dorgan, \nMrs. Murray, Mr. Robb, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nBryan, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Daschle) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the bill Senate Concurrent \nResolution 101, supra, as follows:\n\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 7, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 8, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 11, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 12, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 15, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 16, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 19, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 20, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 23, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 24, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 3, decrease the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 4, decrease the amount by $2,500,000,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 CONRAD (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2935\n\n  Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Robb, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Graham) proposed an amendment to \namendment No. 2906 proposed by Mr. Allard to the concurrent resolution, \nS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING BREAST AND CERVICAL \n                   CANCER.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection \n     Program under title XV of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 300k et seq.) (referred to in this section as the \n     ``NBCCEDP'') provides funding only for screening and not \n     treatment of these breast and cervical cancers.\n       (2) From its inception in 1990 through March 1999, the \n     NBCCEDP has provided over 1,000,000 mammograms to women 40 \n     years of age and older. Of these, over 77,000 were found to \n     be abnormal and 5,830 cases of breast cancer were diagnosed.\n       (3) Of all women screened by the NBCCEDP, over 6,200 cases \n     of breast cancer have been diagnosed.\n\n[[Page S2255]]\n\n       (4) The NBCCEDP has diagnosed over 34,000 precancerous \n     cervical lesions and over 550 cases of cervical cancer.\n       (5) Screening must be coupled with treatment to reduce \n     cancer mortality.\n       (6) The current system for treatment for low-income, \n     uninsured women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer in \n     the NBCCEDP is an ad hoc patchwork of providers, volunteers, \n     and local programs scrambling to find treatment dollars.\n       (7) Time and effort required to arrange for treatment for \n     women diagnosed through the NBCCEDP have begun to divert \n     resources away from screening services, allowing the program \n     to screen only 12 to 15 percent of eligible women.\n       (8) There is a precedent for covering participants in the \n     NBCCEDP under the medicaid program under title XIX of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.).\n       (9) The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act of 1999 \n     (Senate bill 662 106th Congress) has 57 bipartisan \n     cosponsors, and would establish an optional State medicaid \n     benefit for coverage of women screened and diagnosed with \n     breast or cervical cancer under the NBCCEDP.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution, and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution, assume that there should be \n     passage of legislation to provide medical assistance for \n     certain women screened and found to have breast or cervical \n     cancer under the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early \n     Detection Program under title XV of the Public Health Service \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 300k et seq.).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                ASHCROFT (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2945\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. \nGrams) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING INVESTMENT OF \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Government investment of the social security trust \n     funds in the stock market is a gamble Congress should be \n     unwilling to make on behalf of the millions who receive and \n     depend on social security to meet their retirement needs;\n       (2) in 1999, the Senate voted 99-0 to oppose Government \n     investment of the social security trust funds in private \n     financial markets;\n       (3) in addition to the unanimous opposition of the United \n     States Senate, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and \n     Securities and Exchange Commissioner Arthur Levitt also \n     oppose the idea; and\n       (4) despite this opposition, and despite the dangers \n     inherent in having the Government invest social security \n     trust funds in private financial markets, President Clinton \n     has once again suggested, on page 37 of the Administration's \n     proposed fiscal year 2001 Federal budget, that the Government \n     invest part of the social security trust funds in corporate \n     equities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that the Federal Government should not \n     directly invest contributions made to the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund established under section 201 of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401), or any interest derived \n     from those contributions, in private financial markets.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                SANTORUM (AND GRAMS) AMENDMENT NO. 2947\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself and Mr. Grams) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING INCREASING ACCESS TO \n                   HEALTH INSURANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) 44,400,000 Americans are currently without health \n     insurance--an increase of more than 5,000,000 since 1993--and \n     this number is expected to increase to nearly 60,000,000 \n     people in the next 10 years;\n       (2) the cost of health insurance continues to rise, a key \n     factor in the increasing number of uninsured;\n       (3) more than half of these uninsured Americans are the \n     working poor or near poor;\n       (4) the uninsured are much more likely not to receive \n     needed medical care and much more likely to need \n     hospitalization for avoidable conditions and to rely on \n     emergency room care, trends which significantly contribute to \n     the rising costs of uncompensated care by health care \n     providers and the costs of health care delivery in general; \n     and\n       (5) there is a consensus that working Americans and their \n     families will suffer from reduced access to health insurance.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that increasing \n     access to affordable health care coverage for all Americans, \n     in a manner which maximizes individual choice and control of \n     health care dollars, should be a legislative priority of \n     Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     REID AMENDMENTS NOS. 2948-2950\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. REID submitted three amendments intended to be proposed by him to \nthe concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING AN INCREASE IN \n                   FUNDING FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) less than 15 percent of the funding at the National \n     Institutes of Health is for women's health research, yet \n     women make up approximately 55 percent of the population;\n       (2) National Institutes of Health funding for women's \n     health has not increased to meet the growth in the number of \n     women, especially older women;\n       (3) between fiscal years 1997 and 2000, the percentage of \n     National Institutes of Health funding dedicated to women's \n     health has actually decreased; and\n       (4) according to the Census Bureau, by 2010 the growth rate \n     of the older population will be 3\\1/2\\ times that of the \n     total population, with older women one of the fastest growing \n     cohorts, creating an urgent need for research into the \n     diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of age-related diseases.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels of this resolution assume that a portion of \n     any increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health \n     should be used to increase the amount of funding for women's \n     health research so that progress is made in achieving equity \n     in women's health research funding at the National Institutes \n     of Health.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2949\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   NOTCH BABIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Social Security Amendments of 1977 (Pub.

Access by Native Americans to the Internet \n     and to computers is statistically negligible.\n       (2) Regardless of income level, Americans living in rural \n     areas lag behind in Internet access. Individuals with lower \n     incomes who live in rural areas are half as likely to have \n     Internet access as individuals who live in urban areas.\n       (3) The digital divide for the poorest Americans has grown \n     by 29 percent since 1997.\n       (4) Access to computers and the Internet and the ability to \n     use this technology effectively is becoming increasingly \n     important for full participation in America's economic, \n     political and social life.\n       (5) Unequal access to technology and high-tech skills by \n     income, educational level, race and geography could deepen \n     and reinforce the divisions that exist within American \n     society.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution on the \n     budget assume that--\n       (1) to ensure that all children are computer literate by \n     the time they finish the eighth grade, regardless of race, \n     ethnicity, gender, income, geography or disability, to \n     broaden access to information technologies, to provide \n     workers, teachers and students with information technology \n     training, and to promote innovative online content and \n     software applications that will improve commerce, education \n     and quality of life, initiatives that increase digital \n     opportunity should be provided for as follows:\n       (A) $200,000,000 in tax incentives should be provided to \n     encourage private sector donation of high quality computers, \n     sponsorship of community technology centers, training, \n     technical services and computer repair;\n       (B) $450,000,000 should be provided for teacher training;\n       (C) $150,000,000 for new teacher training;\n       (D) $400,000,000 should be provided for school technology \n     and school libraries;\n       (E) $20,000,000 should be provided to place computers and \n     trained personnel in Boys & Girls Clubs;\n       (F) $25,000,000 should be provided to create an E-Corps \n     within Americorps;\n       (G) $100,000,000 should be provided to create 1,000 \n     Community Technology Centers in low-income urban and rural \n     communities;\n       (H) $50,000,000 should be provided for public/private \n     partnerships to expand home access to computers and the \n     Internet for low-income families;\n       (I) $45,000,000 should be provided to promote innovative \n     applications of information and communications technology for \n     underserved communities;\n       (J) $10,000,000 should be provided to prepare Native \n     Americans for careers in Information Technology and other \n     technical fields; and\n       (2) all Americans should have access to broadband \n     telecommunications capability as soon as possible and as \n     such, initiatives that increase broadband deployment should \n     be funded, including $25,000,000 to accelerate private sector \n     deployment of broadband and networks in underserved urban and \n     rural communities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     LAUTENBERG AMENDMENT NO. 2957\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him \nto the concurrent resolution, S.

Res. 101, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       (a) Findings.--\n       The Senate finds that:\n       (1) Federally-funded research and development and science \n     and technology programs have led to innovations that have \n     dramatically improved the quality of life for all Americans.\n       (2) The Federal investment in research and development \n     conducted or underwritten by both military and civilian \n     agencies has produced benefits that have been felt in both \n     the private and public sector.\n       (3) The National Science Foundation is the largest \n     supporter of non-medical basic research in the Federal \n     Government.\n       (4) In 1990, the Department of Defense supported 44% of all \n     university-based engineering research, by 1999 such support \n     is estimated to have declined by 43%.\n       (5) The Department of Energy leads the federal government \n     in supporting research in the physical sciences.\n       (6) Technical innovation is the principal driving force \n     behind the long-term economic growth and increased standards \n     of living of the world's modern industrial societies. Other \n     nations are well aware of the pivotal role of science, \n     engineering, and technology, and they are seeking to exploit \n     it wherever possible to advance their own global \n     competitiveness.\n       (7) Discoveries across the spectrum of scientific inquiry \n     have the potential to raise the standard of living and the \n     quality of life for all Americans, and as such federal \n     investments in research and technology should be balanced \n     across all disciplines, including but not limited to the \n     physical sciences and engineering, life sciences, biomedical \n     research, and information technology.\n       (8) The Senate has in past legislation expressed its \n     commitment to continued investments to both civilian and \n     defense science and technology, namely in the Federal \n     Research Investment Act of 1999 and the Strom Thurmond \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.\n       (9) A continued trend of funding appropriations equal to or \n     lower than current budgetary levels will lead to permanent \n     damage to the United States research infrastructure, high \n     technology economy, and national security.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that:\n       (1) Total federal investment in civilian research be at a \n     minimum consistent with the levels called for in the FY01 \n     Administration\n\n[[Page S2263]]\n\n     Budget Request, as this investment manifests the Senate's \n     belief that the Federal government should have a robust \n     program of research across all disciplines of scientific \n     endeavor.\n       (2). For fiscal years 2001-2008, the science and technology \n     (6.1, 6.2 and 6.3) accounts for the Department of Defense, \n     including all of the Armed Services, in Function 050 \n     (National Defense), shall increase annually and at a minimum \n     achieve the levels called for in Section 214 of the Strom \n     Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     1999.\n       (3) Congressional authorizers and appropriators should \n     continue their efforts to support merit-based and peer-\n     reviewed R programs as a priority in the federal science \n     investment portfolio.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  REED (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2964\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nTorricelli, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Robb, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Biden, \nMr. Byrd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reid, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \nWyden, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. L.

Mr. President, the hour is late and I have a special \nsensitivity to the fact that many of the staff people have been here \nfor a long time, and I know we will return to this amendment and debate \nfirst thing in the morning. I will make my remarks mercifully brief and \njust alert the Members of the Senate and those who follow this debate \nof the nature of the amendment I am offering.\n  I think this amendment goes to the heart of politics, the best part \nof politics. It goes to a clash of ideas, a difference of opinion, a \ntrue choice for the Members of the Senate and for the people of the \nUnited States because the amendment I offer has become the cornerstone \nof the Presidential debate for the year 2000.\n  The two candidates who are the likely nominees of their party, George \nW. Bush and Vice President Al Gore, have one marked difference. \nGovernor Bush has proposed a substantial--some would say massive and \nrisky--tax cut. Vice President Gore believes that, as do many of the \nMembers of the Senate and the House, with this surplus we anticipate in \nthe coming years, our first priority should be the reduction of the \nnational debt so that our children don't bear that burden, and that we \ndon't have to generate in taxes every day of every year the interest \npayments on old debt.\n  Furthermore, Vice President Gore and many of us believe that we \nshould take our surplus and dedicate it to preserving Social Security, \nmaking certain that Medicare will be there for many years to come. He \nbelieves, as many of us do, that we should have targeted tax cuts well \nwithin our means, consistent with our goal of reducing the national \ndebt, and that we should then have specific spending priorities for \neducation and health care.\n  On the other side of the coin, there is quite a different proposal. \nGovernor Bush has suggested perhaps the largest tax cut that has been \nproposed in recent memory. Every politician applauds a tax cut, and \nmost of us like to offer one. But certainly we don't want to do \nsomething that is unrealistic. I suggest to my colleagues that the Bush \ntax cut being offered in the Presidential campaign is not only \nunrealistic; it is risky. And if we are not careful, if we follow his \ncampaign pledge and his advice, we could jeopardize the economic growth \nthat we have seen over the past 7 years.\n  Twice in the Senate Budget Committee, I allowed my colleagues--both \nRepublicans and Democrats--to go on record in reference to the Bush tax \ncut. I thought it was only fair that the Republican members of the \nSenate Budget Committee would have that opportunity to stand by their \nPresidential candidate and the cornerstone of his campaign, the Bush \ntax cut because, you see, the Senate budget resolution we are \nconsidering today, proposed by Senate Republican leaders, doesn't \ninclude Governor Bush's tax cut.\n  I think this is a terrible oversight and omission that the standard \nbearer of the Republican Party would come forward with a vision of \nAmerica that includes a tax cut, and for some reason the Senate \nRepublicans don't want to include it in their proposal for the course \nof action in America for the next 5 or 10 years.\n  So twice in the Senate Budget Committee I offered the Bush tax cut \nfor an up-or-down vote, take it or leave it, stand by your man, the \nRepublicans with the Democrats, make it clear you disagree.\n  I was disappointed to find that my Republican colleagues in the \nSenate Budget Committee did not want to go on record when it came to \nthe tax cut proposed by the standard bearer of the Republican Party, \nthe possible Presidential nominee, Governor George W. Bush. I think \nthere is good reason for that. I will explain it in a minute.\n  But I said in the committee that if the Senate Republicans in the \nBudget Committee didn't want to vote for Bush's tax cut in the \ncommittee, I would feel duty bound to offer that same opportunity to \nall of the Members of the Senate here on the floor. After all, as we \ndebate important policy questions such as funding and education and \nwhether we are going to drill in ANWR, these are policy questions on \nwhich we go on record. We establish our positions by our votes.\n  I am hoping by offering this amendment that the Senate will go on \nrecord. The Republican Members have their chance with this amendment to \nstand up for the tax cut proposed by their Presidential candidate. I \nthink they should vote no. Above all, I hope they don't continue to \nduck this vote. They cannot duck this vote any more than Governor Bush \ncan duck the responsibility to explain his tax cut and what it means to \nAmerica.\n  Take a look at where we have been in this Nation over the past 7 \nyears and the progress we have made. Record budget deficits have been \nerased. We have had the largest paydown of debt in the history of the \nUnited States with $297 billion in debt reduction. We are on the right \ntrack. We have seen the smallest Government in over three decades while \nwe have increased key investments in education and in training for the \npeople of this country. The typical family has seen their tax burden \nlowered to a level where you would have to reach back to the 1970s to \nfind a comparison. Investment has boomed.\n  Take a look at the investment that is mirrored by our stock exchanges \nand our investments across America and you will see that people have \nbeen putting money into companies for growth. It has paid off. \nUnemployment is the lowest in decades, the welfare rolls the lowest in \ndecades, inflation under control, housing starts at record levels, and \nbusiness creation at record levels.\n  Frankly, everything you like to see that is positive in our economy \nhas been moving forward under the Clinton-Gore administration. Of \ncourse,\n\n[[Page S2266]]\n\nthey can't take complete credit for that, but they can take some credit \nfor it. They would certainly be blamed if we were back in the \nrecessions of previous Presidents.\n  We have to say as well that some credit should go to the Federal \nReserve because they have tried to quell the flames and forces of \ninflation, and they have been very effective in doing so. The Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, deserves credit for his \nleadership. I was happy recently to vote to reconfirm him for another \nterm as Chairman of that important body.\n\n  But, on balance, most Americans believe we are headed in the right \ndirection.\n  One American who apparently does not believe that is the Republican \ncandidate for President because George W. Bush has proposed a dramatic \nchange and a drastic shift in America's economic policy. He said we \nshould take the surplus we see coming because of a strong economy and \ndedicate it to a massive and risky tax cut primarily for the wealthiest \npeople in America.\n  If you take a close look at what this means, this chart shows our \neconomy moving forward as a great ocean liner and a $168 billion \nproposed tax cut from the Presidential candidate, George W. Bush, that \nmasks an iceberg of a tax cut that is so large, it would exceed the \navailable surplus and force us to move into the Social Security trust \nfund to pay for it.\n  Our fear, and the fear of Chairman Greenspan and many others, is that \nsuch a tax cut at this moment in history would fire up an economy, \ncreate inflation, force increases in interest rates, and, frankly, doom \nthe economic expansion we have seen for over 108 months, a record in \nthe history of the United States.\n  Take a look at what the Bush tax cut would cost over a 5-year period \nof time based on research by the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities. It would be a $483 billion tax cut, and over 10 years it \nwould be a $1.3 trillion tax cut.\n  What would be the impact of a $1.3 trillion tax cut on the Social \nSecurity surplus? As you can see, the non-Social Security surplus is \n$171 billion. That is what we can consider using for such things as \ndebt reduction, targeted tax cuts, and expenditures on education. But \nGeorge W. Bush would take $483 billion out for his tax cut. You may \nnote that is far in excess of the amount that is available outside of \nthe non-Social Security surplus.\n  The obvious conclusion is, to pay for the George W. Bush tax cut, you \nwould have to raid Social Security. I find we have decided on a \nbipartisan basis that won't happen, that we will protect the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  That is why I believe the Republican Members of the Senate, if they \nshare that belief, as I do, that Social Security should be protected, \nshould vote against the George W. Bush tax cut. My amendment gives them \na chance to go on record against this tax cut to make it clear that \nthey want to protect Social Security and avoid a raid on the Social \nSecurity trust fund to make up the $312 billion difference in the first \n5 years we would see if we followed George W. Bush's plan.\n  The obvious question is whether this Bush tax cut is fair and whether \nit would help American families. As I said earlier, all of us would \nlike to see tax cuts. We would certainly like to go back to families in \nIllinois and across America and say to them, We can give you a break to \nhelp pay for your bills. Most of them would welcome it. But if you take \na close look at the proposal from George W. Bush for his tax cut, you \nwill see that most working families and middle-income families in \nAmerica won't even notice a change.\n  If you notice, the bottom 60 percent of wage earners in America, \nthose making below $39,300 a year, will see an average tax cut of about \n$249 a year, a little over $20 a month. That comes down to 75 cents a \nday they might see by way of George W. Bush's tax cut--60 percent of \nAmerican families. But in the top 1 percent, the people who are making \nover $300,000 a year already, the George W. Bush tax cut is worth over \n$50,000 a year. Not only does this tax cut raid Social Security but the \nbeneficiaries of it turn out to be wealthiest people in this country. \nFrankly, that isn't fair.\n\n  If we are going to jeopardize our economic growth, if we are going to \nin some way avoid the debt reduction, which most economists agree is \nimportant for the growth of America, you would think a tax cut on the \ntable would at least benefit most American families. Honestly, it \ndoesn't or, if it does, it is so small, they wouldn't notice it. Twenty \ndollars a month? That is what 60 percent of the working families of \nAmerica would see. As I mentioned earlier, it would be at great expense \nand peril to the Social Security trust fund and others.\n  As I offer this amendment, I am hoping we can have a bipartisan \nconsensus to tell Governor George Bush to go back to the drawing board, \nto come forward with a proposal, if you will, that is consistent with \ncontinuing the economic growth in this country and that in fact \nidentifies as the highest priority the reduction of our national debt \nand doesn't jeopardize Social Security. Frankly, his tax cut does. That \nis why I think this Senate should go on record in opposition to it on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  There is a lot of criticism of current political campaigns across \nAmerica: They are too long; they are too nasty; they are too negative. \nAnd virtually all of those criticisms are true. But if our political \ncampaigns in this democracy are of any value, they are because we have \na true clash of ideas, a difference of opinions, and a real choice for \nvoters.\n  When it comes to the George W. Bush tax cut, there couldn't be a \nclearer choice.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will accept their responsibility, \nstep up, and say whether they endorse the proposal of the Presidential \ncandidate on the Republican side for this tax cut or whether they \nbelieve, as Chairman Greenspan does, Vice President Gore, and most \nAmerican people do, that it is an unwise course of action.\n  I understand, as most people do, that there are a lot of differences \nof opinion in the course of a campaign. But Governor Bush has been very \nspecific in spelling out his tax cut. In order to achieve his tax cut, \nyou not only have to raid Social Security, but when you go in the \noutyears beyond 5 years, to achieve it you have to cut dramatically in \nspending on very important programs for America.\n  If that is something which the Republican side of the aisle wants to \nembrace, so be it. I, frankly, think it is shortsighted to take over \n$3.7 million low-income women and children off the WIC Program, a \nnutrition program for children and pregnant women so their babies are \nborn healthy and get off to a good start.\n  If you follow through on the George W. Bush tax plan, you see massive \nspending cuts in key programs such as WIC. There is a $4.8 billion \ncutback in the Pell Grant Program, meaning 784,000 college students who \nreceive grants--not loans, because they are low income--would see those \ndisappear.\n  Mr. President, 400,000 kids, $2.9 billion cuts in Head Start--does it \nmake sense to offer a tax cut of $50,000 a year to some of the \nwealthiest people in America and at the same time cut back and \neliminate 400,000 kids from the Head Start Program?\n  The community development block grant programs and so many other job \ntraining assistance and support programs would be decimated by the \nproposal of the Presidential candidate on the Republican side, Governor \nBush.\n  I believe if we are to stand on the record for this Bush tax cut \nplan, we have to answer to the voters in Illinois and across the Nation \nwhy we are prepared to threaten the future of Social Security and \nMedicare; why would we make deep cuts in Medicare spending; why would \nwe fail to invest in debt reduction and help these important programs \nto provide the largest tax cuts in history to the richest people in our \nNation.\n  Eliminating the estate tax primarily benefits millionaires. I asked a \ngroup who came to my office recently who said they wanted to see the \nestate tax eliminated: What percentage of estates in America pay the \ntax? They didn't know. The answer is 1.3 percent. It is a very small \npercentage. It comes down to the fact that if we are going to eliminate \nthose taxes on the richest people in America, we should only do it if \nwe can justify it. I don't believe Governor Bush can justify it in \nterms of the benefits that it would mean for the rest of the people who \nlive in this country.\n  I hope we will not jeopardize our economic prosperity. I hope we will \nfollow\n\n[[Page S2267]]\n\nthe model that has been suggested by Vice President Gore. I sincerely \nhope my colleagues in the Senate will not duck this opportunity to vote \non the George W. Bush tax cut plan. If they are proud of their \ncandidate, if they believe in his platform, if they share his vision, \nfor goodness sake, have the courage to stand up and vote yes; if you \ndisagree with his position, at least have the courage to go on the \nrecord and say so.\n  I hope, as in the Budget Committee, we don't run into the same \nexperience on the floor where the Republican majority refuses to go on \nthe record when it comes to the cornerstone of the campaign of the \nRepublican Presidential candidate George W. Bush.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/05/senate-section/article/S2267-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
