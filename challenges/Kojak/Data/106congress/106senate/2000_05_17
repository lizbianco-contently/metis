Mr. President, I thank the leader for entering the order \ngiving me 30 minutes for a statement this morning. I have sought that \ntime to speak on what I believe to be one of the most important issues \nwhich will be presented to the Congress this year; that is, the issue \nof permanent normal trade relations for the People's Republic of China.\n  The Senate is scheduled to take up this issue sometime next month, \ndepending upon what the House of Representatives does. The House of \nRepresentatives is scheduled to consider this matter next week. I \nthought it appropriate to make this statement at this time, to give my \nviews on important issues of weapons of mass destruction and nuclear \nproliferation, insights which I gained, in large part, from serving on \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee for some 8 years, including 2 years \nas chairman during 1995 and 1996, and other insights on related matters \nwhich I have seen in my capacity as chairman of the Judiciary \nsubcommittee on oversight of the Department of Justice.\n  My own record has been that of a strong free trader. I have supported \nNAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. I have supported free \ntrade with the Caribbean nations. I supported, last week, free trade \nwith the African nations. I believe the long tugs and pulls of the \neconomy, both domestic and international, strongly support the notion \nof free trade.\n  But I am opposed, strongly opposed to granting permanent normal trade \nrelations to the People's Republic of China because of their record on \nnuclear proliferation, of weapons of mass destruction, because of their \nrecord on human rights, and because the executive branch, the \nadministration, has not imposed sanctions as required by law to stop or \ninhibit such nuclear proliferation but, in fact, has taken affirmative \naction to grant waivers. So it is necessary for Congress to exercise \nour constitutional responsibility of checks and balances and \ncongressional oversight of the executive branch, to see to it the \nnational interest is preserved.\n  The Congress has authority under the Constitution. There are some \nconstitutional inhibitions which prohibit the Congress from delegating \nthat authority to the executive branch. I am not necessarily saying \nthat permanent trade with China would be such an unconstitutional \ndelegation, but at the very minimum it is an unwise delegation, based \non this state of the record, based on the necessity to impose \nrestraints on conduct of the People's Republic of China, not only as to \nhuman rights--fundamental, important human rights--but of greater \nmagnitude, the threat to international peace through their \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  During my tenure on the Intelligence Committee I saw many instances \nof the People's Republic of China supplying rogue nations, nations \nwhich constitute a threat to world order, with weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  For example, the People's Republic of China provided M-11 missiles to \nPakistan back in 1992. Those missiles, now armed with nuclear warheads, \nare pointed at India, creating a nuclear threat to the subcontinent, \nthe possibility of a nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan, and \nthreatening world peace.\n  The People's Republic of China has assisted North Korea's missile \nprogram by providing specialty steel, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and \nprecision grinding machinery. The People's Republic of China is \nproviding assistance to Libya's long-range missile program by assisting \nin the building of a hypersonic wind tunnel which is useful for \ndesigning missiles and cooperating in the development of Libya's Al \nFatah missile which has a range of some 600 miles, threatening peace \nand stability in that area.\n  The People's Republic of China has helped Pakistan, Iran, North \nKorea, and Libya in a way which is very destabilizing.\n  What has been the reaction of the Clinton administration to these \nissues? The transfer of M-11 missiles to Pakistan falls under category \n1 of the Missile Technology Control Regime, which is set up to \nestablish gradations in seriousness of violations. That is category 1.\n  The 1991 National Defense Authorization Act mandates the President to \ndeny for not less than 2 years certain licenses, and we find not only \nhas the President not taken those steps on sanctions, but has, in \naddition, moved ahead and granted affirmative waivers to facilitate \ndeveloping China's ballistic missile capability. Those waivers were \ngranted in a celebrated case on the application of Loral Space and \nTechnology.\n  A series of events, beginning in 1992, involving both Hughes and \nLoral demonstrates a very serious problem on transmitting to the \nPeople's Republic of China high-level technology.\n  On December 21, 1992, a Chinese Long March 2E rocket carrying a \nHughes manufactured satellite crashed shortly after takeoff. Without \nattaining the required State Department license, the Hughes personnel \nengaged in a series of discussions with Chinese officials, giving them \nvery important information.\n  On January 26, 1995, a Chinese Long March 2E missile carrying another \nHughes satellite exploded approximately 50 seconds after takeoff. A \n1998 State Department assessment showed that, ``Hughes directly \nsupported the Chinese space program in the areas of [accident analysis] \n. . . .''\n  The Cox committee reviewed these matters and called for a very \ndetailed investigation as to what had actually occurred.\n  On February 15, 1996, the People's Republic of China's Long March 3B \nmissile exploded with a communications satellite on board built by \nLoral. Following these explosions, Loral and Hughes transmitted to the \nPeople's Republic of China their assessments of why the rockets failed. \nThe assessments required a prior license from the Department of State \nwhich had not been obtained.\n  In May 1997, a classified Department of Defense report concluded that \nLoral and Hughes significantly enhanced the guidance and control \nsystems of the People's Republic of China's nuclear ballistic systems. \nAs a result of the Department of Defense report, the U.S. Department of \nJustice began a criminal investigation of Loral and Hughes. Then Loral \napplied for a waiver from the Clinton administration to launch another \nsatellite from a Chinese rocket.\n  The Department of Justice weighed in and objected to a Presidential \ngrant of a waiver on the ground that such a waiver would have ``a \nsignificant adverse impact on any prosecution that might take place \nbased on a pending investigation of export violations by Loral.''\n  Notwithstanding the very serious issue of China having sold M-11 \nmissiles to Pakistan creating a threat of nuclear war, notwithstanding \nthe fact that Loral and Hughes gave an assessment to China which \nsignificantly enhanced their nuclear capability system, notwithstanding \nthe fact that there was a criminal investigation pending by the \nDepartment of Justice, notwithstanding the fact that the Department of \nJustice objected to the grant of a waiver on the ground that it would \nhave an adverse impact on their criminal investigation potential \nprosecution, the President on February 18 of 1998 granted the waiver.\n  What are we to make of all of that, and why, in fact, was the waiver \ngranted? A preliminary investigation has shown that in an early \nmemorandum in\n\n[[Page S4033]]\n\nJanuary of 1998 from the National Security Adviser, there was a \nreference to a State Department concern about transfers by the People's \nRepublic of China to Iran of C-802 antiship cruise missiles. That was a \nJanuary 1998 draft memorandum from National Security Adviser Samuel R. \nBerger to the President.\n  When the final memorandum was submitted to the President by Mr. \nBerger on February 12, 1998, that important warning was dropped. The \nearlier memorandum had contained language of the importance of an \nexpedited waiver because Loral was in the process of losing money. \nIsn't it curious that emphasis is placed upon Loral's financial \nsituation while an important factor about the PRC's furnishing key \nweaponry to Iran is excluded in the final memorandum?\n  The decision by the President to grant that waiver is further suspect \nbecause the chief executive officer of Loral, Mr. Bernard Schwartz, had \nmade a contribution to the President's campaign of some $1.5 million, \nand the chief executive officer of Hughes, Mr. C. Michael Armstrong, \nwas the chairman of the President's export council actively lobbying on \nthese issues, raising a very serious issue of a potential conflict of \ninterest.\n  In the face of activity of this sort, it is my view that it is \nindispensable that the Congress maintain close oversight on what the \nexecutive branch is doing. It is my view that it is indispensable for \nCongress to maintain close oversight on the effort by the \nadministration now to grant permanent normal trade relations with the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n  The preferable course, by far, in my view, is for Congress to make a \nyear-by-year analysis as to what is happening so we can exert the \nmaximum pressure on the People's Republic of China and not delegate to \nthe President broader authority to initiate action which will grant \npermanent trade status to China so there is no opportunity for the \nCongress to impose leverage to try to secure China's compliance with \ntheir international commitments.\n  As a result of the large campaign contribution, $1.5 million from Mr. \nSchwartz, the special counsel retained by the Department of Justice to \nevaluate the campaign finance issue, Charles LaBella, recommended to \nthe Attorney General that an independent counsel be appointed.\n  One of the reasons cited by Mr. LaBella for the need for independent \ncounsel was the contribution made by Mr. Schwartz. That reason, among \nmany other reasons, was forwarded by Mr. LaBella to the Attorney \nGeneral, along with a strong recommendation by the Director of the FBI \nthat independent counsel be appointed. Notwithstanding those strong \nrecommendations, the Attorney General declined to appoint independent \ncounsel on a complex subject which has been the matter of extensive \nhearings by the Judiciary subcommittee, which I chair, on Department of \nJustice oversight.\n  It is an extraordinarily difficult matter to pursue the executive \nbranch to find the facts so the Congress can exercise its \nconstitutional responsibility and authority on oversight.\n  Notwithstanding a subpoena issued by the Judiciary Committee calling \nfor the production of the LaBella report, the report by FBI Director \nFreeh, and other reports, and all related documents, returnable on \nApril 20, to this day the Department of Justice has not complied with \nthat subpoena.\n  A hearing was held where Mr. LaBella testified about his \nrecommendation for the appointment of independent counsel, including \nhis view--hypothetically stated during the course of the hearing--that \nthere should have been an investigation of Mr. Schwartz, and that where \na potential quid pro quo was involved--those were Mr. LaBella's words; \nand the language of a quid pro quo is the equivalent of bribe \nlanguage--with the allegation of a bribe, that the President should be \ninvestigated as well. Yet no independent counsel was appointed.\n  The Judiciary subcommittee on oversight is pursuing the documents, is \npursuing the testimony of FBI Director Freeh. It has recently been \ndisclosed that there are other documents which the Department of \nJustice has not provided, notwithstanding the return date is almost 1 \nmonth old--April 20 to today, May 17--so there will be an application \non tomorrow's Judiciary Executive Calendar for a contempt citation as \nto the Department of Justice.\n  The subpoena is issued; some documents are returned; other documents \nare not returned; the full scope of the subpoena is ignored. We are \ntrying to find out what happened on many matters, including the grant \nof a waiver to Loral. It is a long, hard chase to pursue the executive \nbranch.\n  On these stated facts, the question arises inevitably: Is the Clinton \nadministration to be trusted? I am not prepared yet to respond to that \nquestion because our investigation is not complete. But I am prepared \nto say that it is devilishly difficult to pursue the oversight \nfunction, that the Senate, the Judiciary Committee, the Judiciary \nsubcommittee, have been led on a merry, meandering chase trying to find \nanswers, trying to find documents, trying to corral witnesses to find \nout what actually happened in these matters.\n  So when Congress has the authority to decide on normal trade \nrelations as to China, on a year-by-year basis, we ought not to give up \nthat very important, that very powerful prerogative. We ought not to \ngive up on the recommendation of the Clinton administration that China \nshould have it. We ought not to give it to China in the face of their \nflagrant record of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, \nand in the face of the flagrant record by the Clinton administration of \nnot acting with sanctions but even granting affirmative waivers to \nfacilitate the development of Chinese capability for \nballistic projection.\n\n  I believe there is substantial evidence that the People's Republic of \nChina will respond to pressure and to leverage. When we talk about the \nsanctions, we are talking about something which is really in the hands \nof the executive branch. But when we talk about granting permanent \nnormal trade relations, that is a power which is in the hands of the \nCongress. It is very difficult--really impossible--for the Congress to \nlegislate with sufficient specificity to compel the executive branch to \nimpose sanctions.\n  Some of my colleagues are talking about additional legislation. But \nat the end of every line of public policy, at the end of every line of \nsanctions, at the end of the rainbow, every time we take up these \nissues, there is an inevitable grant of authority to the President, as \nChief Executive Officer, to grant a waiver under certain circumstances \nfor national security reasons.\n  It is not practical for the Congress to put into place--or at least \nwe have never been able to do it--a set of circumstances which can be \npredetermined to anticipate every eventuality, to mandate it without \ngiving that kind of discretion to the President. That is why, where we \nhave independent authority, such as granting permanent normal trade \nrelations to China, we ought not to give it up.\n  When we talk about the issue of trusting the administration, trusting \nthe executive branch, I am reminded of President Reagan's comment when \ndealing with the Soviet Union. There was a lot of wisdom in his comment \nabout ``trust, but verify''--``trust, but verify''--deal with the \nSoviet Union, make arrangements with the Soviet Union, but verify to \nsee that it is carried out.\n  There may well be an inherent institutional distrust built into the \nConstitution with the requirement of oversight and with the requirement \nof checks and balances. Perhaps ``institutional distrust'' is a little \nstrong. But in the context of this record, with what China has done, \nwith what Loral has done, to have a waiver granted under these \ncircumstances certainly requires that there be a determination, at the \nvery minimum, on the part of Congress that if we are to trust, we ought \nto verify, and we ought not to give up any of our powerful weapons to \nsee to it that the People's Republic of China does not proliferate \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  In reviewing the efficacy of sanctions, in reviewing the desire of \nChina to have normal trade relations, there was a case involving a \nlibrarian from Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, last year which bears \non this issue suggesting that China does respond to pressure, does \nrespond to leverage.\n  The librarian, Yongyi Song, was within 1 month of being sworn in as a\n\n[[Page S4034]]\n\nnaturalized U.S. citizen, having lived in Pennsylvania for some 10 \nyears, prior to the time that he and his wife Helen took a trip to \nChina last August to study the Cultural Revolution. He is a very \ndistinguished Chinese scholar.\n  In August, he was taken into custody by the People's Republic of \nChina on trumped up charges. His wife similarly was taken into custody. \nShe was released. But he remained in custody and on Christmas Eve was \ncharged with a very serious crime.\n  The family came to me, the college came to me, and with a large \nnumber of Senate cosponsors, I filed a resolution seeking the immediate \nrelease of Yongyi Song on the grounds that he was being detained \nimproperly, illegally, without regard to basic standards of decency and \ncriminal justice protocol.\n  I had a meeting with the Chinese ambassador, and ultimately Yongyi \nSong was released. There is good reason to believe that the pressure, \nthe leverage had some effect on what activity was taken by the People's \nRepublic of China.\n  The condition of normal trade relations with the United States is an \nitem which is very highly prized by the People's Republic of China.\n  And it is one which we ought to maintain in reserve to evaluate their \nconduct on a year-by-year basis. It is my view that when you deal with \nthe question of weapons of mass destruction, and when China arms \nPakistan, and when China arms Libya, and when China arms Iran, when \nChina arms North Korea, those are matters of much greater consequence \nthan the dollar profit to be gained by greater trade with China.\n  When people say, ``If we don't sell it, somebody else will,'' I \nrespond to that comment emphatically by saying we ought not to sell it. \nWe ought to take a leadership role in the world to try to persuade our \nallies not to sell it either because the almighty dollar is not worth \nthe risk we run by giving China a free hand to proliferate weapons of \nmass destruction. If we are to take a cost-benefit ratio relationship, \ntaking a look at our $300 billion defense budget, and apportioning a \npart to what we have to do with the 7th Fleet in the Taiwan Strait when \nthe People's Republic of China threatens Taiwan and a test missile \ndrops there in their bullying efforts, considering what we have to do \nby way of defensive efforts, it is a bad deal in dollars and cents for \nwhatever profit we may gain with our trade with the People's Republic \nof China.\n  Mr. President, the question of human rights is a very important one. \nThe record in China has been deplorable. We have utilized the trade \nissue to try to impose leverage on China, to try to persuade them to \nimprove their human rights. It is a complex conclusion as to whether, \non that issue alone, the people of China might be better off with \nexpanded trade, which would improve the quality of life and living in \nChina, which might move them along the road to democratization which, \nin the long run, might have an overall beneficial affect on human \nrights in China. And on a year-by-year basis, I have supported granting \nmost-favored-nation status. In light of the developments on the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, I am not sure that even \nthat ought to be done on a year-by-year basis. When we take a look at \nthe violation of human rights, including religious persecution by the \nPeople's Republic of China, it is deplorable.\n  Last September, police instructed 12 underground Catholic Church \nleaders in Wenzhou to go to a hotel where they were pressured to join \nthe official Catholic Church. On October 18, last year, police \ndisrupted services at two of Guangzhou's most prominent house churches. \nOne of the pastors, Li Dexian, and his wife were detained, and his \nchurch was ransacked by the police. On August 24, 1999, 40 house church \nmembers were arrested, and the church leaders were sentenced to 1 to 3 \nyears in a reeducation-through-labor camp. Other items are cited, which \nI will have introduced into the Record at the close of my statement.\n  The issue of religious persecution in China is overwhelming. In 1997, \nI introduced S. 772, the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act, and \nlater joined with Senator Nickles in structuring legislation, which \nbecame law on October 27, 1997, the International Religious Freedom Act \nof 1998.\n  I make reference to that during the course of these remarks to point \nout the problems of violation of human rights. It happens again and \nagain and again--repressive action taken by the People's Republic of \nChina. That is a factor which should weigh heavily in our consideration \nof granting of trade relations to the People's Republic of China.\n  When I visited the Ambassador, talking about the case of the \nDickinson librarian, I received a lecture about not meddling in \ninternal Chinese affairs. I responded with a short lecture of my own \nabout human rights and about the appropriate process of decency in \ndealing with criminal matters as a matter of balance, noting that we in \nthe United States have great respect for the 1.2 billion people in \nChina. The Ambassador quickly corrected me, pointing out that there are \n1.250 billion people in the People's Republic of China. I overlooked 50 \nmillion, and perhaps the number had grown during the course of our \nconversation. There is no doubt that China is the upcoming colossus of \nthe world, the dominant power, and that we are going to have to be \nvery, very careful.\n\n  In conclusion--perhaps the two most popular words in any speech--I \nbelieve that we have to give very sober consideration to the totality \nof our relationship with the People's Republic of China. In commenting \nabout a nation of 1.250 billion people, with their potential, it is no \ndoubt that they are becoming a superpower, if they are not already a \nsuperpower. They may become the dominant superpower with that kind of a \npopulation. When they are throwing their weight around by selling \nweapons of mass destruction to the likes of North Korea, Libya, and \nIran, and selling missiles to Pakistan, which threatened world peace \nwith the nuclear exchange between Pakistan and Iran, the United States \nought to retain all the leverage and pressure that it can.\n  The facts are that we cannot rely upon the Clinton administration to \ndo that. It may be that, institutionally, we cannot rely upon any \nadministration to do that and, institutionally, the Constitution gives \noversight authority to the Congress, and the checks and balances in the \nConstitution require that we maintain leverage and see to it that the \nnational interests of the United States are maintained. That is a \nconstitutional responsibility of the Congress. And it is in that \ncontext, from what I have seen on proliferation as chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee and the dereliction I have seen in my \nchairmanship of the oversight committee of the Department of Justice, \nthat I urge my colleagues to vote against the granting of permanent \ntrade relations to the People's Republic of China.\n  My eight years on the Senate Intelligence Committee including the \nchairmanship in 1995 and 1996 and my current chairmanship of the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Department of Justice oversight have \nconvinced me that the People's Republic of China (PRC) threatens world \npeace by flagrantly proliferating weapons of mass destruction to \ncountries like Pakistan, North Korea, Iran and Libya.\n  The Clinton Administration has not only deliberately refused to \nimpose mandated sanctions but has also granted unwarranted waivers \nfacilitating technology transfers to enhance the PRC's missile \ncapabilities. As noted in the New York Times article entitled ``Clinton \nArgues for `Flexibility' Over Sanctions'' on April 28, 1998, President \nClinton admitted that U.S. sanction laws have put ``enormous pressure \non whoever is in the Executive Branch to fudge an evaluation of the \nfacts of whatever is going . . .''\n  Congress should assert its constitutional oversight and checks and \nbalances on Executive Branch excesses by retaining annual review of \ntrade with China to influence the PRC to honor its non-proliferation \nobligations and conform to fundamental standards of civility and \ndecency in the community of nations.\n  With regards to the PRC and matters of proliferation, the essential \nfacts are:\n  According to the unclassified extract of the classified National \nIntelligence Estimate of September 1999, the PRC sold M-11 missiles to \nPakistan in November 1992, which are now pointed at India armed with \nnuclear weapons\n\n[[Page S4035]]\n\ncausing or contributing to the threat of nuclear war between those two \ncountries.\n  The PRC has supplied Iran with ballistic and cruise missiles and \ntechnology for chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, according to a \nreport by the Congressional Research Service entitled ``Chinese \nProliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction: Current Policy Issues,'' \ndated April 13, 2000.\n  PRC has assisted North Korea's missile program by providing specialty \nsteel, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and precision grinding machinery, as \nalso noted in the ``Chinese Proliferation of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction: Current Policy Issues'' CRS report.\n  The PRC is providing assistance to Libya's long-range missile program \nby assisting in the building of a hypersonic wind tunnel which is \nuseful for designing missiles, and cooperating in the development of \nLibya's Al Fatah missile, which has a range of 600 miles, according to \nthe CRS report entitled ``Chinese Proliferation of Weapons of Mass \nDestruction: Current Policy Issues.''\n  The PRC's transfer of M-11 missiles to Pakistan falls under Category \nI of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR). According to the \nU.S. Department of State Bureau of Nonproliferation, Category I of the \nMTCR applies to ``complete missile systems, as well as major systems . \n. .'' as noted in the February 8, 2000 Fact Sheet entitled ``Missile \nTechnology Control Regime (MTCR).''\n  Where there has been a Category I violation, the 1991 National \nDefense Authorization Act (Public Law 101-510) mandates the President \nto deny, for a period of not less than two years, licenses such as the \nlicenses for the technology transferred to the PRC by Hughes Space and \nCommunications, Inc. and Loral Electronics to the PRC, as specified \nherein.\n  On December 21, 1992, a Chinese Long March 2E rocket carrying the \nHughes-manufactured Optus B2 Satellite crashed shortly after takeoff. \nWithout obtaining the required State Department license, Hughes \npersonnel engaged in a series of discussions with Chinese officials in \n1993 and 1994 regarding improvements in the fairing (nose cone) of the \nLong March 2E rocket which resulted in changes. These events were \nclearly outlined in Volume II of the Report of the Select Committee on \nU.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the \nPeople's Republic of China, also known as the Cox Report.\n  On January 26, 1995, a Chinese Long March 2E rocket carrying the \nHughes Apstar 2 satellite exploded approximately 50 seconds after \ntakeoff. A 1998 State Department assessment concluded that, in working \nwith the Chinese to address the cause of the failure, ``Hughes directly \nsupported the Chinese space program in the areas of anomaly analysis/\naccident investigation, telemetry analysis, coupled load analysis, \nhardware design and manufacturing, testing, and weather analysis,'' as \nnoted in the Cox Report.\n  The Cox Committee reviewed the Hughes launches and failure analysis \nand concluded that further inquiry should be conducted to determine: \nfirst, that the kind of information that may have been passed to the \nPRC beyond what has been revealed by Hughes; second, the application, \nif any, of coupled loads analysis to improving PRC ballistic missiles; \nand third, the likelihood that the PRC will in fact incorporate this \nknow-how into their future missile and space programs.\n  Additionally, I was informed in a letter from Wilma Lewis, United \nStates Attorney for the District of Columbia on May 10, 2000, that the \nDepartment of Justice, including the U.S. Attorney's Office for the \nDistrict of Columbia, has undertaken a criminal investigation of the \n1995 failed launch as part of an investigation of a 1996 launch failure \nanalysis involving both Loral and Hughes, but no prosecution decisions \nhave been made even though the statute of limitations has expired on \nthe January 26, 1995 launch and crash.\n  As outlined in the Cox Report, on February 15, 1996, the PRC's Long \nMarch 3B missile exploded with a communication satellite on board which \nwas built by Loral. Following this explosion, Loral and Hughes \ntransmitted to the PRC their assessments of why the rockets failed \nwhich assessment required a prior license from the State Department. As \nnoted in the Cox report, in May, 1997, a classified Department of \nDefense report concluded that Loral and Hughes significantly enhanced \nthe guidance and control systems of the PRC's nuclear ballistic \nmissiles.\n  Following the DoD Report, the Department of Justice began a criminal \ninvestigation of Loral and Hughes. Then, Loral applied for a waiver \nfrom the Clinton Administration to launch another satellite from a \nChinese rocket.\n  Bernard Schwartz, Chief Executive Officer of Loral, contributed \napproximately $1,500,000 to President Clinton's 1996 campaign. C. \nMichael Armstrong, Chairman of Hughes, who lobbied the Administration \nagainst sanctions and for expansion of satellite exports to China, had \na potential conflict of interest from his contemporaneous service as \nChairman of the President Clinton's Export Advisory Council.\n  A January 1998 draft memorandum from National Security Samuel R. \nBerger to the President regarding the Loral waiver included the issue \nof the PRC transfers to Iran of C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles. The \nInternal State Department correspondence dated December 3, 1997 noted \nthat: ``In light of our ongoing review of China's transfers to Iran of \nC-802 missiles, you should be aware that if a determination were made \ntriggering sanctions under the Iran-Iraq Nonproliferation Act, the \nsanctions might prohibit the export of satellites licensed but not yet \nexported.''\n  The final memorandum from Mr. Berger to the President on February 12, \n1998 did not include the concerns of the Department of State regarding \nthe PRC's transfers to Iran.\n  As clearly noted in Maureen Tucker's memorandum for Samuel Berger, \nentitled ``Request for Presidential National Interest Waiver for \nChinasat-8 Communications Satellite Project,'' of January 30, 1998, the \nDepartment of Justice through a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, \nobjected to a presidential grant of that waiver on the grounds that ``a \nnational interest waiver in this case could have a significant adverse \nimpact on any prosecution that might take place based on a pending \ninvestigation of export violations by Loral,'' according to the \nmemorandum for the President from Samuel L. Berger, Larry Stein, and \nDaniel K. Tarullo entitled ``Request for Presidential National Interest \nWaiver for Chinasat 8 Communications Satellite Project,'' dated \nFebruary 12, 1998.\n  As I was informed in a letter from Wilma Lewis, United States \nAttorney for the District of Columbia on May 10, 2000, Main Justice, in \ncollaboration with the U.S. Attorney's Office in the District of \nColumbia, has been investigating the Loral/Hughes matters for three \nyears with only two, sometimes one, attorney(s) assigned to the case.\n  On May 4, 2000, the Judiciary Subcommittee requested a briefing from \nMr. Berger, and was later advised that he would not be available until \nJune 13th. By letter dated May 11, 2000, the Judiciary Subcommittee \nrequested the briefing before Mr. Berger's scheduled departure from the \nUnited States on May 16th so the briefing would occur before the \nCongressional votes on PNTR. The request was rejected.\n  Without drawing any conclusions at this stage, questions are \nobviously raised by the long delays in the Department of Justice \ninvestigation of Hughes and Loral, including allowing the statute of \nlimitations to run on the January 26, 1995 explosion of the Hughes \nsatellite, the limited resources devoted to the Hughes/Loral \ninvestigation and the issue of possible undue influence by Mr. Schwartz \nor Mr. Armstrong. A further question arises as to whether the delays by \nthe Clinton Administration seek to defer answers on these sensitive \nissues until after the PNTR Congressional votes.\n  Perhaps the Department of Justice will satisfactorily answer these \nquestions even though the Attorney General rejected the recommendation \nof Charles G. LaBella, Esquire, for the appointment of Independent \nCounsel on the President and Mr. Schwartz on Mr. Schwartz's \ncontribution. If not, Congressional oversight should seek answers \nincluding Mr. Berger's decision to omit the Department of State \nconcerns on the PRC transfers to Iran of C-802 anti-ship cruise \nmissiles from the final memorandum to the President.\n\n[[Page S4036]]\n\n  Even without answers to those questions, the record is clear that the \nPRC has been guilty of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \nthe Clinton Administration has not only not acted to stop that \nproliferation, but has assisted with the grant of the Loral waiver.\n  For those who look to profits from increased trade with the PRC, what \nis the cost/benefit ratio of building, maintaining and sending the 7th \nFleet to the Taiwan Strait with the added profits from increased China \ntrade? As a matter of basic morality, the U.S. should not engage in \nsuch a balancing test or even consider rewarding the PRC's aggressive \ntactics. But to those who look to trade profits, let them draw the \nbalance sheet and apportion the appropriate part of the $300 billion \nDefense budget to the PRC's threat to Taiwan. While hard to calculate, \nit very likely costs U.S. taxpayers a great deal more than U.S. \nconsumers would benefit from cheaper Chinese goods. But, more \nimportantly, it is not the right thing to do.\n\n\n                        HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS\n\n  For decades, the PRC has violated human rights illustrated by the \nTiananmen Square massacre. In voting, I have supported extending the \nPRC's NTR status on a year by year basis in the past. In doing so, I \nhave weighed the potential long-range benefits to the people of China \nfrom NTR status with a view that as China prospered and moved toward \ndemocracy, there would be a concomitant improvement of human rights. \nThat improvement, in my opinion, depends upon continuing pressure and \nleverage on the Chinese government.\n\n  I saw this firsthand from my experience with a constituent, Mr. \nYongyi Song, a librarian at Dickinson College in Carlisle, \nPennsylvania. Mr. Song had resided in Carlisle for approximately ten \nyears and was due to be sworn in as a United States citizen in \nSeptember, 1999 when he and his wife, Helen, took a trip last August to \nthe Peoples Republic of China where he intended to pursue his studies \nof the cultural revolution. On August 7, 1999, Mr. and Mrs. Song were \narrested and detained without cause. Mrs. Song was released on November \n16, 1999. On Christmas Eve, Mr. Song was charged with ``purchase and \nillegal provision of intelligence to persons outside China'' without \nany foundation.\n  At the request of the Song family and Dickinson College officials, I \nfiled a resolution with eight Senate co-sponsors expressing the sense \nof the Congress that, the Government of the People's Republic of China \nshould immediately release from prison and drop all criminal charges \nagainst Yongyi Song, and should guarantee in their legal system fair \nand professional treatment of criminal defense lawyers and conduct fair \nand open trials. I then sought a meeting with Chinese Ambassador Li \nZhaoxing which was scheduled for 11:30 am on Friday, January 28, 2000. \nEarlier that morning I heard a rumor that Dr. Song was being released.\n  My meeting with Ambassador Li Zhaoxing was pleasant and cordial \nalthough each of us expressed our views in direct blunt terms. \nAmbassador Li Zhaoxing objected to U.S. protests on Mr. Song and other \nhuman rights issues on the ground that we were meddling in China's \ninternal affairs. I countered that Mr. Song was entitled to the \nprotection of the United States government and that human rights were a \nuniversal matter so that our intervention did not constitute officious \nmeddling in their internal affairs. When I commented that we had great \nrespect for the power of China with 1,200,000,000 people, I was \npromptly corrected by Ambassador Li Zhaoxing that the correct figure \nwas 1,250,000,000 people with the Ambassador losing no time in telling \nme the rapid growth of China's increasing power.\n  On the Senate floor, I argued that the People's Republic of China \nshould have to observe minimal standards of decency and civility if \nChina wished to gain the benefits of membership in the world community \nincluding permanent trade status and membership in the World Trade \nOrganization. In my opinion, the leverage from the Senate resolution \nand China's interest in membership in the World Trade Organization or \nNormal Trade Relations status were instrumental in securing the release \nof Mr. Yongyi Song.\n  Another area of serious human rights abuse in China that has been \nbrought to my attention in recent years is the persecution of \nChristians and other religious minorities. The PRC officially permits \nonly two recognized Christian denominations--one Protestant and one \nCatholic--to operate openly. As a result, unapproved religious groups, \nincluding all other Protestant and Catholic groups, experience \nrepression and persecution by the government of the PRC.\n  In the past year, religious services were forcibly broken up and \nchurch leaders and followers were fined, detained, and imprisoned. For \ninstance, in September 1999, police instructed 12 underground Catholic \nchurch leaders in Wenzhou to go to a hotel, where they were pressured \nto join the official Catholic church. On October 18, 1999, police \ndisrupted services at two of Guangzhou's most prominent house churches. \nOne of the pastors, Li Dexian and his wife were detained, and his \nchurch was ransacked by the police. On August 24, 1999, 40 house church \nmembers were arrested, and the church leaders were sentenced to 1 to 3 \nyears in a reeducation-through-labor camp.\n  In an effort to combat such religious persecution in China and other \ncountries around the world, I introduced S. 772, the ``Freedom from \nReligious Persecution Act'' in May, 1997. The following Spring, I \nworked with Senator Nickles to produce the text of S. 1868, the \n``International Religious Freedom Act of 1998'' which became law in \nOctober 27, 1998 and required, among other things, that the State \nDepartment issue an annual report on religious freedom around the \nworld. The first State Department report on religious persecution was \nissued in September, 1999, and it listed China as one of the ``most \nrepressive nations.''\n  Another area of great concern to me is the Chinese system of criminal \njustice. Although the Chinese legal system was significantly reformed \nin 1997, on paper, the PRC has not fully implemented these reforms. The \njudicial system in many cases denies criminal defendants basic legal \nsafeguards and due process. For example, defendants continue to be \nsubjected to torture, forced confessions, arbitrary arrest and \nprolonged detention. Police often use loopholes in the law to \ncircumvent a defendant's right to seek counsel. Furthermore, lawyers \nwho try to defend their clients aggressively often are harassed or \ndetained by police and prosecutors. For example, on January 6, 2000 the \nNew York Times reported on the case of Liu Jian, a criminal defense \nattorney, who was detained in July 1998. After defending a local \nofficial charged with taking bribes, Liu was charged with ``illegally \nobtaining evidence'' and was detained for 5 months. He eventually pled \nguilty in exchange for a light sentence, but his criminal record \nprevents him from practicing law.\n  There are virtually daily media reports of additional PRC's human \nrights violations. For example, a front page New York Times story on \nMay 8, 2000 reports Chinese leaders criticizing prominent academics and \nforbidding or punishing newspapers from running their articles. The \nsame edition of the New York Times reports forcing changes in \nPrinceton's language program because of a critical essay in the Beijing \nSocial Science Journal.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  The record of the Clinton Administration's winking at the PRC's \nflagrant proliferation violations, in conjunction with Congress's \nconstitutional responsibility for oversight and checks & balances of \nExecutive Branch excesses calls for our retaining annual review of \ntrade relations with China.\n  Ignoring obvious facts which mandate sanctions calls into question \nmany U.S. laws on sanctions and adherence to the rule of law generally, \nleaving critical questions of national security to presidential \n``fudging''. The frequently heard plea ``if we don't sell it to them, \nsomeone else will'' should be forcefully met with U.S. policy not to \nsell and U.S. leadership to persuade other nations not to sell to rogue \ncountries.\n  The record does show that the PRC responds to pressure to achieve \nhighly-prized trade relations with the United States. Accordingly, we \nshould use PNTR to influence the PRC to honor its international \nobligations not to\n\n[[Page S4037]]\n\nproliferate and to conform to fundamental standards of civility and \ndecency of the international community of nations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a press release I issued \nyesterday be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Senator Specter Opposes Permanent Normal Trade Relations With China\n\n       In a Senate floor statement scheduled for May 17, 2000, \n     Senator Arlen Specter announced his intention to vote against \n     Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with the People's \n     Republic of China (PRC) and urged his Congressional \n     colleagues to do the same.\n       Senator Specter based his opposition to PNTR on China's \n     flagrant proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the \n     Clinton Administration's (1) refusing to impose mandated \n     sanctions and (2) granting a waiver to enhance China's \n     missile capabilities, plus the PRC's deplorable record on \n     human rights.\n       Senator Specter cited:\n       (1) The PRC's sales of weapons of mass destruction to \n     Pakistan, North Korea, Iran and Libya.\n       (2) The PRC's sale of M-11 missiles to Pakistan, which are \n     now pointed at India threatening nuclear war on the sub-\n     continent, was a Category 1 infraction mandating sanctions to \n     preclude licensing of technology such as that transferred by \n     Loral and Hughes to the PRC.\n       (3) Without obtaining the required license from the State \n     Department, Loral and Hughes provided information to the PRC \n     on a missile explosion which the Department of Defense \n     concluded significantly enhanced the PRC's nuclear ballistic \n     missiles.\n       (4) After the Department of Justice initiated a criminal \n     investigation of Loral and Hughes for those disclosures to \n     the PRC, Loral applied for a Presidential waiver to launch \n     another satellite from a Chinese rocket.\n       (5) Notwithstanding a DoJ objection that a presidential \n     waiver would have a ``significant adverse impact on any \n     prosecution'', President Clinton granted the waiver.\n       Noting President Clinton's close relationship to CEOs from \n     Loral and Hughes and the President's admission that there was \n     ``enormous pressure * * * to fudge the facts * * * '' on \n     sanction laws, Senator Specter concluded that Congress should \n     assert its Constitutional oversight and checks & balances on \n     Executive Branch excesses by retaining annual review of trade \n     with China.\n       Senator Specter served eight years on the Senate \n     Intelligence Committee including the chairmanship in 1995-96 \n     and currently chairs the Judiciary Subcommittee on Department \n     of Justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/17/senate-section/article/S4037-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4037-S4096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001--Continued\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from California to \nspeak on the Daschle amendment that is before the body this morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I want to use my 15 minutes to do \nthree things. The first two are to debunk certain myths that the \nNational Rifle Association has developed. The first is the myth they \nhave developed with respect to the second amendment to the \nConstitution. Second is the myth that the gun laws are not being \nenforced. The third item I would like to discuss is the juvenile \njustice bill that has been awaiting conference now for about a year.\n  Let me begin by talking about the NRA claim that the second amendment \nto the Constitution gives every individual the right to own any kind of \nweapon, no matter how powerful or deadly:\n  From the Derringer to a Bazooka. From the .22 to .50 caliber weapon. \nFrom a revolver that holds 5 bullets to weapons of war with drums of \n250 rounds. From the copper jacketed bullets to the black talon that \nrips apart organs as it passes through a body.\n  The fact of the matter is that the Supreme Court has never struck \ndown a single gun control law on second amendment grounds. Let me just \nquickly read to you the second amendment. It says:\n\n       A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security \n     of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear \n     arms shall not be infringed.\n\n  Contrary to the constant claims of the NRA, the meaning of the second \namendment has been well-settled for more than 60 years --ever since the \n1939 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Miller. In that \ncase, the defendant was charged with transporting an unregistered \nsawed-off shotgun across state lines.\n  In rejecting a motion to dismiss the case on second amendment \ngrounds, the Court held that the ``obvious purpose'' of the second \namendment was ``to assure the continuation and render possible the \neffectiveness'' of the State militia. Because a sawed-off shotgun was \nnot a weapon that would be used by a state militia--like the National \nGuard--the second amendment was in no way applicable to that case, said \nthe Court.\n  More than 40 years after the 1939 Miller case, in the 1980 case of \nLewis v. United States, the Supreme Court again held that ``the Second \nAmendment guarantees no right to keep and bear a firearm that does not \nhave `some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of \na well regulated militia.' '' Again, the Court pointed to the militia \nas the key to the right to keep and bear arms.\n  Since Miller, the Supreme Court has addressed the second amendment \ntwice more, upholding New Jersey's strict gun control law in 1969 and \nupholding the Federal law banning felons from possessing guns in 1980.\n  Furthermore, twice--in 1965 and 1990--the Supreme Court has held that \nthe term ``well-regulated militia'' refers to the National Guard.\n  And in the early 1980s, the Supreme Court even refused to take up a \nSecond Amendment challenge, leaving established precedent in place. \nAfter the town of Morton Grove, Illinois, passed an ordinance banning \nhandguns--making certain reasonable exceptions for law enforcement, the \nmilitary, and collectors--the town was sued on second amendment \ngrounds.\n  The Illinois Supreme Court and the U.S. Seventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals ruled that not only was the ordinance valid, but went further \nto say--explicitly--that there was no individual right to keep and bear \narms under the second amendment. In October 1983, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt declined to hear an appeal of this ruling, allowing the lower \ncourt rulings to stand.\n  I was mayor of San Francisco when this took place, and I put forward \nlegislation in the early 1980s to ban possession of handguns in San \nFrancisco since at that time the homicide rate was soaring. The \nlegislation passed. It was subsequently preempted by State law in a \ncase brought and carried up to the State supreme court on the basis \nthat the State of California had preempted the areas of licensing, of \nregistration, and of possession, but it was not struck down on second \namendment rights grounds.\n  Perhaps this history is what led former Supreme Court Chief Justice \nWarren Burger in 1991 to refer to the second amendment as ``the subject \nof one of the greatest pieces of fraud, I repeat the word `fraud,' on \nthe American public by special interest groups that I have ever seen in \nmy lifetime. . .[the NRA] ha(s) misled the American people and they, I \nregret to say, they have had far too much influence on the Congress of \nthe United States than as a citizen I would like to see--and I am a gun \nman.'' This was Warren Burger--a Nixon appointee to the Court.\n  Burger also wrote,\n\n       The very language of the Second Amendment refutes any \n     argument that it was intended to guarantee every citizen an \n     unfettered right to any kind of weapon. . .[S]urely the \n     Second Amendment does not remotely guarantee every person the \n     constitutional right to have a `Saturday Night Special' or a \n     machine gun without any regulation whatever. There is no \n     support in the Constitution for the argument that federal and \n     state governments are powerless to regulate the purchase of \n     such firearms . . .\n\n  Erwin Griswold, former dean of Harvard Law School and Solicitor \nGeneral in the Nixon Administration said in 1990 that ``It is time for \nthe NRA and its followers in Congress to stop trying to twist the \nSecond Amendment from a reasoned (if antiquated) empowerment for a \nmilitia into a bulletproof personal right for anyone to wield deadly \nweaponry beyond legislative control.''\n  All told, since the Miller decision, lower Federal and State courts \nhave addressed the meaning of the second amendment in more than thirty \ncases. In every case, up until March of 1999, the courts decided that \nthe second amendment refers to the right to keep and bear arms only in \nconnection with a State militia--in other words, the National Guard, \nnot an individual.\n  And the NRA is clearly aware of this history. Despite all of the \nNRA's rhetoric and posturing on this issue, they\n\n[[Page S4038]]\n\nknow that the second amendment does nothing whatsoever to limit \nreasonable gun control measures. In fact, in its legal challenges to \nfederal firearms laws like the Brady law and my assault weapons ban, \nthe National Rifle Association has made no mention of the second \namendment.\n  When the Ninth Circuit expressly rejected a second amendment \nchallenge to California's 1989 assault weapons ban, the NRA elected to \nnot even appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court, because they knew \nthey would lose.\n  In fact, even when part of the Brady law was struck down as \nunconstitutional, that decision was not based on the second amendment, \nbut on a narrow States' rights issue.\n  Another suit against the 1994 assault weapons ban was based on a \n``bill of attainder'' argument, that Congress illegally targeted gun \nmanufacturers--again, the suit is not based on the second amendment.\n  Elsewhere around the country, the NRA has argued that various gun \ncontrol laws violate the first amendment, or the privacy rights of gun \nowners, or even the equal protection clause because NRA members are \ntreated differently than others. The second amendment is never even \nbrought up.\n  Nonetheless, many on the other side of the aisle may point to the \none, single, lone exception to the long history of second amendment \njurisprudence.\n  On March 30, 1999, a United States District Judge in Texas struck \ndown a federal law making it a felony to possess a firearm while under \na domestic restraining order.\n  In the Texas case, a man in the midst of a divorce proceeding was \naccused of threatening to kill his wife's lover. Although put under a \nrestraining order and therefore barred from possessing a firearm under \nfederal law, the man was subsequently caught with a gun and indicted \nfor violating the ban. U.S. District Court Judge Sam Cummings dismissed \nthe indictment, in part because the federal law, he said, had the \neffect of ``criminalizing'' a ``law-abiding citizen's Second Amendment \nrights.''\n  This was the first time such a decision was made by a federal judge, \nbut it is important to note that this decision has been appealed. There \nis absolutely no reason to believe that the Supreme Court, if it ever \ngot to that level, would uphold this decision.\n  The Texas decision clearly flies in the face of 60 years of second \namendment precedent and, as Handgun Control has said, ``can only be \nviewed as a renegade decision.''\n  In fact, in his opinion, Judge Cummings was unable to follow usual \njudicial practice and cite legal precedent supporting his decision, \nbecause no such precedent exists.\n  This ruling is, as I have said, being appealed and since that \ndecision, two federal courts, including a higher circuit court, have \nruled that the second amendment does not guarantee an individual right \nto keep and bear arms.\n  That is the first myth.\n  Now let me talk about the second myth being perpetrated by the \nNational Rifle Association. That is that our current gun laws are not \nbeing enforced. Members have heard over and over again: We have the gun \nlaws; now go out and enforce them.\n  Of course we should be enforcing our gun laws. And of course we are. \nAnd the evidence clearly shows that gun prosecutions are up. In fact, \nsince the passage of the Brady Bill just seven years ago, more than \n500,000 felons, fugitives, mentally ill individuals, and stalkers have \nwalked into a gun dealer and walked right back out again without a gun \nbecause of a background check.\n  The NRA argues that prosecutions are down, but they fail to correctly \ninterpret the statistics to recognize that state and federal \ncooperation have actually led to an increase in combined prosecutions \nduring the Clinton administration.\n  In fact, since 1992 the total number of federal and state \nprosecutions combined has increased sharply, and about 25 percent more \ncriminals are sent to prison for state and federal weapons offenses \nthan in 1992--from 20,300 prosecutions to 25,100.\n  Federal numbers may be down, but there is a reason for it. The \nfederal government is now focusing its prosecutions on higher level \noffenders, and turning the lower level offenders over to the states for \nprosecution. In fact, the number of prosecutions of higher level \noffenders--those sentenced to 5 or more years in jail--has gone up \nnearly 41 percent in 7 years. And the number of inmates in federal \nprison on firearm or arson charges have increased 51 percent from 1993 \nto 1998.\n  Just last month, Senator Kohl of Wisconsin and I introduced an \namendment which would expand Project Exile to 50 cities and provide law \nenforcement with ballistics technology that will make it far easier to \nidentify and punish the perpetrators of gun violence. And I also \nsupport the President's request to fund at least 500 additional ATF \nagents and 1000 new prosecutors to focus on guns.\n  But here's the rub, and here's the contradiction of the National \nRifle Association. On the one hand, they say enforce the law, and then \nthey go out and they oppose any effort to strengthen those laws. The \nNRA fought the Brady Bill for 10 years. The NRA defeated all attempts \nto allow the consumer product safety commission to regulate the safety \nof firearms. The NRA in 1986 got legislation passed which restricts \nAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms from inspections of gun dealers to once a \nyear. Even dealers who are the source of hundreds of gun crimes cannot \nroutinely be inspected more than once a year without a special court \nwarrant.\n  For years, the NRA has even blocked the ATF computerization of gun \nsale records from gun dealers that have gone out of business. As a \nresult, when a gun is traced as part of a criminal investigation, the \nfiles have to be retrieved manually from warehouses where old records \nare kept. This can add days or even weeks to an investigation. By the \ntime the records are found, the trail may already be cold.\n  And most importantly, the National Rifle Association fights against \nfunding law enforcement agencies at levels adequate to enforce our \ncurrent laws.\n  As former New York City police commissioner William Bratten has said, \n``The National Rifle Association has strenuously opposed increased \nfinancing for ATF and has successfully lobbied against giving it the \nauthority to investigate the origin of gun sales.''\n  The result: ATF has been left underfunded, understaffed and unable to \nadequately enforce all the laws on the books.\n  And the simple fact is that even if enforced, the current laws aren't \nenough. There so riddled with NRA induced loopholes, that they are easy \nto get around. And that's why you see children killing children today. \nGuns left loaded without safety locks, with no responsibility in the \nlaw, civil or otherwise, for parents to keep those guns and weapons in \nsafe storage.\n  Let me speak as a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, this body passed a comprehensive bill to address the \nproblem of juvenile crime almost exactly one year ago. The House \nfollowed suit a month later. Both bills passed by wide margins, and \nthis Nation was given hope that some solutions to the problems of gun \nviolence and juvenile crime were close at hand.\n  Yet simple fact is, the conference committee has met only once--in \nearly August of last year. No real issues have been discussed. No \nprogress has been made. The bills sit in legislative purgatory, \napparently never to see the light of day again.\n  Democrats in both Houses have been ready and willing to debate these \nissues in conference for months now. But time continues to tick by. It \nnow seems clear that these bills will die a quiet death at the end of \nthis session because the NRA opposes certain targeted gun laws passed \nby this body to keep the guns out of the hands of children, out of the \nhands of juveniles, and out of the hands of criminals.\n  There is no one I have ever spoken to who believes a gun should not \nbe sold without a trigger lock. There is no one I have ever spoken to \nwho believes an assault weapon should be purchased by a juvenile. There \nis no one I have ever spoken to who believes we should not plug the \nloophole in my assault weapons legislation which permits the \nimportation of clips, drums, or strips of more than 10 bullets--even \nthe NRA agrees to that. And there is no one I know, outside of the \nNational Rifle Association, who believes that two teenagers from \nColumbine should be able to go to a gun show and buy two assault\n\n[[Page S4039]]\n\nweapons with no questions asked. That is what this is all about. As a \nresult, all of the important issues we debated will go un-addressed: \nGang violence, juvenile detention, firearm regulation reform, and a \nhost of other problems will go unsolved.\n\n  Mr. President, this demonstrates just how deeply these bodies are \ndominated by this one special interest group--these people who \nfervently resist any regulations on weapons, no matter how mild, no \nmatter how targeted, and no matter how much the American people want \nit.\n  The Columbine incident shocked this nation to its core and this \nCongress to action. But since we passed that bill one year ago, we have \ncontinued to see tragedy after tragedy, all because we live in a nation \nawash with guns, and we won't stand up to the NRA.\n  In Atlanta, we saw a distressed day trader gun down his family and \ncolleagues. In California, a hateful bigot killed a postal worker and \nthen wounded five others at the North Valley Jewish Community Center in \nGranada Hills. The pictures of those young children being led away from \nthe scene of the tragedy were not only heart-wrenching, but also \nclearly depicted the trickle-down of gun crimes in this country. Now \nthe victims are young children.\n  We even saw one six year old child bringing a handgun to school, \napparently in retaliation for a slight the day before, and use that gun \nto kill another 6 year old.\n  And every day since Columbine, another 12 children have died from \ngunshot wounds, in incidents of gun violence that go relatively \nunreported, and with outcomes not so public.\n  These incidents will never stop until we do something to stop them. \nThe death rate will never be diminished unless we stand up and take \naction.\n  The Senate-passed juvenile justice bill is not an over-reaching \nstatement with regards to gun control. Rather, the provisions in the \njuvenile justice bill are small, reasonable measures to make a \ndifference in the lives of our children. None of those provisions \nshould be controversial. Let me describe just a few of these \nprovisions.\n  This bill includes four common sense provisions to address gun \nviolence:\n  A ban on juvenile possession of assault weapons and high capacity \nammunition magazines;\n  Closing the gun show loophole;\n  Requiring safety locks with every handgun sold in America;\n  And my provision to ban the importation of large capacity ammunition \nmagazines.\n  Let me talk just a bit about this last amendment--my amendment to ban \nthe importation of large capacity ammunition feeding devices.\n  The ``Large Capacity Ammunition Magazine Import Ban Act of 1999'' \npassed the Senate as an amendment to S. 254 by voice vote, after a \nmotion to table failed 59-39. The same amendment, offered by Judiciary \nChairman Henry Hyde on the House floor, passed by unanimous consent in \nthe House.\n  This amendment would stop further importation of large-capacity \nammunition clips by eliminating the grandfather clause--as to these \nimported clips--that was included in the 1994 Assault Weapons Ban. \nLarge-capacity ammunition clips are ammunition feeding devices, such as \nclips, magazines, drums and belts, which hold more than ten rounds of \nammunition.\n  This legislation would not ban the sale or possession of clips \nalready in circulation. And the domestic manufacture of these clips is \nalready illegal for most purposes. Under current law, U.S. \nmanufacturers are already prohibited from manufacturing large capacity \nclips for sale to the general public, but foreign companies continue to \ndo so.\n  As the author of the 1994 provision, I can assure you that this was \nnot our intent. We intended to ban the future manufacture of all high \ncapacity clips, leaving only a narrow clause allowing for the \nimportation of clips already on their way to this country. Instead, \nBATF has allowed millions of foreign clips into this country, with no \ntrue method of determining date of manufacture.\n  In fact, from July, 1996 to March, 1998, BATF approved over 2.5 \nmillion large-capacity clips for importation into the country. And \nrecently, that number has sky-rocketed even further. Between March of \n1998 and March of last year, BATF approved more than 11.4 million \nlarge-capacity clips for importation into America. Since that time, \nthere have been millions more as well.\n  The clips come from at least 20 different countries, from Austria to \nZimbabwe.\n  These clips come in sizes ranging from 15 rounds per clip to 30, 75, \n90, or even 250 rounds per clip.\n  At least 40,000 clips of 250-rounds came from England;\n  Two million 15-round magazines came from Italy;\n  10,000 clips of 70-rounds came from the Czech Republic;\n  156,000 30-round clips came from Bulgaria;\n  And the list goes on, and on.\n  Mr. President, 250-round clips have no sporting purpose. They are not \nused for self defense. They have only one use--the purposeful killing \nof other men, women and children.\n  It is both illogical and irresponsible to permit foreign companies to \nsell items to the American public--particularly items that are so often \nused for deadly purposes--that U.S. companies are prohibited from \nselling.\n  Yet this amendment, along with the rest of the juvenile justice bill, \nremains stalled in conference.\n  And the juvenile justice bill being held hostage by the NRA is not \njust a gun bill. That legislation also contains countless provisions to \nstem the tide of youth violence in general:\n  A comprehensive package of measures I authored with Senator Hatch to \nfight criminal gangs; and\n  The James Guelff Body Armor Act, which contains reforms to take body \narmor out of the hands of criminals and put it into the hands of \npolice;\n  And the Senate bill also provides for:\n  A new $700 million juvenile justice block grant program for states \nand localities, representing a significant increase in federal aid to \nthe states for juvenile crime control programs, including:\n  Additional law enforcement and juvenile court personnel;\n  Juvenile detention facilities; and\n  Prevention programs to keep juveniles out of trouble before they turn \nto crime.\n  The bill contains provisions regarding the nature and amount of \ncontact allowed between juvenile offenders and adult prisoners. These \nare important provisions relating to the safety of youth offenders that \nhave been worked out through extensive negotiations for months, yet \nthey, too, remain in limbo.\n  The bill encourages increased accountability for juveniles, through \nthe implementation of graduated sanctions to ensure that subsequent \noffenses are treated with increasing severity\n  The bill reforms juvenile record systems, through improved record \nkeeping and increased access to juvenile records by police, courts, and \nschools, so that a court or school dealing with a juvenile in \nCalifornia can know if he has committed violent offenses in Arizona; \nand\n  And the bill extends federal sentences for juveniles who commit \nserious violent felonies.\n  There are some key issues that still need to be resolved, including \nthe issue of who gets to decide whether a young offender is tried as a \njuvenile or an adult. It is my hope that the conference committee will \ngive judges greater discretion in this area. But if the conference \ncommittee never meets, this issue--like so many others--can never be \nresolved.\n  Mr. President, all of the common-sense provisions in this bill are \nnow at risk of disappearing without a trace, and I urge the majority to \nproceed with the conference and come to a compromise.\n  Let me now turn to more recent events.\n  Mr. President, this past weekend, we saw a formidable gathering of \npeople united in a common cause--750,000 at the National Mall and tens \nof thousands in other cities throughout America--marching in support of \ncommon-sense gun laws.\n  These mothers, fathers, sons and daughters gathered together for one \npurpose--to tell this Congress that enough is enough. These moms and \nothers were saying that we can, should and shall put an end to the \nviolence that is taking 80 lives a day--12 of them children--in our \nnation. We must pass sensible legislation to prevent gun violence.\n\n[[Page S4040]]\n\n  There are those who will try to dismiss the Million Mom March as a \none-shot affair, a day in the sun on the Mall, but I say such cynics do \nnot know the power of a woman whose child is in jeopardy. Such cynics \ndo not know the power of a million women united on behalf of the safety \nof their families.\n  There are those, such as the National Rifle Association, who have \neven sought to deride the Million Mom March, as ``a political agenda \nmasquerading as motherhood'' in full-page newspaper ads.\n  While at the same time bragging about working out of the White House \nafter November, the NRA said it was ``shameful to seize a cherished \nholiday for political advantage.''\n  But women throughout America have a message for the NRA--your time is \nup. It's a message so well articulated in a Tapestry on the Million Mom \nMarch web site. On this Tapestry, thousands of women have had their say \nabout the senseless violence taking more than 30,000 lives a year.\n  I'll pick out just a couple of these messages to share with you \ntoday. Here's Kerry Foley, Chevy Chase, Maryland: ``I am the mother of \nthree and I am an emergency medicine doctor. I have seen the carnage of \ngun violence first hand--a high school student shot dead while mowing \nthe lawns by a mentally ill person. A man who shot his brother to death \nin an argument over the TV remote. We are not safe. Our kids are not \nsafe. I'll be at the march to add my voice to all of yours.''\n  And Karen Farmer, from Littleton, Colorado, ``The right for my child \nto live, far outweighs anyone's `right' to own anything.''\n  Mr. President, I ask approval to submit this Tapesty as part of the \nRecord. It demonstrates the spirit, determination and commitment of \nwomen throughout America, the one force that I believe can finally \nbreak the gridlock that is keeping even the most common-sense gun laws \nfrom passage.\n  This march was the culmination of a lot of pent up grief and \nfrustration at the inability of Congress to act.\n  On August 10, 1999, a hate-filled madman opened fire at a Jewish \nCommunity Center in Granada Hills, California, wounding five people, \nthree of them children.\n  This was but the latest mass shooting across our great country. Who \ncan forget the horrors of Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas, and \nLittleton, Colorado to name just a few. But on that day last August, \nthe dream of the Million Mom March was born.\n  Mothers from New Jersey to California shared that dream and joined \ntogether this past Sunday, urging Congress to pass the four common-\nsense gun measures held in Conference Committee as part of the Juvenile \nJustice Bill since last June. And urging this Congress to approve new \nlegislation for firearm licensing and registration.\n  Mr. President I have been working on this issue for months, with \ncommunity groups dedicated to preventing gun violence, with law \nenforcement officials, other Senate offices and even individuals \ninvolved in the Million Mom March.\n  As Donna Dees-Thomases, organizer of the March, said ``licensing and \nregistration is the foundation of sane gun laws. Without these basic \nmeasures, even current gun laws cannot be adequately enforced.''\n  The product of our work is the ``Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale \nAct of 2000,'' a bill I introduced last week with the support of my \ncolleagues, Senators Lautenberg, Boxer and Schumer.\n  I began working on this legislation after the shooting at the Jewish \nCommunity Center in Granada Hills, when I became determined to find a \nbetter way to ensure that only responsible citizens have access to \nfirearms.\n  I believe that this legislation will begin to address three key \nproblems facing our nation.\n  First, too many criminals are finding it easy to obtain firearms. Our \nsystem of background checks has been a success--the Brady Law has \nstopped more than 500,000 felons, fugitives, stalkers and mentally ill \napplicants from obtaining firearms.\n  However, under the Brady Law a background check is required only when \na gun is purchased through a licensed dealer. Gun shows and private \nsales have long provided a safe haven for those persons who are not \nlegally entitled to buy a gun.\n  Only with a comprehensive system of licensing and records of sale can \nwe hope to limit these illegal sales. By requiring that gun owners be \nlicensed, that every transfer be processed through a licensed gun \ndealer, and that gun dealers record the transfer of guns, we will begin \nto limit the number of gun sales that fall between the cracks.\n  Second is the problem of gun tracing. Gun tracing is the process \nthrough which law enforcement can take a gun found at the scene of a \ncrime and, as the name suggests, trace it back to its owner. In this \nway, many crimes have been solved and many dangerous perpetrators \ncaught.\n  But without a national system of licensing and sale records, and \nwithout universal background checks, law enforcement often finds it \nimpossible to track down the perpetrators of these crimes. Guns left \nbehind, even those with serial numbers, turn out to be no more than \ndead ends for criminal investigators, because they may have been sold \nmany times--even legally--with no background checks, no records kept, \nand no accountability.\n  If we begin to record the transfers of these guns, we make it easier \nfor law enforcement to trace a crime gun to the perpetrator of the \ncrime.\n  For this same reason, Senator Kohl and I recently introduced \nlegislation to further the efforts of law enforcement to establish so-\ncalled ``gun fingerprints''--ballistics information that will allow law \nenforcement to trace those who use guns in crime even when the firearm \nitself is not found at the crime scene.\n  Third, and what I believe is the primary benefit of this legislation, \nwe place a greater burden of responsibility on those persons who own \ndangerous firearms.\n  As Mike Hennessy, the Sheriff of San Francisco, recently pointed out \nin a letter to me, ``Most importantly,'' this legislation ``places \nresponsibility for the tragic consequences of children having access to \nfirearms squarely where it belongs, on the adult owner.''\n  This legislation provides criminal penalties for those adults who \nknowingly or recklessly allow a child access to a firearm, if the child \nthen uses the firearm to seriously injure or kill another person.\n  Mr. President, the problem of firearm injury goes beyond just \ncriminal violence. Too many lives are lost every year simply because \ngun owners do not know how to use or store their firearms--particularly \naround children.\n  In fact, according to a study released early last year, in 1996 alone \nthere were more than 1,100 unintentional shooting deaths and more than \n18,000 firearm suicides--many of which could have been prevented if the \nperson intent on suicide did not have easy access to a gun owned by \nsomebody else.\n  And think of this--if a man goes into a barber shop to have his hair \ncut, the barber is licensed. When we women go to a beauty shop to have \nour hair done, the cosmetologist is licensed. If we want to fish, we \nget a license. If we want to hunt, we must get a license. If you're a \npest control eradicator, you must have a license. If you want to drive \na car--not a lethal weapon in itself--but certainly a lethal weapon if \nirresponsible people are driving it, you get a license. And as a matter \nof fact, you register the automobile.\n  When a 16-year-old boy wants to drive a car, we make him prove that \nhe knows the rules of the road, and that he can operate a car safely \nand responsibly. But if that 16-year-old uses his hard-won new license \nto drive to a gun dealer, he faces no written safety test, and no \ndemonstration of proficiency whatsoever. It is time to recognize that a \nfirearm is at least as dangerous as an automobile.\n  These are the issues--keeping guns out of the hands of criminals, \ntracking down criminals once they have used a gun in the commission of \na crime, and making sure that gun owners know how to safely use and \nstore their weapons.\n  I know that no single piece of legislation can solve the problems of \ngun violence in America. But in order to begin addressing these issues, \nI have introduced a bill that will require that all future transfers of \nhandguns or semi-automatic guns that can take detachable magazines be \nrecorded, and their owners be licensed.\n\n  Now let me first discuss why the bill covers the guns that it does.\n\n[[Page S4041]]\n\n  The bill covers handguns because statistically, these guns are used \nin more crime than any other. In fact, approximately 85 percent of all \nfirearm homicides involve a handgun.\n  And the legislation also covers semi-automatic firearms that can \naccept detachable magazines, because these are the assault weapons that \nhave the potential to destroy the largest number of lives in the \nshortest period of time. A gun that can take a detachable magazine \ngenerally also take a large capacity magazine. Combine that with semi-\nautomatic, rapid fire, and you have a deadly combination--as we have \nseen time and again in recent years.\n  Put simply, this legislation will cover those firearms that represent \nthe greatest threat to the safety of innocent men, women and children \nin this nation. Common hunting rifles, shotguns and other firearms that \ncannot accept detachable magazines will remain exempt.\n  Now as to those firearms that will be covered by the bill, there are \ntwo requirements placed on prospective gun owners.\n  Regarding the licensing requirement first, this legislation requires \nthat every person wishing to own a firearm covered by this bill must \nobtain a license--either from the federal government or from a state \nprogram that has been certified by the federal government.\n  In order to obtain a license, a person will have to provide proof of \nidentity, and be legally entitled under federal law to own a gun. This \nwill entail providing several things to federal or local law \nenforcement:\n  Provide information as to date and place of birth and name and \naddress;\n  Submit a thumb print;\n  Submit a current photograph;\n  Sign, under penalty of perjury, that all of the submitted information \nis true and that the applicant is qualified under federal law to \npossess a firearm;\n  Pass a written firearms safety test, requiring knowledge of the safe \nstorage and handling of firearms, the legal responsibilities of firearm \nownership, and other factors as determined by the state or federal \nauthority;\n  Sign a pledge to keep any firearm safely stored and out of the hands \nof juveniles--this pledge will be backed up by criminal penalties for \nanyone failing to do so;\n  And undergo state and federal background checks.\n  Once an individual has received the license from the Treasury \nDepartment, that single license entitles the licensee to own or \npurchase any firearm covered by this bill. Only one license is \nrequired, no matter how many firearms are purchased.\n  Licenses will cost $25 maximum and be renewable every five years. \nThey can be revoked anytime if the licensee becomes disqualified from \nowning a gun under federal law.\n  Right now, the United States is one of only two countries--along with \nthe Czech Republic--that does not have a firearm licensing system. \nPerhaps that is one of the reasons why children under 15 in this \ncountry are 12 times more likely to die from gunfire than the children \nof 25 other industrialized nations combined.\n  Only America, so advanced in other ways, remains so backward in how \nwe regulate guns and gun owners. I believe that it is time to listen to \nthe American people, and to enact common sense, reasonable legislation \nto ensure that all gun owners become responsible gun owners, and that \nguns themselves can be used more effectively to track down perpetrators \nof gun violence.\n  The second requirement of this legislation is that all future \ntransfers of firearms covered by this bill be recorded by a licensed \ngun dealer.\n  This record of sale provision means that guns that are transferred in \nthe future will, effectively, be registered. Registration is not a \ncomplicated issue, and it is one that every American will understand. \nWe register many things in this country that are far less dangerous \nthan firearms.\n  We register cars and license drivers;\n  We license barbers and cosmetologists:\n  We register pesticides;\n  We register animal carriers and researchers;\n  We register gambling devices; and\n  We register a whole host of other goods and activities--even \n``international expositions,'' believe it or not, must be registered \nwith the Bureau of International Expositions!\n  The American people already support national gun registration \noverwhelmingly, despite a concerted campaign by some to change their \nminds.\n  By requiring that firearm sales and transfers be recorded, we will \nestablish some accountability for the use and care of those guns. Law \nenforcement will be able to track crime guns back to their legal \nowners, so owners will therefore need to be more careful about storing \ntheir guns so they are not stolen and also in reporting gun sales--\nnobody wants to be responsible for a crime committed by someone else.\n  As San Francisco Sheriff Mike Hennessy wrote to me, ``By requiring \nevery transfer of handguns and semi-automatic firearms to be made \nthrough a licensed dealer, a chain of ownership can be established that \ncan assist law enforcement in identifying firearms used in the \ncommission of crimes.'' This record requirement is not so we can target \nlaw abiding citizens, but rather so that law enforcement can quickly \napprehend criminals who use guns in crime.\n  Firearms dealers already keep careful track of gun sales, and submit \nserial numbers to the ATF for later use in gun tracing. The new record \nof sale requirement will essentially mean that this same process will \nbe expanded to all covered firearms.\n  Penalties will vary depending on the severity of the violation:\n  Those who fail to get a license will face fines of between $500 and \n$5,000.\n  Failing to report a change of address or the loss of a firearm will \nalso result in penalties between $500 and $5,000;\n  Dealers who fail to maintain adequate records will face up to 2 years \nin prison--dealers know their responsibilities, and this will give law \nenforcement the tools necessary to root out bad dealers and prevent the \nstraw purchases and other violations of law that allow criminals easy \naccess to a continuing flow of guns;\n  And adults who recklessly or knowingly allow a child access to a \nfirearm face up to three years in prison if the child uses the gun to \nkill or seriously injure another person.\n  Mr. President, the Million Mom March was just the beginning of a \npowerful movement for sensible gun laws. Like the women activists \nbefore them, mothers and others who led the fight to abolish child \nlabor, to establish juvenile courts, to improve child care and broaden \nhealth coverage, the participants in this March are now united behind a \ncause that we cannot afford to ignore: Sane, common-sense gun laws; \nchild-safety locks on handguns; a ban on minors buying assault weapons; \nclosing the gun-show loophole that allows buyers to get around \nbackground checks; prohibiting the import of high-capacity ammunition \nmagazines; and finally licensing gun owners and registering firearms. \nAfter all, we ask people to get licenses to drive a car and we register \nautomobiles; why not gun-owners and firearms?\n  I urge the Senate to pass the juvenile justice bill, and to continue \nthe fight against gun violence demanded by those million people this \npast weekend.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from California, \nSenator Feinstein, who has done a remarkable job in presenting this \nissue to the Senate on behalf of not only her constituents but on \nbehalf of many of us across the country. I thank the Senator for her \nleadership.\n  I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I rise today, as well, in support of the amendment before the Senate. \nI pose a question to the Members of this body, a question asked by \n750,000 mothers, fathers, and children who gathered in our Nation's \nCapital for the Million Mom March this past weekend. It is a question \nbeing asked by tens of thousands of people who took part in rallies \nacross 70 cities in this country this last weekend. It is a question \nbeing asked after every school shooting and after every other act of \ngun violence.\n  I ask my colleagues: What will it take to get this Congress to pass \ncommonsense gun legislation? Do we have to wait for more innocent \npeople to lose their lives before this Congress will act? Currently, 12 \nchildren die every day from gunfire. Do we have to wait for our homes \nand places of worship to become crime scenes? Lord knows, we have seen \nenough of that. Do we have to wait for our schools, places\n\n[[Page S4042]]\n\nwhere our children should feel safe and loved, to become war zones?\n  We have already had school shootings in many cities: Littleton, \nDeming, Jonesboro, Flint, Conyers, Pearl, Fort Gibson, Springfield, and \nMoses Lake in my home State of Washington. Do we have to wait for a \nmillion people to rally here in D.C. and across the country to get this \nCongress to act? We just had that this past weekend. Do we have to wait \nfor a shooting to take place right here in the Nation's Capitol \nBuilding to act? We have already had that. Do we have to wait until no \nplace is safe for this Congress to pass commonsense legislation? We are \ngetting closer to that every day. It is not getting any better. It \nseems the accidents are all the more common. It seems the shock and the \npain and the loss keep growing, but this Congress has not acted.\n  What is it going to take for this Congress to pass commonsense gun \nlegislation? I want to give my colleagues a reason to act. I want to \nshare with them a personal story about how gun violence is tearing our \ncountry apart. It is a story from a member of my own staff in \nWashington State. She is a wonderful woman named Mary Glen, who lost \nher son in a tragic robbery. It is something that has had a tremendous \nimpact on her and on me. I know I cannot convey, or even imagine, the \nhorror she has been through. But I also know that her voice must be \nheard by this Congress, so I want to read to you what she said in her \nown words at the Million Mom March in Seattle, WA, this past weekend.\n  I truly commend her for her courage, telling her story so openly and \nallowing me to share it with you today. Mary Glen said:\n\n       On Jan. 1st 1994 I awoke to a knock at the door, two police \n     officers were standing there with the news that my 15-year-\n     old son, Shaun was dead. Shot in the back, robbed of his \n     money and his clothes.\n       As Shaun left a convenience store after purchasing a pizza \n     early New Year's morning of 1994, two young men took him by \n     gun point, forced him into a car, drove him a couple blocks \n     away, made him strip out of his clothes, took his money and \n     then ordered him out of the car. They then shot him in the \n     back! What a cowardly act. My world was torn apart that day \n     but all I could think of is I can't let this happen to anyone \n     else's child.\n       As a mother, I had been a good parent, but that wasn't \n     enough as I found out. It didn't matter how good of a parent \n     I was, because when Shaun was out of my sight I couldn't \n     protect him from what happened.\n       Sixteen days later I was speaking to other Moms who had \n     lost loved ones due to guns.\n       In February of 1994, just 6 weeks after I buried Shaun, I \n     spoke before the Washington State Legislature, telling my \n     story and asking for stricter gun laws, telling them, if they \n     had tears in their eyes after just hearing my story, which \n     they did, imagine how I must feel having to survive it and go \n     on without my son.\n       This kind of violence is preventable. In April of 1994, \n     Senator Feinstein invited me back to Washington, DC for a \n     press conference on the assault weapons ban, part of the 1994 \n     Crime Bill. . . .\n       There, I met with others who had lost loved ones and \n     together we spoke out about gun violence to anyone who would \n     give us the time. The effects of gun violence are very brutal \n     and personal for me. . . .\n       This isn't about being pro or anti gun it's about saving \n     our children who leave our houses and are not coming home. \n     The devastating effects don't magically stop. It's an ongoing \n     struggle. . . .\n       If I could have one wish answered for Mother's Day this is \n     what it would be: That every person who screams about their \n     2nd amendment rights and the need to own a gun without \n     wanting to be held accountable for the responsibilities that \n     go with it, feel the pain of losing a child to murder for one \n     day--because then doing the right thing wouldn't even have to \n     be argued.\n\n  Those are the words of Mary Glen. She is a member of my staff in \nWashington State, and I could not agree with Mary more. She is a \nsurvivor. She is a strong and loving woman. I got to know her through \nher work with Mothers Against Violence in America. So, again, after \nsharing Mary's story with all of you I ask: What will it take for this \nCongress to pass commonsense gun laws?\n  Last year, in the juvenile justice bill, the Senate passed \ncommonsense gun restrictions. We closed the gun show loophole; we \nmandated trigger locks on all handgun sales; we enacted legislation to \nensure that violent juveniles cannot buy weapons; and we banned the \nimportation of high-capacity ammunition clips. Unfortunately, this \nCongress has failed to make that bill law. The juvenile justice bill \nhas languished in the conference committee for nearly a year.\n  Some opponents of commonsense laws say we are not doing enough to \nenforce the laws that are already on the books. This administration has \ndone more to protect children from gun violence than any in our \nNation's history. Gun prosecutions overall have increased nearly 30 \npercent in the Clinton-Gore administration. Of course, there is more we \ncan do, and the President has proposed increasing the number of Federal \ngun prosecutors and helping States with their gun prosecutions and \nenforcement. But at the end of the day, all of the excuses and all the \ndoubletalk from opponents will not save one life. Sensible gun laws \nwill save lives. But first we have to get this Congress to act.\n  Today, with this amendment, we are asking this Congress to act in a \nsmall and symbolic way. We are asking this Congress to commend those \nwho took part in the Million Mom March. It is the least we can do for a \ngroup of people who have suffered losses many of us cannot even \nimagine. They have asked: What will it take for this Congress to pass \ncommonsense gun legislation? Let's answer them by showing we are ready \nto protect Americans from gun violence. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I wasn't going to say anything on this \nsubject, but after listening to several of the statements, both last \nnight and again this morning, I am compelled to speak. Everybody is \ntalking about a message that was conveyed to this country last Sunday. \nThere was a message there. I walked through that crowd. There weren't \ntoo many television cameras following me because I am not one of the \nsuperstars here. I do not take this floor and do a lot of talking. But \nthis time I think I must.\n  If you listened to them, there was a message. Common sense? Yes, that \nmessage was there: Do some commonsense things that will really reduce \nour exposure to crimes committed using firearms and enhance safety \naround children. They were not only talking to Congress; they were \ntalking to America. They were saying: Americans, if you have children \nand young adults in your home and you also own firearms, then you have \nsome responsibility. You, as the adult of that home, have a \nresponsibility. You have a responsibility to your community as well as \nto this Nation that that child or young person or young adult knows and \nrespects the weapon. The message was: Come to your senses, America.\n  We can pass laws in here. We can pass this sense-of-the-Senate \nmeasure. We can pass the juvenile crime bill. But if we as adults in \nour own homes and with our own neighbors do not take responsibility, it \nwill not change a thing --not one thing.\n  There is a reason the second amendment was put in the Constitution. \nAll we have to do is look around the world. We are a different society. \nWe are a free society. Those men who shaped the Constitution and fought \nover it and bled over it, who walked, not the Halls of this building \nbut in Philadelphia and New York, probably did not know exactly what \nthey wanted in the Constitution, but they knew exactly what they did \nnot want --tyranny by government.\n  We are no different from the roots from which we sprang. I go back to \nthe words of Benjamin Franklin. I will never forget them. I think they \nare very true today, just as they were then:\n  Those who think we can pass laws that make us feel good and warm and \nfuzzy, who say look what we have done but do not change the \ncircumstance any, they will say we are more secure now, but it is a \nfalse security. Those who would sacrifice freedom for security deserve \nneither.\n\n  Those are the words of Benjamin Franklin. They are words that ring \nthrough these Halls today. If there is no responsibility, nothing \nhappens, and the message from the Million Mom March is for naught. Pass \nthe laws. Those who obey the laws become the prey, and those who are \nwilling to break the law have no fear of it and become the predator and \ntherefore rule by fear.\n  Common sense, America; common sense. That is what they said. No \nmatter what the law, the bottom line is responsibility--adult \nresponsibility--not\n\n[[Page S4043]]\n\ngiven to the Government, not given to the schoolteacher, not given to \nthe babysitter; it is part of what we call parental responsibility. We \nshould not be lulled into a false sense of security because we have \npassed a law that basically changes nothing.\n  Those who have lost children in any way, in any fashion, understand \nthat down in their gut. How can they tell the story? Because they \nbelieve it deep down.\n  When I drive across this great country of ours--Washington is not the \ncenter of the universe--when I drive on the other side of the mountains \nand out across the prairies of America into the West and clear to the \ncoast, I see people who are willing to take responsibility. They built \na great nation, and they did not build it on false security.\n  Last night I played a tape called ``Touch Tones in Valor.'' It is a \n10-minute tape on the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. I started \nwondering: Why did these men and women of great courage think so much \nof freedom that they were willing to pay the supreme cost? Yet we \ncannot seem to teach that in our schools.\n  During this debate, there have been numbers quoted, stats quoted, and \nthere are politics involved. Why don't we say to the organizations that \nhave the ear of people who shoot for sport and to hunt: Instead of this \nadversity, why aren't we working with those folks and their programs of \neducation and responsibility and do something to raise awareness to \nmake communities safe?\n  We can do that, America. We can do that. We can work with parents, \nand we can work with schools, but we have to get involved. We cannot \npass a law, walk away, and say look what we have done, and all at once \nbelieve that we are safer. We have to get involved with the young \npeople. It is about time we remind ourselves to teach right from wrong \nand that there are consequences for wrong.\n  It boils down to the message I got on Sunday, which is to help us; \nhelp us, but for Heaven's sake, when you go into groups, talk about \nparental responsibility, talk about the way to raise our children, talk \nabout the way to teach our young adults. Do not go through this process \nof pretense and then say, ``Look what I have done.'' Do not be afraid \nto teach.\n  My good friend from Washington comes out of the education community, \nand I bet she was a good teacher. We all teach every day. Every one of \nus, every adult, teaches every day. That is where it starts. That was \nthe message of this past Sunday: Be a leader; be a role model.\n  For Heaven's sake, don't do something with a paintbrush and think we \nhave a new barn because we still have the same old one. We have to \nchange from the inside.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, of the 10 minutes, I yield myself 8\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  I hope the American people are beginning to understand the difficulty \nthose of us who want sensible and responsible opportunities are having \nin putting before the Senate proposals which we think can reduce youth \nviolence and the availability of weapons to children in this country. \nWe were stalled yesterday, and we have been stalled again to the point \nwhere we are acting only on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. We are, \nbecause of what I consider an abuse of the rules of the Senate, denied \nan opportunity for accountability by the Members.\n  I hear a great deal about responsibility. I hear the speeches about \nhow we ought to be responsible and parents ought to be responsible. I \nsay the Senate ought to be responsible. The Senate of the United States \nought to be responsible, the House of Representatives ought to be \nresponsible, and at least have a debate about these issues rather than \nrelying on the gymnastics of parliamentary procedures to deny us that \nopportunity.\n  When our good friends talk about responsibility, let's start right \nwhere it should begin, and that is right in the Senate.\n  It ought to be self-evident that children in the United States of \nAmerica have the easiest access to guns of any country in the world.\n  We know we have more youth deaths than the next 25 industrial nations \ncombined. Easy access to weapons has been demonstrated.\n  The argument is: Why aren't we doing more in terms of prosecutions? \nOr, Why aren't we doing more in terms of helping children? I daresay, \nthat those of us who are in strong support of the Daschle amendment \ntake a back seat to no one in trying to find ways to help and assist \nparents, schools, local communities, and church leaders in local \ncommunities to try to deal with the problems of violence in the \ncommunity.\n  What we have also seen from Justice Department statistics is that \nthere has been vigorous enforcement of the laws in sending people off \nto jail who are violating gun laws. Where the penalty is above 3 years, \nthere is a 30-percent increase in prosecutions. In State law, there is \na 25-percent increase in prosecutions for those with a penalty below 3 \nyears. There are 25 percent more criminals going to jail today than 7 \nyears ago in relation to gun offenses.\n  Let's free ourselves from the adage: we have enough laws on the \nbooks--let's just enforce them. The statistics respond to that \nstatement.\n  The second question is, if we go ahead and pass these laws, that \nisn't the only problem. We understand it is not the only problem. But \nwe are stalemated in trying to deal with the underlying problems, as \nwell.\n  Let's think of where we are. We have a number of different proposals \nto try to help and assist parents and schools and local communities. \nFor example, we have our Safe and Drug Free Schools Program that \nprovides help and assistance to every school in this country. We have \nfound that any effort to increase the funding for that program has been \nopposed by the Republicans. That is the principal instrument to try to \nhelp our schools develop their own kinds of programs to deal with the \nproblems of violence in the schools.\n  The Justice Department's Safe Schools and Healthy Students Program \nattempts to help schools. And it too has been sidetracked by the \nmajority.\n  The various prevention programs in the Juvenile Justice bill like the \njuvenile drug and alcohol treatment programs, school counseling, and \nother school-based prevention programs like the FAST Program--which is \nthe Families and Schools Together Program--and the centers of \nexcellence to treat children who have witnessed or suffered serious \nviolent crimes, all of those programs are put on the back burner. We \ncannot get funding or support for those programs.\n  Let's not stand out here and say that there are other causes of \nviolence. We understand that. We also understand that people in other \ncountries are seeing our movies, they are viewing our games, and yet \nthey do not have this proliferation of violence. Maybe we ought to be \ntaking a look at some of those issues, but we are being denied now on \nthe most basic and fundamental issue, and that is the issue of the \nproliferation of weapons.\n  With all due respect to our friends on the other side of the aisle, \nlet's look at what their position has been in terms of the \nproliferation of weapons. I was here when we passed the McClure-Volkmer \nAct. I voted in opposition to that bill, which opened up the whole gun \nshow loophole. The McClure-Volkmer bill effectively facilitated the \nsale of guns to criminals and juveniles by turning gun shows into a \nbooming business. It severely restricted the ability of the ATF to \nconduct inspections of the business premises of federally licensed \nfirearms dealers. It raised the burden of proof for violations of \nfederal gun laws. That is what the NRA has supported on the McClure-\nVolkmer bill.\n  Then we had the Brady bill. They resisted it every step of the way. \nIt took 7 years to pass the Brady Bill. And the NRA's ongoing attacks \non the National Instant Check System show that their claims to support \nbackground checks are utterly specious.\n\n  Then we had the whole question about the ATF. As I have mentioned \npreviously, the NRA and the Republicans oppose sufficient numbers of \nlaw enforcement officials in the ATF. We have the same number of law \nenforcement officials now as we had 25 years\n\n[[Page S4044]]\n\nago, with basically flat funding. Everyone around here knows what that \nmeans. It means a real drop in the funding by about 30 percent. So to \nour good friends on the other side: untie the hands of law enforcement. \nTheir hands are tied behind their backs, and you ask: why aren't they \nenforcing the laws? Come on now.\n  We are prepared to do something in terms of these other issues, as I \nmentioned. We have passed the SAMSHA program, which deals with issues \nof mental health and tries to provide resources to local communities to \nwork with schools, religious organizations, and law enforcement, to \nreduce the proliferation of weapons.\n  What are the radical proposals we keep hearing about that are going \nto basically undermine the Constitution of the United States?\n  We have a gun show loophole. We want to go back to where we were \nprior to the time of the McClure-Volkmer Act. That is where we \nbasically want to go. It has passed the Senate and we cannot even get \nconsideration of it.\n  I listened to my good friend from Montana talk about holding parents \nresponsible. That is the proposal of the Senator from Illinois, what is \ncalled the CAP proposal. We have it in Massachusetts.\n  Is the Senator from Montana, or anyone on the other side, willing to \nsponsor that and bring it up this afternoon? Of course they are not.\n  Holding parents responsible is what we want and what they oppose. We \nlistened to how we want family responsibility, parental responsibility. \nThat is what this child access prevention legislation is all about. But \nwe are denied even the opportunity to debate it.\n  So don't lecture us about it. Don't lecture us about it.\n  Safety locks, to try to make sure the 1,200,000 guns which are loaded \nand unlocked in households across America--where children will go this \nafternoon--have safety locks. Requiring that every new gun have a \nsafety lock, and trying to hold parents responsible, is that so \ndramatic? Of course it is not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 8\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have a minute and a half, I believe.\n  Mr. President, the possession of automatic weapons, to change this \nfrom the age of 18 to 21, we are opposed on that.\n  This morning I looked on the web to see what has been happening in \nthe last few days.\n  May 15: Georgia boy 12, accused of killing a 10-year-old cousin.\n  May 15: Chicago sees five youths injured by gunfire in 36 hours.\n  May 15: Michigan boy 17, son of mayor and Congressman--one of our \ncolleagues--dies from self-inflicted gunshot.\n  May 11: Mississippi, 5-year-old shoots sister, 2, with mom's unlocked \ngun.\n  May 11: Arkansas boy uses gun from home to shoot at officer.\n  May 10: Florida, 5-year-old takes gun to prekindergarten.\n  May 8: Montana, teen dies from accidental self-inflicted gunshot \nwound.\n  The list goes on. That is in the last week alone.\n  For how many more weeks will we have these lists? How many more weeks \nare we going to be denied by the Republican leadership the opportunity \nto do something about it?\n  That is what this debate is about. That is why their position is \nirresponsible. That is why we are going to continue to battle during \nthe course of this Congress to protect these children in this country \nwho need our protection.\n  To recap, since Columbine, the National Rifle Association and the \nRepublican leadership in Congress have succeeded in blocking any action \non new or stronger gun laws with a blunt response: ``We don't need new \ngun laws, just enforce the laws already on the books.''\n  We need to expose the National Rifle Association and the Republican \nhypocrisy. The NRA has systematically weakened federal gun laws over \nthe past two decades and has made law enforcement's job of apprehending \ncriminals more difficult.\n  There are three major components of our weak gun laws that have the \nfingerprints of the NRA all over them: The McClure-Volkmer Act, the \nBrady Law, and the funding of ATF agents.\n  The NRA-sponsored Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, also known \nas the McClure-Volkmer Act, is perhaps the strongest evidence of NRA \nhypocrisy on gun enforcement. With its passage, the NRA accomplished \nthe following:\n  It allowed unlicensed individuals to sell their personal firearms as \na ``hobby.'' The result has been the sale of massive numbers of \nfirearms to criminals and juveniles without background checks. This \nprovision not only created a vast secondary market --it also opened up \nthe ``gun show loophole,'' which many of us in Congress are now \nstruggling to close.\n  It facilitated the sale of guns to criminals and juveniles by turning \ngun shows into a booming business.\n  It allowed criminals to keep or regain their rights to own guns.\n  It severely restricted the ability of the ATF to conduct inspections \nof the business premises of federally licensed firearms dealers.\n  It raised the burden of proof for violations of federal gun laws.\n  The seven-year battle to pass the Brady Bill and the NRA's ongoing \nattacks on the National Instant Check System show that the NRA's claims \nto support background checks is utterly specious.\n  Before the Brady Bill was passed, 32 states lacked a background check \nsystem. A criminal could walk into a gun store, sign a form stating he \nis not a prohibited purchaser, and walk out with a gun. The form would \nsimply be filed away, with no follow-through to make sure that the \npurchaser's statements were accurate. The Brady Bill was designed to \nclose this loophole by reducing an honest background check and waiting \nperiod, and the NRA worked tirelessly to defeat it.\n  Only when the NRA realized that the Brady Bill was unstoppable did it \nshift its efforts to weaken the law as much as possible. It attempted \nto push through the immediate reliance on an ``instant check'' system--\na system that was not technically feasible at the time.\n  Even after embracing an ``instant check'' system, the NRA has \ncontinually sought to undermine the system's integrity and efficiency, \nby preventing law enforcement from maintaining any records on the \nbackground checks it conducts.\n  Most telling is the NRA's continued opposition to background checks \non all gun purchasers, including all gun show sales and private sales. \nIf the NRA supports background checks, why do they want to keep this \ngaping loophole open in our gun laws?\n  Finally, it is no secret that the NRA has tried to undermine federal \nlaw enforcement, particularly the ATF. NRA rhetoric combined with its \ncampaign to financially cripple the ATF demonstrate the gun lobby's \nsingle-minded thoroughness in carrying out its extremist agenda. The \nNRA makes the gun laws weak and difficult to enforce--and it also \nundermines the agency that has primary responsibility for enforcing \nthose laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. May I inquire how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 17 minutes; and the minority \nhas 81 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to Senator Bunning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I would like to return to the underlying \nbill, the MILCON bill.\n  I rise to speak in support of the Byrd-Warner Kosovo amendment that \nwas included in this measure by a vote of 23-3 by the members of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  The committee got it right. It is time for Congress to exercise its \nconstitutional authority and its constitutional responsibility to \naddress the basic policy issues involved in the deployment of U.S. \nground forces in Kosovo.\n  More than 5,900 U.S. troops are currently participating in the NATO \npeacekeeping operation in Kosovo, despite the fact that Congress has \nnever authorized--or even formally debated--U.S. involvement in Kosovo \nsince the Senate, on March 23, 1999, authorized airstrikes against \nYugoslavia.\n  We need a plan. We need a policy. We need an exit strategy. And, \nright now, we have none of these.\n  I remember very distinctly, back in 1995, when I was serving in the \nHouse of Representatives and we passed, with bipartisan support, a \nresolution calling\n\n[[Page S4045]]\n\non the President to obtain congressional authorization before deploying \ntroops to Bosnia.\n  That resolution passed by a vote of 315-103.\n  Despite that vote, President Clinton went ahead with a large-scale \nand long-term deployment of tens of thousands of our troops to Bosnia \nwithout congressional approval or any meaningful debate.\n  Our concern then was the fact that there was no well defined \nmission--no exit strategy--no plan.\n  We were given assurances that we wouldn't be there long. Our troops \nwould be brought home in a year or two. But now, here we are five years \ndown the pike and our troops are still there. There is no end in sight. \nNo plan. No exit strategy.\n  The same thing is happening in Kosovo.\n  We did our part in Kosovo. We bore the brunt of the costs and the \nrisks involved in the air war over Kosovo. It was U.S. pilots and U.S. \nplanes that forced the Yugoslav withdrawal from Kosovo that allowed for \nthe deployment of the U.N. peacekeeping forces.\n  We have done our part.\n  I firmly believe that it is time for the European Community to live \nup to their responsibilities. Kosovo is in their back yard. Our \nEuropean allies should assume more of the responsibility for \npeacekeeping.\n  I believe that there is no justification for U.S. ground forces being \nplaced in the middle of age old feuds and animosities.\n  I believe we should never have sent U.S. ground forces into Kosovo. \nAnd I believe that we should bring our fighting men and women back \nhome.\n  I do not believe that we should drift along without a policy--without \na plan--without an exit strategy--in Kosovo as we have been doing in \nBosnia.\n  The Byrd-Warner amendment does not really go as far as I would like \nto go. It does not say, ``We are going Home.''\n  It simply says that if the President of the United States can make a \ncase for keeping troops in Kosovo--let him do it.\n  The Byrd-Warner amendment is much more cautious and conservative than \nI would like us to be.\n  But it would require the President to develop a plan to turn the \nground combat troop element of the Kosovo peacekeeping operation over \nto the Europeans by July 1, in the year 2001.\n  It does not require the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops. It would \nterminate funding for the continued deployment of U.S. ground combat \ntroops in Kosovo after July 1, of next year, unless the President seeks \nand receives congressional authorization to continue that deployment.\n  It gives the President a year's notice. It gives the European \nCommunity a year's notice.\n  This amendment basically says to the President--not only our current \nPresident but whoever replaces him as well--develop a plan to get us \nout, or come before Congress and the American people and explain to us \nwhy it is the Nation's interest to stay in.\n  This amendment simply says it is time to quit drifting along, it is \ntime to quit putting the lives of our young people on the line without \nany clear mission, without any clear policy, without any plan.\n  It is our responsibility. It is Congress' responsibility to conduct \noversight of the policies that result in the deployment of U.S. troops \nabroad. It is time we lived up to that responsibility and the Byrd-\nWarner amendment does just that.\n  It simply says, ``Drift'' is not a valid substitute for a national \ndefense policy.\n  And it tells the President to give us a policy, explain it, convince \nthe American people and the U.S. Congress that it is in our national \ninterest to keep ground troops in Kosovo--or bring our troops home.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this reasonable and responsible \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson) The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank some of \nmy colleagues I have heard out here on the floor. I had a chance last \nnight to listen. I had to go back home. I have a ruptured disc in my \nback. I was lying in bed listening to Senator Boxer. I thought she was \nbrilliant. And when Senator Kennedy speaks on this matter, I think he \nspeaks with great moral authority. I say to Senator Boxer that I use \nthe word ``brilliant'' carefully. It is not to try to get her to like \nme; we are already good friends. I just think she spoke with a lot of \neloquence and a lot of feeling.\n  I am not going to actually go through all of the provisions we have \nbeen talking about because people who follow this debate have heard \nthat already. I want this juvenile justice bill out of conference \ncommittee, although there are other parts of the bill to which I really \nobject. I think it is unconscionable that it has been blocked. I think \nthese sensible gun control measures must be passed by the Congress--the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  Instead, what I want to do is talk about this Million Mom March and \nhow it affected me and how it has affected my wife Sheila. We came back \nfrom, actually, Wisconsin where I went to support Tammy Baldwin and \ncame back to D.C. to take part in that march. We did that because we \nwanted to join in with a lot of mothers from Minnesota. Second of all--\nactually, I had a discussion with Senator Boxer about this--I thought, \nthis is really historic; I should be there.\n  I don't really know how many mothers were there. I don't know whether \nit was 750,000 or 650,000, but it was very powerful. I really believe \nthere were two messages to that march. One has been much discussed. The \nother has been less discussed. The first message was that you had \nmothers basically saying to the Nation--much less to the Congress--\nthere is too much violence; there are too many of our children being \nkilled; we can do much better as a nation.\n  We are all for doing everything possible on prevention. We are all \nfor making sure the existing laws are enforced. We are all for making \nsure we figure out how to help children with troubled lives--some of \nthe children who committed these crimes or a murder. But we want our \nCongress--if it is our Congress--to pass legislation that will make \nsure some of these children and other citizens who should not have \nthese guns don't get these guns in their hands--make sure we deal with \nthe loopholes, and make sure people with a history of violence don't \nhave these guns. Surely, we can do better. Nobody can ever get it 100-\npercent right. Nobody can be sure those citizens who should not have \naccess to guns don't get access to guns. Nobody can stand here on the \nfloor of the Senate and say if we pass these measures, we won't have a \nrepeat of a Columbine or what happened in many other schools. But we \ncan certainly do everything that is humanly possible to try to reduce \nthe violence and try to reduce the number of children that are \nmurdered. It is reasonable.\n\n  I come from a State where Minnesotans love to hunt. They do not want \ntheir long guns taken away. They do not want their rifle hunt taken \naway. This has nothing to do with that. It has nothing to do with the \nbasic constitutional rights. It is not written anywhere in the \nConstitution that anybody who wants to own a gun--even if they have a \nhistory of violence, are convicted of a violent crime, even if they \nhave used guns before--should be allowed to have a gun. There is \nnothing in the Constitution that says that.\n  That is what this is all about. That is what these amendments are all \nabout.\n  I think the first message on the part of mothers--I do not know. We \nwill see. The proof will be in the pudding. We will see how history \nwrites about this later depending upon the followup of this march. But \nI see that march as the beginning of a very important citizens lobby in \nthe country. You had a lot of women who came. I know that in Minnesota \nwe have a lot of Democrats; we have a lot of Republicans; and we have a \nlot of women who really do not care about either party, to tell you the \ntruth. They do not really care. But they care fiercely about this \nissue. I think they came here with a lot of courage. I think they came \nhere with a lot of hope. That is good. That is all\n\n[[Page S4046]]\n\nabout representative democracy. They are not afraid to take on powerful \nspecial interests. They are not afraid to hold all of us accountable. \nThey are not afraid to speak out for their children and their \ngrandchildren. They are not afraid to work hard, to speak up, to lobby, \nto write letters, to advocate for sensible legislation that would \nreduce some of this violence and save lives. They are not afraid to do \nthat.\n  I think there was a lot of determination and a lot of indignation. I \nsay to colleagues that I personally think indignation can be good. I \nwould much rather women, men, and all citizens who believe we ought to \ndo something to reduce this violence, and to get some of these guns out \nof the hands of children and other people who shouldn't have these \nguns--I think it is good that there is indignation. I think it is good \nthat these women are saying to Senators and Representatives that we are \nnot going to march here and have this big rally, and when the smoke \nclears away, you will never hear from us again. That is not going to \nhappen. I think that makes our country work better. That is the second \nmessage.\n  I think what happened on Sunday was inspiring. I think the mothers \nprovoked the hopes and aspirations of other women and men in the \ncountry that, yes, we can change legislation; yes, ordinary citizens \nmatter; that we have a right as citizens to make demands of the \nCongress and to be as bold and as courageous as we can be as citizens \nin a democracy. I think that was a message of this march. That is a \nwonderful message. That is an empowering message.\n  Finally, there was another message, and if was a different one. The \nnext day we had a panel discussion. There were a number of women \ncrossing all income lines and all racial lines who lost children. I \nmade the comment during this discussion when some of the mothers were \nspeaking that people kept trying to get the mikes closer. But I think \none of the reasons their voices were so quiet was because there is so \nmuch pain.\n\n  I pray for our family. We have children and grandchildren. I pray \nthat we never have to ever go through that. I pray no mother, no \nfather, no grandparent, no brother, no sister, no wife, no husband \never, ever has to go through the living hell that these women have gone \nthrough having lost a child to this violence. At that discussion I \nthink there was a lot of personal pain and a lot of agony. God knows, I \ndon't know how these women have done it. I really do not. I do not know \nthat I could have done it. They have somehow been able to muster up the \ncourage to try to do everything they can to save the lives of other \nchildren. To honor them is the least we can do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nIdaho for yielding.\n  I should have known that as election season approaches we would have \nto be down on the floor with more debate on gun control, and, \nunfortunately, the hostage held here--for our service men and women who \nare waiting--is the military construction appropriations bill. It is \nnow being held hostage by this debate. It is unfortunate that some of \nour colleagues would do this to our military who we know are very much \nin need of a lot of the dollars and programs that are in that budget.\n  Frankly, there is nothing more politically expedient or coldly \nopportunistic or blatantly unconstitutional, frankly, than gun control. \nIt is pretty clear.\n  I do not know how our colleagues can say the first amendment is all \nright and the second amendment isn't.\n  Of course, it is an unmistakably and an unspeakably horrible tragedy \nwhen someone is killed. And it is very difficult to sometimes respond \nto the emotionalism of those who have lost a loved one in a tragedy \nsuch as a shooting or any other tragedy. But our response, my \ncolleagues, should not be to disregard our oath of office and to walk \naway from the Constitution of the United States. We took an oath right \nthere in the Well to ``defend and support'' the Constitution. The last \ntime I looked, the second amendment was part of that Constitution. I \nwould have more respect for my colleagues if they came down and offered \nan amendment to remove it. At least that would be more honest.\n  Our response should be to encourage gun safety, too, and to crack \ndown on the scum, the criminals, who commit these horrible acts against \nus, and to take an introspective look at ourselves and our children.\n\n  We need to restore respect for all human life ourselves. We need to \nstop calling gratuitous and indiscriminate violence in the popular \nmedia, in TV, movies, and in videos ``art'' and start calling it the \ntrash that it is because it is corrupting young people's minds, and it \nruins their souls. These are the problems about gun violence--not guns.\n  My colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, a few minutes ago on \nthe floor, made some very interesting remarks. She said, and I am using \nher words:\n\n       Debunk certain myths that the National Rifle Association \n     has developed; the first is the myth they have developed with \n     respect to the second amendment of the Constitution.\n\n  She said:\n\n       ``Well-regulated militia'' refers to the National Guard.\n\n  She said:\n\n       No individual right to keep and bear arms under the second \n     amendment.\n\n  She said the second amendment is a:\n\n       [F]raud on the American public by special interest groups.\n\n  She said:\n\n       The second amendment refers to the right to keep and bear \n     arms only in connection with a state militia. In other words, \n     the National Guard, not an individual.\n\n  She also said:\n\n       The second amendment does not guarantee an individual's \n     right to keep and bear arms.\n\n  Those are startling, shocking statements from a colleague whom I \nrespect immensely. She is entitled to her position. But my colleague \nmentioned various court rulings that supposedly decided that the right \nto keep and bear arms is only for the Government. It is exactly the \nopposite. The courts said so; so it must be right.\n  But let me tell you about some decisions that the courts made that \nweren't right.\n  No. 1, they said in Dred Scott in 1857 that a black man couldn't sue \nin Federal court because he was property. Do you know what. The courts \nwere wrong when they said that--dead wrong.\n  I also point out that in Plessy v. Ferguson they said ``separate but \nequal'' public facilities for blacks and other facilities for whites. \nThe courts said that, too, and they were wrong.\n  I don't think my colleagues would have argued on the floor of the \nSenate that the Supreme Court was right in those cases. There are \nplenty more cases where the courts were wrong--morally, legally, and \nconstitutionally wrong, wrong, wrong.\n  So don't come down to the floor of the Senate and say just because \nsome court said it that it is right, right, right, right, because it \nisn't.\n  My colleague also mentioned various judges. There are many judges who \nhave upheld the individual right to keep and bear arms. There is a long \nlist of them. I am not going to go through the list. I would rather \nquote instead of the judges, those fine people who wrote the \nConstitution, and who lived it.\n  They know what they meant. They said what they meant: Inalienable \nright to keep and bear arms.\n  Let's hear from a few who I think knew what they were talking about.\n  Thomas Jefferson: ``no free man shall ever be debarred the use of \narms.'' That was when he proposed the Virginia Constitution in 1776.\n  Any uncertainty about that statement?\n\n       Laws that forbid the carrying of arms . . . disarm only \n     those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit \n     crimes. . . . Such laws make things worse for the assaulted \n     and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage \n     than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked \n     with greater confidence than an armed man.\n\n  That was Thomas Jefferson's ``Commonplace Book,'' 1774-1776, quoting \nfrom ``On Crimes and Punishment'' by criminologist Cesare Beccaria, \n1764.\n\n[[Page S4047]]\n\n  George Mason, of Virginia:\n\n       [W]hen the resolution of enslaving America was formed in \n     Great Britain, the British Parliament was advised by an \n     artful man, who was governor of Pennsylvania, to disarm the \n     people; that it was the best and most effectual way to \n     enslave them; but that they should not do it openly, but \n     weaken them, and let them sink gradually . . . I ask, who are \n     the militia? They consist now of the whole people, except a \n     few public officers.--Virginia's U.S. Constitution \n     ratification convention, 1788.\n\n  Further: ``That the People have a right to keep and bear Arms; that a \nwell regulated Militia, composed of the Body of the People, trained to \narms, is the proper, natural, and safe Defence of a free state.''--\nWithin Mason's declaration of ``the essential and unalienable Rights of \nthe People,'' later adopted by the Virginia ratification convention, \n1788.\n  Samuel Adams, of Massachusetts:\n\n       The said Constitution [shall] be never construed to \n     authorize Congress to infringe the just liberty of the press, \n     or the rights of conscience; or to prevent the people of the \n     United States, who are peaceful citizens, from keeping their \n     own arms.--Massachusetts' U.S. Constitution ratification \n     convention, 1788.\n\n  In other words, freedom of the press, Freedom to bear arms--yes, yes, \nyes.\n  William Grayson, of Virginia: ``[A] string of amendments were \npresented to the lower House: these altogether respected personal \nliberty.''--Letter to Patrick Henry, June 12, 1789, referring to the \nintroduction of what become the Bill of Rights.\n  Richard Henry Lee, of Virginia:\n\n       A militia when properly formed are in fact the people \n     themselves . . . and include all men capable of bearing arms \n     . . . To preserve liberty it is essential that the whole body \n     of people always possess arms . . . The mind that aims at a \n     select militia, must be influenced by a truly anti-republican \n     principle.--Additional Letters From the Federal Farmer, 1788.\n\n  James Madison, of Virginia: The Constitution preserves ``the \nadvantage of being armed which Americans possess over the people of \nalmost every other nation . . . (where) the governments are afraid to \ntrust the people with arms.''--The Federalist, No. 46.\n  Tench Coxe, of Pennsylvania:\n\n       The militia, who are in fact the effective part of the \n     people at large, will render many troops quite unnecessary. \n     They will form a powerful check upon the regular troops, and \n     will generally be sufficient to over-awe them.--An American \n     Citizen, Oct. 21, 1787.\n\n  We could go on and on.\n  Noah Webster, of Pennsylvania:\n\n       Before a standing army can rule, the people must be \n     disarmed; as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The \n     supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the \n     sword . . .\n\n  Don't come down to the floor and tell me the founders meant that the \nsecond amendment didn't mean anything. They put it in because they knew \nthe dangers of an unarmed citizenry. Just because we have these \nterrible acts of violence perpetrated upon innocent people in this \ncountry--by criminals, by scum who prey upon us--is not a reason to \ntake away our rights under the second amendment. It is a reason to put \nthem away, put them in jail and throw the key away and leave them \nthere, and stop having sympathy for these people who do this.\n  I have a long list of people, founders who knew what they were \ntalking about. They wrote the Bill of Rights. The Bill of Rights is \nabout individual rights, not about government rights. It is about \nindividual rights. That is why they put all 10 amendments in the \nConstitution.\n  Does my colleague mean to say that the right to free speech, the \nright to free expression, the right to the freedom of religion or trial \nby jury or freedom against cruel and unusual punishment belongs to the \nState? That sounds like Communist Russia.\n  One member of the Supreme Court, Justice Joseph Story, appointed by \nJames Madison, in his ``Commentaries on the Constitution,'' considered \nthe right to keep and bear arms the ``palladium of the liberties of the \nrepublic'' which enables the citizenry to maintain and defend a free \nsociety.\n  And now let's take a look at the Thesaurus.\n  A synonym for infringed, as in ``the right to the people to keep and \nbear arms shall not be infringed,'' is encroach.\n  Encroach is defined by Webster's New World College Dictionary as ``in \na gradual or sneaky way''; ``to advance beyond the proper, original, or \ncustomary limits; make inroads on or upon.''\n  That sure sounds like what some of my colleagues are trying to \ndo, trying to sneak around or circumvent the second amendment. They are \nusing terrible tragedies that we all deplore to do it. I would like to \npunish personally, if I could, every single one of those people who \ncommitted those atrocities, but we must not trample the Constitution of \nthe United States while we do it. Let's remember that oath we took: \nUphold the rule of law and uphold the Constitution.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I stand in support of the Daschle \namendment. I want to get back to what it says. We heard a lot of \nexcited debate, but here is what the Daschle amendment says.\n  No. 1, we commend the million moms--by the way, I think there were \nmore than a million people across this country--for exercising their \nrights to gather and to send a very strong message to the Congress; in \nthis case: Save our children, stop the violence; stop the mayhem; stop \nthe school shootings; stop the church shootings; do what we are \nsupposed to do.\n  It was a very clear message. We commend them today.\n  Second, the Daschle amendment says bring back the five sensible gun \nlaws that passed the Senate already, get that conference to meet, get \nthe juvenile justice to meet, and send those laws to the President for \nhis signature. Very, very simple.\n  What does the other side say? I ask with great respect the Members on \nthe other side who are great debaters. I was here last night until \nquite late, listening and debating.\n  The other side says no laws are needed, a change in behavior is \nneeded. They said: Laws don't change behavior. I will take that to its \nlogical conclusion. If laws don't change behavior, why do we have laws \nagainst murder? Why do we have laws against rape? Why do we have laws \nthat regulate products so when our kids pick up a doll, they don't \nchoke on it? We do it to protect our citizens.\n  We are a government of laws, not men. That was stated by our \nfounders. It is a basic foundation of our Nation. I believe personally \nthat guns should not be in the hands of children. Children and guns do \nnot mix. I believe, personally, that anyone who is mentally unbalanced \nshould not have a weapon because they do not know what they are doing. \nWe heard from a woman who said, ``My brother is a manic schizophrenic \nand he has threatened my family. I do not know what to do because he \ncould go to a gun show, get a gun, and kill my child.'' So I believe \nmentally unbalanced people should not have guns. I also believe \ncriminals should not have access to weapons.\n\n  That is what the people on this side of the aisle are trying to do. \nIf you are a responsible adult, yes, you can have that weapon. If you \nhave responsibility and you understand what you are doing, that is one \nthing. But if you are not responsible, no way; that is it.\n  What is so controversial about that? My friend says, if there is a \nmurder with a weapon, put that person away. Of course, put that person \naway. Enforcement is up in this Nation.\n  USA Today did an analysis in June 1999. They said gun laws are \nenforced more vigorously today than 5 years ago by any measure. \nProsecutions are more frequent than ever before. The number of inmates \nin Federal prison on gun offenses is at a record level.\n  Of course, you put people away; you throw the book at them. As far as \nI am concerned, you can do anything to them. That is how I feel about \nsomeone who shoots and kills another person. But that doesn't stop the \nshooting. That doesn't stop the heartbreak. That doesn't stop the \nmayhem. We know that. You need to do both. We keep getting a false \nchoice here: Enforcement or no gun law. On our side, we say enforcement \nand sensible gun laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 1 additional minute to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There is a war in our streets. Here is where we stand. We \nlost\n\n[[Page S4048]]\n\n58,168 of our beautiful citizens in an 11-year period in the Vietnam \nwar until President Nixon ended that war because the people marched and \nthe people said enough is enough.\n  We have lost, in an 11-year period, 395,441 of our citizens. We have \na war at home. It is going to take courage to stand up and say enough \nis enough. Let's commend the million moms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nyielding the time and the Senator from California for, as always, her \nintelligent and heartfelt remarks. She is able to combine both, \nintelligence and direct from the heart, and it is great to listen to \nher.\n  I rise in support of the Daschle amendment. Let me make a couple of \npoints here. I do not think we should even have to be debating whether \nto close the gun show loophole or these other modest measures because \nwe all know they are the right thing to do. We all know they have the \noverwhelming support of the American people. We all know it is a small \ngroup of people--heartfelt, truly concerned--who hold this place in \nlogjam on the issue of guns.\n  Not to close the gun show loophole? Not to have a Brady check every \ntime a gun is passed from one hand to another? I go around my State and \nI ask gun owners: Has the Brady law interfered with your right to bear \narms? Not one person says yes. If it does not interfere when you go to \na gun shop, why will it interfere when you go to a gun show?\n  I had wanted to have a colloquy with my friend from New Hampshire, \nbut he is not here now. But he is talking, with great erudition and \ngreat passion, about the Founding Fathers and what they had put in the \nBill of Rights, a document we both revere. ``Revere'' is almost the \nright word. It is almost a godly document.\n  I would have liked to have asked him if he believes the second \namendment is absolute. Nobody much does. I believe in the first \namendment. I believe strongly in the first amendment. Blood is shed for \nit. But when Judge Oliver Wendell Holmes said you can't scream fire in \na crowded theater, he was putting a limit on the first amendment.\n  We put limits on every amendment. What some of my colleagues seem to \nfail to realize is, the one amendment on which they do not want to put \nany limits is the second amendment. I am not one of those who belittles \nthe second amendment. I think there is a fair argument that it deals \nwith individuals bearing arms as opposed to just militias. But I just \nas strongly believe that reasonable limits can be placed on the second \namendment the way we place them on the first.\n  Freedom of religion is sacrosanct, as it should be. But you can't \navoid taxes because you say it is your religion. You can't avoid \nservice in the Army--you can modify it but not avoid it--because you \nsay it is against your religion. Why is it that the only amendment we \nhear from the other side should not have any modification whatsoever--\neven a modest modification such as the Brady law applying at a gun \nshow--is the second amendment? I argue it is a misreading of the \nConstitution.\n  I argue to some of my friends on the left, when we demean the second \namendment, we are not playing fair because it was put there in the \nConstitution by the Founding Fathers and by the Thirteen Original \nStates just as the other nine were in the Bill of Rights. But I would \nargue with my friends from the other side of the aisle that when they \nsay it is an absolute right, as they seem to be saying today because \nthese changes are so modest, they are just as wrong as the people they \noppose on the left who demean the second amendment or who want to \nrepeal it.\n\n  I would like to make one other point. The second-degree amendment by, \nI believe it is the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Lott, talks about \nenforcement. Again, I challenge my colleagues to put their money where \ntheir mouth is. I believe in enforcement. I try not to let ideological \nbarriers get in the way. I have stood shoulder to shoulder with NRA \nmembers in New York State as we have implemented Operation Exile in \nBuffalo, in Rochester, in Syracuse, in Albany, and it has worked. It is \nan enforcement proceeding, and it works. But in so many other \nenforcement areas we get no help. In this resolution, No. 7 says it is \na Federal crime for any person to knowingly make a false statement in \nan attempted purchase of a firearm. It is a Federal crime for convicted \nfelons to purchase a firearm. Then it goes on to say that 500,000 \npeople have tried to buy firearms at gun shops and very few have been \narrested.\n  Do you know why very few have been arrested? Because of amendments \nsupported by people on the other side that do not let an ATF agent \nstand inside a gun shop; because of amendments supported by the other \nside that the records must be destroyed; because there is actually a \nlaw on the books that says there can only be one unannounced visit on a \ngun shop a year.\n  You want enforcement? I would love to have enforcement. I am a tough-\non-crime guy. I am for throwing the book at these folks who use guns in \ncrimes and who have guns illegally. But you cannot enforce the law if \nyou are going to put obstacles in the way.\n  We found out by a survey done by my staff that only a small number of \nthese gun shops sell most of the crime guns. Fewer than 1 percent of \nthe gun shops sell 50 percent of the crime guns. So if the ATF were \ngiven permission by this body to enforce the law, you could shut down \nthose few bad gun shops and let the others flourish. I welcome the \nopportunity to work with the Senator from Idaho, the Senator from \nMontana, and the Senator from New Hampshire on an enforcement bill that \nwould do the things we have to do. I welcome that opportunity. \nEnforcement is a good idea.\n  But as the Senator from California said, we can do both. One is not a \nsubstitute for the other. Enforcing the law is not a substitute for \nclosing the gun show loophole. The two are not contradictory in \nintellectual concept or in implementation. I think it is somewhat \ndisingenuous to put the two in contraposition, one to the other.\n  I thank the Senator for the time she has yielded.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the group of \npeople who organized the Million Mom March on Mother's Day. Three-\nquarters of a million people coming to Washington, DC, is rather \nimpressive. I suspect even opponents of what they are trying to do are \nimpressed with citizens' willingness to come to their Nation's Capital, \nespecially in this case, declaring their intent to organize in a \npeaceful, law-abiding fashion to change the law. I wish them all the \ngood luck in the world, and I appreciate very much the effort they have \nmade and the success they had on Mother's Day.\n  I also thank Senator Daschle for bringing the juvenile justice issue \nback before this body. All of us--at least I do in Nebraska--wrestle \nwith this question of juvenile justice on almost a daily basis. \nWhenever I am back in the State, it quickly goes to the top of the list \nof things about which people are concerned. We have methamphetamine \nproblems and other law enforcement problems, but juvenile justice is at \nthe top of the list.\n  This legislation would be relatively easy to pass were it not for \nthis gun show amendment which I will address. It has tougher \nenforcement provisions, but it also provides resources to States, \nGovernors, and community organizations so we can prevent crime from \nhappening in the first place. It is almost without controversy that the \ncompromise provisions we reached on the law enforcement side and the \nprevention side will work, and the communities are asking for that \nbill. What is holding it up is this gun show provision. I have come to \nthe floor to talk about it.\n  I listened carefully to the opposition to the original Lautenberg \namendment, especially those who said there was too much paperwork, too \nmuch regulation. I played a role in it, I called Tom Nichols in Omaha, \nNE, who operates one of the largest gun dealerships in the Midwest to \nask him if he would help me fashion something. Frankly, I worked\n\n[[Page S4049]]\n\nwith Mr. Nichols before trying to reduce the paperwork gun dealers \nface, which does not increase safety but increases paperwork without \nanything one can measure and say was beneficial.\n  He agreed, understanding he would take a little heat for \nparticipating. I shipped him the Lautenberg amendment. He made \nmodifications and changes. Senator Lautenberg offered that amendment \nthe second time. Now, what we are talking about is something that, in \nmy view, requires a minimal amount of regulations.\n  As the Senator from New York said earlier, unlike most businesses, a \ngun dealer has a relatively small amount of regulation to face. It may \nfeel like a lot if it is your business. I am licensed to sell alcoholic \nbeverages in the State of Nebraska, and there is no restriction that \nsomeone can only come in once a year to inspect my premises, and if I \ndestroy my records, it is only a misdemeanor. They can come in six \ntimes a day if they want to make certain I am obeying the law. We have \na fairly light hand already in terms of regulation, given the \ntransactions that are in place.\n  The Lautenberg-Kerrey--if I can be so bold as to call it that--\namendment decreases in a significant way the paperwork that was \nrequired in the original amendment.\n  If one looks at the statistics, there are a very high number of \nhandguns that are purchased from dealers, about 3.5 million, and about \n2 million that are purchased off the books. I am not saying all those \nare bought at gun shows, but there are 2,000 to 5,000 gun shows every \nyear, so a pretty big fraction of those are purchased there.\n  Like every licensed dealer, this is what the gun show dealer will \nhave to do: They will have to register with ATF and pay a small fee. If \nsomeone objects to the size of the fee, let's debate that. They license \nthemselves; they just register with ATF.\n  Each vendor has to show proof of identification when they check into \nthe gun show. All they verify is that the vendor is who he or she \nclaims to be.\n  The gun show promoter has to let people know every gun sold has to go \nthrough the NICS background check. That is a full 3-day background \ncheck. That is the extent of the regulation. We modified the original \namendment and now have one that, in my view, will save lives. Will it \nsave millions of lives? Probably not. Will it save hundreds of lives? \nProbably not. What value do we place on a human life? How do we value \nthe number of lives that have already been saved by the Brady \nbackground checks themselves?\n  The State of Nebraska is a State where hunting is almost a religion; \nit is a way of life. Kids in Nebraska are raised to handle guns in a \nsafe fashion at a very early age, to handle long rifles, to handle \nshotguns, and even handguns at a very early age. These people are not \nthe problem. I would not be here voting for something that is going to \nimpose a regulatory requirement upon them if I did not believe strongly \nthat it will save lives in other parts of the country. In my view, it \nwill. That is what this is all about.\n  Are we going to try to balance the needs of one group of people \nagainst the needs of another? The Senator from New York talked about \nthat. That is exactly what we do. That is what the doctrine of relative \nrights says. I do have freedom of speech, unless my freedom of speech \nbumps up and endangers the life of somebody else. Oftentimes, that is \nthe problem with guns.\n  I agree with those who say we ought to enforce the laws. I agree that \nlaw enforcement needs to be given more power. But, I don't agree that \nenforcing the laws alone is the answer. We must also enact reasonable \nmeasures like this.\n  This is a very reasonable change in the laws of the land. It imposes \nwhat I consider to be a very modest regulatory burden upon people who \nare organizing gun shows. It is hardly about any measurement of \nregulation. Go to any business in America where we regulate for safe \ndrinking water or anything else. This is a relatively small burden for \nsuch an obvious benefit.\n  I hope Senators will examine--I see the Senator from New Jersey is \nhere--what I have been calling it the Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment. It \nimposes a very small burden upon people who are opening up gun shows \nand operating gun shows. I do not want to shut down the gun shows. \nThis, obviously, does not shut them down; this allows them to continue \nto operate.\n  In addition, there is another argument that the playing field needs \nto be leveled, that the regulatory playing field needs to be the same \non every premise where guns are sold. Why should you give me an \nadvantage? Why should you say if you want to be a licensed gun dealer, \nbuild a building, and hire and employ people to work in your local \ncommunity, there is a set of regulations you have to go through. But if \nall you want to do is have a gun show once every 6 months or so, you do \nnot have to go through the same kind of regulation.\n  I appreciate very much that this has become a contentious debate, but \nfrankly, when you look at what we are asking in the regulation, it \nperplexes me.\n  This is holding up a very important piece of legislation. The \nJuvenile Justice Act is a piece of legislation, in my view, that will \nreduce crime and reduce violent crime and increase the likelihood that \nit will prevent them as well. It has been worked out. Republicans and \nDemocrats came together. It was a very big vote. My guess is, it will \nprobably be 100-0 without this one particular contentious provision.\n  I hope Senators will examine what this so-called gun show provision \ndoes. It is not unreasonable regulation. It is reasonable regulation \nthat, based upon the success of Brady, we can say will produce a \nbenefit that is worth the price.\n  That is what all of us, as we try to figure out whether or not we are \ngoing to support a particular regulation, regardless of who is being \nregulated, ought to examine. Is the cost of the regulation worth the \nbenefit we get? In this case, I overwhelmingly, enthusiastically, and \nunfortunately painfully, because it is slowing down the enactment of a \nvery good law, come to the conclusion that it will.\n  I hope through the course of this debate, this will become clear. A \nmajority in the country, 80 percent of the people, favor it when it is \ndescribed specifically to them. It is not something that should be \nslowing down the Juvenile Justice Act. Indeed, we ought to see it as \nnot only consistent with, but strengthening the Juvenile Justice Act \nand pass it with all due speed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President I have sat quietly by through the hours of \nlast evening and listened to my colleagues debate a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution with great passion, and I respect them for their passion. I \nthink all of us enter issues wanting to believe in them and trust they \nare the right thing to do. We saw an awful lot of moms on The Mall this \nweekend marching because they thought it was the right thing to do. \nThey marched against violence, I trust.\n  Some of them have had violence ravaged against them and their \nfamilies, and they were here to speak out about that. Interestingly \nenough, underlying the march was a premise of gun registration and gun \ncontrol. I think most Americans recognize while that is an important \nissue with violence, that does not solve the violence that takes away \nso many of our young people. That is why we are on the floor today.\n  It is strange we find ourselves with such passion about something \nthat will not count. A sense-of-the-Senate resolution is like walking \noutside and saying: It's pretty nice today, and tomorrow it will \nprobably be better. But, of course, the Presiding Officer knows \ntomorrow it may not be better; it may be worse, weatherwise. In other \nwords, just saying it does not make it so.\n\n  A sense-of-the-Senate resolution is in itself a political point, a \npolitical expression. It is not substantive law. It is not intended to \nbe. It is intended to make a political point.\n  So what is the fuss about? The fuss is that we have already dealt \nwith this issue, and the House rejected it. Somehow my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle cannot accept the idea that the Congress of \nthe United States has rejected something about which they feel so \npassionate.\n  So they have stopped the process in the Senate. They have chosen a \ntactic that most of us would choose not to use to stop the process in a \nnonsubstantive\n\n[[Page S4050]]\n\nway. I do not dispute their passion, but I do question their motives.\n  Here we are dealing with a piece of legislation that has to pass this \nyear to make our Government run. I serve on the subcommittee of \nappropriations that deals with military construction. The Senator from \nWashington serves on that committee. She was there at that committee \nmaking sure her bases in Washington and my base in Idaho got treated \nfairly. But we are stalled out right now. We have lost 8 hours of \ncritical time in a very short legislative year, not out of substantive \ndebate but a political point.\n  I know that may spell some degree of importance, but passing the \nDaschle resolution today does not the world change. Passing the \nLautenberg amendment last year might have changed the world if the \nHouse had not said no to the Senate's approach. So here we are today in \npolitics and not in legislation.\n  Of course, the other side wants to be reflective of what those women \nsaid on The Mall. So do I. I cannot tell you I feel their pain because \nI have not lost a loved one to violence. But I think I can understand \njust a little bit of it. You see, there were other moms marching there, \ntoo, but they did not get much attention. They, too, had lost loved \nones to violence. But they also recognized that they have a right in \nthis country; and the right is to self-defense to protect themselves \nand their families when law enforcement cannot make it there in time. \nMoms want to do that. They will put themselves in harm's way to protect \ntheir children.\n  Tragically enough, the other moms are saying: Let the Government do \nit. The Government can fix this problem. And the Government can fix \nthis problem if it will only pass a law.\n  Oh, my goodness. What a hoax. What a false premise, to tell those \nmoms, who came from all over the country, with dedicated concerns, that \nwe will just pass a law and the world will be a better place. It has \nnot happened.\n  This Congress, year after year, struggles with violence in our \ncountry; and we reshape the structure of our laws to deal with it. Yet \nwe have not found an answer to it. We have not found an answer to it \nbecause our culture has changed dramatically over the years.\n  The family unit is different than it used to be. Children are reared \ndifferently than they used to be. The violence in our juvenile culture \ntoday is alarming. We all appreciate it. We are all frustrated by it \nand angered by it. Yet you were led to believe that all kids die \nbecause of a gun. It ``ain't'' so. It just ``ain't'' so.\n  In 1997, 1,700 kids died because of motor vehicles. They were killed \nin a car crash, a violent car crash. Sixteen hundred were killed in \ntraffic accidents. That is violence, perpetrated on somebody 10 years \nof age or younger.\n\n  Mr. President, 750 died by drowning. We know we cannot outlaw \ndrowning. Now, we can teach kids to swim, and we can teach water \nsafety, and we can lessen the risk, but, God knows, we cannot legislate \nhere to stop drowning because if we could, we would. But we know we \ncannot.\n  Mr. President, 575 died of suffocation--rolled over on their pillow, \nrolled over on a plastic mattress, got a sack over their head--some \nvery dramatic--and, in the end, a violent act.\n  Residential fires, 570; struck by or on something, 89; falls, 87; \ncycling, 78; poisoning, 58.\n  Now, this is 1997. But yet on The Mall on Saturday, it was: 5,000 \nkids die because of guns. They were not telling the truth. That is the \nproblem. Because the bulk of those kids were 15 to 19 years of age, and \nthey were caught in the crossfire of a drug war on the streets of \nAmerica.\n  That is violence and that is tragic and that is horrible. And we are \ngoing to try to fight a war on drugs. But in 1997, only 48 kids age 10 \nyears or younger were killed by the misuse of a firearm. And the number \nis less today.\n  Those are the facts. Those are the facts that come from the National \nCenter for Injury Prevention and Control. And doggone it, we ought to \nset the record straight, and we ought to be honest with those moms. \nThat is what we ought to be. Yet today we are not.\n  Today, the rhetoric is not about the violence in America against \nAmerica's young people; it is about a false premise of passing a law \nand the world will be better and the Sun will come up tomorrow. I do \nnot think we can do that. I would like to be able to do it. I am not at \nall convinced we can.\n  Firearms, misused, killing young people, 10 years of age or younger, \nis 10th or 11th on the list of how young kids die 10 years of age or \nyounger. Those are the facts. It is important we talk about them.\n  So we are stalled out on a critically important piece of legislation \nthat ought to move. I hope it will move.\n  We dealt with guns last year, and the Congress rejected what we did. \nI did not support it. I voted against it. I thought it had gone too \nfar. Pass a law; fix it; it is all over with; we have made the world a \nsafer place.\n  And 20,000 gun laws that we currently have, with few of them being \nenforced--and most of them not, in many instances--and we pass another \nlaw and turn to the American people with a straight face, and say: The \nworld will now be safe? I think not. And guess what. The American \npeople understand it.\n  On Saturday of this past week, a candidate for President stood up and \nsaid: I am going to buy a lot of safety locks, and I am going to make \nthem available to people who want to use them. Somebody said: That is a \nsilly idea. I say that is a great idea. Why aren't we doing this with \nGovernment here? Why don't we voluntarily get involved in making the \nworld safer and educating people and training them?\n  The Senator from Nebraska said: Kids who are trained in the use of \nfirearms do not hurt themselves. And they know better because they know \na firearm is a dangerous object misused. Kids who are not trained, kids \nwho are not educated, are the kids who hurt themselves. Yet this \nGovernment is not involved in an educational program.\n  So when a candidate for President steps up and says, ``Let's make the \nworld safer, on a voluntary basis,'' somebody says, ``Make it \nmandatory.'' We are going to set up a cop system to go into every house \nto check to see if every gun has a trigger lock on it? I do not think \nwe are going to do that. Yet that is kind of what the other side is \nsuggesting: Make it mandatory, and enforce it.\n  How do you enforce a law such as that? The practicality is, you \ndon't. You don't enter every home in America to prove it; that is, \nunless you have licensed the gun and you know the gun is there. Then do \nyou do random checks on private property? I don't think we get there, \neither. I think our Constitution, somewhere else in its text, would \ndeny the Government of this country the right to enter that private \nproperty, for whatever reason, unless there was just cause and a court \norder. Those are some of the real issues.\n  I am frustrated--I think my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare, too--that we cannot reach out and solve these critical problems, \nthat somehow the passion that we feel about the violence that is \nwrought against the young people in this country cannot be fixed by \nthis august and powerful body called the Senate. We know we can't fix \nit, so let's try to politic it. Boy, have we tried.\n\n  The other side couldn't gain traction because the American people \nsaid: Something is wrong besides just laws. Something is wrong in the \nculture of our country. Something is wrong with all of the violence our \nchildren see, and it transfers into their minds. Somehow they begin to \nunderstand that they can act violently, and there is no consequence for \nthat action or there is less consequence. Yes, they watch a lot of \nviolent activities on television and, yes, they play a lot of violent \ngames and, yes, it has an impact. Well, let's fix Hollywood.\n  Do you think this side of the aisle would do that? I doubt that. We \nare not going to fix them because that is first amendment rights. \nNobody over here is saying we have to restrict first amendment rights. \nIt is only the second amendment we fix.\n  That is why we are here today, stalled out, for the political point \nthe opposition is trying to make on this issue. It is raw politics. It \nis not substance, and they know it, because it is a sense of the \nSenate. Last year, when we debated the Lautenberg amendment, that was \nsubstance. That could have become law if the Congress of the United \nStates had agreed. But they didn't.\n\n[[Page S4051]]\n\n  We are here today stalled out for the politics of the issue, not the \nsubstance of the issue. We want to say to the Million Mom March and the \nhundreds of thousands who were gathered on The Mall, we care, we hear \nyou. That is what we keep hearing from some of our Senators. Well, we \nall heard them, and you are darned right, we care.\n  The issue is violence in America--all violence, not just guns. That \nis a minority part of the violence. It is sometimes the most visible \nand the most publicized, but this is the beginning of spring and into \nsummer. This is the swimming season. Nobody today is standing on the \nfloor suggesting hundreds of kids will drown this year from improper \ntraining and improper supervision of their parents and we ought to pass \na law to save all those kids. No, we are not doing that. Why? Because \nwe can't. That is why.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have just witnessed one of the most \nsignificant demonstrations this country has ever seen: 750,000 moms, \nsome pops, some grandpops, some grandmas, people who love their \nchildren, people who want to protect their children, sending a message, \nwhen they gathered 750,000 strong, just in Washington, DC. There were \nother cities across the country where not too dissimilar demonstrations \nand marches were being held. There were large turnouts in lots of \ncities.\n  As a matter of fact, one in New Jersey, one mom march, was headed by \npeople who have become my friends. Their name is LoCicero. Jake \nLoCicero and his wife lost their daughter on the Long Island train, \nkilled by an assassin who took quite a few lives. They were active gun \nclub members, NRA. They said: Enough; we are not doing this anymore. We \ndon't want our daughter to have died in vain. She was young, about to \nget married, in her early twenties. They believed she had to make a \ncontribution. Her life was so valuable, she had to leave a legacy that \nwent beyond her short time on Earth.\n  Then we hear the trivialization of laws to try to protect children, \nas we just heard: It is just politics; it is only politics. What do you \nmean, you want to protect your kid when they go to school? That is \npolitics.\n  When are we going to stop this nonsense here? ``Nonsense,'' I use the \nword advisedly. We just heard our friend from Idaho talk about how many \nchildren die in automobile accidents and how many die falling off bikes \nand how many die suffocating in their cribs. I ask any of my \ncolleagues, don't we have regulations that say put a safety belt on, \nput a child in a child seat? I have seven grandchildren. I watch my \ndaughters put their children in the seats because they don't want them \nto get hurt. They know what the rules are. They could violate the rules \nand say, no, I am not going to do it, but good sense says you have to \ndo it.\n  There are all kinds of warnings about different mattress covers and \nplastic bags and things of that nature. There are warnings about \nwearing helmets when you go out for a bike ride. We try to stop the \nmayhem in those situations. But our friend over here said: No. Don't \nworry about the few kids who are killed by guns. He made a statement--\nand I want the Record to be checked to be sure that that statement was \nwhat I heard, and I listened carefully--guns don't kill.\n  How does that lead pellet get through a kid's heart or his head if it \ndoesn't come from a gun? It doesn't come from a knife. It is not \nbecause of a slingshot. It comes from a gun.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I did not make that statement.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will check the Record.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Please, check the Record. I did not make that statement.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. You said guns don't kill.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I didn't say that.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have the floor, thank you very much.\n  Trivializing the ownership of guns, saying that if we have gun \nenforcement laws, guards from the Federal Government will come into \nevery room in every house. Don't protect the children.\n  He wants to have a statistical debate about how many really died. Not \nthat many. Heck, no, not so many. A few maybe, but not a lot--unless it \nis your kid, unless it is your friend, unless it is your niece or your \nnephew or your sister's kid or your brother's kid. A lot of us have not \nexperienced it directly, but anyone who doesn't empathize or sympathize \nwith someone who has lost a child, who doesn't understand the emotion \nthat renders, doesn't get it, just doesn't understand it.\n\n  When 12 young people were shot in Columbine High School, those were \nnot the only wounds. There were some who were hit by guns who also were \nwounded. But that wounding took place throughout the school, throughout \nthe community, throughout the country. People had a vision of that boy \nhanging down from the window pleading for help: Save me. We couldn't \nhear the words, but we could see the gesture.\n  Well, we are detached from that. Why do you have to control guns? \nJust because a few kids got killed? That is what is being said here. I \ncan't believe my ears. We will check the Record. We could be mistaken \nabout one thing, but check the Record and see what it says.\n  Kids get killed from drowning. It is as if to say, if kids get killed \nfrom bike rides, from car rides, from suffocating in a crib or \ndrowning, then that is kind of normal. It isn't normal because we have \nlifeguards and all kinds of protections. But when it comes to guns, no, \nyou can't touch that. We hear about the second amendment.\n  I am always reminded, when we discuss the second amendment, it was \nsaid by the Supreme Court that the amendment guarantees the right to be \narmed only in service to a well regulated militia.\n  No one has an automatic right to own a firearm. No one has the right \nto own a firearm without a license. No one has the right to buy a gun \nwithout those of us in the community asking who they are. I authored \nthe Lautenberg law, along with Senator Kerrey from Nebraska. Both of us \nserved in the military. I wasn't as heroic. He is a Medal of Honor \nwinner, having lost a leg in Vietnam. I spent my time in World War II. \nI was not touched. We know something about guns. Should someone be able \nto buy a gun from an unlicensed dealer? That is the subject. From an \nunlicensed dealer, no questions asked, buyers anonymous --oh, protect \nthe identity of that potential felon, protect the identity of someone \nwho may be so disturbed, that if they get their hands on a gun, they \nwill kill somebody. It has happened. We have seen it lots of times. We \nhave seen it at Columbine, with two young boys who were too young to \nbuy a gun. A girl testified before the Colorado Legislature that she \nwent around with them to find a nonlicensed dealer to buy guns. She \nsaid, ``If I knew then what I know now, I would have never done it.'' \nTwelve children and a teacher are now dead. There have been bombs and \neverything else.\n  We didn't have to openly say, OK, because kids get killed in swimming \npools, cars, or in bike accidents, you can have guns. Why shouldn't you \nhave guns? What does one thing have to do with the other? Heaven forbid \nit is a child in your family.\n  Talking about the second amendment, Chief Justice Warren Burger--a \nconservative appointed to the Supreme Court by President Nixon, and a \ngun owner himself--called the NRA's distortion of the second amendment \n``a fraud on the American public.'' Cases are never tested on the \nsecond amendment in court. Now, they can't prove that. But there is \nthis mythology about what happens when it comes to guns. If you want to \nown them, you can. If you want to identify yourself, fine. If you don't \nwant to, that is OK, too. What I heard proposed was that maybe every \nchild or every person who walks this Earth should have a gun, and they \ncan act quickly enough so if a law enforcement guy doesn't get there on \ntime, they can stop a murder that might be taking place. I ask the \nmanager, is there any more time available?\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield the Senator from New Jersey 3 additional \nminutes.\n\n[[Page S4052]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will wrap up, Mr. President. This is a passionate \ndebate, and it ought to be. It ought not to be called politics. I would \nlike to hear any of those who advocate not shutting down the unlicensed \ndealers tell it to the 750,000 women out there, those who were talking \nfrom experience, who lost a child. We have heard them. The Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Illinois are on the floor. We heard \nthem talk about the child who had a bullet go through his spine here in \nWashington, DC--19 years old, a promising young man just in the \nbeginning of life.\n  Mr. President, I have to ask this question. If this sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution is so insignificant that it should have just been in \nlaw, then why not let it pass? Why not have this Senate say: Million \nmoms, we salute you; we commend you; we understand you; and we hear \nyou--not, oh, no, no; we don't want to do that because that only \nencourages, in some perverse way, violence. And you have to get guns in \neverybody's hands so they can protect themselves.\n  I fought as hard as I could to get an amendment into law--a piece of \nlegislation that would prevent spousal abusers from getting guns. I \nfought tooth and nail with Senators on the floor. Some might say that \nis a worthless thing; why bother? Well, 150,000 times a year it is \nreported that a woman in this country gets a gun pointed at her head \nand he says, ``I'm going to blow your brains out.'' What happens to the \nchildren who see that or the neighbors who hear that? What happens to \nthe woman when he pulls the trigger? We know what happens. They fought \nme tooth and nail. But the President and I worked together and got it \non a budget bill that had to pass.\n  Mr. President, 33,000 permits for guns have been denied when the \napplicant wasn't of sufficient mind or character to own a gun--33,000 \ntimes we have said no in 3\\1/2\\ years to those people who wanted to \nhave guns. We had a fight over the Brady bill. Over 500,000 gun permits \nhave been denied since the beginning of Brady. Does that help prevent \nlives from being lost?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 3 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield the Senator from New Jersey 2 additional minutes \nto finish his statement.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is time to put the rhetoric aside. Let's see if \nthere really is an interest in doing what we want to do, and that is \nexpress ourselves and pass a sense of the Senate that we Senators agree \nwe ought to do something about gun violence and not go into long tales \nabout kids dying from drownings and other things. Why can't we \nregulate, in some form, the way guns are handled out there and make \nsure we know who the buyers are, make sure that we have the right kind \nof law enforcement? We do it because it has increased substantially \nsince gun laws were on the books. We have reduced the number of people \nwho are out on the streets with guns. They are in jail. But to try to \nminimize the value of controlling who buys a gun--how does that hurt \nanybody who wants to buy a gun, a legitimate gun purchaser? It doesn't \nhurt anybody.\n\n  I hope we can finally come together here and say, OK, this sense of \nthe Senate doesn't hurt anything anyway. Let's do it and say we are \nserious. Let's say to the moms who marched out there last Sunday: We \nhear you and we understand what you are talking about. A million moms \nwere marching from across the country. We hear debate about whether or \nnot kids get killed from other sources as well. It hardly seems \nserious. It hardly seems real. It hardly seems possible that we could \nbe having this kind of debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Before I yield to my colleague from Wyoming, it hardly \nseems important, but it is. I joined with the Senator from New Jersey \nto right the spousal abuse provision, and I voted for it. He didn't say \nthat on the floor; he should have. We had some disagreements. We worked \nout those differences so that those who are adjudicated spousal abusers \ncan't buy a gun. But those who were only accused but not proven can \nstill hold their rights. Those are the facts. The Senator from New \nJersey knows it; he failed to say it.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of all \nSenators, and anyone else who might hear our words, that it is a very \nconfusing situation here on the floor. One might think the issue up for \ndebate is guns. The underlying issue of the entire debate process is \nmilitary construction--military construction. That is where we take \ncare of the security of this Nation. That is where we provide for \nmilitary housing. That is where we provide for cleaning up the \nenvironment on bases that are having a problem. That is where we \nprovide for the morale of our military.\n  But you heard guns discussed. This is an amendment that I think is \nnot germane to the process. It is not about security, not about \nhousing, not about the environment, not about the morale of our \nmilitary people. It is not about the military. We are going to use up a \nday and a half debating that. The other side says, well, if it is so \ninsignificant, why not pass it? Because we are setting a precedent for \nthis body that we have not had before. We are setting a precedent for \nthis body that under appropriations we are going to debate a sense of \nthe Senate that anybody brings up, whether it applies to anything in \nthe bill or not.\n  That is a very important precedent. It is very important that we do \nnot set that precedent, that we do not get off on debating any whim \nthat anybody in the Senate wants to do under any bill. There has to be \na process--particularly a process for spending almost $2 trillion of \nthe people's money. This is supposed to be a deliberative debate about \nspending the money--spending the money on military construction--just \nmilitary construction. Instead we are talking about guns.\n\n  Last night, the Senator from California said we have time for this; \nthat, after all, we have 4 months left before the new appropriations \nhave to go into place.\n  I want everyone to understand that, 4 months. First of all, we will \nnot be here for all of the 4 months. This is an election year. People \nwill be leaving to participate in their candidacy. We will be gone \nduring August.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ENZI. I am sorry. Time is equally divided on this. I will not \nyield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator declines to yield.\n  Mr. ENZI. We have 4 months. One month we will be gone for recess. \nThat leaves 12 weeks. We have 13 appropriations bills. We seldom pass \nmore than one appropriations bill a week.\n  I can tell you that if we start doing sense-of-the-Senate resolutions \non appropriations bills, we will not be able to get them finished in a \nweek. What does that do? That puts the process that the Constitution \nsays is ours, the Congress of the United States, in the hands of the \nPresident.\n  I have to admit that were I the President, I might want that to \nhappen, and that is why the other side delays and delays and delays \nwith things such as sense-of-the-Senate resolutions.\n  Last year, we put rule XVI back into effect. We said we are not going \nto legislate on appropriations bills. That was a major move for this \ncountry. We said there will be no legislation on bills.\n  Now what we are talking about as the point of this whole debate is \nwhether we are going to have sense-of-the-Senate resolutions back door. \nWhy is that important? We said no real legislation.\n  Now are we going to allow any kind of a debate we want on any kind of \na topic with a sense-of-the-Senate resolution? A sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution says it is kind of our opinion, and it would make us feel \ngood to pass it, and perhaps with all of the publicity we can persuade \nAmerica that we are right. Well, America sees through that. America \nknows whether we are really doing our work or whether we are trying to \nmake people feel good. We don't know that yet. But they know that.\n  That is the process that we are going through. This will set a \nprecedent. We set a precedent under the budget this year. There were \ndozens of sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that did not make it into the \nbudget process. I know. I negotiated two sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions dealing with OSHA.\n\n[[Page S4053]]\n\n That is one of the most difficult things to reach agreement on between \nthe Democrats and the Republicans. But it was for the safety of \nAmerican workers. We agreed to two of them. We had another one on \nhealth care.\n  Sometimes it is difficult for Republicans and Democrats to agree. We \nagreed.\n  Then in the budget process, we said no, unless these have been fully \ndebated. And there is a very limited time for debate. In the budget, we \nsaid we are not going to do that.\n  Some very good sense-of-the-Senate resolutions went down. We decided \nat that point in the process that we should not do sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions; they really do not mean much except for people being able \nto stand up later and say: This sense of the Senate passed 100-0. Well, \nthey passed it in a hurry to get it out of the way so we could get on \nwith substantial debate that this body is charged with--the bipartisan \neffort that we are charged with of getting an appropriations bill \nfinished, and then the other 12 appropriations bills that we are \nsupposed to do.\n  We cannot concede 8 hours of debate on every issue that wasn't \nbrought up through any other process. We can't give up 8 hours on every \npartisan issue that can come to this body.\n  Never mind that it was a knee-jerk, one-size-fits-all, do-it-in-\nWashington, make-the-people-feel-good motion. It doesn't solve \nproblems. It just doesn't solve it. It is just a political issue. It \nisn't a complete reflection of even the march that happened Sunday.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from today's Washington Post by Courtland Milloy in which he \ntalks about some of the other issues at the march. It wasn't all about \nguns. It was about the safety of our kids. But you can tell that the \nbig publicity thing is guns. I ask the Senate to watch what is \nhappening and not set a precedent.\n  I thank the Senator for the time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 17, 2000]\n\n                   To Be Safe, Start With the Driver\n\n                         (By Courtland Milloy)\n\n       Lisa Sheikh, a child safety advocate, was a volunteer at \n     the Million Mom March. She was moved by the speeches, \n     including one praising this generation of mothers for doing \n     so much to make children safer, like getting childproof caps \n     on medicine bottles and better car seats for children.\n       But Sheikh is also director of the Partnership for Safe \n     Driving. She knows that more children are killed in car \n     crashes than by guns and that many of the people operating \n     those deadly vehicles are mothers.\n       ``A lot of others are speeding and running red lights,'' \n     Sheikh said.\n       Sheikh, fresh from the march, had come to see me because we \n     disagree about some of the ways being used to get people to \n     drive safely. She favors automated enforcement--i.e., \n     cameras--to curb red-light running; I do not. I think a \n     driver's education program, updated to deal with the new \n     realities of our congested roads, would work.\n       She thinks an education campaign by itself would take too \n     long to make a difference. She does agree with me, though, \n     that driver's education and safety have never really been \n     given a fair chance.\n       Most of the efforts by the National Highway Traffic Safety \n     Administration, for instance, have been on making car crashes \n     safer, not drivers smarter.\n       Indeed, the NHTSA Web page is taken up largely with news \n     about seat belts, air bags and those celebrity ``crash \n     dummies.''\n       ``It's all about how well does this or that car perform in \n     a crash,'' Sheikh said. ``No one is talking about the role of \n     the driver.''\n       The Partnership for Safe Driving, which was formed three \n     years ago, seeks to change driving behavior through \n     television, radio and print advertising campaigns. The \n     Washington-based organization is seeking funds for a \n     nationwide education effort.\n       To be fair, the NHTSA puts out a little ``Driver's Guide to \n     Coping With Congestion.''\n       ``You are late for work--again,'' it begins. ``Traffic is \n     bumper to bumper. You can feel the tension mounting. Suddenly \n     you see an opening. You accelerate. You jerk your wheel \n     quickly to the left. Mission accomplished.\n       ``Welcome,'' the guide says, ``to commuter purgatory, where \n     heavy traffic has unleashed the `driving demon' in all of \n     us.''\n       Tips to get out of this man-made hell include planning \n     ahead, concentrating, relaxing, telecommuting or changing \n     jobs.\n       I think we can do better than that.\n       When I was in high school, we had a real driver's education \n     program, complete with driving simulators and a fleet of cars \n     for real test drives. This was back in the 1960s. Surely, the \n     technology is now available to provide even more \n     comprehensive understanding of the rules of the road.\n       Moreover, my driver's education course was not just about \n     how to maneuver a car. It was also about developing \n     appreciation for the high level of cooperation required to \n     keep our highways safe.\n       In recent years, driver's education programs have been cut \n     from most public high schools in the country, even as crashes \n     caused by inexperienced teenage drivers were increasing.\n       So, we cut funds for driver's education, then address the \n     resulting problem with moneymaking enforcement techniques, \n     such as red-light cameras. (Come to think of it, we do the \n     same thing with public schools and private prisons. Cut funds \n     in one, then clean up the resulting mess by building more of \n     the other.)\n       Sheikh believes we have no choice for now, that red-light \n     running has reached epidemic proportions. Running red lights, \n     she notes, is the third leading cause of traffic deaths, \n     behind speeding and drunken driving.\n       ``People simply have more demands on their time--with two \n     working adults struggling to get children to and from school, \n     then going off to work, then getting them to soccer practice \n     and other activities,'' she said. ``They don't have time to \n     do everything. So they are trying to make up time on the \n     road. Of course, that's not an excuse.''\n       But it could be part of an safe driver's education \n     campaign: a soccer mom and her smoking gun that, in this \n     case, could be a Volvo.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nWashington for yielding the time.\n  I rise in support of Senator Daschle's resolution to commend the \nparticipants in the Million Mom March, and to also call on Congress to \npass meaningful gun safety legislation. Senator Daschle, as we all \nknow, has been a long-time advocate and leader on the issue of gun \ncontrol. I thank him for taking this issue on. I would prefer, frankly, \nto be speaking about real legislation.\n  I find it ironic that Members of the Senate would be bemoaning the \nfact that we don't have real legislation before us when, in fact, \nlegislation is bottled up in a conference committee because of a gun \nlobby in the NRA. We all would prefer to be speaking about real \nlegislation that would do something.\n  This is a resolution that follows another resolution I sponsored just \na few weeks ago on the budget that would have called for the conferees \nto meet and to discharge and send to us a conference report including \nall the provisions, including the Lautenberg-Kerrey gun show provision \nthat we passed almost a year ago. That resolution passed 53-47 on a \nbipartisan basis.\n  It is quite clear that these measures should return to us in the form \nof the juvenile justice conference report that will be passed by this \nSenate.\n  What that caused is the gun lobby and the NRA to do all they can to \nensure that conference report stays locked up in the conference.\n  We are here today because we want to move forward on an agenda of \nsensible gun control. We want to respond to the thousands and thousands \nof mothers who came to Washington last weekend and who asked us to act \nresponsibly to protect the children of this country. A vast majority of \nAmericans support us. They support these measures, and they, in fact, \nare insistent that we take action.\n  If there is any reason today why we are talking about another \nresolution on a military construction appropriations, it is because the \ngun lobby has dug themselves in to prevent consideration of real \nlegislation. We have to overcome that opposition. We have to overcome \nit by word and by deed. Last Sunday, the mothers of America marched. \nNow it is our responsibility to act today at least by passing this \nresolution.\n  We also know the real sticking point in this legislative battle is \nthe Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment with respect to gun shows. What we want \nto do and what I think the American people want to do is apply the same \nrules of the Brady background checks to all sales at gun shows. The \nBrady bill gives law enforcement authority up to 72 hours--brief as it \nis--to conduct a background check on a prospective purchaser of a \nfirearm.\n  What happened was in the development of the original Brady law there \nwas a loophole created which would\n\n[[Page S4054]]\n\nallow unlicensed dealers at gun shows to avoid these background checks. \nInterestingly enough, three of the weapons used by the Columbine \nkillers were acquired at a gun show because even these young men knew \nthat they could go to a gun show and avoid a background check, and that \nthey could, in cohort with another, purchase arms without a background \ncheck. We want to close it. I hope we can.\n  This is also the case throughout the country where this is not just a \nDemocratic-Republican issue.\n  The Governor of Colorado, Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican, recently \nsigned a petition to place a gun show initiative with a 3-day \nbackground check on the ballot in his home State of Colorado.\n  It is sensible, and it is long overdue. The opponents of this measure \nare suggesting that this is a mandatory waiting period--it is a 3-day \nwaiting period--that a waiting period would destroy the gun shows. That \nis not the case. In fact, if you look at what is happening, it is \nbecause of technology. Because of the national instant check system, \nthe FBI can clear 72 percent of gun buyers within 30 seconds. Another \n23 percent are cleared within 2 hours. Ninety-five percent of those \nindividuals who wish to purchase a firearm in this country have their \nbackground checks completed in 2 hours.\n  What about the other 5 percent?\n  The other 5 percent found out they are 20 times more likely to have \nprohibitive information in their files which will restrict their access \nto a firearm. Here is what is happening: The gun lobby and the NRA \nprotect 5 percent of gun purchasers who are much more likely to be \nprohibited from owning firearms, are willing to sabotage the closing of \nthis loophole, are willing to jeopardize, if you will, the safety of \nAmericans. I don't think that is right.\n  What we can and should apply the Brady law across the board to all \nsales of gun shows. I don't think it will interfere materially in any \nway with the rights of a law-abiding citizen to acquire a firearm. In \nfact, I think it will contribute to the public safety and to the sense \nthat the mothers in America tried so vividly to create last weekend: \nThat this country, with all of its violence, has to do something \ndifferent and has to do something better.\n  I hope we can move forward with real legislation, not another \nresolution. I hope we can recognize what hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans were saying to their Government last Sunday: Pass sensible \ngun safety legislation.\n  I commend the mothers and all the supporters who were on The Mall. I \ncommend Senator Daschle for his efforts. I hope we will, before \nMemorial Day, be voting on the juvenile justice bill containing these \nmeasures which will protect all Americans, and particularly the \nchildren in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 27 minutes; \nthe Senator from Idaho has 30 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nyielding. For those who have not followed this debate closely, it is \ntrue that we are not debating the passage of a law; we are debating the \npassage of a resolution which is more or less a message of the Senate \nexpressing its opinion.\n  Why aren't we debating a law, since this is supposed to be the Senate \nand we pass laws? Because the law is bottled up in a committee. The gun \nsafety law we passed in the Senate after the Columbine massacre is \nbottled up in a committee by the National Rifle Association. The \nRepublicans control the Senate and the House, and they will not let the \nbill come out of the committee. Those who believe gun safety \nlegislation is needed have to resort to these devices to try to at \nleast bring the issue up for consideration by the Senate.\n  My colleague from the State of Wyoming said the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution is nothing but delay, delay, delay. Yesterday when we \npresented this sense-of-the-Senate resolution, it was the Republican \nside that delayed it for 5 hours. When we said we wanted to commend the \nMillion Mom March and we wanted to bring the gun safety bill out of \ncommittee, it took the Republicans 5 hours to come up with an \nalternative, a substitute, which, if you read it, is, first, a diatribe \nagainst the Clinton administration and, second, the reaffirmation of \nthe principles of the National Rifle Association.\n  That is their right on the Republican side to offer whatever they \nwant to offer. We believe the message that came on The Mall last Sunday \nand across America, in Chicago and Los Angeles, of 750,000 mothers who \ngave up their Mother's Day to march, is that this Senate, this \nCongress, should get down to the business of passing laws to make \nAmerica safer.\n  It also said this sense-of-the-Senate resolution is similar to \ntalking about the weather: It really doesn't do anything. It is funny \nit would take 5 hours for the Republican leadership to respond to it if \nit really doesn't do anything. What it does is put the Senators in this \nChamber on record: Do you commend the Million Mom March? Do you want \nthis legislation to come out of committee immediately? If so, vote \n``yes''; if you share the opposing position, vote ``no.'' At least \nMembers are on the record.\n  Senator Reed of Rhode Island offered a similar question in a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution a few weeks ago, and 53 Senators--more than a \nmajority--said: Let's vote for it. Bring the bill out, and let's get on \nwith it. It still sits in committee because the Republican leadership \nis blocking the effort to pass gun safety legislation.\n  The Senator from Idaho stands on the floor and reminds mothers across \nAmerica that there are many things injuring children: Automobile \ncrashes, trauma, poisoning--the list goes on and on. The Senator from \nIdaho is certainly right. I don't know that the mothers of America \nneeded to be reminded of that. They understood that when they came to \nThe Mall. They asked us to do something about guns and the fact that \nevery day in America --today, tomorrow, and the day after--12 children \nwill die because of guns. Kids are dying because of gangbangers, \naccidents with guns, suicides--12 kids every single day in America. We \nhave become so used to this, it doesn't make the headlines anymore. \nThere is not another nation on Earth with these grizzly statistics when \nit comes to guns. It is right here. It is America, the country of which \nwe are so proud.\n\n  Mothers march to remind Congress we can do more and we can do better \nto make this world safer for their children. They are right. For the \nSenator from Idaho to say to the mothers across America, you know, a \nlot of kids get hurt in automobile accidents, it is a truism; there is \nno doubt about it.\n  I remind the Senator from Idaho, there is ample legislation, Federal \nand State, establishing the safety of cars we drive, establishing \nrequirements to wear seatbelts and airbags in the cars, use of a child \nsafety seat and restraints, legislation all over the country to make \ncar travel more accommodating and safer for children, but there are no \nlaws on the books, none whatever, in Washington, DC, concerning the \nsafety of guns.\n  Make a toy gun to sell at Christmas and we have an agency that looks \nover your shoulder to say that may not be safe for kids. But make a \nreal gun, the kind used in sport, hunting, or self-defense, and there \nare no--underline ``no''--Federal safety standards.\n  When it comes to kids and cars, we write all kinds of laws about \nsafety. When it comes to guns, the gun lobby says: Hands off; it is our \nconstitutional right to produce any type of weapon we want.\n  He talked about kids who suffocate on mattress covers and plastic \nbags. There are warnings printed. There is a Consumer Product Safety \nCommission watching these products in commerce, trying to keep them \nsafe for families, but no such standards when it comes to guns in \nAmerica.\n  I think the amendment of the Senator from Idaho falls apart. If he \nwants safety for children from all the hazards, I agree with him \ncompletely. And we have passed laws to establish those standards of \nsafety in every single area but one--the firearm industry. They can \nmake any kind of gun they want, and they are not subject to any kind of \ncontrol or supervision by the Federal Government to sell it. They can \nsell it without a child safety device such as a trigger lock. They can \nput it on the market. Look at what happens. Twelve kids in America \nevery single day. Twelve mothers receive a phone call, a knock on the \ndoor, and are told their child has just been shot, maybe killed, by a \ngun.\n\n[[Page S4055]]\n\n  That is why the mothers marched in Chicago. That is why they marched \nin Washington and in Los Angeles and across the Nation. That is why we \nare on the floor of the Senate today. We don't believe that march was \nin vain. We believe that is the best illustration of democracy in \nAmerica, when people from ordinary lives come forward and say: We are \ngiving up a special day each year for mothers to let you know how \nimportant it is that we have safety in our schools and safety in our \nneighborhoods. We expect the Congress, the Senate, to listen. To \nlisten--that is what a democracy is all about. The voters, the people, \nspeak and we listen.\n\n  Frankly, for almost a year now, this Congress has not listened. After \nthe Columbine High School situation in Littleton, CO--12 kids were \nkilled and a score or more were injured--America was horrified that \nthis could happen in a ``good neighborhood,'' a ``good school.'' It \nhappens all over America.\n  I live in Springfield, IL. We are not safe from this. There is not a \ntown, there is not a neighborhood, there is not a community in America \nthat is safe from gun violence. We are a nation of 200 million guns. If \nyou have a careless gun owner who asserts his constitutional right to \nown a gun but refuses to accept his moral responsibility to store it \nsafely, you know what is going to happen. Kids are going to find it. \nKids are going to play with it. They may hurt themselves or an \nunsuspecting playmate. They may take that gun to school, as they did in \nJonesboro, AR--an 11-year-old and a 15-year-old with an arsenal of \nweapons from the grandfather and all the ammunition, sitting in the \nwoods, pulling the fire alarm and watching the kids come out into the \nplayground and firing away at the kids and their teachers.\n  Should we do something about that? Should we require safety locks? \nThat is part of the legislation that is bottled up in committee. That \nis part of the legislation Republicans will not bring to the floor.\n  In Littleton, CO, the guns that were used to kill the students were \npurchased at gun shows without background checks. Don't we want to know \nif the purchaser is a criminal, has a history of violent mental \nillness, or is a child? I would think we would want to know that. We \nwant to keep guns out of the hands of those who would misuse them, but \nthe National Rifle Association says: No, it is too much of an \ninconvenience to have a background check at a gun show. These folks \nneed their weapons; they need them in a hurry; and they have to get out \nin the street.\n  Excuse me but walk through the airports, go through the metal \ndetectors, subject yourself to the inconvenience, if you will, because \nwe want safety on airplanes. If you go to a gun show, you should accept \nthe burden and the inconvenience of a background check because we know \nif we do not make that background check, guns will get in the wrong \nhands. In the wrong hands it leads to crime and killing, pain, and \nsuffering for mothers and fathers across America.\n  It is hard to understand the position of the National Rifle \nAssociation. This organization of some 3 million people has made a \nmockery of democracy. When the overwhelming majority of Americans want \nsensible gun safety laws, when sportsmen and hunters will accept the \ninconvenience of a background check and say that is part of it, we \nunderstand it--and this organization stands in the way of sensible gun \nsafety legislation time and time and time again--it is disgraceful. \nThat is why we are on the floor of the Senate. We want Democrats and \nRepublicans to go on the record to commend the Million Mom March and to \nstand up for gun safety legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time? The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, somehow today, if you do not believe what I \nbelieve, you are not caring nor are you compassionate. Let me suggest \nto anyone listening, and certainly to all Senators, no one on this side \nof the aisle--and I know no one on that side of the aisle--is saying \nthat. We listen, too. Many even participated in the Million Mom March \nin this Nation's Capital last Saturday. I cannot tell you we felt their \npain, but we heard it spoken because unless you have experienced the \nkind of loss that some of those mothers experienced, I doubt that you \ncan feel it. But you can empathize with it, and all of us do.\n  Is that why we are bound up on the floor with this issue today? No, \nit is not. We have been on this floor before, for the last year, on the \nissue of guns, long before the Million Mom March. The reason we have \nbeen on the floor is because what some have wanted to do, the rest of \nthe Congress has not wanted to do--largely because the American people \nare tremendously frustrated at this moment about violence and about \nlaws and laws not enforced and laws that are enforced and the lack of \nsafety or the sense of security and the obvious real violence that goes \non in America today.\n  No, those moms, at least many of them, were sincere. Others, I am \nquite confident, had a political agenda. There were second amendment \nmoms who were there. They had a political agenda. They are also sincere \nbecause they really do believe that passing gun laws does not a safer \nworld make. It does not take the criminal who perpetrates the vast \nmajority of the crimes off the street--who, by the way, very seldom \nwalks into a gun shop and buys a gun but of course acquires his or her \ngun off the street in an illegal fashion.\n  ``We want commonsense gun laws,'' is what we have heard. Yet the \nunderlying mantra of the Million Mom March is not commonsense gun laws; \nit is registration and licensing. Even some of the most liberal, who \nbelieve in gun control, openly admit you cannot get there. You cannot \npass licensing and registration because the Congress will not pass it \nand the public would not accept it, largely because it just would not \nwork.\n  Cars are licensed? Yes, cars are licensed, but you don't have to have \na license to own a car. You don't have to have a license to drive a car \nif you drive it on your private property. A car is not a right in this \ncountry, guaranteed by the Constitution. You have to have a license to \ndrive a car if you drive on public roads. Licenses for cars did not \nstart for safety arguments; they started as a way to tax an owner of a \nvehicle to gain revenue for vehicular purposes in States.\n  So there is that quick jump to logic: You have to have a license to \nown a car. Wrong. You do not need a license to own a car. It is not a \nright; it is a privilege. There is a very real difference.\n  It is important that a few of us cut through the fog of the emotion \nand the rhetoric here. I do believe there are constitutional rights in \nthis country. I think we ought to be terribly careful about how we \ninfringe upon them. That is part of the debate we are involved in \ntoday, and that is the most important part as far as I am concerned.\n  One of the other issues I think is most important is the question of \nownership--250 million guns in this country and somehow we ought to \ntake them all down or take a lot of them down, or register or license \nto deal with them.\n\n  I do not find this humorous, but I find it practical. Holland is a \nnation in Europe--we all know about it: dikes and tulips, a beautiful \ncountry, wonderful people. Guns are outlawed in Holland. It is against \nthe law to own a gun, except under unique circumstances. Guns are \noutlawed in Holland. Now the Dutch authorities are trying to come to \ngrips with a rash of stabbings in Amsterdam. Last year they began a \n``turn in your knife'' campaign, to try to stop the violence in \nAmsterdam, ravaged upon fellow citizens of Holland by knives. In other \nwords, violence is the issue, not guns, not knives. Now they are \nthinking in Holland about a ``buy up the knife'' campaign, something \nlike we have done in this country, or even suggesting they prohibit \nknives in Holland. Politicians ought to pass a law, some are \nsuggesting.\n  Is it a reflection of the weapon or is it a reflection of a human \nproblem that is called violence? I think it is the violence issue we \nare here about today. I know the Senator from California wants to deal \nwith that issue. So do I. But I do not think we all understand how to \ndeal with violence. I believe most of the moms who marched on\n\n[[Page S4056]]\n\nSunday were expressing their frustration about the violence that their \nchildren experience.\n  I yield to the Senator from Idaho such time as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to have a few \nmoments to discuss with the American people this critical issue. The \nquestion of violence in our society is, as the Senator from Idaho, my \ncolleague, has just stated, one we all want to address. The differences \nwe have in this Chamber as we debate are not over whether we want to \naddress the difficult problems of violence in our society; they are \nover how we believe it must best be done. The reason I wanted to stand \nand talk today is because I am convinced if we continue to focus our \nefforts on increased gun control and more strict gun control, not only \nwill we impose burdens on law-abiding Americans that are unjustified, \nbut we will fail to give the attention that is necessary to the true \ncauses of the violence that we have to be addressing. I want to address \nmy remarks in two contexts--one, what should we be focusing on and, \ntwo, why is it I believe gun control is not the answer.\n  I will talk about that second question first: Why is it that \nincreased gun control is not the answer? Right here in Washington, DC, \nwe have the best example of why we should not be looking to this as the \nbest solution. In the past few months, there have been a lot of \nstatements about a terrible incident of violence that took place at the \nNational Zoo. I share my colleagues' concern about these high-profile \nacts of violence, but this example shows why it is that our focus on \ngun control is misdirected. The answer is not to enact more gun control \nlaws but to address the root causes of violence.\n  The April 24 shooting at the National Zoo should shock any law-\nabiding American. At the same time, it dramatically demonstrates that \neven the more restrictive gun control laws in the Nation have little \nimpact on the actions of violent criminals. In Washington, DC, it is \nillegal to possess the kind of handgun that was used in the violence at \nthe National Zoo. It is not just illegal to carry them but one cannot \neven have one in one's home. Washington, DC, has the most restrictive \ngun control laws in the Nation, far more restrictive than the gun \ncontrol laws being debated today.\n  Yet it is in Washington, DC, that this shooting took place--\nWashington, DC, which some have called the murder capital of the world, \nwhere gun violence runs rampant, from where many of the examples of gun \nviolence come.\n  Yet it is Washington, DC, that has tried to solve these problems \nthrough restrictive gun control measures that we seem to debate \nendlessly on this floor.\n  Why is that the case? Some will argue the reason we do not have the \nsolution in Washington, DC, is that we do not have restrictive gun laws \neverywhere and that the person who used this gun in Washington, DC, at \nthe zoo could have gotten that gun elsewhere in the country and then \nbrought it into Washington, DC.\n  The fact is, that is not what happened. This was a stolen gun that \nwas used in Washington, DC, for this crime, and the reason is, one \ncannot just bring a gun into Washington, DC, under the law. For the \nlast 32 years, under Federal law that applies to all States, one cannot \nbuy a gun if one is a Washington, DC, resident and bring it into the \nDistrict. Interstate sales of handguns have been prohibited for 32 \nyears.\n  What would happen if a D.C. resident were to go to Maryland or \nVirginia seeking to buy a gun to bring into the District? What would \nhappen is the gun dealer would say: I can't sell you this gun; I have \nto send this gun to a dealer in your State or in the District and have \nthem deliver it to you there, and since it is illegal to do that in \nWashington, DC, I can't sell you this gun.\n  A person in Washington, DC, who wants to get a gun to use in an act \nof violence is, therefore, going to have to break the law, which is the \npoint. Criminals do not obey the laws. Those who are going to use the \ngun in a crime do not obey these laws. They steal firearms, or they get \nthem on the black market, or they do so illegally. That is exactly why \nin Washington, DC, those who carry guns do so illegally and know that \nthe law-abiding citizens do not carry guns.\n  The shocking truth is that those who are involved in gun violence are \ngoing to get their guns illegally, whether they have gun control \nmeasures in place or not, and Washington, DC--right where we are \nconducting this debate--gives us the best example of why it is that \nfurther efforts to restrict citizens' access to guns are not going to \nstop the violence.\n\n  What is going to stop the violence? I had an experience, it has been \n6 or 8 months ago, watching one of the talk shows on TV that helped me \nto understand and increased my understanding of what we need to do. We \noften talk about needing to address the root causes of violence rather \nthan continuing to restrict the right to bear arms. What do we mean \nwhen we say that?\n  Obviously, we talk about trying to reduce the violence our children \nare exposed to in the media, whether it be TV, video games, and so \nforth, and that is valid. We also talk about needing to have programs \nof education so that our young people who do have access to guns to \nhunt or for target shooting learn to do so in a safe way.\n  We also talk a lot on the floor about needing to enforce the laws \nstrictly so that those who voluntarily choose to use guns in acts of \nviolence are punished. If you do the crime, you should do the time. \nThat is another aspect of what we need to do to address violence in our \nsociety.\n  When I was watching this talk show, one of the experts who was \ntalking on the issue raised another approach which I think is something \non which we need to focus. This particular gentleman who is an expert \nin this area said: I personally support gun control--his position--I \nsupport more gun control, and I support reducing violence in movies, in \nTV games, in video games, and in the music our children listen to.\n  He said those things are not going to solve the problem; that we \nactually have the ability today to identify the large majority of our \nyoung people who are troubled and who are the most high-risk young \npeople to engage in a crime of violence. We ought to focus our efforts \nas a society on identifying these young people who are in troubled \ncircumstances and intervening in their lives at an earlier stage so we \ncan have a positive influence in their lives and steer them back on to \na better course for their lives and for the lives of others whom they \nwill touch.\n  That struck me. Instead of spending the time and the resources trying \nto figure out a way to stop people, even law-abiding people, from \nowning a firearm, what we ought to be doing is spending our time \nfocusing on intervening in the lives of those who are troubled and who \nface these difficult circumstances and making a positive change in \ntheir lives. It is these kinds of efforts that will make a true \ndifference.\n  Again, we will have large differences among ourselves as we continue \nthis debate, but let's let no one in America misunderstand that we all \nseek the same objectives. We simply have a very different opinion on \nhow to get there. I believe if we as a nation satisfy ourselves with \npassing some more restrictive gun control measures, pat ourselves on \nthe back and say we have done our job for violence in America, we will \nbe forgetting the real solutions. We will be diverting attention away \nfrom those things we have to do as a society to address the root \nproblems of crime and the true root problems of violence.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time is left on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 17 minutes, \nand the Senator from Idaho has 15 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership in \nthis effort.\n  Last weekend, hundreds of thousands of mothers and others were in \nWashington, DC, for the Million Mom March, marching for sensible gun \nlaws and safe kids. From my State of Michigan, thousands of moms came \nwith\n\n[[Page S4057]]\n\ntheir children, with their husbands, and with their parents to \ndemonstrate for sensible gun safety legislation.\n  Those moms are distraught. They have lost children in school \nshootings and in drive-by shootings. They have lost their kids in \naccidental shootings and in murders in their homes and in the streets. \nThey are afraid to send their kids to school or to play at another \nchild's house. There are teachers who are afraid to go to work. They \nall marched last weekend to put an end to that fear. My wife Barbara \nand I marched along with them.\n  Every day, 12 of our children, on average, are killed from gunfire in \nAmerica. Mothers are disheartened both by the children lost and by the \nunwillingness of Congress to do anything about gun safety legislation.\n  Of the hundreds of mothers I met this weekend, not one of them said \nlet's do away with guns in this country, and yet that is how NRA \nleaders label the actions of the million moms. In reality, Michigan \nmothers and mothers around the country are simply calling for sensible \ngun safety.\n  The moms I met do not want to endure what a Michigan mother, Veronica \nMcQueen, endured. Her 6-year-old daughter, Kayla Rolland, was shot by \nanother 6-year-old at an elementary school not too far from Flint. On \nSunday, she told her audience:\n\n       Part of my heart went with her. It is so hard for me to \n     think that I will never see her smile, laugh, or play again; \n     I can never hold her or kiss her again, or see her grow up, \n     get married, and have a happy life.\n\n  The mothers who marched on Sunday know that in order to reduce the \nlevel of gun violence in this country, we must do many things.\n  One of the things we must do is to pass stricter laws to keep guns \nout of the hands of those who should not have guns--children who should \nnot have guns, criminals who should not have guns. The way to do this, \nin the first instance, is to pass the juvenile justice bill with the \nSenate gun amendments.\n  About a year ago this week, the Senate passed an amendment which \nclosed the gun show loophole by applying the Brady background checks to \nguns sold at gun shows. The gun show loophole allows criminals and \nother prohibited persons to buy guns at a gun show from a private \nperson that they could not buy from a licensed dealer.\n  It is a loophole which has been exploited frequently by those who \ndeliberately do not want to undergo background checks, including the \nColumbine gunmen, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.\n  On April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold opened fire on their classmates \nwith four semiautomatic assault guns. Of those weapons, three were \npurchased by their friend, Robyn Anderson, at a gun show. Mr. \nPresident, 18-year-old Robyn Anderson bought her younger friends three \nweapons. Because she bought them at a gun show, she did not need to go \nthrough a background check.\n  Later she testified about this. I would think, of the various \ntestimonies that come out of Columbine, this is some of the most \nmemorable. This is what she said. This is the 18-year-old who bought \nthe guns for the two killers. She said:\n\n       Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gone to the Tanner gun \n     show on Saturday and they took me back with them on Sunday . \n     . . While we were walking around, Eric and Dylan kept asking \n     sellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy \n     their guns from someone who was private--and not licensed--\n     because there would be no paperwork or background check.\n\n  Robyn continues:\n\n       I was not asked any questions at all. There was no \n     background check. . . . Dylan got a shotgun. Eric got a \n     shotgun and a black rifle that he bought clips for. He was \n     able to buy clips and ammunition without me having to show \n     any I.D. The sellers didn't write down any information.\n\n  And here is her bottom line:\n\n       I would not have bought a gun for Eric and Dylan if I had \n     had to give any personal information or submit any kind of \n     check at all. I think it was clear to the sellers that the \n     guns were for Eric and Dylan. They were the ones asking all \n     the questions and handling all the guns.\n\n  She concluded:\n\n       I wish a law requiring background checks had been in effect \n     at the time. I don't know if Eric and Dylan would have been \n     able to get guns from another source, but I would not have \n     helped them. It was too easy. I wish it had been more \n     difficult. I wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had \n     faced a background check.\n\n  So the Columbine gunmen knew about the gun show loophole. They took \nfull advantage of it. The result: 15 dead. Congress has a chance to \nclose the loophole with the gun show amendment. But that amendment is \npart of a juvenile justice bill which is tied up because the Republican \nleadership in the House and the Senate will not allow a conference to \nmeet. It is at that conference where Members are supposed to reconcile \ndifferences between the two bills.\n  The Brady law is not intrusive to law-abiding Americans. Mr. \nPresident, 72 percent of the checks are completed in 3 minutes, and 95 \npercent are cleared within 2 hours. The 5 percent of people whose \nbackground checks take more than 24 hours to complete are 20 times more \nlikely to have a criminal record or otherwise be prohibited from buying \nfirearms. It is just simply not unreasonable to extend the Brady \nbackground check to guns that are bought at gun shows.\n  Congress must act. The moms, the dads, the grandparents, the families \nwant us to act. We must vote yes on the pending sense-of-the-Senate \nlegislation that Senator Daschle and others have offered in order to \nclearly state to the American public that there are some of us here, \nyes, in the majority in the Senate--since the majority passed these \namendments--the majority of us want to act. With their help--the \nmillion moms, and millions more like them--we will hopefully be able to \nmove this legislation this year, reduce the number of killings, and \nsave more families from the tragedies which have been too often \nwitnessed in this country.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator \nDaschle to S. 2521. I have come to the floor of the Senate several \ntimes to speak about failure of the Juvenile Justice conference to come \nto an agreement. Our nation is yearning for leadership. I vote for this \namendment to once again urge the conferees to move ahead on the \nJuvenile Justice bill. Craft a common sense bill that will help to \nbreak this cycle of youth violence. Show the nation that the Congress \ncan see what is happening outside of the Capitol Building, and that we \nare capable of working in partnership with all Americans to bring some \ncalm to our classrooms.\n  This legislation does not create dramatic infringements on the right \nof an informed and responsible citizenry to keep and bear arms. It \nsimply would put in place some common sense provisions to balance \npublic safety and private gun owners' rights. Requiring trigger locks \nwould not jeopardize anyone's Second Amendment rights to own a gun, but \ntrigger locks might prevent children from turning guns on other \nchildren. And improving background checks is not a monumental change, \neither. These additional checks would only serve to prevent those \npeople who should not have access to weapons from getting them. I \nbelieve that responsible parents and gun owners would be able to \nsupport these common sense provisions.\n  I also support the amendment offered by Senator Lott to S. 2521. I \nagree that the government can and should do more to enforce the \nexisting laws concerning firearms. I do not believe that we must choose \nbetween enacting common sense measures to protect public safety and \nprotecting the rights of gun owners--we can do both. Nor do I believe \nthat we must choose between enacting additional protections for public \nsafety and enforcement of current gun laws. I hope that the conferees \nworking on the Juvenile Justice bill will come to an agreement on \nlegislation that will enhance enforcement of the laws we currently have \non the books to keep guns out of the wrong hands. Further delay only \nincreases the chance that another child may die from gun violence \nbefore the Congress acts.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, last Sunday, I joined hundreds of \nthousands of Americans in marching in support of common-sense gun \nsafety laws. Today we're trying to show that these marchers made a \ndifference. We can either listen to the mothers and fathers who marched \nwith their feet--or we can listen to the gun lobby--who march with \ntheir dollars.\n  The Daschle amendment says that we're listening to the Million Mom\n\n[[Page S4058]]\n\nmarchers. It merely calls on the Congress to do it's job--to convene \nthe Juvenile Justice Conference and pass common-sense gun safety laws.\n  Since I've been in Congress I have fought for gun control and gun \nsafety. We passed the Brady bill--which requires a 5-day waiting period \nso there can be background checks of gun purchasers. This law has \nstopped 242,000 felons from buying guns. We fought to ban certain types \nof semi-automatic assault weapons and cop killer bullets.\n  For ten months, our gun safety proposals have been in legislative \nlimbo. The Senate passed the Juvenile Justice Bill in July 1999. Since \nthen, the Republican leadership has refused to let us move the bill \nforward.\n  During this time, we've seen 3,600 children die from gun violence. \nWe've seen twelve children die every day from gunfire. In Maryland, \nwe've mourned the death of over 100 children a year. In Maryland we saw \na crazed man steal five guns--and murder four people--before holding a \nfamily and a community hostage.\n  The Juvenile Justice bill includes common-sense gun safety \nprovisions. It would close the gun show loophole--by requiring \nbackground checks for all guns bought at gun shows. It would require \ngun safety locks to be sold with new guns. It would close the loophole \nin the law that permits the importation and possession of high-capacity \nammunition clips. It would keep guns out of the hands of serious \njuvenile offenders by banning gun sales to juveniles with violent crime \nrecords. Finally, it would ban juvenile possession of semi-automatic \nassault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips.\n  The State of Maryland is the national leader in gun safety. I commend \nGovernor Glendenning and the Maryland General Assembly for passing \npath-breaking gun safety legislation. The new Maryland law will require \nbuilt-in child safety locks on new hand guns; ballistics testing for \nnew guns--to help law enforcement and safety training for new gun \npurchasers. This legislation is the first of its kind in the Nation. It \nwill save lives. The United States Congress should follow Maryland's \nlead--and enact common-sense gun safety legislation.\n  Mr. President: I was so proud to join thousands of Marylanders in the \nMillion Mom March. Let's show that the march mattered. Let's make \ndemocracy work--and pass the Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, when the Senator from Michigan speaks I \nalways listen because we work very closely together on issues that deal \nwith kids. Most of the time, we agree. All of the time that we work \ntogether, we are very sincere.\n  I do not question the sincerity of the Senator from Michigan in the \nstatement he made. I am not surprised he was on the Mall last Sunday. \nHe is somebody who feels very deeply about the issues in which he \nbecomes involved.\n  We have worked very closely on issues dealing with young people, such \nas in making sure that we could streamline adoptions so young people \nwithout loving families could find those families and become a member \nof those families. So I listen very closely when that Senator speaks.\n  I also listened to those at the Million Mom March over the weekend. I \nwent to their web site. I looked at their issues. I studied their \npremise. I do not question their sincerity, but some of their issues do \nnot fit common sense and will not work in America.\n  Here is their No. 1 issue shown on this chart, No. 1 on their web \npage: ``License Handgun Owners and Register All Handguns.'' It also \nhappens to be the No. 1 gun issue in a certain Presidential candidate's \nportfolio this year. Coincidence? Maybe not.\n  But the reality of licensing gun owners and registering firearms is \nsomething that almost all Americans have viewed as an anathema for a \nlong while. Why? Because they really do believe that a gun, once \nacquired as private property, is no business of the Government that \nthey should know about.\n  I supported background checks. In fact, I am probably one of the few \nSenators who insisted that the ATF come to the Hill years ago and work \non the aggressive implementation of instant background checks. I wanted \nthat to happen. It is now happening today. I brought appropriations \nbills to the floor to fund ATF to make it happen. There was great \nresistance downtown. They just did not want to make it work. I am not \nsure why.\n  We can instant anything today in our computers. We can instant our \ncredit. We can instant any idea we want, in rapid response, through the \ntremendous telecommunications ability of our country. But somehow we \njust could not get this online. And the reason we could not, there was \na bias. The bias was waiting periods, resistance to the acquisition of \nfirearms.\n  Today we have an instant check. By the way, as we know, last weekend \nit malfunctioned; it went down. Gun shops, that are law-abiding gun \nshops, that are federally licensed gun shops, had to quit dealing for a \ntime, quit selling, because they could not do instant background \nchecks.\n  We are not opposed to background checks. We are not opposed to \nbackground checks at gun shows. Sorry to dispel the myth. What we are \nopposed to is unnecessary regulation, recordkeeping, the kind of thing \nthat would create an ability of the Government to follow back and check \non what most of our private citizens and 65 million law-abiding gun \nowners feel is a constitutional right and none of their Government's \nbusiness.\n  The folks in Australia, Bermuda, Cuba, Germany, Great Britain, \nGreece, Ireland, Jamaica, and Soviet Georgia were worried about gun \nlicensing and registration, because they were fearful it would result \nin gun confiscation. They were right. It did. Citizens in those \ncountries today don't own firearms. They were confiscated by their \ngovernment once their government could find where they were. Is it \nwrong for American citizens to be concerned? I think not.\n\n  There are, certainly, issues that those moms were marching on about \nwhich all of us are concerned: safety locks on handguns, yes, that \nmanufacturers are producing. Should the Federal Government require \nthem? I don't believe it should, but I would certainly have them on my \nhandguns if I owned handguns.\n  If I were a single person living in a dangerous neighborhood and I \nbought that handgun for self-protection, I might not want a safety lock \non that gun in the dark of night when my door is being crashed in by an \nintruder. I wouldn't want to fumble in the darkness to take the safety \nlock off. I would want the instant protection that the gun I acquired \noffered me in my right of self-protection. But because I didn't have \nthe lock on, by what some are arguing on the other side, I would be in \nviolation of a Federal law. Instinctively, none of us want that. None \nof us want to voluntarily feel we force ourselves to be in violation of \na law in defense of our person and in defense of our property.\n  Those are some of the kinds of practical nuances that argue not \nagainst common sense but against some of what is being tried here \ntoday.\n  So if it doesn't work, politicize it. If you can't get your way \naround here, politicize it. Some got their way in the Senate a year \nago. They passed the Lautenberg provisions in the juvenile justice \nbill. I didn't support them. I thought they had gone too far. I think \nthe gun community of America thought they had gone too far, the law-\nabiding gun community of America. Criminals didn't care. They \nrecognized what some of my colleagues in the Senate don't recognize, \nthat by definition, they don't play by the rules so they don't care \nwhat we do. They break laws. That is why they are called criminals. But \nsomehow we write these laws and everybody will march in step with what \ntheir Government demands. Law-abiding citizens will do so.\n  Anyway, we passed the Lautenberg law. The House rejected it. Somehow \nour colleagues on the other side can't accept that fact and won't \naccept it. So here we are today, holding up a very important piece of \nappropriations legislation, all for the sake of making a nonbinding \npolitical point. Well, it is a political body. They certainly have that \nright. But it is nongermane, and it doesn't fit. We ought to do \nsomething that does fit.\n  Most importantly, we ought not perpetrate a hoax on the millions of \nmothers who expressed their frustration\n\n[[Page S4059]]\n\nover violent acts in this society last Sunday. I think most were \nsincere. I think some were very high-level organizers of certain \npolitical interests. I think their web page demonstrates that.\n  That is really not the issue. The issue is, can we pass laws that \nwork and can we pass laws that are enforceable and that the American \npublic will accept? That is the crux of this debate. That is the point \nof the politics.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to indicate my reasons for \nnot supporting the Daschle amendment, amendment number 3148 to S. 2521, \nthe military construction appropriations bill.\n  The Daschle amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. After \nstarting a number of findings, the amendment states that it is the \nsense of the Senate that ``Congress should immediately pass a \nconference report to accompany'' the juvenile justice bill that \nincludes the Senate passed gun-related provisions.\n  During the Senate's debate of the juvenile justice bill in May of \n1999, I supported the Lautenburg amendment, and other amendments to \nclose the gun show loophole in the Brady act. I also supported an \namendment to require licensed firearms dealers to provide a secure gun \nstorage or safety device when a handgun is sold, delivered or \ntransferred. Unfortunately, the juvenile justice bill has been locked \nin a House and Senate conference committee.\n  Let me be clear, I remain firm in my stance on these issues. I \ncertainly hope that House and Senate conferees can reach an agreement \nin conference on the juvenile justice bill. And, I will continue to \nsupport the common-sense gun provisions that passed the Senate during \nthe juvenile justice debate. I believe the Senate passed gun-related \namendments to the juvenile justice bill will help keep guns out of the \nhands of convicted felons and increase public safety without infringing \non the rights of law-abiding citizens.\n  Despite the fact that I agree with the statement in the Daschle \namendment that Congress should immediately pass a conference report on \nthe juvenile justice bill that includes the Senate passed gun-related \namendments, I do not support the Daschle amendment. The Daschle \namendment is not a legislative amendment and is simply a procedural \nmaneuver. The Daschle amendment has no force in law and no relationship \nto the underlying purposes of the military construction appropriation \nbill.\n  As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have a \nresponsibility to secure passage of the important military construction \nappropriations bill. This bill provides critically needed funding for \nmilitary construction projects, improves the quality of life for the \nmen and women who are serving our country in the armed forces, and \nsustains the readiness of our armed forces. These areas are \ntraditionally underfunded, and this bill provides the necessary funds \nto help make up for this shortfall.\n  The Daschle amendment is an unrelated sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nto the military construction appropriation bill. Sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions have no force in federal law. Voting for this amendment \nplaces vitally needed funding for our Armed Forces in peril by \njeopardizing passage of the overall bill.\n  Again, I continue to support the commonsense gun related provisions \nthat passed the Senate as part of the juvenile justice bill. When these \nmatters come before the United States Senate in a substantive, rather \nthan a procedural capacity, and on a related piece of legislation, I \nlook forward to voting for them once again.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, earlier today, Senator Craig spoke on \nthe floor about licensing and registration. I just wanted to correct \none statement he made.\n  Senator Craig said that ``The reality of licensing gun owners and \nregistering firearms is something that almost all Americans have viewed \nas an anathema for a long while. Why? Because they really do believe \nthat a gun once acquired is private property and it is no business of \nthe government that they should know about it.''\n  Of course guns are private property, but the facts do not support the \ncontention that the American people view licensing and registration as \nan ``anathema.''\n  According to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll last year, 90 \npercent of Democrats and 70 percent of Republicans support mandatory \nregistration of any type of gun or firearm.\n  A May report by the National Opinion Research Center at the \nUniversity of Chicago shows similar findings, with 70 percent favoring \ngun-owner licensing and training in use of their guns.\n  A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll taken at the end of April shows seventy-\nsix percent of those surveyed favored registrations of all handguns. \nAnd 69 percent favored the federal government requiring all handgun \nowners to obtain a special license.\n  In fact, a recent Princeton Survey Research Association Poll \nindicated that even 66 percent of gun owners support the registration \nof all handguns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 9 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Idaho has 8 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Murray, and I thank the Chair.\n  It has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still \nthis Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.\n  Let me repeat that. It has been more than a year since the Columbine \ntragedy and this Republican Congress refuses to do anything as it \nrelates to sensible gun legislation. That is why Leader Daschle offered \nhis amendment.\n  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. \nUntil we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of \nthose who died in the past year, and we will continue to do so every \nday that the Senate is in session. We will read those who died of \ngunshots. In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight.\n  The following are the names of some of the people who were killed by \ngunfire 1 year ago today. These names come from the Conference of \nMayors: James Allen, 27, Houston, TX; Ladrid Austin, 21, Chicago, IL; \nJeremiah Buchanan, 22, Houston, TX; Karamoh Daramy, 23, Detroit, MI; \nRufus Dinuwelle, 50, Charlotte, NC; Maurice Harris, 27, St. Louis, MO; \nRaul Martinez, 27, Chicago, IL; Marty Owens, 31, Chicago, IL; Andre \nParker, 19, Chicago, IL; George Robinson, 39, Houston, TX; Robert \nSimms, 30, Washington, DC; Jon Vermillion, 32, Houston, TX.\n  Those are some of the names. We will be here every single day until \nthere is action. The other side is going to say: Shame on you for \ninterfering with the Senate's business.\n  I say to them: There can be no more important business than \nprotecting our children, than protecting our citizens. We are losing \nthem at alarming rates, more than any other civilized country. Indeed, \nall the other civilized countries combined don't have the deaths from \ngunshots that we have in this country--30,000 of our good people every \nyear.\n\n  The other side says it is not about laws; it is about community and \ncaring and family. Of course, they are right. But I say to them that \nthose young kids who were cut down before their prime in Columbine came \nfrom good families. They prayed to God. They got down on their knees \nand prayed, and they were shot.\n  To be scolded on the floor of the Senate for defending our children \nis something that will not stand. I am glad the good Senator put up the \nchart from the Million Mom March because when I look at that, I think \nto myself, there is hope.\n  The Senator implies that we have before us an agenda on licensing of \nguns. We do not have that. That is not in Senator Daschle's amendment. \nHe is calling for the release of the five gun amendments we already \nvoted on, simple, straightforward: trigger locks, no high-capacity \nclips, a study of the gun manufacturers' techniques as they sell to \nchildren, raising the age where a person can buy an assault weapon from \n18 to 21. Those are simple and straightforward.\n\n[[Page S4060]]\n\n  Closing the gun show loophole is another. The woman who got the guns \nfor the deranged children who murdered those kids said if she had to go \nthrough a background check, she never, never would have, in fact, \nbought those guns.\n  So please don't chastise us. It was the other side that stalled for 5 \nsolid hours yesterday and didn't let us have our debate. We would have \nbeen done with this debate.\n  I have to say, when we look at these numbers, 12 kids a day, 30,000 \npeople a year, it is almost too much to comprehend the pain and \nsuffering that goes along with it. Eight times as many as those people \nare wounded, sitting in wheelchairs for the rest of their lives, some \nof them vegetables for the rest of their lives. We don't even begin to \ntouch it when we talk about only the deaths. It is the physical pain \nand agony of those who survive with wounds, and we have seen in \nColumbine children committing suicide because they can't handle the \ntrauma. What is the answer of the other side? We don't need laws. Why \ndon't they think about licensing?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield the Senator 30 additional seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. You need a license to give a haircut to somebody.\n  Does anyone say that the Government is going to come and take the \nscissors? Come on. Don't be afraid of this lobby. Stand up and be \ncounted. Join the million moms. They are Democrats; they are \nRepublicans; they are from families; they are grandmas and grandpas. \nThat is who showed up. I had the joy of marching with them. Let's vote \nfor the Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, the time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 2 minutes; the \nSenator from Idaho has 7.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask whether the Senator from Idaho \nwould be willing to allow us to use some of his time. We don't want to \nvote until 1:30. If I may, I will yield Senator Harkin 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will retain 5 minutes of my time. I will yield a couple \nof those minutes, but we will need the rest for closing purposes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. How much time would that give me for the remaining time \non our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and one-half minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield our remaining time to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, I take a back seat to no one \nin being a legitimate hunter. I hunt every year. I have hunted since I \nhave been a kid. I will take on anyone over there in trap shooting. \nThat is not what this is about. It is not about law-abiding people who \nlike to hunt and own guns to hunt with, or somebody who needs one for \nself-protection in their home. That is not what this is about.\n  That's why I have to take issue with those who are always \nmisinterpreting the Constitution of the United States--misinterpreting \nit. When you look at the Lott amendment before us, the first thing he \nsays is the second amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects the \nright of each law-abiding U.S. citizen to own a firearm for any \nlegitimate purpose, including self-defense or recreation.\n  Please tell me where in the second amendment and the Constitution it \nsays that. You can go out to the NRA building, and on the side it says, \n```The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be \ninfringed,' the second amendment to the Constitution.'' Anybody can \ntake anything out of context, Mr. President. You can prove there is no \nGod by reading the Bible. All I ask you is to open the Bible to Psalms \n14:1. Guess what it says; ``. . .there is no God.'' I ask my friend \nfrom Idaho if he has ever read Psalms 14:1. It says there is no God, in \nthe Bible. But what does it say right before that? ``The fool said in \nhis heart there is no God.''\n  What relation does that have to the second amendment to the \nConstitution? Everybody has this book in their desk. It is not that big \na deal to read this. It says:\n\n       A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security \n     of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear \n     Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n  So what do they do? They take it out of context. I suppose somebody \ncould take the Bible out of context, too. You have to put it into \ncontextual framework. The framers of the Constitution knew they didn't \nwant a standing army. They wanted a militia, like the National Guard, \nfor people in their homes to keep arms for protection. Read your \nhistory books. These people out here who want to reinterpret the \nConstitution for their own ends are doing our people a great \ndisservice.\n  Now, take another look at the Lott amendment. The Lott amendment has \na finding in the end. Here is the sense of the Senate that--get this:\n\n       The right of each law-abiding United States citizen to own \n     a firearm for any legitimate purpose, including self-defense \n     or recreation, should not be infringed.\n\n  The right of each law-abiding United States citizen. It doesn't have \nan age limit. Does that mean a kid 13 years old can have an Uzi for \nrecreational purposes? It doesn't say that there. There is no age limit \non it. It could be a 5-year-old kid or a 10-year-old kid. I will say \none other thing. ``For any legitimate purpose,'' it says. Does that \nmean--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask for 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional \nminutes for the Senator from Iowa to finish his statement.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will not object if that is given to our \nside as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HATCH. Is my request also granted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be part of the request. Is there \nobjection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. Read the language of the Lott \namendment. ``The right of each law-abiding United States citizen.'' No \nage limit; 10-year-old kids or 14-year-old kids can own any amount of \nguns they want.\n\n  ``For any legitimate purpose, including recreation.'' Does that mean \nif I want to own 50 Uzis, the Government can't have anything to say \nabout it? Maybe that is my recreation and I want to blow down a lot of \nthings in my backyard. This doesn't make any sense. The sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution makes no sense. It misinterprets the Constitution.\n  Secondly, it opens the door wider than we have ever seen it before. \nKeep in mind, when you vote on the Lott substitute, what you are saying \nis that anyone in the United States who is a citizen--no age limit--can \nown any amount of guns that person wants. There are no restrictions. Is \nthat what we want in this country? If so, have the guts to stand up and \nsay so. Stand up and say that you want 10-year-old kids owning Uzis and \nmachine guns. Go ahead and say it if that is what you want because that \nis what the language of the Lott amendment says.\n  All you have to do is read the language of what is in front of us. \nLook at this chart. This says what we ought to do is ``start them \nyoung; there is no time like the present'' for a little kid like that \non this chart. This is an ad. Under the Lott amendment, that kid could \nbe carrying 10 Uzis. Keep that in mind when you vote for it.\n  Mr. President, I do support Senator Daschle's resolution. We had one \nmillion mothers, their families and friends on Mother's Day demanding \ntheir elected lawmakers take final action on the Juvenile Justice bill \nand the gun measures that bill included. For ten months since we first \npassed the bill--despite numerous gun tragedies at schools, workplaces \nand even places of worship all across America--the Republican \nleadership has refused to move forward on these common sense \nprovisions.\n  What is almost as senseless as these tragedies is the fact that \nCongress refuses to act on this legislation that would prevent many of \nthese shootings.\n  What are the so-called controversial measures we're talking about? \nMeasures--ironically--that would not affect law-abiding citizens who \nwant to own a gun. Let me take a moment to list\n\n[[Page S4061]]\n\nthem: Requiring gun manufacturers to provide child safety locks with \ntheir guns, giving the owners the option to install them. Closing the \ngun show loophole that allows sales at gun shows without background \nchecks. Right now, 40 percent of all gun show sales go without a \nbackground check. Under this provision, all potential buyers at gun \nshows will use the Instant Check computer system--which normally takes \na few minutes. For the small percentage of potential buyers--less than \n5 percent--they may have to wait up to three days so records can be \nchecked manually on the closest business day. And the bill would ban \njuvenile possession of semi-automatic weapons and high-capacity \nammunition clips. These are reasonable measures.\n  But, I also believe we need to do a better job at enforcing current \nlaws. I support the Administration's budget request for new funding to \nhire more ATF agents and prosecutors. I also support their request for \nresearch funding to develop ``smart-gun'' technology which could limit \na gun's use to its owner and authorized users to help prevent \naccidental shootings.\n  Opponents of common sense gun safety laws set up a false choice \nbetween prevention and enforcement. Any successful policy will have to \nhave both of these elements.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to lend my support to the Daschle \nsense of the Senate, which commends the organizers and marchers of the \nMillion Mom March and urges the juvenile justice conference include the \nSenate-passed gun control measures in its report and to issue its \nreport by the Memorial Day recess. I support the gun control measures \nthat are contained in the juvenile justice bill that was debated and \npassed by the Senate last July and I sincerely hope that the conference \nwill meet to finish their work on this critically important bill.\n  I am deeply troubled by the numbers of people--and particularly the \nnumber of children--that are wounded or killed by gunfire each year. \nAnd, Mr. President, I know that all of America understands that the \nimpact of gun violence on children is staggering. Listen to some of \nthese statistics, Mr. President: The National Center for Health \nStatistics found that in 1997 almost 12 children died every day from \ngunfire. The gun homicide rate for children under 15 is sixteen times \nhigher in the U.S. than in 25 other industrialized nations combined. \nBetween 1979 and 1997, gunfire killed nearly 80,000 children and teens \nin America--25,000 more than the total number of American soldiers \nkilled in battle in Vietnam. Firearms wounded an additional 320,000 \nchildren during this same period. In a single year 4,205 children and \nteens were killed by gunfire. Those 4,205 deaths are equal to the \nnumber of passengers on eight jumbo jets, 90 school buses full of \nchildren, and more than an entire high school graduating class of a \nschool the size of Columbine every school month. Nearly three times as \nmany children under ten died from gunfire as the number of law \nenforcement officers killed in the line of duty. Children are twice as \nlikely as adults to be victims of violent crime, and more likely to be \nkilled by adults than by other children. Homicide is the third leading \ncause of death among children aged five to fourteen.\n  Mr. President, these statistics reveal why it is of such considerable \nconsequence that we complete work on the juvenile justice bill. We \ncannot ignore the violent reality that so many of our children face. \nThe Senate has debated and passed the a very good piece of legislation \nthat seeks to reduce gun violence among our young people. All we are \nasking, Mr. President--all that we have been debating here today--is \nthat the juvenile justice conference meet, that they finish their \nbusiness and issue their report, and that the Congress vote on the \nconference report.\n  The juvenile justice bill is being made controversial, Mr. President, \nbut it does not need to be. The Senate-passed juvenile justice bill \nwould enhance efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and \nchildren, by closing the gun show loophole which currently permits \nsales at gun shows without a background check; by prohibiting the sale \nor transfer by a licensed dealer of a handgun without a secure gun \nstorage or safety device; by closing the loophole in the law that \npermits the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips; by keeping \nguns out of the hands of serious juvenile offenders by banning gun \nsales to juveniles with violent crime records; by expanding the Youth \nCrime Gun Interdiction Initiative to 250 cities by 2003 to enhance \nefforts to trace guns used in crimes and identify and arrest adults who \nsell guns to children; by requiring the FTC and the Attorney General to \nstudy the extent to which the gun industry markets and distributes its \nproducts to juveniles; by increasing penalties on ``straw purchases'' \nto curb the transfer of firearms to individuals who cannot purchase \nthem legally--juveniles, felons, fugitives, and stalkers; and by \nbanning juvenile possession of semi-automatic assault weapons and high-\ncapacity ammunition clips.\n  Mr. President, I don't think it is necessary to get bogged down in a \nprotracted, partisan debate over this legislation. The Senate must come \ntogether to address the horrible number casualties caused by gun \nviolence in this country. The juvenile justice bill that we have \ndebated and passed will make our communities, our schools, and our \ncities safer for this nation's young people. And, Mr. President, I \nthink it is a critical first step to addressing the problem of gun \nviolence that this legislation be moved through conference and voted \non.\n\n  But Mr. President, I understand that common-sense gun control \nmeasures are not a silver bullet capable--by themselves--of solving \nthis tragic problem. We must do much more, Mr. President, than just \nclose the gun show loophole, we must also increase enforcement of \nexisting gun laws at the federal, state, and local levels. We must \nincrease our investment in and commitment to early learning programs. \nWe must also improve and reform our public schools. We must ensure that \nour students have meaningful after-school programs to keep young people \noff the streets at the times in which juvenile crime rates are highest. \nWe must enable communities to hire full-time, school based police \nofficers under the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program \nto prevent and respond to disorder and violence in our schools. We must \nallocate funding for school counselors to assist in identifying \ntroubled students and providing them with the necessary resources and \nattention to address their problems. We must support partnerships \nbetween schools, families, and law enforcement to build relationships, \nestablish anti-truancy programs and mentoring and conflict resolution \nprograms in schools and communities. But if we are truly committed to \nending the terrible trend of gun violence in this country, than we must \nalso implement gun control measures. It is going to take much, much \nmore to deal with this horrendous problem than passing the juvenile \njustice bill, but this legislation is critical to reducing gun \nviolence.\n  Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nthat another very important component of reducing gun violence is \nimproving the enforcement of existing gun laws. I believe we should \nprovide additional funding for ATF agents to crack down on gun dealers \nwho violate federal laws and expand the highly-successful Project Exile \nprogram nationwide. I do not view gun control measures and enforcement \nprovisions as mutually exclusive. I do not believe that we must choose \nbetween more gun control legislation or tougher enforcement. This is a \nfalse choice. The American people want a comprehensive approach that \nincludes common-sense gun legislation; tougher enforcement; and closing \nthe loopholes that exist in current law.\n  Increased enforcement--at the federal, state, and local levels--is a \ncritical component of a comprehensive approach to ending gun violence. \nWe have improved our enforcement efforts over the last few years and I \nthink we should step-up our efforts to improve enforcement. Department \nof Justice statistics show a 41 percent increase in the number of \nfederal gun felons sentenced to more than five years in prison since \n1993, and a 16 percent increase in the number of gun cases filed. The \nnumber of higher-level offenders--those sentenced to five or more \nyears--has gone up nearly 30 percent in five years. Mr. President I'd \nlike to call your attention to an article that appeared in USA Today on \nJune 10, 1999. This article reported that ``Gun laws are enforced more \nvigorously today\n\n[[Page S4062]]\n\nthan five years ago by nearly any measure. Prosecutions are more \nfrequent than ever before; sentences are longer; and the number of \ninmates in federal prison is at a record level. The number of inmates \nin federal prison on firearm or arson charges (the two are lumped \ntogether) increased 51% from 1993 to 1998 . . . A U.S. Sentencing \nCommission analysis done for USA Today shows that lying on the \nbackground check form is prosecuted in federal court far more often \nthan acknowledged.'' We are on the right track and I sincerely hope \nthat the federal government continues to improve its enforcement \nrecord. As of April 1999, there were more than 100,000 federally \nlicensed firearm dealers in America--more licensed gun dealers than \nthere are McDonald's franchises. Yet there were only 1,783 ATF agents \nto police them; many of those agents are detailed by law to only \ninvestigate crimes involving explosives. Clearly there is room for the \nfederal government to do more than it is currently doing. I \nwholeheartedly support increased enforcement efforts and commit to \nworking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see that \nfederal, state, and local enforcement efforts are increased.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that the American people want more \nfrom us and they deserve better from us. They want an end to random and \nsenseless violence. We have got to get past the partisan divide that \nexists in the Senate. It is preventing us from effectively addressing \nthe problem of gun violence and that cannot be tolerated, Mr. \nPresident. We must come together to achieve the goal that I know each \nand every Senator shares: to make our society safer for our young \npeople. This issue is too important, Mr. President, to get caught up in \npolitics. We must find a way to work together on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I oppose Senator Daschle's gun control \nresolution on the military construction appropriations bill. Rather \nthan move forward on this important appropriations bill, some of my \ncolleagues are trying to breathe life into their gun control agenda.\n  I think it needs to be made very clear that nothing this President \nhas proposed and nothing that the million moms have proposed would have \nprevented Columbine; West Paducah, KY; Jonesboro; State of Washington, \nor Hawaii--none of those incidents. This is being done for political \npurposes, not because there is any real logic behind it.\n  I was disturbed to learn that the Federal Bureau of Investigation's \nnational instant criminal background check system malfunctioned last \nweek, thereby preventing background checks of gun buyers. As a result \nof the Government's error, gun sales throughout the Nation were halted \nfrom last Thursday through Sunday. Meanwhile, existing Federal gun laws \nare not being enforced, and the Clinton administration appears to be \nallowing the national instant check system to fall into disrepair. As a \nmatter of fact, they have never fully implemented it, even though we \ngave them that charge a number of years ago.\n  During the debate on the Brady bill, the Clinton administration \npromised the American people an instant background check system, and we \nall agreed with having that system to get the real criminals in our \nsociety and to keep guns away from them. Indeed, I have worked hard to \nmake such a system a reality. Unfortunately, as we have seen all too \noften, the NICS system is not instant for many Americans who wish to \npurchase firearms. As a result, many firearms-owning Americans are \nsuspicious of the Federal Government's attempt to regulate firearms. \nLast week's collapse of the NICS system, which occurred during the \nMillion Mom March, only increases this distrust.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am announcing \nhearings today on the problems associated with the NICS system and how \nCongress can compel this administration to administer the system \nadequately.\n  We will hold hearings on this. One thing is clear about last week's \ncollapse: had the Lautenberg Amendment been enacted into law, all \nsales--even private sales--would have been barred at gun shows.\n  The Clinton Administration, and many of my Democratic colleagues, \ncall for more gun control, but they do not administer or enforce \nexisting laws and programs. There are literally thousands of federal, \nstate, and local firearm laws presently in existence. President Clinton \nspends a great deal of time at press conferences on gun control. \nMeanwhile, his Administration cannot even operate the NICS system \nadequately.\n  Not only does the Clinton Administration fail to administer the NICS \nsystem adequately, it fails to prosecute existing gun crimes. For \nexample, compare the following federal gun laws to the Clinton \nAdministration's prosecution record:\n  It is a federal crime to possess a firearm on school grounds. The \nClinton Justice Department prosecuted only eight cases under this law \nin 1998, even though more than 6,000 students brought guns to school. \nThe Clinton Administration prosecuted only five such cases in 1997.\n  It is a federal crime to transfer a firearm to a juvenile. The \nClinton Justice Department prosecuted only six cases under this law in \n1998 and only five in 1997.\n  It is a federal crime to transfer or possess a semiautomatic assault \nweapon. The Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only four cases under \nthis law in 1998 and only four in 1997.\n  It is a federal crime for a person who has been adjudicated mentally \nill to possess a firearm. The Clinton Justice Department prosecuted \nonly five cases under this law in 1998 and only four in 1997.\n  It is a federal crime for a person who has been dishonorably \ndischarged to possess a firearm. The Clinton Justice Department \nprosecuted only two cases under this law in 1998 and no cases in 1997.\n  Worse yet, the Clinton Administration has failed to prosecute even \nthe most serious gun crimes. Between 1992 and 1998, prosecutions of \ndefendants who use a firearm in the commission of a felony dropped \nnearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to the upcoming hearing on the NICS \nsystem. My colleagues in the Senate should work with me to encourage \nthis Administration to administer and enforce the existing laws before \nwe even consider additional laws.\n  Additionally, we are talking about an enumerated right in the \nConstitution. And we should be very careful before we start playing \naround with the enumerated right. Unfortunately, some people think they \ncan make political hay for this matter, and they are going to do \neverything they can to make that political hay. I have heard arguments \nhere on the floor that are not justified under any terms.\n  It is time for us to enforce the laws that are on the books. There \nare some 20,000 laws, rules, and regulations against misuse of \nfirearms, against the criminal use of firearms, against all other \nthings I have been talking about, and this administration has not been \nserious about enforcing those laws. When they get serious about that, \nmaybe they can come in less hypocritical and talk about some changes \nthat both sides can get together on and do something about rather than \nhaving these phony approaches toward politics rather than the \nconsideration of the rights of American citizens to keep and bear arms.\n  Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to \nuse 5 minutes of my leader time to explain what I am planning to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say to my colleagues that I have just \nput in a phone call to Senator Daschle and advised him of how I wish to \nproceed.\n  What is at stake here is, can we go forward and make progress with \nthe work we do in the Senate on our appropriations bills? Can we \ncomplete the military construction appropriations bill and have debate \nthat we want to have on the Kosovo issue and include it as a provision? \nAnd it is not partisan. Can we go on to the foreign relations \nappropriations bill that has the emergency money for Colombia in it? \nCan\n\n[[Page S4063]]\n\nwe go to the agriculture appropriations bill which has the emergency \nand disaster money in it or are we going to be faced every time we \nbring up appropriations bills with nongermane amendments? Under rule \nXVI, they can be ruled out of order only by the Chair. But if it is a \nsense of the Senate, the Chair has not ruled and has basically \nsubmitted it to the Senate for determination.\n  I am going to make a point of order that the Lott amendment--my \namendment--violates rule XVI, that it is sense-of-the-Senate language \non an appropriations bill, and that the Chair should rule on the \ngermaneness question. If the Chair does not rule on that, then we will \nsubmit it to the Senate and we will have a vote on that question. \nAssuming a majority votes for that, then nongermane sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions will be ruled out of order just as any other nongermane \namendment.\n  I want to emphasize, germane amendments and germane sense-of-the-\nSenate resolutions would clearly be in order. But if we are going to \ndeal with these emergencies, if we are going to get our work done and \nassist the appropriators in moving these very important, very difficult \nbills, we are going to have to get some clarity on this issue.\n  That is what I plan to do. We expect the Chair to rule, and then we \nwill move to a vote on that.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending Lott \namendment violates rule XVI; that it is sense-of-the-Senate language on \nan appropriations bill, and that the Chair should rule on the \ngermaneness question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not well taken.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair, in that \nthe Chair has ruled it will not rule on amendments containing sense-of-\nthe-Senate language on the question of germaneness, and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we have worked out a good \nagreement on how to proceed on the issues before us and the time that \nwould be used this afternoon, tonight, and into tomorrow. Let me read \nthat, and if there are any questions, I will respond.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote now occur on the appeal of the \nruling of the Chair and, immediately following that vote, the point of \norder be withdrawn, the Senate proceed to a vote on the Lott amendment \nNo. 3150, to be followed by a vote on the Daschle amendment No. 3148, \nall without intervening action or debate.\n  I further ask that following those votes, Senator Levin be recognized \nto offer a strike amendment relative to Kosovo and there be 10 hours of \ndebate equally divided in the usual form, with 75 minutes of the \nopponent's time under the control of Senator Byrd, and no amendments in \norder prior to the vote.\n  I also ask consent that the vote occur in relation to the Levin \namendment at 2:30 p.m., Thursday, and, following that vote, Senator \nBurns be recognized to offer a series of cleared amendments on behalf \nof the managers, and, following those, the bill be advanced to third \nreading and the Senate proceed to the House companion bill, H.R. 4425, \nand all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 2521, as \namended, be inserted, the bill be immediately advanced to third \nreading, and a vote occur on passage, all without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  I further ask consent that the Senate insist on its amendments and \nrequest a conference with the House and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees, which will be the subcommittee and the chairman and \nranking member, if necessary, and, following the passage vote, the \nSenate bill be indefinitely postponed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, Senator \nWarner and I hope we can offer an amendment to amend our amendment \ndealing with the commitments that are laid out in that amendment which \nthe allies will be expected to meet. We would like to reduce those \ncommitments. I wonder if we might be able to include such an amendment \nin the request.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would not have an objection to that. I \ndon't believe there would be objection on our side.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, Senator Levin is not \npresently on the floor. I know Senator McCain has worked with Senator \nLevin on this. Maybe I can defer to him. In speaking with Senator \nLevin, I know he also wanted the opportunity to offer an amendment to \nthe Byrd language. I am sure he would want to be included in any kind \nof unanimous consent that would allow for amendments. Perhaps we would \nwant to include that as well. Perhaps we could revisit this question \nafter we get the general agreement to accommodate the Senators.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would certainly be inclined to work with Senator Byrd on \nthat. I hope we can clear this agreement. We will check with all \ninterested parties. I think it is a fair request. It is Senator Byrd's \namendment along with Senator Warner. A lot of Senators are interested \nin it, and we want to be sure they have an opportunity to be aware of \nit.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I take 1 minute to state the Byrd-\nWarner amendment. We would simply change the date from July 1, 2001, to \nOctober 1, 2001, the date on which funds would be prohibited for \ncontinued deployment of ground combat troops. Second is one of the \nbenchmarks the President has to certify. It would be reduced from 33 \npercent to 25 percent, thereby making it possible, in the judgment of \nthis Senator, that the President would be able to make the \ncertification as required by the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I think \nSenator Levin is on the floor now. I ask the majority leader this. It \nis my understanding that this is the first time in 16 years such a \npoint of order has been raised on sense-of-the-Senate resolutions to \namendments to appropriations bills. I ask the majority leader why this \nis the case.\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, we have a number of very important appropriations \nbills we want to move through the Senate, including appropriations \nbills with emergency provisions. In the case of the military \nconstruction bill, we have emergency funds, needed funds, for the \nDefense Department to reimburse accounts, such as operation \nmaintenance, that have already been used to pay for the additional cost \nof fuel. In the case of foreign operations, we have language regarding \nthe Colombian narcodrug war situation. In agriculture, of course, we \nhave disaster funds included in that legislation.\n  The rule is very clear on germaneness when it is a substantive \namendment, and the germaneness point also lies against budget \nresolutions and, under rule XXII, cloture votes and on reconciliation \nbills.\n  All this would say is, that germaneness point of order would be ruled \non by the Chair, as it is in these other instances, in the future. \nGermane amendments would clearly still be in order. I assume they would \nbe offered on many of these bills. It is a clarification of the rule \nXVI provision.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, pursuing \nthis a bit further, we always have appropriations bills. We did last \nyear. I know some of my Republican colleagues had sense-of-the-Senate \namendments. We always have the business of the Senate before us. I \ndon't think the majority leader answered my question. Why, for the \nfirst time in 16 years, has the point of order been raised?\n  Mr. LOTT. If it was raised 16 years ago, I guess that would be \njustification enough under the precedent of the Senate. Sense-of-the-\nSenate resolutions have been growing by leaps and bounds. You will \nrecall that at the conclusion\n\n[[Page S4064]]\n\nof the budget resolution debate, Senator Byrd rose and objected to the \nproliferation of these sense-of-the-Senate resolutions, and something \nlike 35 or 40 sense-of-the-Senate resolutions fell because of the \nconcerns he raised.\n  We have a lot of important work to do. We have the people's business \nto deal with. We need to get appropriations for agriculture. I know the \nSenator feels strongly about that. We need to get transportation work \ndone. There will be plenty of germane amendments, substantive \namendments, to be offered. If we don't make it clear that rule XVI \napplies to the appropriations bills, both on substance and on sense of \nthe Senates, a great deal of our time will be spent on both sides of \nthe aisle--and this is not something just on one side or the other; \nunfortunately, we abuse it, too.\n  So that is the reason, to try to clarify that and facilitate doing \nthe people's work. We should have completed this military construction \nbill last Thursday.\n  Here we are with a lot of issues really we should not be dealing \nwith. You could argue about even some of the language that was included \nin the committee. But the fact is, we have got to get it done, and I am \ntrying to find a way to help get that work done and still allow for \nappropriate germane amendments.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is my last question. Last year, \nthe Senator from North Carolina, Mr. Helms, who had every right to do \nso, had a sense-of-the-Senate bill expressing the sense of the Senate \nthat the U.S. Census Bureau has willingly decided not to include \nmarital status on census questionnaires, and so on and so forth. That \npassed by a 94-0 vote. I think this was on the Transportation \nappropriations bill. This is the first time in 16 years that this has \nhappened.\n  I think the majority leader wants to run the Senate as the House of \nRepresentatives. I think it is a big mistake for this institution to be \nrun that way. I think it is very difficult for us to be out here \nraising questions that are important to people's lives that we \nrepresent in our different States given the continuing challenges of \nraising these points of order by the majority leader. This is happening \nover and over again. I think the Senate is losing its capacity to have \nthe discussions, to have debate, and to have its vitality.\n  I don't think I am going to object, but I would like to go on Record \nin strong opposition to what the majority leader has done. I think it \nis a terrible precedent for the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further objection to the unanimous \nconsent request of the distinguished majority leader?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am not going to object. I think the \nreason I will not is I want to have a vote on these two amendments \nbecause we have been trying to do it. But I hate this precedent. I am \ngoing to try to figure out, along with other colleagues, I hope, a \nchallenge.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am sorry I was not on the floor when the \nSenator from West Virginia offered what I understand to be a proposed \namendment to this unanimous consent proposal. Is that correct?\n  Pending is the proposed amendment of the Senator from West Virginia \nto this unanimous consent request.\n  Is the Senator from Michigan correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment by the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia has not been proposed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I explain \nto my friend from Michigan?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Since the amendment, which was offered by Senator Warner \nand myself, was acted upon in the committee and has reached the floor, \nseveral Senators have indicated concern with respect to the \ncertification process set forth in that amendment. Out of respect for \nthose who are concerned about that certification process, and in an \neffort to improve the legislative product, Senator Warner and I have \ndiscussed this matter, and we are willing to reduce the numbers set \nforth in the certification language. We think that would improve the \nproduct and would also meet the concerns of Senators who have raised \nthem. I was just seeking to include in the unanimous consent request a \nrequest that we might be able to include such an amendment.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would object at this time to any such additions to the \nunanimous consent request. And that is what I was seeking. I would not \nobject to the unanimous consent as it is printed here. But at this \ntime, at least, I object to the amendment which has been proposed by \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further objection?\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say that I certainly have shown my \nsympathy for what Senator Byrd has tried to do. I understand Senator \nLevin wanted to make sure he has thought through what is involved here. \nBut I hope that we could go ahead and get this unanimous consent \nagreement and begin to make progress. Let's work with these two \nSenators to see if we can't find a way to accommodate each other's \ndesires. I know that this is substantive. But I also know that the \nsponsors of the amendment to the language would have an opportunity to \nadjust it. I hope we can go ahead and get this agreement and proceed, \nand let's continue to work on that possibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. I will not \nfurther delay, except to say I hope we can work something out. The \nSenator from Michigan is not going to be able to let us proceed with \nthat part of the request. We will try to work something out. In the \nmeantime, let me say that if we are unable to work out something that \nwill allow us to amend this bill, I want to give those Senators who are \nconcerned in this regard my assurance that in conference I will do \neverything I possibly can to reduce those certification requirements. I \ngive them my word that we will get that done in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am grateful that we are going to be able \nhave two votes. I think it is extremely important. I say to the \nmajority leader I have had requests by three Members that following the \nvotes on the two amendments they be allowed 15 minutes, and, of course, \nif they want, reciprocal time on the other side of the aisle. We would \nbe able to agree to that. We would have 15 minutes to talk following \nthe two votes. It will delay things perhaps up to half an hour, if the \nother side decides to take their 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if we could get the request agreed to at \nthis point, with that one addition, I think that is reasonable.\n  Mr. REID. That is all we have. I think if we could get that agreement \nwe could go forward with the unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we agree to an \namendment of 15 minutes on each side--before we begin the Kosovo \ndebate. We have 10 hours of time for the Kosovo debate. This is a very \nimportant foreign policy and defense issue. We need to get engaged in \nthis discussion.\n  I make that modification, and I urge my colleagues to agree to this \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Is the Byrd request to amend his language part of this \nunanimous consent?\n  Mr. LOTT. It is not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, so there is no misunderstanding, the 30 \nminutes would immediately follow the two votes, and I would control the \n15 minutes on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S4065]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have \nto ask a question of Senator Byrd and Senator Warner. If they are not \nable to perfect their amendment, am I barred from offering the \namendment that would lengthen the time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I can answer that. Senator Byrd and I \ndiscussed not having the amendment accepted. We have the assurance of \nSenator Byrd. I talked to Senator Stevens. I concur that in the \nconference the substance of the amendments will be worked out should \nthe provision remain in the bill. It is the best we can do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request of the \ndistinguished majority leader?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues on both sides for working to \nunderstand what we are doing. I renew my unanimous consent request as \nstated, with the addition that was offered by Senator Reid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I join the \ncomments made by the Senator from Minnesota. This is a historic moment \nin this Chamber. It is not just another procedural vote. It is a \ndecision by the majority, the Republican majority in this Senate, to \nreduce the opportunities that Members in the Senate have to discuss the \nissues of importance to this Nation. It is being offered in the name of \nefficiency. It is being offered in the name of saving time.\n  It was not that long ago, only a few years ago, when the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act was debated for several weeks at a time, \nunder both Democratic and Republican leadership, with the offering of a \nmyriad of amendments on both sides. That was considered the \ndeliberative process. That was what the Senate was all about. It was a \nbattle of ideas and the best side would win. We would move forward with \nlegislation in a bipartisan fashion.\n  What the majority leader is doing today with this point of order is \nto basically close down debate on the floor of the Senate. I think it \nis worthy of note that the issue that has precipitated this is gun \ncontrol. This is the bone in the throat of some of the Members who \ncannot stand the idea of voting on this issue.\n  We believe this is an answer to that. Bring the bill to the floor and \nlet's vote for it up or down, bring it out of conference. The idea we \nare somehow paying homage to efficiency in the name of this \ninstitution, in the name of taking away our birthright as Senators to \nspeak to issues on behalf of the American people, I believe, is, \nfrankly, going to penalize this institution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is for Senators to object or \nnot to object. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order has been called. A Senator \nmay object or not object.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no right to--the Senator has \nthe right----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I object. I object.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, everybody is trying to be patient and \nunderstanding. I ask the Senator be allowed to speak under his right to \nobject, but remind him that the rules are that it is not an opportunity \nto give a speech on the substance. It is a reservation to make a point \nor a question. I hope the Senator would accommodate that and not go \ninto a long statement.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his courtesy. I \nwould have objected, but I spoke to our minority leader and I follow \nhis leadership. I cannot state how strongly I feel about the inability \nto have open debate in the Senate. I simply say, with all due respect \nto the majority leader, a man I respect and admire, the feelings on \nthis side, and our inability to debate issues we think are important--\nwhether they be gun control or education--are reaching the boiling \npoint. I fear if we are throttled any further, the whole order and \ncomity of this body will break down.\n  I plead with the majority leader that we think of a better way to do \nthings than close down debate on issues some Members think are vitally \nimportant to debate. I say that with great respect and love for this \ninstitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues. In the 15 minutes after the votes, I \nwill respond to some of the comments that have been made in the way \nthey richly deserve. For now, I believe we are ready to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Crapo). The question is, shall the \ndecision of the Chair stand as the judgment of the Senate?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd) is \nnecessaily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have witnessed an extraordinary \npolitical spectacle in the last 24 hours. Yesterday we spent \napproximately 3 hours in a quorum call because the Republican caucus \ncould not decide how to respond to a simple Sense of the Senate \namendment commending the Million Mom March and demanding that this \nCongress act now to pass sensible gun safety legislation.\n  Today, the Republicans attempted for the second time to rule our \namendment out of order.\n  What, I ask, is so disconcerting about the Democratic amendment?\n  Are there really members of this Senate who do not believe that the \nstalling has gone on too long? Are there really members of this Senate \nwho believe that it is not a national emergency that children are dying \nin this country every day from gun violence? Are there really members \nof this Senate who believe that this emergency is too insignificant to \ncommand time on the Senate floor?\n  Yesterday, after 3 hours of silence and paralysis, our Republican \ncolleagues decided that they could not simply join us in commending the \nMillion Moms. Instead, they decided to offer their own amendment.\n  Let us not be distracted. We will vote on the Republican amendment, \nbut the vote that matters, the vote that may just prevent more kids \nfrom dying, is on the amendment I have offered.\n  Constitutional scholars may disagree about the meaning of the Second \nAmendment, but I for one believe there is nothing inconsistent about \nprotecting the Second Amendment and closing the gun-show loophole, \nrequiring trigger locks on handguns, or banning juvenile possession of \nmilitary style assault weapons.\n  Moreover, I agree we should enforce our gun laws. But that is only \npart of the solution. It is just a basic fact that you can't enforce a \nloophole. We need a policy of zero loopholes, and zero tolerance.\n  The gun lobby keeps trying to confuse us. They say the debate is \neither new gun laws or education. They say it is either new gun laws or \nenforcement of existing laws. But this is not an either/or debate. We \nneed a multifaceted solution to end gun violence.\n  Let's look at what the Republican amendment says:\n  They call for better enforcement of existing gun laws. But they can't \nresist attacking the Clinton Administration's efforts. They twist \nstatistics to make the case they want.\n  The reality is that the number of firearms offenders sentenced to 5 \nyears or more in federal prison has increased more than 41 percent \nsince 1992. The reality is that federal authorities have worked \ndiligently with state and local authorities, during this \nAdministration, to reduce violent crime in a cooperative and \ncoordinated fashion. The reality is the total number of prosecutions \nfor weapons offenses has increased more than 22 percent since the \nbeginning of this Administration and violent crime has dropped by 35 \npercent.\n  I think we should commend America's hard-working law enforcement \nofficials for these successes, not vilify them. Sadly, my Republican \ncolleagues do not agree.\n  Next, the Republican Sense of the Senate acknowledges the existence \nof the Juvenile Justice Conference Committee. And they point to \nprovisions passed by this Senate as part of the Juvenile Justice bill \nthat they support, such as strengthening penalties for gun crimes and \nillegal gun purchases and prohibiting juveniles who commit felonies \nfrom ever possessing a gun.\n  Democrats support these provisions, too. But these measures, by \nthemselves, are not enough. This Senate did better. This Senate passed \nthe Lautenberg amendment to close the gun show loophole. And just a \nmonth and a half ago, 53 Senators reaffirmed that the conference report \nshould include this provision. Sadly, my Republican colleagues chose \nnot to include the Lautenberg amendment on their list of priorities.\n  The Republican amendment, however, while it acknowledges the \nexistence of the Juvenile Justice Conference, does not explain why that \nconference report has yet to come before this Senate.\n  The biggest problem may not be difference over which provisions are \nmost important. The biggest problem may be the fact that special \ninterest politics have prevented this conference from meeting at all.\n  Finally, the Republican amendment concludes that each U.S. Attorney's \noffice should designate a prosecutor to pursue firearms violations, \nthat we should update the national instant criminal background system, \nand that we should encourage states to impose mandatory minimum \nsentences for firearm offenses. Again, most Democrats support these \nmeasures. But are they enough? We know they are not.\n  Their amendment also concludes that law-abiding citizens have the \nright to own a firearm for self-defense and recreation. I agree with \nthis statement. I myself am a hunter. But I am also a father and I feel \nfor all the other fathers--and mothers--who have lost a child to gun \nviolence. That is why I introduced this amendment.\n  On the whole, I have decided to vote against this amendment because I \ndisagree too strongly with many of the findings in the Republican Sense \nof the Senate amendment, and their one-sided nature. However, I must \nmake clear that I support the second amendment, like other \nconstitutional provisions, and believe that the second amendment does \nnot preclude reasonable regulation of the use of firearms. But this \nRepublican amendment does not go far enough and will not stop the \nviolence in our communities.\n  Democrats have offered an amendment that acknowledges the dreadful \ncost that gun violence is having on our country. We cannot forget that \n12 young people are killed every day in America by gunfire. We cannot \nforget that American children under the age of 15 are 12 times more \nlikely to die from gunfire than children in 25 other industrial \ncountries combined. And we cannot forget that every day we spend in \npolitical gridlock is a day we waste solving this terrible problem--a \nday we do less than we should to stop the killing.\n  That is why the Democratic amendment, in addition to commending the \nmothers and fathers that gathered across the country this Mother's Day \nto call for meaningful, common-sense gun policy, insists that Congress \nact now to improve our gun safety laws.\n  This Senate needs to demonstrate to America's mothers and fathers \nthat we heard their call. This Senate needs to resolve today, as the \nDemocratic amendment demands, that the Juvenile Justice Conference must \nmeet and must pass a conference report that includes the Lautenberg \namendment and other critical provisions to limit access to firearms by \njuveniles, convicted felons, and other prohibited persons.\n  It is the least we should do, and it is long overdue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that vote No. 64 be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Rollcall Vote No. 64, April 6, 2000\n\n (On agreeing to the Reed amendment (No. 2964) to express the sense of \n    the Senate regarding the need to reduce gun violence in America)\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith, (OR)\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S4067]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3148\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, after an extended period of time for votes \non these issues, we are ready to go to what I hope will finally be a \nsubstantive debate with regard to the Kosovo issue. Under the agreement \nthat was worked out, I believe we have 15 minutes now to talk about \nthis series of votes which just occurred. Therefore, I claim a part of \nthat time for myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 15 minutes per side.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, there were a number of things said earlier today on \nwhich I just bit my lip and took it because I thought, for the greater \ngood of the Chamber, we should get an agreement and move forward. There \nhas been a lot of what I consider to be misinformation put out about \nthis issue and why we were proceeding the way we were. Plus, I also \nfeel personally maligned, and I do not appreciate it, I say to my \ncolleagues.\n  I made the choice to leave the House and come to the Senate. I was on \nthe Rules Committee. I could have stayed there. I could have been on \nthe Rules Committee, but I chose to leave. I do not think we have any--\nI do not remember the term that was used earlier--God-given rights in \nthis institution.\n  We all have certain rights, and I am going to work to protect those \nrights. When I believed Senator Schumer was not being treated properly, \nI spoke up. Last year, in a very critical moment when Senator Byrd was \nnot being treated properly, I said: No, that is not right.\n  I am getting really tired of people questioning my commitment to the \nSenate and to the opportunity for debates and that I am trying to be a \nrules committee of one.\n  I tell you, what I am trying to do is find a way for the Senate to do \nits work. These charges that are leveled against me are nonsense.\n  One of the things I have done since I have been in the Senate and \nhave been majority leader is I have studied the history of this \ninstitution. That is why I started the Leader's Lecture Series, because \nI wanted to know what previous majority leaders did. I read them on \nboth sides. I can tell you what Senator Mansfield did. I can tell you \nwhat Senator Lyndon Johnson did. I can tell you what Senator Byrd, \nSenator Mitchell, Senator Dole, and Senator Baker did as majority \nleaders.\n  People talk about that civility has broken down, and there is \nacrimony. That is ridiculous. I think we have a very good relationship \nhere. You may not get it the way you want it every time, but you do not \nhave a guarantee that you get the results you want every time.\n  What it is really all about is getting the work of the Senate done, \ndealing with real bills and real issues, not playing games and saying: \nOK, we voted last year; we have not voted this year. OK, we voted last \nmonth; we have not voted this month.\n  Somebody has to be charged with the responsibility of trying to get \nthe process to move forward. It falls to the responsibility of the \nmajority and, therefore, the majority leader.\n  Am I the only guy here who thinks we ought to get the military \nconstruction appropriations bill done with the emergencies in it that \nthe President asked for?\n  Am I the only guy here who thinks we ought to pass the foreign \noperations appropriations bill with the Colombian drug money in it, \nwhich we need to do, because there is a crisis developing down there? \nYou talk about the situation in Kosovo. I think the situation in \nColombia is a lot more dangerous for the long term. They are poisoning \nthe minds of our children. Every day they are killing kids.\n  Am I the only one who thinks we ought to do the agriculture \nappropriations bill with the disaster money that is in it? Everybody \nsays: We want it. We want it. When? When do you propose to do it?\n  The military construction appropriations bill should have been done \nlast Thursday. It could have been done last Thursday. We could have had \na debate on the Kosovo issue. I did not put that into this process. It \nwas done at the subcommittee level. I might not have done it that way, \nbut it is there. We have to deal with it. No, no, no, no, the word was \nwe had to have talk about guns, driven by the Million Mom March.\n  You wanted debate. Yesterday at 4 o'clock, I said: OK, let's have \ndebate. The rest of the night we will debate, tomorrow for 3 hours, and \nwe will have a vote. No. We were told we have to have 12 hours for \ndebate on this issue. And then, 4, 5 hours later, we wound up basically \ngetting an agreement so people could talk for about the same time. \nMaybe you all were not aware I was trying to say, OK, let's have \ndebate.\n  I want to go back to one other thing I said earlier. No, it is not a \n``rules committee of one.'' It is a rules committee of the majority. \nThere has to be fairness; there has to be understanding. You have to be \nable to make your speeches on both sides. We want that. But to have \nthese sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that make these great, profound \nstatements but don't result in any substantive action, I think that is \na very serious problem.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. We had in our budget resolution provisions that stopped \nsense-of-the-Senate resolutions from being voted on repeatedly, over--\nwell, 45 of them right at the end of the session.\n  Now, somebody said we are trying to shut down Senate debate. We had \ndebate. We had 6 or more hours on this issue. We debated it 4. We had \ndebate on it last week on the so-called gun issue. We had debate and \nvotes on it last year.\n  As a matter of fact, we have bills in conference on a number of these \nissues on which we are going to act. I am working on them one by one. \nWe have\n\n[[Page S4068]]\n\nthe FAA authorization conference report. We have the African trade \nconference report. We are working, in a bipartisan way, to see if we \ncan get the bankruptcy conference report. We are working on e-commerce.\n  Nobody is trying to shut the Senate down. We are trying to get the \nSenate to move forward and do its work.\n  As far as order and comity, I support that. I am going to do \neverything I can to continue to support that. But I think for us to \nhave basically 1, 2, 3, 4 days tied up having debate on gun amendments \ninstead of having debate on Kosovo and the military construction \nappropriations bill is not the way we should be operating.\n  We have this language in conference. We voted on it last year in the \njuvenile justice bill. Maybe you forgot. But last year I said, with \nadvanced notice: OK, we are going to have the juvenile justice bill. It \nis going to be open for amendment. We were going to finish it; start on \nMonday and get through on Thursday. It took another whole week. My \ntrying to be helpful and cooperative wound up causing all kinds of \nproblems for us.\n  I think it is important that we put this in perspective. We had the \ntwo votes. What has been proven here? One of them--a resolution--we \nagreed to by a vote of 69-30, saying: Hey, we have laws on the books. \nWhy don't we enforce the gun laws? Why don't we arrest people who are \nusing guns in the commission of crimes? Why don't we stop people from \ntaking guns into schools? Why don't we take actions instead of just \ntalking about it?\n  More laws on the books. Oh, that's the solution: More laws. Let's \ntake away people's rights instead of enforcing the laws that are on the \nbooks.\n  But we got an overwhelming vote on that. Then again, we got a vote of \n50-49 telling the conference to act before Memorial Day. Well, great. \nThe Senate is going to tell the conference to act before Memorial Day? \nDo you know how much weight that really carries? Zero.\n  They are going to get a juvenile justice bill. Will it be to the \nperfect liking of me or anybody else in this Chamber? I doubt it. But \nthey are going to get a result.\n  So this is a lot of sound and fury that is not going to produce \nresults in terms of the Justice Department enforcing the laws on the \nbooks or in terms of getting the conference to provide a final action.\n  I have been pushing to act on that conference report. In fact, I am \npushing every conference report. But I have to go on the record saying \nI do believe I have been maligned unfairly. I have bent over backward \nto try to give notice when we were going to call up a bill and to have \ncooperation with the Democratic leadership to make sure Senators had a \nchance to make their case.\n\n  But to come in here and think we have to have a right to offer \nnongermane amendments to every appropriations bill that comes through, \nand then criticize us for not getting our work done--oh, boy, that is \nreally smart--really smart: Yes, we demand our rights to offer our \nissues. By the way, why aren't you guys getting these bills done?\n  I do not believe the American people are being fooled by all of this.\n  So I will end with this. I will not impugn other people's actions or \nintegrity. I am going to try very hard to make sure we are civil in the \nway we act and that we have a relationship. But also I hope you will \nunderstand that I am trying to get bills done.\n  Some people say: You worry too much about running the railroad. \nSomebody has to do that. I guess it is my responsibility. Somebody has \nto try to see if we can get these appropriations bills done before the \nend of the year so we don't get to the end of the session and schools \ndon't know what they are going to get, parks don't know what they are \ngoing to get, while we are wrangling around here to see who is going to \nget primacy over the other.\n  I am saying let's do these appropriations bills. I am going to give \npriority to the appropriations bills over everything else. I would like \nto do the defense authorization bill and the defense appropriations \nbill next week, but we have people who want to offer nongermane, \nnonrelevant amendments that are going to tie that up probably for all \nweek. So instead, we will go to the agriculture appropriations bill.\n  But before we leave next week, we are going to have to do the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill, the foreign operations \nappropriations bill, and the agriculture appropriations bill. In the \nprocess, if we could have a little cooperation, I think we could get a \nlot of nominations done. Hopefully, we can come to an agreement on how \nto complete action on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  I am going to offer a unanimous consent request next week or tomorrow \nto have more amendments on education, but let's see if we can find a \nway to get to a conclusion on education. I presume the Democrats are \ngoing to object because they want to offer issues that do not relate to \nelementary and secondary education.\n  Let me say I suspect there might be objections on this side, too, \nbecause people want to offer amendments that are going to do nothing \nbut cause problems and probably defeat the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. I do not think that is good. I think we need to address \nthis issue of education.\n  So I wanted to take advantage of some of this 15 minutes. I do not \nknow how much time is left. But I had it on my chest, and I had to hold \nit earlier, so now I feel better. I hope maybe we all got some of this \nout of our system and we can move on to get our work done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will use my leader time and not the time allocated to \nothers for consideration of their remarks.\n  Let me just say the majority leader was able to get some things off \nhis chest. I have not heard all of what he has unloaded this \nafternoon. But I look forward to reading the Record. I don't know if \nthere is any possible way, in a period of a couple minutes, for us to \nget everything off of our chests.\n\n  I will tell you this. The way the Senate is being run is wrong. No \nmajority leader in history has attempted to constrain Senate debate as \naggressively as Senator Lott has chosen to do. Now, that is his right. \nPeople ask, on many occasions, what my feelings are personally about \nthat. That is his right. He has chosen the way he runs the Senate. I \nthink he is doing that for what many believe is a laudatory reason. He \nis trying to protect his members so they don't have to vote on tough \nissues.\n  Let's get it out on the table. If I am going to get everything off my \nchest, I think he is trying to protect his members. He sees that as his \nrole. I understand that. But no majority leader has ever gone to the \nextent that he has--no one in history. I defy anybody to come to the \nfloor and challenge that statement. No majority leader has come to the \nfloor to say, before we take up any bill, we will have to limit the \nentire Senate to relevant amendments. No one has done that. So let's \nget that straight. I ask any of the 99 colleagues to challenge that \nstatement. No one can. So we start from that.\n  Why do we want to have debate on amendments? Because that is the only \nability for the minority to express itself. The majority leader has \nphrased it very interestingly. He said: I don't want all these \namendments to cause trouble. The more they cause trouble, the more in \njeopardy the bills will be.\n  He made reference to that regarding the education bill. He didn't \nwant amendments to cause trouble. Cause trouble for whom? What kind of \ntrouble? What are we talking about here? We are talking about the \nability of Senators to express themselves, to offer amendments, to have \ndebate. There is an old-fashioned way of dealing with it. It is called \na tabling motion. Or you can get elaborate and offer a second-degree \namendment. You can do all kinds of things. But to say, ``We are going \nto come to the floor and do it my way or no way,'' is unacceptable.\n  Over and over and over and over again, we are told that is the way it \nis going to be. One of our colleagues the other day said it is like the \nfrog sitting in a pot of water who doesn't notice that the water keeps \ngetting hotter and ultimately the frog boils to death. Well, the water \ncontinues to heat, and we are slowly boiling to death, procedurally.\n  We just lost another right this afternoon, and it is outrageous--\noutrageous. How many more times do we have to limit ourselves to debate \non the Senate floor, and how many other ways are we\n\n[[Page S4069]]\n\ngoing to limit debate and expression and gag Senators? That is wrong. \nThat is absolutely the wrong way to run the Senate. We hear a lot about \ncooperation, but I am telling you, there will not be cooperation unless \nwe understand that the minority has to have its rights, too. Those \nrights have to be respected.\n  I hope, when we are in the majority, we understand the rights of the \nminority. I will admonish my colleagues to do that. But this is getting \nto be more and more a second House of Representatives. This is getting \nto be more and more a gagged body. This has nothing to do with the \ntraditions of the Senate that I admired when I became a Senator. We \nhave gagged Senators on the budget. We have gagged Senators on \nappropriations. We have gagged Senators on sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions. We have gagged Senators on the right to participate in \nconferences. Do you know that we have not had a conference report this \nyear come back with a kind of conference that we have always \nhistorically and traditionally organized as a result of passing \nlegislation? We just don't have real conference committees anymore.\n  I just heard a report in our ranking member's lunch today, where \nstaff reported on virtually every bill that has passed the Senate, \nwhere we are meeting at the staff level trying to work things out for \nthe conference report, and Republican staff told Democratic staff: If \nyou don't like it, don't come because that is the way it is going to \nbe. That is cooperation?\n\n  So I will say to my colleagues on the other side that we are not \ngoing to tolerate it anymore. We are not going to accept that anymore. \nI am going to demand that every single appropriations bill that comes \nto the Senate before it can be completed be passed in the House first \nbecause that is regular order. Let's stay through a recess for a \nchange. I am ready. We are going to require the regular order when it \ncomes to appropriations bills. We are not going to do unanimous consent \nrequests routinely as we have done so easily and quickly in the past.\n  It is over. If there is going to be cooperation, I want to see it on \nboth sides. I want to see some respect for the rights of the minority \nwhen we deal with these issues, and I will not allow our members to be \ngagged. We will have a lot more to say about this, but I am telling \nyou, we have drawn the line. We are not going to be conducting business \nas we have in the last several months. That is over. That is behind us. \nWe can do it the Senate way, or we are not going to do it at all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe we have 4 minutes left on our \nside. I believe I have some leader time left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield myself time under my leader time and leave the \nremaining 4 minutes for others who might want to speak on the gun \nissue.\n  If that is the way it is going to be, then that is the way it is \ngoing to be. One of the things that shocked me in the last day in \ntalking about things that you don't appreciate is, yesterday, I had no \nnotice at all that this issue was going to come up. I found out when I \ncame on the floor. I had not seen the amendment to be offered. I had no \nnotice whatsoever.\n  Earlier this year, when there was an incident where I took an action \nand the Democrats had not been notified, it was called to my \nattention--because I thought they had been--so I apologized and said we \nwould correct that, and we did. But if it is over, it is over. This can \ngo all ways. We can just draw the line and not get any work done. We \ncan just not have cooperation if that is the way they want it to be. \nBut it extends across the board. I don't think that is the way to \nproceed.\n  I am not going to be threatened and intimidated by the minority in \ntrying to get our work done. If you want to go through this approach, \nif you want to shut down everything, then everybody loses in that \nprocess. We can cooperate and we can get these bills done.\n  As far as issues coming up where we don't like it--in fact, one of \nthe Senators I have been concerned about--and one of the issues on this \nElementary and Secondary Education Act is that we have a Senator who \nwants to offer something dealing with NCAA gaming, and there is an \nobjection on the Democratic side. I have gone to the colleague on this \nside and said this is not relevant to this issue, doesn't relate to \nelementary and secondary education, and we ought not to do that. After \na lot of back and forth, he came back and said: OK, if we can get it up \nsome other way, I will agree to back off of that for now.\n\n  But on both sides we have Senators who want to offer things that will \ncause mischief and delay or kill a bill. That happens. If you have an \nelementary and secondary education issue that comes up and somebody \noffers a killer amendment, we stall out right there. It might not be on \nthis side.\n  So it takes a lot of cooperation around here on both sides. I think \nwe have had that pretty much for 4 years. Both leaders have to look \nafter their members. You have members who want to be heard. You have to \ntry to get them in there. In fact, every one of these issues that I \nhear complaints about, we voted on all those issues. We voted on all of \nthem over the last year. Maybe not this year or last month, but they \nhave been voted on. So I hope it doesn't come to this.\n  I have tried to avoid having an acrimonious relationship. Maybe it is \nunavoidable in this election year, but I think that would be a shame \nfor the American people because, after all, that is about whom we \nshould be thinking.\n  Regarding these conference reports, I have never seen a more \nbipartisan effort than what we had on the Africa and CBI trade bill. I \ndon't know whether it was some sort of legally constituted conference \nor not. Sometimes the House doesn't appoint conferees, but we have an \nobligation to keep trying to work. Senator Moynihan was there, Senator \nRoth was involved, as were Chairman Archer and Congressman Rangel. It \nwas totally bipartisan.\n  It was one way, one side, or one party or the other trying to get the \nupper hand on the other.\n  The reason we are doing what we are doing on bankruptcy is that we \nare trying to find a way to move bankruptcy so we can then extract the \nminimum wage issue. We have people on one side or the other objecting \nto it. What do you propose we do? What I propose we do is to get our \nwork done right across the board. I am willing to try to do that.\n  But if we are going to hold our breath, turn red in the face and \nthreaten, then that is the way it will be. But everybody needs to \nunderstand that in that kind of relationship nobody wins; everybody \nloses. More importantly, this body and the American people lose because \nwe have a lot of work we need to do together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am sure I have a little time remaining.\n  Let me just say no one wants to stomp their feet and get red in the \nface--certainly not me. That is not my style. If it has happened, it is \nonly because the frustration level continues to mount.\n  It is ironic that the majority leader uses the word ``cooperation'' \nso frequently because that irony has struck me to be the essence of the \nproblem. There is so little opportunity for cooperation when the \nmajority acts in the manner it has throughout this Congress. That is \nthe problem--no cooperation. We are prepared to work through \nappropriations bills and to work through the authorization bills.\n  He mentioned the need for cooperation. He also mentioned, I might \nadd, the urgency of the emergency funding in these appropriations \nbills. The House begged the majority leader for cooperation on the \nemergency supplemental. The administration begged the majority leader \nfor cooperation on the emergency supplemental. Many of us on the \nDemocratic side urged the majority leader to cooperate on the emergency \nsupplemental. But do you know what the majority leader said? I have \ndecided there will not be any cooperation on the emergency \nsupplemental. I have decided it will go piece by piece in \nappropriations bills, and you take it or leave it.\n  I am not trying to get excited here. But let me just say as softly \nand as sincerely as I can: That is not cooperation. That is a Senate \nversion of dictatorship that I think is unacceptable. We work by \ncommittee. We work by consensus. We work by genuine cooperation. We \nwork by trying to deal\n\n[[Page S4070]]\n\nwith these issues one by one. I could cite many other examples. We want \ncooperation. We are willing to work with the majority quietly and \nproductively. But we want cooperation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I hope I have some time left because I do \nneed to put some things in the Record.\n  With regard to cloture votes, I have studied the masters.\n  First of all, we now have to file cloture on the motion to proceed \nbecause we are told it is going to be filibustered. Even the motion to \ngo to a bill is being filibustered, and there has been a tremendous \nincrease in that.\n  We are not filibustering even the substance of the bill but the \nmotion to proceed to the bill.\n  Let me give you some statistics.\n  When Senator Byrd was majority leader, he filed 87 cloture motions. \nThere was one cloture vote on a conference report.\n  The average cloture votes per Congress: 289.\n  Senator Mitchell filed 166 cloture motions--26 cloture motions on \nconference reports, and then 35 motions that were withdrawn or \nvitiated. That is another thing. Quite often we have to file cloture; \nwe get an agreement, and we vitiate it.\n  Senator Dole--so everybody understands this is not partisan--filed 91 \ncloture motions: 5 cloture motions on conference reports, and 21 of \nthem were withdrawn.\n  These are some interesting statistics about how we proceed around \nhere. When we are having a filibuster, either we have amendments or we \ndebate. That is the only option the majority leader has.\n  I wanted to get that in the Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me say for the Record at this moment, \nin response to the distinguished majority leader, that Senator Byrd and \nSenator Mitchell never filed cloture to prevent Members from offering \namendments--never.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNevada is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Kennedy, 4 \nminutes to Senator Boxer, 3 minutes to Senator Durbin, 2 minutes to \nSenator Reed of Rhode Island, and 1 minute to Senator Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope our majority leader understands \nthe friendship and the personal affection that many of us feel for him \npersonally. This really isn't a personal issue. It is about how we are \ndefining the role of the Senate.\n  As I remember history, our Founding Fathers wanted this to be a place \nwhere there would be free and open discussion and the clash of ideas--\nnot a place for a narrow, partisan agenda; not where there was going to \nbe, as the Democratic leader pointed out, effectively, the gagging of \nMembers from being able to represent different ideas and different \npositions.\n  We come from all different parts of the country. We represent a \nvariety of interests. This institution is supposed to be, as I thought \nit was going to be, about representing various positions and having the \nclash of ideas.\n  There isn't anyone who has questioned the majority leader's \nleadership in asking for a delay in terms of the consideration of \nvarious pieces of legislation. That is not what this is about.\n  But there are many of us who believe it is a matter of importance \nthat we deal with the availability of guns to children in this country. \nWe don't think that this is just some simple Democratic proposal. We \nbelieve it is something that goes to the core of many families in this \nnation. We think we ought to be able to debate and then call the roll.\n  We don't think it is just a matter of some narrow interest about \nwhether we debate and finally resolve the issue of prescription drugs. \nWe think that this is something of major importance and consequence.\n  We had to go through the hoops in order to try to deal with the No. 1 \nissue of people in this country; that is, whether doctors are going to \nmake the decisions in treating people or whether it is going to be \ninsurance agents. We are being denied the opportunity to bring those \nup. We were denied that opportunity and we've had to go through \ngymnastics.\n  We are denied the simple opportunity to have a vote in the Senate on \nthe issue that affects 12 million of the neediest people in this \ncountry, the minimum wage.\n  So the leader shouldn't take this as a personal matter. This is what \nwe think this institution is all about. They have their agenda. They \nhave the votes. But let us at least try to represent what we believe \nfamilies in this country are all about. That is what I think our leader \nis attempting to make sure we do.\n  With all respect to our leader and all the history he has \nrepresented, I have been here for a good period of time and we have \nnever had this kind of termination and basic denial of individuals \nbeing able to raise these issues.\n  We were here when Jim Abourezk, Howard Metzenbaum, and one other \nSenator closed down the Senate day in and day out because of their \nconcerns on the deregulation of natural gas. People respected this. And \nat the end of 3 days and nights, Members of the Senate were going out \nand embracing and shaking hands because they respected the fact that \npeople had strong views and that this institution responded to them.\n  That is all we are asking. Let's let the Senate be the Senate of the \nUnited States. That is what we are going to fight for, and that is what \nwe are going to insist on.\n  I agree with my good friend, the Senator from South Dakota. This \nisn't about feeling threatened. No one is threatening. If you want to \nshut this thing down, go to it. If you are not going to let the work \nget done, so be it. If you want to threaten with being red in the face, \nso be it. No one is talking about that. We are talking about trying to \nadvance the agenda that is of central concern to people in this \ncountry.\n  That is what this institution is about. I thought Senator Daschle \nspoke for the institution. I think it is an agenda that should be \npursued.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will take a deep breath to see where we are in this \ngreat body.\n  Senator Daschle, on behalf of many Members on this side and on behalf \nof 750,000 moms and their families, offered a very simple amendment to \nthe bill. By the way, that happens all the time or should happen all \nthe time around here. He offered a simple amendment to a bill \ncommending the Million Mom March and simply asking that the conference \ncommittee that is taking up the juvenile justice bill release that \nbill, bring it back with the five sensible gun laws, and send it to the \nPresident for his signature. These five sensible gun laws are to stop \nthe killing, the violence that is happening in our streets, in our \ncities, in our suburbs and our rural areas, in our schools, even in our \nchurches, even in our Jewish community centers, a simple, \nstraightforward amendment.\n  The majority leader said today he didn't see it coming. What was \ncoming? An amendment, a simple, straightforward amendment. The majority \nleader acted as if he was hurt to the core that this amendment would be \noffered.\n  Let me say with great affection to the majority leader, he shut the \nSenate down for 5 hours yesterday because he didn't want to vote on \nthat simple, straightforward amendment commending the Million Mom March \nand asking that conference committee to come back with the legislation. \nHe shut the Senate down for 5 hours. It took 24 hours until we were \nable to vote. Might I just say when we thought we were ready to vote, \nhe made a point of order that hasn't occurred in 16 years to try to do \naway with that vote. He wonders why those on this side felt we were \nbeing gagged.\n  On the bright side, we won that vote today. The Senate has gone on \nrecord for the second time--the first time with the Reed amendment, and \nthe second time with the Daschle amendment--to bring five sensible gun \nlaws to this body for action. The Senate has spoken. The majority \nleader made light of it and said, ``No one really cares about it. It is \na sense-of-the-Senate amendment.'' That isn't being respectful of the \nMembers here, a few of\n\n[[Page S4071]]\n\nwhom crossed over from that side of the aisle. I thank those three or \nfour who did so. I think the majority leader is wrong to think the \nconference committee would not listen. I hope it will.\n  One of the things the majority leader said is we want to get to the \n``real'' bills. I close with this: Is the majority leader implying that \nit is not a ``real'' tragedy when 12 children are shot down and killed \nevery day? Does the majority not think it is a real issue, it is a real \nconcern, when 30,000 Americans are killed every year--300,000-plus over \nthe last 11 years, and 8 times as many injured, many in wheelchairs, \nsuffering posttraumatic stress.\n  This has been an emotional couple of days for this Senator. This is \nthe Senate. We should not be gagged. We should be heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have worked in and around legislatures \nin the Congress for most of my life, over 30 years. I understand what \nbeing in the minority means. That means we usually lose. That is part \nof the business.\n  I also believed when I was elected to the Senate that I had an \nobligation beyond my obligation to the people of the State of Illinois, \nan obligation to this institution. This institution represents \nsomething special in the history of this Nation. Only about 1,840 men \nand women have had the honor to serve in the Senate. I think we all \nfeel an obligation to our Nation, to our Constitution but, equally, we \nfeel an obligation to the Senate.\n  I have stood by for the last 4 years and watched consistently while \nthe Republican majority has reduced the opportunity for Members of the \nSenate to express their point of view, reduced the opportunity to \ndeliberate the great issues, reduced the opportunity for people to \nstand up and speak from the heart on the floor of the Senate. I don't \nbelieve that is consistent with the history or tradition of the Senate.\n  What we saw happen today I hope will be noted by the press and \nhistorians. Bringing up the controversial gun issue, the Republican \nleadership in the Senate decided to close down for the first time in 16 \nyears the opportunity of any Senator, Democrat or Republican, to offer \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution to an appropriations bill. They have \nlimited, once again, the opportunity for Senators of both parties to \ndebate. I don't believe that is in the best interest of the Senate nor \nis it in the best interest of the country.\n  It is clear evidence that this issue of gun safety, an issue which \ntouches the hearts of so many families across America, is one that must \nbe debated and resolved on the floor of the Senate. Instead, every \nobstacle possible is thrown in our path.\n  What we are asking for is simply this: Bring the conference report \nout; let Members vote on it. If we pass it, send it to the President; \nif we don't, take it to the people in an election. That is what this \nbusiness is about.\n  Senator Kennedy, who has served for over 30 years in this body, has \none of the most important pieces of legislation in his control on the \nDemocratic side, our education bill. He is asking for a chance to \ndebate some important amendments, some controversial amendments, bring \nit forward and pass it, as every Congress has done, decade after \ndecade. And he is stopped, week after week, by the Republican majority \nwhich refuses to consider amendments they find unpopular.\n  I understand as a Member of the Senate I will have to vote for and \nagainst unpopular issues. That is the nature of this job. I understand, \nas well, that we are sent here to deliberate these issues.\n  I close, saying I am sorry that the majority leader felt some of the \ncomments made earlier were personal in nature. They were not. Though I \ndisagree with him on so many issues, I do respect him. I hope he will \npause and reflect on the future of this institution and believe that \nbeyond the issue of gun control, we all have an obligation on both \nsides of the aisle to preserve the history and tradition of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today for the second time in a month, the \nSenate of the United States has gone on record supporting sensible gun \nsafety legislation. It has gone on record to say that we should close \nthe gun show loophole; that we should ban the importation of large \ncapacity ammunition clips; that we should require the use of child \nsafety locks; that we should prohibit the possession of assault weapons \nby juveniles.\n  This body could not be clearer on where it stands when it comes down \nto the issues. What is confusing is the fact that we are unable to \nreach these issues in a substantive, decisive way because the \nlegislation is not on this floor but bottled up in a conference \ncommittee.\n  We are responding to many things. Most recently, we were responding \nto hundreds of thousands of American men and women who came to this \ncapital to ask their Senators to act. How do we act? We do it by debate \nand by voting. That is what we did this afternoon. It is difficult, \nsometimes, to achieve a vote because of the procedures of the Senate, \nbut in consequence of that, there has always been the presumption that \ndebate should be free ranging, should be open, and should be easy to \nobtain.\n  Today, we should celebrate not only the victory--again, within a \nmonth--of what I think is reason over unreason, of sensible safety when \nit comes to guns, over a fascination with the proliferation of weapons \nin society, but we all should celebrate the fact that finally and \nultimately we have gotten a chance to speak about this issue, speak for \nthe hundreds of thousands of mothers who came last weekend to \nWashington to ask us to live up to our oaths and our duty and to \nprotect their children and all Americans by enacting sensible gun \nsafety legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have 1 minute. I hope I am not too \nsuccinct.\n  The bottom line is simple: Why, for the first time in 16 years, are \nsense-of-the-Senate resolutions being refused? Because the other side \ndoes not want to vote on guns.\n  Why, for the first time, is ESEA not being debated fully? Because the \nother side doesn't want to vote on guns.\n  Guns is the issue--not the efficiency of the Senate.\n  I think it is a shame. Eighty percent of the American people want \ncommonsense gun legislation. The Republican majority is afraid to vote \non it and instead twists the rules, the procedures, and the beauty of \nthis body in a knot because they do not want to vote on guns.\n  The issue is not about moving the Senate efficiently; the issue is \nthe fear of voting on guns, plain and simple. I regret the inability of \nthe other side to have the courage of their convictions to vote the way \nthey feel and let our side vote the way we feel.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, did we have 3 minutes in that wrapup?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes. Approximately 4 minutes remain.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I want to take a moment and tell my good \nfriends, especially the Senator from New York who has left the floor, \nmake no mistake, I am proud of my vote. Make no mistake about that \nbecause I love this Constitution. We should not be out here arguing \nabout something. We should all be working together, trying to get \nAmerica working together so we can do something about this violence. \nThis is what I said a while ago: It boils down to communities' and \nindividuals' responsibilities. We can pass laws all day, make us all \nfeel good and warm, but they are not going to work. They are not going \nto work. I feel bad about that.\n  I am proud of my vote today. Don't worry about me, that I did not \nhave nerve enough to stand up here and vote my conscience. I voted my \nconscience.\n  By the way, Senator Warner of Virginia will be handling our side of \nthis debate, and Senator Roberts is here now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for \nthe purpose of offering an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3154\n\n         (Purpose: To strike section 2410, relating to Kosovo)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senators McCain, Biden, Lugar, Hagel, Lieberman, Smith of \nOregon, Robb, Voinovich, Reed of\n\n[[Page S4072]]\n\nRhode Island, Mack, Lautenberg, Kerry of Massachusetts, and Daschle, \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Biden, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n     Smith of Oregon, Mr. Robb, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Reed, Mr. Mack, \n     Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Daschle, proposes an \n     amendment No. 3154.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 2410.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes, and then I am \ngoing to yield to the Senator from Delaware for 45 minutes.\n  Our amendment strikes language in the bill which requires ground \ntroops be withdrawn from Kosovo by a fixed date next year unless \nCongress later changes its mind. Our amendment would strike language \nrequiring withdrawal this year, unless the President certifies that \ncertain specific contribution targets have been met by the Europeans.\n  We are attempting to strike this language for the pullout of our \nground forces next year for many reasons. First and foremost, in my \njudgment, is that such a requirement will create a year or a year and a \nhalf of dangerous uncertainty and dangerous instability in the Balkans. \nCreating that year of uncertainty and instability is dangerous because \nit is inconsistent with what we have struggled so hard to achieve in \nthe Balkans, which is stability in a relatively peaceful environment. \nCreating that uncertainty for a year or a year and a half would make us \nan unreliable partner in NATO.\n  I hope when we come to vote on this matter, we will take into account \nthe words of General Wesley Clark, who was our commander there until a \nfew weeks ago. He wrote a letter. I want to quote very briefly from \nthat letter because it seems to me this captures what our problems are \nwith this language that is in the bill. General Clark wrote:\n\n       These measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto \n     pull-out decision by the United States. They are unlikely to \n     encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures \n     would invalidate the policies, commitment and trust of our \n     Allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and \n     encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in \n     the Balkans.\n       At the time that US military and diplomatic personnel are \n     pressing other nations to fulfill and expand their \n     committment of forces, capabilities and resources, an \n     apparent congressionally mandated pull-out would undercut \n     their leadership and all parallel diplomatic efforts.\n\n  He also wrote that these provisions will place U.S. forces on the \nground at increased risk.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full letter from General Clark dated 11 \nMay 2000 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                     May 11, 2000.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Thank you for your letter of 10 May and \n     the opportunity to provide my personal views on the amendment \n     adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee governing the \n     future of U.S. troops in Kosovo.\n       While I support efforts of the Congress and the \n     Administration to encourage our allies to fulfill their \n     commitments to the United Nations mission in Kosovo, I am \n     opposed to the specific measures called for in the amendment. \n     These measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto pull-\n     out decision by the United States. They are unlikely to \n     encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures \n     would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our \n     Allies in NATO, undercut US leadership worldwide, and \n     encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in \n     the Balkans. Furthermore, they would, if enacted, invalidate \n     the dedication and commitment of our Soldiers, Sailors, \n     Airmen, and Marines, disregarding the sacrifices they and \n     their families have made to help bring peace to the Balkans.\n       Regional stability and peace in the Balkans are very \n     important interests of the United States. Our allies are \n     already providing over 85 percent of the military forces and \n     the funding for reconstruction efforts. US leadership in \n     Kosovo, exercised through the Supreme Allied Commander, \n     Europe, as well as our diplomatic offices, is a bargain. It \n     is an effective 6:1 ratio of diplomatic throw-weight to our \n     investment. We cannot do significantly less. Our allies would \n     see this as a unilateral, adverse move that splits fifty \n     years of shared burdens, shared risks, and shared benefits in \n     NATO.\n       This action will also undermine specific plans and \n     commitments made within the Alliance. At the time that US \n     military and diplomatic personnel are pressing other nations \n     to fulfill and expand their commitment of forces, \n     capabilities and resources, an apparent congressionally \n     mandated pullout would undercut their leadership and all \n     parallel diplomatic efforts.\n       All over Europe, nations are looking to the United States. \n     We are their inspiration, their model, and their hope for the \n     future. Small nations, weary of oppression, ravaged by a \n     century of war, looking to the future, look to us. The \n     promise of NATO enlargement, led by the United States, is the \n     promise of the expansion of the sphere of peace and stability \n     from Western Europe eastward. This powerful, stabilizing \n     force would be undercut by this legislation, which would be \n     perceived to significantly curtail US commitment and \n     influence in Europe.\n       Setting a specific deadline for US pull-out would signal to \n     the Albanians the limits of the international security \n     guarantees providing for their protection. This, in turn, \n     would give them cause to rearm and prepare to protect \n     themselves from what they would view as an inevitable Serbian \n     reentry. The more radical elements of the Albanian population \n     in Kosovo would be encouraged to increase the level of \n     violence directed against the Serb minority, thereby \n     increasing instability as well as placing US forces on the \n     ground at increased risk. Mr. Milosevic, in anticipation of \n     the pullout and ultimate breakup of KFOR, would likely \n     encourage civil disturbances and authorize the increased \n     infiltration of para-military forces to raise the level of \n     violence. He would also take other actions aimed at preparing \n     the way for Serbian military and police reoccupation of the \n     province.\n       Our servicemen and women, and their families, have made \n     great sacrifices in bringing peace and stability to the \n     Balkans. This amendment introduces uncertainty in the \n     planning and funding of the Kosovo mission. This uncertainly \n     will undermine our service members' confidence in our resolve \n     and may call into question the sacrifices we have asked of \n     them and their families. A US withdrawal could give Mr. \n     Milosevic the victory he could not achieve on the \n     battlefield.\n       In all of our activities in NATO, the appropriate \n     distribution of burdens and risk remains a longstanding and \n     legitimate issue among the nations. Increased European burden \n     sharing is an imperative in Europe as well as the United \n     States. European nations are endeavoring to meet this \n     challenge in Kosovo, and in the whole KFOR and UNMIK \n     constitute a burdensharing success story, even as we \n     encourage Europeans to do even more. The United States must \n     continue to act in our own best interests. This legislation, \n     if enacted, would see its worthy intent generating \n     consequences adverse to some of our most fundamental security \n     interests.\n       Thank you again for your support of our servicemen and \n     women.\n           Very respectfully,\n                                                  Wesley K. Clark,\n                                               General, U.S. Army.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the issue is not whether Congress has the \npower to force withdrawal of ground forces. We have that power. We \nshould have that power. We should defend that power. And we have \nexercised that power, recently in Haiti and Somalia before that. We \nhave exercised that power to pull out ground forces when the power has \ncontributed to U.S. security. So the issue is not whether we have the \npower to act in the way the Appropriations Committee proposes. The \nquestion is whether or not it is a wise exercise of congressional power \nto set a deadline for a pullout in Kosovo, thereby creating a year or \ntwo of dangerous uncertainty which would result in increased risks to \nour troops and to our interests.\n  It is not the power of Congress that is at issue; it is the wisdom of \nexercising that power in the way proposed under these circumstances \nwhich we will be debating today and tomorrow.\n  I ask that Senator Cochran of Mississippi be added as a cosponsor of \nour amendment, and I will now yield to my friend from Delaware for 45 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, immediately \nfollowing Senator Biden, I be recognized for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I reserve \nthis right because I have to go to a function tonight and I would like \nto get 15 minutes in before I go. I am supposed to be there at 6 \no'clock.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If I might respond to the distinguished Senator, whose \namendment I am supporting----\n\n[[Page S4073]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I also have a commitment at 6:30.\n  Mr. BYRD. I knew that already.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. It seems we have a lot of commitments here. Obviously, I \nwill yield to the sponsor of the amendment and the author of the \namendment. I commend him for the amendment. But that will mean if the \nSenator from Delaware were looking at probably a quarter to 6, and then \nthe Senator from West Virginia would take how much time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Ten minutes, 15.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I will rephrase my unanimous consent request to be \nrecognized following the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for \n20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, may I follow these two Senators for a \nperiod of 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I surely won't, but \nsince we are lining up speakers, I will then ask to be recognized after \nSenator Hollings for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I be acquainted--I am sorry, I just \nhad to step off the floor for a minute. Will the Chair kindly repeat \nthe unanimous consent request at the moment? I believe I am going to \ntry to manage this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Biden will be recognized for 45 \nminutes, followed by the Senator from West Virginia for 15 minutes, \nfollowed by Senator Roberts for 20 minutes, Senator Hollings for 20 \nminutes, and Senator Levin for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, might I add, I then follow my \ndistinguished colleague and ranking member for 30 minutes?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, so there is \nno problem, I think it appropriate that each of these parties who are \nasking to have time yielded to them indicate where their time is coming \nfrom. Senator Levin controls 5 hours, Senator Warner controls 5 hours. \nJust so there is no problem tomorrow, we should determine whose time is \nbeing yielded.\n  It is my understanding the time Senator Levin has used has been his \nown time, Senator Biden's is his own time, Senator Byrd is off that of \nSenator Warner, as is Senator Roberts and as is Senator Hollings.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the time of Senator Biden is off our 5 \nhours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding of the Chair. Is \nthere an objection to the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. WARNER. None, Mr. President, but I want to inform the Senate as a \npart of this colloquy that it is the distinguished majority leader's \nwill we do at least 4-plus hours tonight. I will remain, of course, for \nthat purpose. I do hope other Senators will indicate their availability \nso we can use that time properly. I believe this is one of the most \nimportant and interesting debates on a foreign policy issue we have had \nin the Senate this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nrequest is agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator allow me to speak for \n1\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend Congressman John Kasich. The \nHouse voted 264-153 to adopt the provision which I drafted and then \ngave to Congressman Kasich, which is approximately one-half of the \nmatter we are now debating.\n  In other words, the House has already acted on one-half of the \nprovision we are debating, and it voted in favor of it 264-153.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the House amendment \nin today's Record for the availability of Members.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Amendment to H.R. 4205, as Reported, Offered by Mr. Kasich of Ohio\n\n       At the end of title XII (page 338, after line 13), insert \n     the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 1205. ACTIVITIES IN KOSOVO.\n\n       (a) Contingent Required Withdrawal of Forces From Kosovo.--\n     If the President does not submit to Congress a certification \n     under subsection (c) and a report under subsection (d) before \n     April 1, 2001, then, effective on April 1, 2001, funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of \n     Defense may not be obligated or expended for the continued \n     deployment of United States ground combat forces in Kosovo. \n     Such funds shall be available with respect to Kosovo only for \n     the purpose of conducting a safe, orderly, and phased \n     withdrawal of United States ground combat forces from Kosovo, \n     and no other amounts appropriated for the Department of \n     Defense in this Act or any other Act may be obligated to \n     continue the deployment of United States ground combat forces \n     in Kosovo. In that case, the President shall submit to \n     Congress, not later than April 30, 2001, a report on the plan \n     for the withdrawal.\n       (b) Waiver Authority.--(1) The President may waive the \n     provisions of subsection (a) for a period or periods of up to \n     90 days each in the event that--\n       (A) United States Armed Forces are involved in hostilities \n     in Kosovo or imminent involvement by United States Armed \n     forces in hostilities in Kosovo is clearly indicated by the \n     circumstances; or\n       (B) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, acting through \n     the Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, requests emergency \n     introduction of United States ground forces into Kosovo to \n     assist other NATO or non-NATO military forces involved in \n     hostilities or facing imminent involvement in hostilities.\n       (2) The authority in paragraph (1) may not be exercised \n     more than twice unless Congress by law specifically \n     authorizes the additional exercise of that authority.\n       (c) Certification.--Whenever the President determines that \n     the Kosovo burdensharing goals set forth in paragraph (2) \n     have been achieved, the President shall certify in writing to \n     Congress that those goals have been achieved.\n       (2) The Kosovo burdensharing goals referred to in paragraph \n     (1) are that the European Commission, the member nations of \n     the European Union, and the European member nations of the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization have, in the aggregate--\n       (A) obligated or contracted for at least 50 percent of the \n     amount of the assistance that those organizations and nations \n     committed to provide for 1999 and 2000 for reconstruction in \n     Kosovo;\n       (B) obligated or contracted for at least 85 percent of the \n     amount of the assistance that those organizations and nations \n     committed for 1999 and 2000 for humanitarian assistance in \n     Kosovo;\n       (C) provided at least 85 percent of the amount of the \n     assistance that those organizations and nations committed for \n     1999 and 2000 for the Kosovo Consolidated Budget; and\n       (D) deployed at least 90 percent of the number of police, \n     including special police, that those organizations and \n     nations pledged for the United Nations international police \n     force for Kosovo.\n       (d) Report on Commitments and Pledges by Other Nations and \n     Organizations.--The President shall submit to Congress a \n     report containing detailed information on--\n       (1) the commitments and pledges made by the European \n     Commission, each of the member nations of the European Union, \n     and each of the European member nations of the North Atlantic \n     Treaty Organization for reconstruction assistance in Kosovo, \n     humanitarian assistance in Kosovo, the Kosovo Consolidated \n     Budget, and police (including special police) for the United \n     Nations international police force for Kosovo;\n       (2) the amount of assistance that has been provided in each \n     category, and the number of police that have been deployed to \n     Kosovo, by each such organization or nation; and\n       (3) the full range of commitments and responsibilities that \n     have been undertaken for Kosovo by the United Nations, the \n     European Union, and the Organization for Security and \n     Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the progress made by those \n     organizations in fulfilling those commitments and \n     responsibilities, an assessment of the tasks that remain to \n     be accomplished, and an anticipated schedule for completing \n     those tasks.\n       (e) Construction of Section.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be deemed to restrict the authority of the President under \n     the Constitution to protect the lives of United States \n     citizens.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Virginia, we would \nbe 50 percent better off if we adopted the House position than the \nSenate position. The House position is only half as bad as the Senate \nposition. The House position adopted today says there must be an \naccounting, as I understand it. The House requires that we pay our fair \nshare, and that unless NATO meets their aid commitments, then troops \nwould be withdrawn.\n  This amendment goes a lot further than that. The real damage of the \nByrd-Warner amendment, in my view, is that it does something that I \ncannot imagine any military man wanting to do. It says that what we are \ngoing to do is announce today, tomorrow, the next day--whenever we \nfinally vote on it--if it prevails, we are going to announce\n\n[[Page S4074]]\n\nthat in the summer of 2001 we are out of there, unless we affirmatively \nvote to stay.\n  I find this absolutely intriguing. We had a very spirited debate \nabout whether to get involved in Kosovo at all. I do not remember a \nsingle, solitary person during that debate who really wanted to be \ninvolved. I suspect--as my friend from South Carolina always reminded \nme--there was no one more vocal about our need to make that effort than \nme. He would come to the floor --and I consider him one of my closest \nfriends, not only my closest Senate friend--he would say: How is the \nBiden war going today?\n  I felt strongly it was the right thing for the United States to do. I \ndo not remember any time during that debate--and I believe I \nparticipated in every piece of that debate--when anybody said there was \nany reasonable prospect there would be no American forces in Kosovo 1 \nyear or 2 years or even 3 years from now. We had just gone through \nthis, in my view, very wrongheaded debate about setting a time certain \nfor troops to be withdrawn from Bosnia. We did that once already, and \nwe finally figured out it made no sense to set a time certain to \nwithdraw troops in Bosnia, and here we are again.\n  Let's peel back the first layer of this onion. We have a very \nlegitimate, fundamental, serious disagreement among many of us on this \nfloor, crossing party lines. I do not know anybody stronger against \nthis amendment than the Presiding Officer. He is a Republican. And I do \nnot know anybody stronger for the amendment than Senator Byrd, a \nDemocrat. This division crosses party lines.\n  It boils down to something very basic, it seems to me, and that is, \nwhen every Senator asks himself or herself the following question, they \nwill know how they should vote.\n  The question is, Does the United States have a significant interest \nin peace and stability in the Balkans? If it does not, then my \ncolleagues should vote for Byrd-Warner. I respect that view. I respect \nthe view of those who say it is not a critical U.S. interest, a vital \nU.S. interest, a significant U.S. interest, or it is Europe's problem. \nI respect that. I think they are dead wrong, but I respect their view.\n  What I find fascinating, though, is I do not know how anyone can \nintellectually reach the following conclusion; that it is in our vital \ninterest to see to it there is peace and stability in that part of \nEurope, but we should announce now that we are out unless we \naffirmatively vote we are in. I do not get that.\n  My mom had an expression--it is not original to her. She said: Joey, \nthe road to hell is paved with good intentions.\n  We are paving a road to hell with this amendment. What we are doing \nwith this amendment is saying to Slobodan Milosevic, unintentionally, \nbut the effect is: Hang on, baby, we do not have the will to stay.\n  Let me ask another question rhetorically: We have 5,600 troops there. \nThank God, none are being shot at. Thank God, no one has been killed. \nThank God, there is peace. Thank God, they are doing their job. Thank \nGod, there is no immediate jeopardy from an outside invading army, et \ncetera. Does anybody believe that if we withdraw our forces from Kosovo \nthe Europeans will get it right? Does anybody here believe that the \nEuropeans will say: OK, the United States is gone; no worry, we're \ngoing to take care of this matter; not a problem.\n  We can all sit here and say: The GDP of Europe is bigger than ours. \nEurope should be mature enough to be able to handle this. They don't \nneed us. It is their backyard.\n  That is all well and good to say, but does anybody believe it? In a \ndifferent context, Thomas Jefferson said: If a nation wishes to be both \nignorant and free, it wishes for something that never was and never can \nbe. If anybody believes there can be stability in Europe without \nstability in the Balkans, they are wishing for something that never was \nand never can be. Never in our history has it been that way.\n  So let's cut right to the quick. You have to be able to say the \nfollowing, it seems to me, to be for Warner-Byrd, Byrd-Warner: \nstability in the Balkans is not important for stability in the rest of \nEurope; or it is important, but I believe the Europeans can handle it \nby themselves.\n  If you can conclude either of those two to be true, then have at it. \nBut if you conclude, as Barry Goldwater used to say--and I did serve \nwith him--in your heart you know that not to be true, then you better \nnot vote for this amendment or you better vote to strike this \namendment.\n  What are the likely consequences of adoption of this amendment? I \nwill get back to some of the details about the amendment and the \nrequirements imposed upon the administration to be able to certify that \nthe Europeans are doing their part. I will state right now the \nEuropeans are doing their part. We have battered them up and about the \nhead--no one more than this Senator--to do their part.\n  The President will have to certify, though, on a very different \nstandard. By the way, the reason my friends want to amend this is so it \ncan be even remotely possible that the President would be able to \ncertify that the Europeans are doing their part.\n  But regarding individual countries, the European Commission is in the \nprocess of collecting data from the 15 member states in the European \nCouncil, each of which has unique budgeting procedures in fiscal years. \nWe are utilizing the United Nations. As we already see in the \naggregate, our European partners are providing a vast majority of the \nassistance to Kosovo.\n  If we look at the troop strength, our NATO allies have 40,000 troops \non the ground in Kosovo; we have 5,600. That is, the United States is \nproviding about 13 percent of the KFOR troop strength.\n  If we look at UNMIK--I hate these acronyms--but UNMIK's consolidated \nbudget--that is the U.N. piece here--the Europeans, and others, are \nright now funding 87 percent of that entire budget. Our part, again, \ncompromises only 13 percent of the total.\n  So the benchmark laid out in the legislation has already been met.\n  How about international police? There are civilian police officers \nsent from the U.N. member states all over the world, who are to relieve \nKFOR troops of the nonmilitary law and order function in Kosovo. That \nis the plan. We all support it. Fully 88 percent of the pledges for \ncivilian police for Kosovo have come from outside the United States of \nAmerica. And 87 percent of all the police officers pledged have already \nbeen deployed.\n  Let's look at the so-called reconstruction funding concerning \nEurope's financial contributions to the reconstruction of Kosovo. \nSection 2410 of the Byrd-Warner amendment focuses on the speed with \nwhich it delivers that assistance.\n\n  When the United States commits funding for large-scale reconstruction \ninitiatives, sometimes the United States itself does not hit the \nbenchmark set here--33 percent obligated or contracted for a year or \ntwo.\n  Let's look at the humanitarian relief. In the spring of this year, \nthe United Nations High Commission for Refugees announced that the \nhumanitarian disaster in Kosovo had been averted. The much feared \nwinter had come and gone. It was time for the international community \nto switch from a relief role to a reconstruction role.\n  Nonetheless, Senator Warner's legislation, in section 2410, insists \nthat Europeans continue to funnel money into humanitarian relief when \nthe need no longer is pressing. This is what I might call \ncounterproductive micromanagement from thousands of miles away.\n  The United States is not paying a disproportionate price in the \ninternational effort to secure peace in Kosovo--not in terms of the \nnumber of peacekeeping troops, not in terms of the number of civilian \npolice, not in terms of the reconstruction and humanitarian aid.\n  Section 2410 is also inconsistent. It really is saying to the \nEuropeans: Heads I win; tails you lose, Europeans. We set these \nbenchmarks. We tell them they have to meet the benchmarks. They are \nmeeting the benchmarks. Then we tell them: By the way, while you're \nmeeting those benchmarks--and you do that first--we are not committing \nto stay anyway. As a matter of fact, we're out of there. We're out of \nthere. We tell you now, ahead of time, hey, Europe, we're out in July \n2001, unless we affirmatively change our mind and stay in.\n  That really is persuasive, isn't it? What do you think it would be \nthe other way around if Europe said: I tell\n\n[[Page S4075]]\n\nyou what, United States, you put up 87 percent of this endeavor we're \ngoing to get involved in. Once you put it up, we are going to tell you \nthat we're not in anyway, unless we change our mind a year and a half \nfrom now.\n  Let me ask you a rhetorical question: If you are sitting in Europe--\nand in the mood that exists in the United States today, in a country \nthat has turned down the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, where the \ndebate is about whether or not we should be involved in Africa, whether \nwe should be involved in anything that comes up internationally--and \nyou hear that the Senate--and hopefully not the Congress as well--\npasses a law that says we are affirmatively out in 1 year and 3 months, \nunless we change our minds and affirmatively vote to stay; what do you \nthink that communicates to Europe? What do you think they are going to \nthink in Berlin, in Paris, in London, in Lisbon, et cetera?\n  Do you think they are going to say: Oh, I tell you what: that is just \nthe way their Constitution operates. That is just how they do that?\n  I chaired the Judiciary Committee for years. I have made it my \nbusiness to try to understand and--most dangerously--actually teach \nconstitutional law and the separation of powers issues, and \nparticularly the war clause. I take a back seat to no one, including my \ndistinguished friend, Senator Byrd, in paying attention to the \ncongressional prerogatives that exist when it comes to the notion of \nwhat constitutionally is permissible for a President to do and what our \nconstitutional responsibility is.\n  The truth of the matter is, Congress has the power to authorize \ndeployment to Kosovo or to set limits on deployment. Congress could, as \nthe Byrd-Warner amendment clearly contemplates, cut off funds or \ncircumscribe the missions of the troops. But merely because the \nCongress has the power to do that does not mean it is wise to exercise \nthat power or that it has the obligation to do that under the \nConstitution.\n  I would have no objection to a resolution authorizing the deployment \nof U.S. forces or a resolution today saying: Withdraw now. Withdraw \nnow. At least that would end the uncertainty. It would end the fact \nthat you would have our troops and 40,000 other troops in Kosovo \nsomewhere other than in limbo wondering whether we are going to stay or \nnot stay, wondering what our predisposition is likely to be.\n  I do not believe we should put our troops or our allies under the \nsword of Damocles with the threat of a funding cutoff that implies the \nUnited States is abandoning its friends and allies in Europe now. The \nfact is, no one is being shot at now, our troops are not being shot at. \nWe are not in a state of war now.\n  There is no outside army. There are a bunch of thugs wandering the \ncountryside who have the possibility of doing harm to our forces and \nothers. This is as close as you are going to get to a legal definition \nof a police action as you are ever going to have. This is not a \ncircumstance requiring the United States--beyond what was already done \nin voting for the airstrikes and the use of force--to have \nCongressional consent beyond what it already has. As one of our \ncolleagues said in the caucus, I didn't hear anybody in 1973 when I was \nhere, or in 1977, or in 1985, or in 1997, or in 2000, call for \ncontinued authority, an affirmative vote to continue to maintain \n100,000 troops in Europe.\n  With regard to the argument that we are stretched too thin and can't \nafford to have 5,600 forces in Kosovo for an extended period of time, \nwell, if we can't afford that, how are we able to afford to have \n100,000 troops in Europe? I want to know that one. I don't quite get \nthat. I don't quite get how we can afford to have 100,000 troops in \nEurope, stationed in Germany and elsewhere, where they are not keeping \nanything except our political flag raised high--and I think that is \nimportant--but we can't afford 5,600 troops in Kosovo. If my memory \nserves me--and I have been here longer than one of the other three \nMembers on the Senate floor. The only person I have been here longer \nthan is Senator Warner, but he has more experience. The other two \nMembers I haven't been here longer than. I don't ever recall, since I \nhave been here, having less than a minimum of 100,000 in Europe, and as \nmany as 350,000. I don't remember that. But now we have this dire, \nurgent need to withdraw 5,600 forces from Kosovo.\n  Now, my friend from Virginia and my friend from North Carolina, as \nwell as the Senator from West Virginia--but he is on Appropriations--\nthese other two fellows spend a lot of time on the military side of the \nequation, and Armed Services in particular. If I am not mistaken, we \nspent some time in Europe fretting over what the Europeans mean by \nESDI, European Security and Defense Initiative. That is something the \nFrench have been pushing a long time. They don't like the fact we are a \nEuropean power. They don't like that idea. So they got this idea they \nwere going to have this independent force--an independent force, \nseparate from NATO. We got them to cool their jets a little bit and say \nwhat this really means is they get all that independent force with no \nAmericans. That independent force would only be engaged in missions \nNATO first refused to be engaged in. But everybody knows that it is a \nharbinger for diminishing the power and the political efficacy of NATO.\n  I want to ask a rhetorical question. You know, in those movies when \nClint Eastwood said, ``Go ahead, make my day''--we are about to make \ntheir day for the French. We are about to make France's day. Can you \nhear the discussion now if we vote this amendment: I told you the \nUnited States is not reliable. I told you we need our own European \ndefense system. I told you about NATO. Can't you hear it? Maybe I have \nbeen to too many conferences with my French friends. Can anybody stand \nup and say that if we pass this amendment, we are not making it \nexponentially more difficult for us to deal with ESDI? Come on. Come \non. Does anybody think that?\n  By the way, some of our friends--and they are obviously extremely \nbright, competent Senators who truly--and I am not speaking of anybody \non the floor--believe NATO's day is past and it no longer has any \nutility, and that we should disengage. In fact, the fellow I ran \nagainst a while ago for the Senate came to call me the ``Senator from \nEurope'' because I supported NATO. I thought it was very important that \nwe stay involved in NATO. I respect the view. I disagree with it, but I \nrespect the view.\n\n  But those of you who say you think NATO is important, I respectfully \nsuggest to you that if Byrd-Warner becomes the law, we will have done \nmore in two small paragraphs to damage the coherence of NATO than \nanything we have done since 1950. I truly believe that. I absolutely \ntruly believe that. Obviously, I may be wrong, but I honest to goodness \nbelieve that.\n  Right now there are reports coming out of Serbia. By the way, before \nI say that, I came here at a time when the Vietnam war was in its final \npainful throes, in 1973. I used to resent it when people would say, \nwhen I opposed the war, that we were giving comfort to Ho Chi Minh. I \nam not suggesting anybody is intentionally or unintentionally giving \nanybody comfort. I want to state what I think to be the fact. Milosevic \nis tightening his grip now in Serbia, cutting off the alternative press \navailable to the Serbs, cracking down on it--for example, last night, \nhis goons occupied a station, Studio B2-92, and padlocked the doors of \nthe other independent outlets and media offices and shut them down. An \nopposition leader declared the Milosevic government had imposed an \ninformal state of emergency.\n  Now, why do you think he is doing that? I think he is doing that \nbecause he is desperate, because the hourglass is filling up from the \nbottom. He knows he doesn't have much time left. One of the reasons why \nhe has reacted the way we wanted him to every time--that is, by backing \noff--is he has been convinced of our resolve. I suggest that the reason \nhe finally capitulated at the end of that war is we started to move \nforces in place for deployment in Macedonia. He wasn't sure if we were \ngoing to invade and use land troops. I think most who studied that \nwould acknowledge that is an overwhelming possibility. Now what does he \ndo? Here he is in his last gasp, and we have gone on record saying we \nwill pull out of Kosovo by midsummer next year. We affirmatively state \nthat--not that we will have to have a vote next summer, or that we \nshould consider it, but that we are out--unless we vote to stay in.\n\n[[Page S4076]]\n\n  Now, say you are an opposition leader in Serbia; or you are sitting \nin Montenegro, which Milosevic has been leering at for the past 9 \nmonths; does that embolden you? My European colleagues will not like \nwhat I am about to say. But I have traveled the Balkan region on seven \noccasions. I met with every President of every frontline state, as many \nof us have. Does anybody know any leader in that region who is willing \nto place his fate in the hands of the Europeans? Can you name me one--a \nsingle solitary person who is in opposition to Milosevic, any democrat \nfrom Romania to Albania, from Bulgaria to Montenegro, who is willing?\n  Would I tell them: The United States is out, but don't worry, you \nhave the French and the Germans to rely on; don't worry, they will be \nthere? Can anybody stand up on this floor and say that you know a \nsingle leader who would say that?\n  I know there are certain things you shouldn't say. That is one, \napparently. I will be reminded of this by my French friends and my \nBritish friends and others. But I think we have to be realistic. \nEverybody knows that if we are out, the game is up. That may not be \nfair. We shouldn't have to carry that much of a load, maybe. But they \nare the facts of life, and they are the facts of history.\n  Does anybody here believe Europe has achieved political maturation \nwhere they are going to solve their problems without the catalyst of \nthe United States? What have we said all along? We have said: Look, as \nlong as we are not carrying a disproportionate share, we are involved.\n  I remember going in to see the President when he made his speech \nabout us being involved. He said we should not be responsible for any \nmore than 15 percent of whatever reconstruction, peace, stability, et \ncetera, in that region requires. We are about 13 percent to 17 percent.\n  That was kind of the deal we thought we were brokering here. Sure. We \nprovided 85 percent of the air power and 90 percent of leadership.\n  With this amendment, we would still require a NATO commander heading \nup the entire operation in Kosovo to be an American while we had no \nAmerican troops there. I want to be there for that discussion.\n  I want to be there when we withdraw all American forces from Kosovo \nand then we tell our European allies abruptly: By the way, we are still \nin charge. We are the guys. Our general is an American general. He is \nin charge. He is in charge of NATO in Europe. That is where NATO is. He \nis in charge. That is a good one. I like that one. That will really \nhelp cohesion in NATO.\n  Heck, we are trying to convince the French that they had better buy \nan aircraft carrier before they take over the fleet in the \nMediterranean. That is a big fight we are now having. The French say: \nWe want a French admiral.\n  I got in trouble with the French when I said: OK, it is fine by me, \nif you buy some more ships. They didn't like that.\n  Can you imagine the argument now with a NATO operation in Kosovo led \nby an American general with no American troops?\n  Colleagues, this is not a well conceived plan unless, I respectfully \nsuggest, unless you conclude that NATO is not vital to our interests \nany longer; unless you conclude that having a beefed up European \ndefense initiative a la the French plan for the last 15 years is a good \nidea for the United States of America; unless you believe the Europeans \ncan maintain stability in the Balkans, or that stability in the Balkans \nis not important for stability in Europe.\n  If you draw those conclusions, this makes sense. But if you say you \nthink NATO is vital for American interests, if you say stability in \nEurope depends at least in some part upon stability in the Balkans and \nsouthern Europe, if you say you want an American in command of NATO \nforces when we have 100,000 left in Europe, then I don't know how you \ncan reach this conclusion.\n  That is why I say here what I said at the White House when all of my \nfriends who are sitting here, with one exception, were at that meeting \n3 months ago, along with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of \nState, the National Security Advisor, and the National Security \nAdvisor's team. I will say it again. This is about what you believe is \nimportant.\n  I ask again a rhetorical question. Can anyone paint a picture for me \nthat looks like this: That 5 years from now there is not a reignition \nof a great ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, that there is increasing \nstability in economic growth in the region, and that there is becoming \nan integration of that part of Europe into the rest of Europe--without \nthe United States of America having some portion of the total force \nstructure of NATO being present? Can anybody paint that picture for me?\n  I will be overwhelmingly delighted if my colleagues prevail and I am \nwrong, because my fervent hope is, if Senator Levin and I and others do \nnot succeed in striking this language, everything I said is \nmisinformed. That would be my fervent hope and prayer, because I think \nthis has certain-disaster written all over it. I think this is one of \nthe most serious mistakes we can make.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? I \nyield on my time.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am delighted to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have listened very carefully. By the way, it was the \nBiden-Warner amendment back in the intense part of that air operation \nwhich prevailed.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct. I acknowledge that.\n  Mr. WARNER. How interesting it is that two good friends and two \ncolleagues can be on opposite side of an issue at this point in time. \nCircumstances have changed.\n  I draw the Senator's attention to page 565 of the bill where it says:\n\n       Except as provided in paragraph (B), absent specific \n     statutory authorization . . . the President may waive the \n     limitation in paragraph (1)(B) for a period . . . of up to 90 \n     days each in the event that--\n       . . . the Armed Forces are involved in hostilities in \n     Kosovo or that imminent involvement by the Armed Forces in \n     hostilities in Kosovo is clearly indicated;\n       (ii) NATO, acting through the Supreme Allied Commander --\n\n  The very person the Senator from Delaware pointed to remaining in \ncharge--\n\n     in Europe, requests the emergency introduction of United \n     States ground forces into Kosovo to assist other NATO or non-\n     NATO military forces involved in hostilities or facing \n     imminent involvement in hostilities.\n\n  There it is. The President, seeing the actions that the Senator just \npointed out, can dispatch the American troops. They can come out of \nthat cadre of over 100,000, or thereabouts, in NATO and go right into \nthis action.\n  The Senator says the 85 percent that are there now from some 32 \nnations are of little consequence if a portion of the U.S. forces--\nnamely, the ground combat troops--are withdrawn and we leave the other \nsupport troops and the other types of troops there.\n  This is not an American cut and run. This is not an American pullout. \nHere is the authority for the President to step in in the types of \ncontingencies the Senator pointed out.\n  If I might pose a rhetorical question, does the Senator think the \ncase is so weak for the Balkans that the next President of the United \nStates cannot come to the Congress and make the case for the Congress \nto have the troops stay after July 1?\n  Mr. BIDEN. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. I, frankly, would vote for it, if the next President were \nto come and ask for that and made a strong case.\n  I really think the sky is not falling in, I say to my distinguished \nfriend. We have carefully provided in this piece of legislation \ncontingencies for any such action that would jeopardize our remaining \ntroops and/or the other nations that will come and pick up the modest \nnumbers of combat troops.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will respond.\n  What the Senator has written in the legislation I would characterize \nas having tried to do something after the horse is out of the barn.\n  Here is the deal. I am not suggesting there will be any hostilities \nbefore the U.S. forces leave. I am not suggesting there will be \nhostilities as the U.S. forces leave. If I were Milosevic, the KLA, or \nanybody else, I would have garlands and roses strewn along the road as \nthey were on their way out. I would be throwing them bouquets. I would \nbe giving them chocolates and\n\n[[Page S4077]]\n\ncigarettes as they left. I would not do a thing. I would wait until \nthey were gone. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, when they go, I predict to you that you will see in the \ncouncils of Europe an overwhelming discussion about whether or not the \nEuropeans will stay, and in what numbers.\n  At that point, if there is hostility, if Mr. Milosevic moves on \nMitrovica to annex the top of the state, or if there is a movement in \nMontenegro to topple the Government, is the Senator saying to me that \nautomatically authorizes the President of the United States to send \nwhatever forces he wishes back in?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is what the amendment requires. In other words, if \nthere is a need, the President has the waiver authority.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Then the Senator is saying there is no damage or war, \nthere is no American being killed now, but we are going to pull the \nAmericans out; but if there is war and carnage, again we will put them \nback in?\n  Mr. WARNER. That power is given to the President of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague, Senator \nByrd, on the floor. I ask Senator Byrd a question, if he is willing.\n  Is it his understanding that if we withdraw these forces and war \nerupts again in Kosovo, the President needs no Congressional \nauthorization and he is preauthorized to use whatever force is \nnecessary to bring peace and stability back to Kosovo? Is that the \nSenator's understanding?\n  Mr. WARNER. I can answer in the affirmative to the Senator's \nquestion.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I understand the Senator from Virginia thinks that. I \nwonder whether the Senator from West Virginia thinks that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am hoping to be able to leave the Senate \nafter making a 15-minute speech of my own.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I withdraw the question.\n  Mr. BYRD. I think I stated that earlier.\n  May I say to the distinguished Senator, I will try to answer his \nquestion. First, I say to the Senator, if he will yield, he has framed \nit this way: We are out unless we vote to stay in; come next--we hope \nto make that October 1 in conference; in the bill, it is announced July \n1, 2001. We will not let the Senate frame it that way: ``We are out \nunless we vote to stay in.'' This bill does not say that. This \namendment does not say that.\n  The Senator from Delaware, I say most respectfully, is leaving out \none very important factor, that being the President of the United \nStates, whoever he may be next October. The opponents of my amendment \ndepend heavily upon the ``Commander in Chief.'' Well, there will be a \nCommander in Chief at that time, and that Commander in Chief, unless he \nmakes a case, unless he asks to be authorized to continue to deploy \nAmerican ground troops after that date, and unless Congress then votes \nto authorize, then they would leave.\n  But the Senator says, ``We are out unless we vote to stay in.'' That \nis not the case. There is going to be a President there asking. I \nassume, if he believes we ought to continue to deploy troops after that \ndate, he will be up here asking. He will be requesting them. And then \nCongress will vote to authorize or not to authorize. It is not that \nsimple, ``We are out unless we vote to stay in.''\n  Mr. BIDEN. If I may respond, unless I misunderstand still, that is a \ndistinction with little difference. If I understand the way the \nlegislation reads, the President will submit a report to Congress \nsaying, I want to stay.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, that is what the Senator is leaving out.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Once the President does that, then in order for the troops \nto stay, both the House and the Senate have to affirmatively vote to \nhave them stay; correct?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is correct, but that is the other half I am trying to \nget into the Record.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. May I ask, if the Senate and House refuse to act one way \nor another, what happens?\n  Mr. BYRD. Of course, if they do--the Senator is assuming something I \nwill not assume.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am asking for clarification.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am answering the Senator. The Senator is assuming \nsomething I don't assume.\n  Mr. BIDEN. With all due respect, I am not assuming a thing. \nAssumption is the mother of all screwups.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator says, if thus and such.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is not an assumption. An assumption is if I said \n``when the Senate fails to act.'' I did not say that. I said ``if'' the \nSenate fails to act. It is a question, not an assumption.\n  Now, if the Senate fails to act--does not vote one way or another--\nare the troops allowed to stay, or must they come home?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is half the picture.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I got that, Mr. President.\n  Let me rephrase it. The President of the United States, President \nGore or President Bush, and whatever operative date it ends up being, \nOctober or July, sends a report to the Congress and says: I wish the \n5,600 troops to remain in Kosovo.\n  That is the first part. He has done that. He says: I want them to \nstay.\n\n  What happens if the Senate says: We are not even going to vote on it? \nCan the troops stay?\n  Mr. BYRD. I assume the Senate would certainly debate that.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is not my question, with all due respect.\n  Mr. BYRD. With all due respect, if we are going to limit half the \nquestion, we are not really dealing with the situation. Let me answer \nthe Senator. If the Congress refuses to authorize, of course they are \ngoing to come out.\n  But let us not assume that and let us not forget that the Commander \nin Chief will be making an effort to justify the continued deployment \nof those troops.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Let me rephrase my assertion. The Congress, as of whatever the \noperative date--and right now the operative date is in July 2001--the \nCongress does not vote to stay in Kosovo; then the troops must be \nwithdrawn. Now, that is a distinction with a technical, legal \ndifference.\n  What I respectfully suggest is, it will fall on deaf ears in every \nEuropean capital. I respectfully suggest, if my friends think it is so \ndangerous or imprudent for us to be there now, if there is a \nconstitutional requirement for us to have to vote on it, then why are \nwe shirking the responsibility of not voting right now? Because if \nthere is a constitutional responsibility, it is not delayed for a year. \nIt either exists or it does not exist. If it exists, the obligation \nexists today to vote. And my friends want the next Congress to vote in \nthe year 2001.\n  It is illogical to suggest, with all due respect, that there is a \nconstitutional requirement for Congress to vote for these troops to \nstay but we don't have to do it for a year. The implication is, he \ndoesn't have the authority now. So that takes care of the \nconstitutional argument. There is obviously no serious constitutional \nargument, for if there were, we have to vote now, I assume, unless \nsomeone responds to the contrary that I am correct.\n  Look, folks, thank God that not a single American was killed in the \nentire war. Thank God, an American hasn't been killed yet, although it \nis possible. Thank God, there are not 800,000 people displaced and they \nare back in their homes. Thank God, the ethnic cleansing has stopped.\n  I ask the rhetorical question, if the Lord Almighty came down and sat \nin the well and said, ``I promise you all that, if you keep 5,600 \ntroops in Kosovo for the next 10 years, there will be no carnage, there \nwill be no death and destruction of American forces,'' would anybody \nhere say that is too high a price to pay? Would anybody say that? Would \nanybody vote and say, Lord, no, we are stretched too thin?\n  I can pick an awful lot of places where I would like to take 5,600 \ntroops out if we are stretched too thin other than Kosovo. Talk about a \nplace where we are doing some good in what we are not allowing to \nhappen! I think this is one heck of a gamble. The logic escapes me. I \nmay be slow. I have not been here as long as some, but I have been here \n28 years. I pay a lot of attention to this. I try my best. And the \nlogic escapes me. If there is a constitutional requirement, it exists \ntoday. It exists tonight. It existed yesterday. It doesn't \nautomatically click into effect in July of 2001. If we are stretched \ntoo thin, if that is the problem, let's pick 5,600 troops from a place \nwhere they are\n\n[[Page S4078]]\n\nserving a function, but none nearly as important as the one they are \nserving now. And if we expect to be and intend to be a major force in \nEurope and NATO, let's understand that it will not happen without our \nparticipation to the degree of 13 percent of the forces in Europe.\n\n  We asked the Europeans to do the lion's share after Milosevic \nyielded. They are doing the lion's share, on average over 80 percent \nand as high as 87 percent in the four categories. So if anybody thinks \nthat does not make sense, let us vote now. Can anybody seriously say \nthat the anxiety level, at a minimum, in European capitals, the anxiety \nlevel in the frontline states, the anxiety level for our troops, the \nanxiety level for the total military, is not somewhat heightened by the \nfact that it will require, no matter how we get to it, an affirmative \nvote of the Congress in July of next year to have those troops stay?\n  I will end where I began and reserve the remainder of my time, if I \nhave any. I will end where I began. It seems to me this is a basic, \nlegitimate debate on what is in the naked self-interest of the United \nStates of America. It is a fundamental foreign policy debate. Do you \nthink stability in the Balkans can be maintained without U.S. forces \nthere? If you do not, do you think that stability in the Balkans is \nnecessary for stability in the rest of Europe? If you do not, do you \nthink the United States is negatively impacted by either outcome?\n  While I strongly support trying to move the supplemental funding \nneeded by our military and the important military construction projects \nincluded in this bill, Section 2410 would do damage to Kosovo and to \nthe United States of America, despite the best intentions of its \nauthors.\n  Section 2410 is premised on an inaccurate understanding of the facts, \nand then gets worse, as it abdicates U.S. leadership of NATO and gives \ncomfort to Slobodan Milosevic.\n  There are two aspects to Section 2410. The first would require a \njoint Congressional resolution authorizing continued deployment of \nAmerican troops in KFOR after July 1, 2001.\n  The second aspect would require that the Europeans are meeting \ncertain requirements for burdensharing in Kosovo. If the President \ncould not make that certification by July 15, 2000, then thereafter \nfunds would only be allowed to be used for withdrawal of U.S. forces \nfrom Kosovo, unless Congress authorized their continued deployment by \njoint resolution.\n  If Congress failed to enact such a joint resolution, no funding could \nbe obligated to continue the deployment of United States military \npersonnel in Kosovo. In that case, the President would be required to \nsubmit to Congress, not later than August 15, 2000, a report on a plan \nfor the withdrawal of United States military personnel from Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, the question of whether Congress must, as a \nconstitutional matter, authorize the deployment of U.S. forces in the \nKosovo peacekeeping mission is a close one.\n  I yield to no Senator in my defense of the constitutional powers of \nCongress on matters of war and peace. In my view, Congress has not only \nthe power to declare war, but also to authorize all uses of force. I \nhave consistently resisted arguments by Presidents--Democrats and \nRepublicans alike--that the Commander-in-Chief power provides \nunfettered authority to use force against foreign countries.\n  In this circumstance, however, I would argue that Congressional \nauthorization for the deployment of U.S. peacekeeping forces in Kosovo \nis unnecessary.\n  The deployment of peacekeepers, in a situation such as we now have, \nis not war, or even a use of force. It falls far short of both. Unlike \nthe deployment of U.S. forces to Lebanon in the early 1980's, there is \nno significant threat of hostilities from a foreign army or from \nguerilla forces. Rather, the only threat to U.S. forces comes from a \nhandful of lightly-armed thugs in both the Serbian and ethnic Albanian \ncommunities in Kosovo. In that sense, the deployment is truly a \npeacekeeping or police action.\n  Undoubtedly, Congress has the power to authorize the deployment to \nKosovo--or to set limits on that deployment. Congress could, as the \nByrd-Warner amendment clearly contemplates, cut off the funds, or \ncircumscribe the mission of the troops. But merely because Congress has \nthe power to do so, does not mean that it is wise to exercise that \npower in this circumstance, in this manner.\n  Mr. President, I would have no objection to a resolution authorizing \nthe deployment of U.S. forces. Let us have that debate. But I do not \nbelieve we should do so under the Sword of Damocles, with the threat of \na funding cut-off that implies the United States is abandoning its \nfriends and allies in Europe.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, the second aspect of Section \n2410 would codify burdensharing with our allies.\n  The bill would decrease by twenty-five percent the aid contributions \nby the United States to Kosovo unless the President certified to the \nCongress that the European Commission, the member states of the \nEuropean Union, and European members of NATO were meeting certain \ntargets for assistance expenditures and provision of civilian police in \nKosovo.\n  Specifically, the President would have to certify before July 15, \n2000 that the Europeans have:\n  First, obligated or contracted at least thirty-three percent of the \namount of the assistance that the aforementioned organizations and \ncountries committed to provide for 1999 and 2000 for reconstruction in \nKosovo;\n  Second, obligated or contracted for at least seventy-five percent of \nthe amount of humanitarian assistance to which they committed for 1999 \nand 2000;\n  Third, provided at least seventy-five percent of the amount of \nassistance to which they committed for the Kosovo Consolidated Budget \nfor 1999 and 2000; and\n  Fourth, deployed at least seventy-five percent of the number of \npolice, including special police, which they pledged to the United \nNations international police force for Kosovo.\n  Mr. President, because the United States carried the vast majority of \nthe military burden in last year's air campaign against Yugoslavia, it \nis now the Europeans' turn to provide most of the peacekeepers and the \nreconstruction money to win the peace in Kosovo.\n  Our allies agree with this formulation. Furthermore, Mr. President, \nthis is precisely what has already happened, and continues to happen.\n  Finally--after decades of criticizing and cajoling--we finally have \nbefore us an example of successful burden sharing in NATO and the \nUnited Nations.\n  What is the share of the burden that our NATO allies and other \ncountries are currently bearing?\n  The European Commission has already responded to this proposed \nlegislation by providing a considerable amount of data on assistance \nprograms that it administers. These data show that the European Union \nmeets or surpasses the criteria of the legislation.\n  Regarding individual countries, the European Commission is in the \nprocess of collecting data from the fifteen members states of the \nEuropean Union, each of which has unique budgeting procedures and \nfiscal years.\n  Utilizing data from the United Nations, however, we can already see \nthat, in the aggregate, our European partners are providing the \nmajority of assistance to Kosovo.\n  If we look at troop strength, our NATO allies have 40,000 troops on \nthe ground in Kosovo. We have 5,600. That is, the United States is \nproviding only thirteen percent of KFOR's troop strength.\n  If we look at the UNMIK Consolidated Budget, the Europeans and others \nare right now funding about eighty-seven percent of that. Our part, \nagain, comprises only thirteen percent of the total. So the benchmark \nlaid out in Section 2410 has already been exceeded.\n  How about the International Police? They are civilian police \nofficers, sent from U.N. member states all over the world, to relieve \nKFOR troops of non-military, law-and-order functions in Kosovo. That is \nthe plan. We all support it.\n  Fully eighty-eight percent of the pledges for civilian police for \nKosovo have come from outside the U.S., and eighty-seven percent of all \npolice officers pledged have already been deployed.\n  Now let's look at Reconstruction Funding. Concerning Europe's \nfinancial contributions to the reconstruction of\n\n[[Page S4079]]\n\nKosovo, Section 2410 focuses on the speed with which it delivers its \nassistance. When the United States commits funding for large-scale \nreconstruction initiatives, sometimes the U.S. itself does not hit the \nbenchmark set here--thirty-three percent obligated or contracted--for a \nyear or two.\n  Last, let's look at Humanitarian Relief. In the spring of this year, \nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees announced that \nhumanitarian disaster in Kosovo had been averted. The much-feared \nwinter had come and gone. It was time for the international community \nto switch from a relief role to a reconstruction role.\n  Nevertheless, Section 2410 insists that the Europeans continue to \nfunnel money into humanitarian relief, when the need is no longer \npressing. This is counterproductive micro-managing from thousands of \nmiles away.\n  Mr. President, the United States is not paying a disproportionate \nprice in the international effort to secure the peace in Kosovo--not in \nterms of the number of peacekeeping troops, not in terms of the number \nof civilian police, not in terms of reconstruction and humanitarian \naid.\n  Mr. President, Section 2410 also is inconsistent. It is really a \n``heads I win, tails you lose!'' for the Europeans.\n  The benchmarks in the first part of Section 2410 demand that the \nEuropeans pay more and/or faster and supply the bulk of the troops and \npolice in Kosovo. In the second part, though, the Congress mandates--\nirrespective of the Europeans' performance on the benchmarks--the \nenactment of a joint resolution to authorize the continued deployment \nof U.S. ground combat troops. The message to Europe boils down to this: \npay first, and then we'll see.\n  Aside from these internal contradictions in the legislation, Section \n2410 would do serious harm to our geopolitical interests, not only in \nthe Balkans, but in all of Europe. If the mandated burdensharing could \nnot be certified in every detail, the legislation would have one \nhundred percent of ground troops in Kosovo supplied by NATO allies and \nother non-American powers, leaving our contribution at zero with one \nexception: KFOR would remain under the ultimate control of the Supreme \nAllied Commander Europe, U.S. General Joseph Ralston. That would be \nquite a deal for us, but one which I doubt that our allies would \nsupport for long.\n  We all know that there are elements in NATO who argue for the need \nfor Europe to have its own ``army,'' independent of NATO. To date, the \noutline of the European Security and Defense Policy, or ESDP as it is \ncalled, has conformed to our wishes. It would only go into action if \nthe alliance as a whole chose not to be involved.\n  If the U.S. Congress were to compel the President of the United \nStates to unilaterally withdraw all U.S. combat troops from the NATO \nforce in Kosovo, you can rest assured that the Europeans would get the \nmessage that the ESDP is the wave of the future, not NATO. I can hear \nthe grumbling all over Western Europe: ``The French are right. We'd \nbetter have our own army, because we can't count on the U.S. in NATO \nany more.''\n  Do we really want this happen? I don't think so.\n  Irrespective of these considerations, I would ask the authors of this \nsection whether they really want to allow American military decisions \nto be made by other countries, in this case the Europeans? That would \nbe an abdication of responsibility that should horrify any Member of \nthis chamber.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let us consider the dynamic that Section 2410 \nwould set in motion. First of all, let's consider what it would mean in \nSerbia and Kosovo, on the ground. Make no mistake about it: the result \nof this bill, unless Section 2410 is eliminated, will be a U.S. \nwithdrawal from Kosovo. What Milosevic could not win on the \nbattlefield, he would be handed by Congressional trepidation.\n  If the indicted war criminal Milosevic knew that the U.S. Congress \nwas serious about abandoning Kosovo, his temptation to make mischief \nthere would be dramatically increased.\n  If percentage point differences in contributions made at conference \ntables would be enough to force the U.S. military out of Kosovo, then \nimagine what would be the effect of a few U.S. soldiers wounded or \nkilled by Serbian commandos!\n  Moreover, consideration of this amendment comes at a time of \nincreasing weakness of Milosevic.\n  Last night his goons occupied television station Studio B and \nindependent radio station B2-92, and padlocked the doors of other \nindependent media offices.\n  An opposition leader declared that Milosevic's government had \n``imposed an informal state of emergency.''\n  Is this the time that we want to give Milosevic even the slightest \nbit of comfort?\n  Does the U.S. military support Section 2410? No. Secretary of Defense \nCohen has said so, directly to its authors. Those who might support the \namendment in the alleged interest of staving off the ``hollowing out'' \nof our military readiness should ask of the Department of Defense: is \nSection 2410 a good idea for the U.S. military overall?\n  The answer is an unambiguous ``no!'' It would harm--not help--the \nreadiness of our armed forces for the rest of this fiscal year. If the \nPresident were unable to certify the meeting of the benchmarks, most of \nthe supplemental funding for the Department of Defense would be \nunavailable. That would, therefore, mean that the Military Services' \naccounts for maintenance and operation would not be replenished, since \nthey are currently being used to cover essential costs in Kosovo.\n  More broadly, the simple fact is that establishing security in the \nBalkans is squarely in the national interest of the United States. This \ncountry has a web of economic, political, security, cultural, and human \nties to Europe that is unmatched with any other part of the world. \nThanks to the patient, sustained, bipartisan policy of stationing \nmillions of American troops in Western Europe for more than a half-\ncentury and through our nuclear guarantee, the western half of the \ncontinent was able to democratize, heal old wounds, and eventually \nprosper.\n  But, Mr. President, the stability of Western Europe would be severely \nthreatened if war were to re-erupt in the Balkans--as it surely would \nif Western forces would withdraw. A study by the General Accounting \nOffice released yesterday made that clear.\n  Last year we got a taste of the massive refugee flows that war would \nunleash. And some of those refugees would wind up in Western Europe--in \nfact, many already have.\n  Mr. President, the United States is the unquestioned leader of NATO, \nand I believe it must remain the unquestioned leader. I do not think \nthat a leader can lead from the sidelines. To restrict our future \nparticipation in KFOR, or SFOR, to providing logistical and \nintelligence support would indicate to our allies that we were \nbeginning a more general withdrawal from the continent. The symbolism \nwould be unmistakable.\n  Incidentally, who would try to fill the vacuum left by the departure \nof American troops from Kosovo?\n  I urge my colleagues to recall that the Russians desperately wanted \ntheir own sector of Kosovo last summer. My guess is that they would \nhave their hand up in an instant to volunteer to replace us.\n  I do not want this legislation to be the first step in reversing the \nmost successful element in American foreign policy in the last fifty-\nfive years.\n  Mr. President, Section 2410 is an idea whose time not only has not \nyet come--it is an idea whose time, I fervently hope, will never come.\n  We won the war last year, and now our allies are carrying the lion's \nshare of the burden of winning the peace. We are on the right track. To \nrashly withdraw would invite further aggression by the Serbian dictator \nand gravely undermine the North Atlantic Alliance, the lynchpin of our \ntrans-Atlantic ties.\n  Instead of pursuing this self-destructive course, I urge my \ncolleagues to consider the approach taken by my friend from Ohio, \nSenator Voinovich. His resolution, S.Res. 272, which advocates a \ncoherent strategy for furthering American interests in the Balkans, was \npassed overwhelmingly by the Foreign Relations Committee last month. It \nwas passed by the full Senate just two weeks ago, on May second.\n  The Voinovich resolution advocates continued involvement in Kosovo \nand elsewhere in the Balkans, not the precipitous disengagement called \nfor in\n\n[[Page S4080]]\n\nSection 2410. It expresses the sense of the Senate that the United \nStates should remain actively engaged in southeastern Europe, continue \nto oppose Slobodan Milosevic, support the democratic opposition in \nSerbia, and fully implement the Stability Pact.\n  This is the course the United States is currently taking, and this is \nthe course we should pursue with renewed vigor in the future.\n  It will not be an easy struggle; nothing worth accomplishing ever is.\n  We will not achieve lasting stability in the Balkans overnight--\ncertainly we cannot expect to have achieved it less than a year after \nthe end of the air war.\n  But rashly to conclude that we should no longer be part of the \nsolution would be totally out of character for the United States of \nAmerica.\n  We are the leader of NATO. We are the indispensable factor in the \nEuropean security architecture.\n  We dare not sacrifice this position out of momentary frustration and \nimpatience.\n  So, let's get this straight.\n  If you believe that stability in the Balkans is not important to the \nU.S. and our own naked national interest, then vote with my good \nfriends Senators Byrd and Warner.\n  But, if you think, as I do, that it is virtually impossible to have \nchaos in the Balkans, affecting, if not engulfing, the likes of Bosnia-\nHerzegovina, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, even \nGreece and Turkey, while simultaneously maintaining stability in the \nrest of Europe, and at the same time developing a mature relationship \nwith the countries of the former Soviet Union--then, to paraphrase \nThomas Jefferson, who said ``If you expect to be both ignorant and \nfree, you are expecting what never was and never will be,'' I say that \nif you are expecting chaos in the Balkans and stability in the rest of \nEurope, you are expecting what never was and never will be.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Under the \nprevious order, the Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, may I say to my friend from Delaware, I have \na great deal of respect for him. He has had long experience on the \nForeign Relations Committee. And he is my friend. I just have to differ \nwith him on this occasion.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I respect that.\n  Mr. BYRD. He asked a question, Why don't we vote now? I have the \nanswer to that. It would be irresponsible to vote now to take the \ntroops out. My colleague, Senator Warner, and I are not saying take the \ntroops out. We are not saying we should withdraw the troops. Certainly, \nwe would not say vote now to take the troops out. That would be very \nirresponsible.\n  What we are trying to do is establish an orderly procedure, over a \nperiod of more than a year from now, at which time the President, the \nnew President, be it Mr. Gore or be it Mr. Bush, can come to the \nCongress and ask for authorization to continue the deployment of \nAmerican troops, if he can make the case, if there is justification for \nit.\n  There are those of us in the Senate today who are supporting this \namendment who, if that case is made, if a good case is made, a \npersuasive case is made--I do not assume I would vote against it. I \nmight vote for it. But we are trying to lay down an orderly process \nwhereby there will be plenty of time.\n  What we are trying to do is take back the authorities of the Congress \nwhich have been usurped by the administration. We have slept on our \nrights. I do not blame the administration; I blame the Congress. We \nhave slept on our rights. So we are not saying take the troops out. But \nwe do think it would be the wrong thing to attempt to vote to take the \ntroops out now. We don't say that. We do not even say take the troops \nout, period. We are saying let the next President justify the case for \nleaving them in after a certain date, if that be the circumstance.\n  Mr. President, it has become startlingly clear over the past several \ndays that the Clinton administration fiercely opposes the Byrd-Warner \nAmendment. Why does the administration fiercely oppose this amendment? \nThe amendment does not mandate the withdrawal of U.S. ground combat \ntroops from Kosovo. The amendment does not micromanage the Pentagon or \nthe State Department. What is the administration afraid of? The intent \nof the Byrd-Warner Amendment is to restore congressional oversight to \nthe Kosovo peacekeeping operation. Congress should have taken this step \nlong ago, but by not doing so, Congress has allowed, by its own \ninaction, the administration to usurp the Constitutional authority of \nCongress in this matter.\n  The administration would much prefer that Congress not interfere at \nthis late date with the continued usurpation of Congress' \nConstitutional prerogative and authority. No, the administration would \nmuch prefer Congress to keep quiet, roll over, play dead, or pretend to \nplay dead, while the administration continues to do whatever it wants \nto do in Kosovo, run up the costs of the operation, prepare for a long-\nterm stay there, and then send the bills to Congress for payment.\n  The position of the administration has been articulated most \nfervently by General Wesley Clark, the former Supreme Allied Commander \nof NATO troops in Europe. In a letter to Senator Levin, and in several \nmeetings with Senators this week, General Clark repeatedly made the \nargument that the Byrd-Warner amendment would undermine the confidence \nthat our European allies place in the U.S. commitment to NATO. Ha-ha, \nlisten to that. How ridiculous that the Byrd-Warner amendment would \nundermine the confidence that our European allies place in the U.S. \ncommitment to NATO. In less than two weeks, we will celebrate Memorial \nDay. We will remember, and honor, the 4,743,826 men who served in World \nWar I. We will mark the loss of the 53,513 men who lost their lives in \nbattle during that war, and the 63,195 uniformed men who also died, \nthough not in battle. We will honor the 204,002 men who were wounded in \nthat conflict, whose blood was spilled in those muddy trenches and \nacross those snowy hills.\n  We will also pay tribute to the 16,353,659 men who put on a uniform \nand served during World War II, a conflict that also started in Europe. \nSome 292,131 of those 16 million men died--died in battle during that \nbloody war, and another 115,185 died while serving in that war. Another \n671,876 were wounded in all theaters. American blood has soaked \nEuropean ground--the ground cries out--and saved European lives. Then \nto say that the passage of this amendment would cause the Europeans to \nlose trust in the Americans--how silly, how perfectly ridiculous that \nthat would be said.\n  That is the U.S. commitment to NATO, and to our European allies. Our \ncommitment lies under European sod, under poppy-covered fields marked \nwith endless rows of white crosses. Our blood is our bond. What more \ncane they ask? It is preposterous for General Clark or the \nadministration to suggest that the Byrd-Warner amendment could \nundermine that bond. How silly, how utterly ridiculous.\n  Asking our European allies to meet their commitments in Kosovo, while \nwe continue to shoulder the burden of intelligence collection, \ntransportation, and other critical support roles for which we are \nuniquely equipped, is not walking away from NATO. It is not walking \naway from Europe. The Byrd-Warner amendment assumes that the \nadministration can come up with a supportable case for continued U.S. \ninvolvement in Kosovo if necessary. It might be Mr. Gore. It might be \nMr. Bush. But we assume that they can come up with a justifiable case \nif they think they have a case.\n\n  The Byrd-Warner amendment does not assume that the United States will \nwithdraw from Kosovo. We do not assume that at all. That is simply the \nlogical conclusion of but one path this debate might take. The other \npath is that the administration will present, and defend, a plan--\nwhatever administration it is--by next year for continued U.S. \ninvolvement in Kosovo that the Congress and the American people can \nsupport. We assume they can. But let them do it. Then our troops, our \nmilitary establishment, our allies, and others in the region, will \nunderstand the depth of support for this mission in the United States.\n  One of the primary aims of the Byrd-Warner provision is to get the \nadministration and the next administration, be\n\n[[Page S4081]]\n\nit Democratic or Republican, to focus on a policy.\n  I have asked this administration for an exit strategy. I cannot get \nan answer. I have asked for a rough estimate, within 2 years, of how \nlong we expect ground troops to remain in Kosovo. I cannot get an \nanswer. I have asked this administration for an estimate of the \nultimate cost of this operation to the American taxpayer. I cannot get \nan answer.\n  As far as I can tell, we are on mission ``Ad Hoc'' in Kosovo, with \nnobody in the entire executive branch in Washington or elsewhere, able \nto give this Senator and the American people answers to the most basic \nquestions regarding the scope, costs or foreseeable end of the mission.\n  I cannot even get anyone to tell me how we will know when it is time \nto leave? How will we know when it is time to leave?\n  Talk about open ended commitments! This endeavor does not even have \nwalls, much less ceilings or floors.\n  Now we are being told by the Office of Management and Budget that the \nadministration cannot provide assurances that the certification of \nallied effort required by the Byrd-Warner amendment will be met by the \ndue date of July 15. The problem? I quote from the statement of \nadministration policy. Here is the problem: ``mechanical formulas and \nrecordkeeping technicalities.'' I realize that this administration has \nhad its share of recordkeeping problems, but I find it difficult to \nbelieve they cannot do the simple arithmetic--the old math or the new \nmath--this provision requires.\n  The administration itself acknowledges that the allies are already \nexceeding their commitments for humanitarian assistance and for the \nKosovo consolidated budget. Further, according to the administration's \nreckoning, the allies have already deployed 63 percent of the civilian \npolice that they have promised. No, they have not yet met the 75 \npercent benchmark, but Spain is expected to deploy 115 additional \npolice in June, and great Britain recently announced that it will \ndeploy an additional 57 police by the end of May, which would boost the \ntotal to over 75 percent.\n  Given the allies' poor track record in the area, I think we should \nhold their feet to the fire on the 75 percent standard. It is \nachievable. If the allies balk at coming up with 158 additional \npolicemen, Congress and the American people should know and should know \nthe reason why. And we should know the reason before we pay out the \nfinal installment of the $2 billion in military costs funded in this \nbill that the U.S. has incurred in Kosovo this year.\n  The administration also contends that the allies will not be able to \ncome up with 33 percent of their promised reconstruction assistance. \nThe changes that we intend to make to this provision--Senator Stevens \nand I confer if we are not allowed to make them on the floor--will take \ncare of that problem. We will drop that requirement to 25 percent. \nAccording to the National Security Council, which apparently can do the \narithmetic, the allies are currently at 23.1 percent. I have every \nconfidence that they can come up with the remaining 1.9 percent by July \n15. Mr. President, the purpose of including the certification \nbenchmarks in this provision was to give the United States leverage to \ndemand that our allies live up to their commitments. Our intention is \nfor these requirements to be used as a prod, not a battering ram. We \nwant the allies to meet these requirements. But if for some reason they \ncannot, we have included a safety valve--a vote under expedited \nprocedures to release the money being held in reserve to continue the \ndeployment of U.S. forces in Kosovo. It is not now, nor was it ever, \nthe intention of Senator Warner or me to force a withdrawal of U.S. \ntroops from Kosovo in July.\n  Our intention is very simple: To do right by the Constitution, to do \nright by the American people, and to do right by the men and women in \nuniform that we send into harm's way in operations like the one in \nKosovo.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia engage in a colloquy with me because I am very interested in \nhis remarks. I have the highest respect for his efforts in this body, \nand I listened closely to what he had to say.\n  I believe there has been a lot of misunderstanding or \nmisinterpretation or misinformation about what is in this legislation. \nPerhaps this was not the best place to put this language, but certainly \nthe timing is propitious. This issue is upon us.\n  Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, two of the most respected Senators \nin this body and senior members on the Appropriations Committee--\nSenator Stevens is obviously very much interested in the condition of \nour military troops, what they are doing, and where they are, and the \nsame is true with Senator Byrd. Maybe it is an oversimplification, but \nas I understand it, the Byrd-Warner language will really do two things: \nOne, say the President should certify to the Congress by this summer--\nthe exact day is July 15?\n  Mr. BYRD. We can adjust that date.\n  Mr. LOTT. By a reasonable date this summer that our allies are \nfulfilling their commitments, one. And two, that by July 1 or October 1 \nof next year, the Congress would have to authorize the continuation of \nground combat troops in Kosovo; is that basically it?\n  Mr. BYRD. That is correct. We would continue our air support, our \nlogistical support, and our intelligence support. We would merely \nwithdraw the ground troops, but we would only withdraw them in the \nevent the President did not ask for authorization to continue the \ndeployment, and in the event he asked and Congress voted no. Otherwise, \nthey will be there.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will allow me to ask another \nquestion----\n  Mr. BYRD. May I say further, what is wrong with that?\n  Mr. LOTT. I do not think there is anything wrong with that.\n  Mr. BYRD. What is wrong with that?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am going to support it.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am not directing the question to the majority leader. \nWhat is wrong with that? We would expect the President, Republican or \nDemocrat, to come up here to make his case if he wants to continue, if \nhe believes there is justification to continue the deployment. He \nshould come here. That is what we want. We want the administration to \ncome here and request authorization and to justify that authorization. \nIf he does that, Congress then will vote up or down. What is wrong with \nthat?\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield just so we keep things in order? It \nis my understanding he is taking time allotted to Senator Roberts.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe Senator Byrd's time has expired. I ask to use the \ntime designated for Senator Roberts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is being so charged.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know Senator Hollings is wishing to speak on this. I do \nnot intend to use the full time, but we have an expert on this subject.\n  Mr. REID. Pardon the interruption, I wanted to make sure people \nunderstood.\n  Mr. LOTT. For the people watching, you have made the point, and I \nhave made the point, that what this requires is for Congress to do its \njob to fulfill our responsibility, that while the President clearly has \na role--this is not aimed as a criticism of this President or as a \nhalter on the next President--it is for the Congress, for the Senate to \nstep up to its responsibilities.\n  I believe the responsibilities you have cited are constitutional. I \nalso believe we have the War Powers Act on the books.\n  Would the Senator take a moment to talk about those constitutional \nand other legal requirements that suggest we should act in this area?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I know that the distinguished Senator from \nSouth Carolina badly needs to make another appointment.\n  May I say to the distinguished majority leader that I intend, in my \nspeech tomorrow, to lay out in full the constitutional requirements. I \nintend to respond to his question at that time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will just take a few minutes to say that I \nthought a good bit about this issue--both Kosovo and the Byrd-Warner \nlanguage. I have not been quick to make a final judgment or to make \ncomments, but I have concluded that this is the right thing to do. I \nwant to emphasize, again, I say that knowing full well that the \nPresident has problems with it. I\n\n[[Page S4082]]\n\nthink they are overreacting to what is in this language.\n  Mr. BYRD. They are hysterical.\n  Mr. LOTT. Now our candidate for the nomination, our presumptive \nnominee, has said he is concerned about Presidential prerogatives. I \nunderstand. All Presidential candidates and Presidents worry about \nthat.\n  But we have a responsibility here, too. What about the prerogatives, \nwhat about the responsibility of the Congress? I think the American \npeople want to know what is going on. They are unaware, really, of what \nis going on and not asking about it. They are not really aware of the \ncommitment we have there. They don't really know that perhaps our \nallies are not fulfilling their commitments. They have not done it in \nterms of personnel or money. And why is because they do not have to. \nThey know Uncle Sam will take care of this problem.\n  I had occasion to meet with the President of one of our ally \ncountries. I said: Why aren't you fulfilling your commitment? Why don't \nyou do more? Why don't you do what you said you were going to do? Only \nafter a brief silence, he said: You are the world leader. You are the \nonly surviving power. It is your responsibility.\n  That is kind of the attitude, frankly, of some of our allies--yes, \nyou are the big guy. You have to take care of it. Yes, it is in our \nbackyard. This is supposed to be a peacekeeping initiative. But you \nwill handle it. We don't have to do that.\n\n  In their defense, to be honest, I think because of Senator Warner's \nefforts, and others, because of complaints I made to some of our \nallies, they are beginning to do a better job.\n  I believe the President will be able to meet this certification. But \nI think it is important that our allies in NATO do what they say they \nwere going to do. I am hesitant for us to even reduce the requirements \nof what they should have to do.\n  But I tell you what is really bothering me. We wonder, how long are \nwe going to stay there? We have been in some parts of the world for 50 \nyears. We have been sending troops now to every little place imaginable \naround the world. There is no end in sight in Bosnia; no end in sight \nin Kosovo; no plan, no end game. We do not know what is going to be the \nfinal outcome. We are just there. Then each year this administration, \nand the next administration--Democrat or Republican--will show up and \nsay: Sorry, we had this problem. We had to spend the money. We spent $1 \nbillion. We spent $1.5 billion in Kosovo, not to mention what we are \nspending in Bosnia. We had to take it out of other defense accounts, \nO, operation and maintenance--very important things--and now you have \nto give us the money, because if you don't give us the money, then we \nare not going to be supporting our troops.\n  Then we are in a bind, without any real accountability, without \nhaving input, without voting to authorize it, without knowing what the \nend game is--without anything. Then we just ante up the money. You are \nnot talking chicken feed. You are talking a lot of money. We have to \nstop that.\n  I noted what Senator Byrd said. And I would say, for myself, when the \nvote comes to authorize it, I think we would be hard pressed not to \nauthorize keeping troops there. Certainly we would be for the support \nof troops.\n  But if the case was made, if we knew what we were getting into, we \nknew how much it was going to cost, how long it was going to last, I \nthink that a persuasive case would be made. And I have not made up my \nmind how I would vote. I want to see what it is.\n  But that is not where we are now. People are saying: You are taking \naction now. You are going to have these difficult problems on your \nhands next year. That is one of the reasons why I want to deal with it \nnow. I want us to make sure everybody understands we have to have an \naccounting; we have to have a plan.\n  We cannot put our men, our women, our ships, our planes in every \ncorner of this world indefinitely with no plan. We are still dealing \nwith Iraq. We probably had sorties today. We probably bombed somebody, \nwhile we are counting on them to produce 700 million barrels of oil for \nus, I guess it is. The hypocrisy of it bothers me, too.\n  I know it is expected that the majority leader of the Senate would \nautomatically just say: No, we can't have this out of the \nAppropriations Committee. We don't want to tie the hands of the next \nPresident. It could be a President from your party.\n  That really offends me. This is bigger than that. I believe some of \nthe comments that have been made questions the integrity, the \npatriotism of the sponsors of this legislation. I think that is totally \ninappropriate. They would not do that.\n  So as for myself, unless there is something dramatic that changes, I \nplan to support this language. I urge my colleagues to take a look at \nwhat is really in it. Do not be misguided by incorrect information that \nis being put out there. Ask yourself: Are you satisfied with the \nsituation in Kosovo? I think the answer is no.\n  So I thank the two sponsors of this legislation. I hope the language \nstays in the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished leader, who came \nto this body following an earlier distinguished career in the House, is \nhe aware of the overwhelming vote in the House today for basically the \nprinciples that are incorporated in the Byrd-Warner amendment? The vote \nwas 264 to 140-some, something along in there.\n  I think that is a clear indication that the people in the United \nStates of America want, first, participation by the coequal branch, \ni.e., the Congress; and, secondly, for us to address this matter in a \nresponsible way before we shovel out $2 billion more for this type of \noperation.\n  Mr. LOTT. I certainly agree. I have found, as I have gone to my own \nState and other States, that when people find out what we are doing \nthere--the commitment we have there in terms of the facilities and the \ntroops involved, and how much it is costing; and the fact that we have \nnever voted to authorize; we do not know where we are headed, how long \nit is going to take, how much it is going to cost, what the plan is--\nthey are horrified. They basically look at me--and I can see it in \ntheir eyes-- and they are thinking: What are you going to do about it?\n  It is our responsibility.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is right.\n  Mr. President, their voices, the people's voices, were heard through \nthis House vote today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Right. I agree.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished leader for his support. I thank \nour dear colleague from West Virginia who, year after year after year, \ncomes to this floor and reminds the Senate of its responsibilities in \nforeign affairs. This is precisely what is before us in this vote.\n  Mr. BYRD. Right.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nSouth Carolina is recognized for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I commend our distinguished chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Warner, and my distinguished \nleader, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, on this initiative.\n  You learn through experience. We had bitter experiences, as \npoliticians, on the floor of the Senate during the war in Vietnam.\n  Someone tells me that the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, has taken \nexception to this particular amendment. I could only say to my \ndistinguished colleague from Arizona that I feel very keenly, if I knew \nin 1966 what I know now about Vietnam, I could have saved or \nparticipated, let's say, in the saving of at least 40,000 of the 58,000 \nlives we lost.\n  It took McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, almost 25 years to admit \nit was a mistake. And the question arises in my mind as to how long it \nis going to take us to acknowledge that this, too, is a mistake. Mind \nyou me, I am not for withdrawal. I think this is a deliberate \ninitiative, well considered, and deserves strong support. Otherwise, I \nam 100 percent for the troops wherever they are.\n  The record will show that the last $500 million that had to be \nappropriated at the request of a general for Vietnam was made on the \nmotion from the Senator from South Carolina. But I visited with those \ntroops. I have seen, in a very short period, certain disturbing things \nin Kosovo. And to watch my friend, the Senator from Delaware,\n\n[[Page S4083]]\n\ndignify this mistake, and all the spurious arguments made, is almost \namusing, in the sense that one of the things he says is ``to wish for a \nnation to be both ignorant and free, wishing for a nation that never \nwas and never can be''--quoting Thomas Jefferson. He says if you look \nfor Europe to be both Balkan and stable, it is wishing for something \nthat never was and never can be.\n  I happen to agree, Mr. President. That is what disturbs the Senator \nfrom South Carolina with the positioning of troops who are there for \nbattle and not as a police force. We are really ruining the morale of \nour troops in this kind of commitment, not following through. They were \nsupposed to have been out in a year's period, gone from any kind of \nmilitary deployment, and we were supposed to have had the substitution, \nof course, of the police force and the allies. It is a very weak \nalliance that has not put up the money. The chaos grows by day and the \ndanger is in the morning paper.\n  We have five sectors in Kosovo. You learn very quickly that the \nRussians are not supportive, and that is why we don't have the police \nforce. You learn from the briefings that the Greeks are not for this \nparticular deployment. The French, comme ci, comme ca. It is intimated \neven by the Senator from Delaware that they are not in support. I asked \nthe Brits in London later about their withdrawal of a certain area and \nthey said they were too stretched. But more ominously, you will find on \npage A-18 of the Washington Post this morning an article entitled \n``Russia Strengthens Yugoslav Ties.'' It says:\n\n       At the end of the two-day visit in Moscow today, Yugoslav \n     Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic praised ``cooperation\" \n     between the two countries. Russia granted Belgrade a $102 \n     million loan and announced the sale of $32 million worth of \n     oil to Yugoslavia. The loan comes at a time when the \n     International Monetary Fund, whose activities are \n     underwritten by U.S. taxpayers, is considering resumption of \n     loans to Russia.\n       . . . Putin's policy is consistent with Russian sentiment \n     toward Yugoslavia. Moscow opposed the war, considered the \n     NATO bombing campaign illegal because it was initiated \n     without the specific approval of the Security Council, where \n     Russia holds a veto. Moscow views the war crimes accusations \n     against Belgrade as politically motivated.\n\n  That is what the distinguished Senator from Delaware was trying to \ndignify. They called it the fifth column in the war with Spain. We have \nfifth columns, as I can see it, militarily deployed in three sectors. \nRussian troops take a man from Moscow, and while we can't get our own \nweak alliance to respond and come up with a police force to keep law \nand order, we find Russians can get hundreds of millions of dollars \nhere to support Milosevic. This is a good deployment? I see a mistake. \nI will never forget there was a mistake in diplomacy. There isn't any \nquestion about it. I will never forget. I will quote what our friend, \nHenry Kissinger, said:\n\n       Rambouillet was not a negotiation--as is often claimed--but \n     an ultimatum. This marked an astounding departure for an \n     administration that had entered office proclaiming its \n     devotion to the U.N. Charter and multilateral procedures.\n\n  I could read further, but there is no question that what we have is \nnot statecraft, but a mistake in a military plan. There isn't any \nquestion that they don't want to admit it publicly, but the Secretary \nof State thought Milosevic would cry uncle in 3 days. We didn't have \nany military plan to take over. In order to try to backstop some kind \nof support and say this is serious, and it is not a mistake--``ethnic \ncleansing, ethnic cleansing, ethnic cleansing''--they tried to equate \nthis with the holocaust. Come, come. We got briefed at the time. There \nwere 100,000 Albanians living peacefully in Belgrade, where Milosevic \nwas also living. This wasn't ethnic cleansing in the sense of a \nholocaust--to find a person of a particular race or religion and \neliminate them. They weren't getting along.\n  Thank heavens we didn't send Madeleine Albright to Northern Ireland; \nwe sent Senator Mitchell. He knows that in order to get persons and \npopulations with differences together, it takes long, hard work, and no \nultimatum. If we had sent the Secretary of State, she would have said \nyou either agree to do this by 12 o'clock tomorrow, or we are going to \nstart bombing you. So we got caught without a military plan. There \nweren't any grand troops ready--even to come from Germany at the \nparticular time.\n  Let's say Milosevic didn't like the majority group down in Kosovo. We \nhad all kinds of briefings to the effect that the differences were \nexacerbating, as they say, and what happened was they would kill a Serb \npolice on the corner and then Milosevic would come and burn out the \nentire block, and that kind of thing. But when we started the bombing, \nwe declared this a war zone. Brother, when you have a war zone, you \nhave a right, title, and interest to clear the enemy.\n  So immediately Milosevic went to work, and that is what led to the \nmillion refugees spilling over the borders into Albania, Macedonia, \ninto Montenegro, and anywhere they could. That was another mistake. \nThere was a mistake, of course, when they called this a \n``peacekeeping'' because there wasn't any peace agreement.\n  The brass in Kosovo, including the four-star general, General Shelton \ntold me what happened. The Joint Chiefs resent me saying this, but what \nhappened is that both sides ran out of targets. Milosevic had already \ncleared the area on the one hand, and we had run out of targets down in \nKosovo. So we have peacekeeping troops there when there is no peace \nagreement. What happens? All we have to refer to is what others have \nsaid, not just what I saw. What I saw was highly disturbing--our \nAmerican military deployed and a hunkered down containment.\n  They took us to a little town with a population of about 67,000 \npeople. We were in the city. But we were guarding a block with Serbs, \nincluding a few families there. We had a GI at one end, a GI at the \nother end, and one GI in the middle to take them to the shopping \nmarket. They had that many more Serbs. So they took convoys of them up \nto Belgrade to shop. Is this peacekeeping?\n  The columnist said:\n\n       The war has done nothing to bring the two sides together. \n     On the contrary, it has intensified ancient animosities.\n\n  What do they say in the Washington Post? Michael Kelly says:\n\n       How safe is Kosovo, how secure? Safer and more secure than \n     it was a year ago, but still, in any real terms, not safe, \n     not secure and becoming less so all the time.\n       Human rights abuses and serious crimes continue to be \n     committed at an alarming rate, particularly against members \n     of minority communities, with virtual immunity.\n\n  I was briefed to the effect that it was 95 percent Albanian.\n  Let me quote further:\n\n       Meanwhile, as predicted, members of the theoretically \n     disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army have emerged as leaders of a \n     criminal mobocracy that is the real power on the streets.\n\n  That is who is keeping the peace--the KLA, and mobocracy rules the \nstreets.\n  What did the GAO say? This past weekend, they gave the report to the \nArmed Services Committee.\n\n       . . . little progress had been made toward creating \n     peaceful, democratic governments committed to political and \n     ethic reconciliation.\n       . . . the former warring parties largely retain their \n     wartime goals.\n\n  We haven't achieved peace.\n  Quoting further:\n\n       . . . it also criticized the United Nations for failing to \n     provide needed resources, particularly in Kosovo where an \n     international police force has been slow to get off the \n     ground.\n       ``. . . an escalation of violent incidents or armed \n     conflict'' over the next five years, not just in Bosnia and \n     Kosovo, but also in Macedonia and in the two remaining \n     republics of the former Yugoslavia, Montenegro as well as \n     Serbia.\n\n  We deployed American GIs in the middle of that mess, and they don't \nwant to even discuss it. They don't want to bring it to a head. Senator \nWarner and Senator Byrd want to bring it to a head.\n  Let's develop some sort of policy because we have a nonpolicy \nsituation.\n  We have no real support from the allies, as I pointed out. The main \nthing is that the Russians are all deployed all around and are giving \nsupport to Milosevic. Of course, Milosevic is strengthened in Europe.\n  We heard from General Clark about how the Europeans felt so safe--not \nat all.\n  They had a very interesting story in Time magazine a month ago \nwhereby Vaclav Havel had befriended his former Czech native, Secretary \nAlbright, our Secretary of State. He wished for her to succeed him as \nthe President of the Czech Republic. The only problem is\n\n[[Page S4084]]\n\nthat 75 percent of the people in the Czech Republic are opposed to \n``Madeleine's War.''\n  This has been a mistake--in diplomacy, in military deployment, in \npeacekeeping, in getting up the support, and everything else. It hurts \nthe Fed's policy. It hurts foreign policy.\n  We have a group going to Moscow at the end of this month that will \nprobably call on President Putin. I don't have the unmitigated gall to \nmention to President Putin about Chechnya. ``Here, here,'' he would \nsay, ``Senator, your country invaded the sovereign country of \nYugoslavia and Kosovo without a United Nations resolution, and on your \nown you just took over and started bombing because they wouldn't agree, \nand you are asking us about Chechnya?'' What kind of foreign policy do \nwe have?\n\n  What kind of Kosovo policy do we have? What kind of military policy \ndo we have? When are we going to admit that this is a mistake.\n  Secretary Albright says we are going to rebuild the infrastructure, \nand after we get the churches, the roads, the airports, the schools, \nand the hospitals reconstructed, and the industries, people will go to \nwork, and they will hug and love each other.\n  Well, we have had 30 years of that in Ireland. From the time I met \nMartin Agronsky in a restaurant, as he came out after a 3-week visit in \nLondon, he said they would never get together for 30 years. And he was \nright. I have been to Northern Ireland. They have the hospitals, the \nroads, the airports, and the infrastructure, and they are not hugging \nand loving yet.\n  Apparently, according to the Senator from Delaware, a stable Europe \nor a stable Balkans was never and never will be.\n  I don't think this is the proper military deployment. We have to \nbring this to a head and acknowledge the mistake we made, and do the \nbest we can. The best we can is to follow the Warner-Byrd resolution \nwhereby we have the people behind us.\n  I will make one political comment. Governor Bush wandered aimlessly \ninto this debate yesterday. If I were the President of the United \nStates, I would never want troops committed in a deliberate fashion as \nthese were without the support of the American Congress, the American \npeople, and the Senate.\n  I would not want them to give me a basket case, if I were elected \nPresident. But I would want, by gosh, some requirement that we look at \nit in an objective fashion, and consider my military, my foreign policy \nadvisers, and look at what was on the ground to see if it was \nworsening, as it is today.\n  We keep saying we are going to get rid of Saddam Hussein, Milosevic \nis going to fall, and Castro is going to disappear. When will we ever \nlearn?\n  The Warner-Byrd resolution helps us to begin to learn so we can \nactually discuss this in an intelligent fashion.\n  The arrogance of America came out markedly in the comments of the \nSenator from Delaware--that were it not for Americans none of this \ncould happen; not at all. I hope they get a European defense force. I \nhope they take over.\n  I voted in 1971, before the Senator from Delaware came here, to cut \nthe troops in Germany back to 5,000. That was the Mansfield amendment.\n  Let's not say we are responsible for everything and anywhere, and \nthat it only can happen with us.\n  I think they are going to have to take over. I think when they take \nover it will be dealt with properly.\n  I, again, thank the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, while our distinguished colleague is here, \nand on my time, I would like to say that he has followed this matter \nfor some time. He was on the Appropriations Committee at the time this \namendment was voted into the bill. My recollection is that 23 Senators \nvoted to put it in. Am I not correct?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is exactly right; overwhelming majority.\n  Mr. WARNER. Three opposed and two abstained.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Showing that the full committee of the Senate \nappropriations gave overwhelming support to this amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is right, though we are really debating the \namendment of the Senator from Virginia. We knew, and we could see it. \nWe went into the different parts of that debate. To get down to all of \nthese extraneous things my friend from Delaware brings out is not the \npoint at all. We are not trying to send a message to Milosevic. We are \ntrying to send a message to ourselves; to our policy; send a message to \nthe GIs out there that is not willy-nilly. General Clark said only \nyesterday that it could be 5 years. Come on.\n  Does he think we will keep America's GIs out there in Kosovo 5 years?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is precisely why, when I visited the region in \nJanuary of this year--I try to go every 6 months or every several \nmonths. The officials told me, the U.N., the E.U., all of them said: \nSenator, if they just keep the money flowing and the police flowing, \nthen eventually we can get some timetable for the withdrawal not only \nof U.S. forces but other military forces and turn it over to a civil \nsociety to operate itself with such security as needed along the \nborders.\n  We are not pulling out. We are 100 or so miles away for some of our \ntroops in the NATO installations. The sky is not falling in.\n  The Senator raises a key point. For General Clark to come up and say, \nin effect, that if we take out just the U.S. combat troops--again, \nleaving 100,000 in NATO, just a short distance away--Milosevic would \nread that as a signal and come charging across the borders--what does \nthat say to the other allies? There are 32 nations providing armed \nforces in the KFOR force of a total in excess of 40,000. It says ``You \ndon't count.''\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly. And the timing of this, just when we were \nassuring Russia that NATO was a purely defensive force, we were \nadmitting three new countries. We destroyed the overall policy. This \nwas a mistake from the word go and they don't want to try to explain \nit; they are embarrassed to do so.\n  But the Senator and I can bring it to a head and we can develop a \npolicy. They are running around politicking and traveling the world. \nBut we have a serious commitment, and I don't want to have any GIs \nhunkered down there and afraid to walk on the streets, with the KLA in \ncharge. Meanwhile, we are sitting back here thinking this is a \nwonderful commitment and America is keeping NATO together. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. We have got the \nattention of the Senate now. We have a debate that will last 10 hours, \nwell into tonight and tomorrow.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I commend the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield my time to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is no need to yield. Following him, \nI think Senator Hutchison of Texas, and then the Senator and I will \nhave a debate well into the evening, I expect.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I look forward to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Michigan for yielding his time.\n  First, there are no more respected and trusted Members of the Senate \nthan Senator Warner and Senator Byrd. When one approaches their \namendment and their language with respect to Kosovo, it is with a \nposition of both, as I mentioned, trust and respect.\n  However, after examining the amendment, I must disagree with their \nconclusion and the amendment. Let me also say by way of an aside, I \ncertainly do support the underlying provisions of the military \nconstruction appropriations bill and I commend both Senator Burns and \nSenator Murray for all their hard work.\n  As I indicated, I am concerned about the amendment offered by my \ncolleagues, Senator Byrd and Senator Warner. The Byrd-Warner amendment \nprovides for several things. First, section 2410 of the bill would \nprohibit the expenditure of funds for the continued deployment of \nground troops after July 1, 2001, unless the President seeks and \nsecures congressional authorization to continue the deployment beyond \nthat date.\n\n[[Page S4085]]\n\n  This, I think, is one of the more central parts of their amendment. \nEssentially, it says our troops will come out by July 2001 unless the \nCongress acts affirmatively to keep them there.\n  There has been some discussion throughout this debate about \nsenatorial prerogative and roles of the Senate in forging policy with \nrespect to deployment of our troops. I don't believe this debate is \nultimately about, or should be about, senatorial prerogatives. It is \nquite clear, given the power of the purse, we can compel the extraction \nof our forces by simply cutting off the funds. That principle is clear. \nWhat is at stake here is the consequences of such an action, whether \nsuch an action would inure to our benefit or whether it would be a \ncostly error. I believe it would not inure to our benefit. I believe \nthe consequences would be detrimental not only to our position in the \nworld, our position in NATO, but ultimately to the position of our \nforces within Kosovo.\n  Let me suggest what I believe to be the consequences of the passage \nof this amendment. It would signal to those forces both within the \nAlbanian Kosovars and the Serbian Kosovars that our commitment to \nstaying in Kosovo is limited to a year. As a result, they will, for \ntheir own protection and also to advance their own particular plans \nafter our departure, begin to rearm, begin to become much more \nprovocative, begin to assault each other.\n  Frankly, given the imbalance of population and forces within Kosovo, \nit is more likely that the Albanian Kosovars will try to seek a final \nremedy by displacement of Serbians out of Kosovo before, in their view, \nthe departure of the summit forces, which would likely be accompanied \nby significant reduction, or certainly a diminution, of the \ninternational commitment to Kosovo.\n  With this combination, we are creating a very destabilizing situation \nwithin Kosovo. That destabilized situation would, I think, jeopardize \nthe safety of our forces there. As a result, we would have a situation \nwhere we were injecting the kind of uncertainty, the kind of \ninstability, that would, I think, blow up in our faces in terms of our \ntroops.\n  I mention what the Albanian Kosovars might do. I think Milosevic, \nbeing shrewd, clever, and unyielding, would seek to regain through this \naction what he lost on the battlefield, would continue to accelerate \nthe introduction of his forces back into Kosovo in the guise of \ncivilians; would begin, if he could, to circumvent embargoes on weapons \nto bring weapons in, setting the stage for violence, for acceleration \nof violence, which I think inevitably would touch our troops.\n  Finally, if one is sitting back and watching these developments from \nwithin Kosovo, and one is expecting a vote of this Congress with \nrespect to whether our troops will stay or they will go, one might \nconclude or deduce, based upon recent history, that the quickest way to \naccelerate our departure is to harm our troops. That is one lesson, \nperhaps imprecise, but one lesson of Somalia. When American forces, \nwith overwhelming firepower, confronted basically tribal forces armed \nwith AK-47s and RPGs, we were staying the course until tragically we \nlost two helicopters and a number of Army rangers and Army personnel, \nand then quickly we were through. We don't know if that is the lesson \nthe leadership in Kosovo would draw, but certainly it is plausible.\n  As a result, as we spin out these consequences, the requirement \nwithin this amendment to withdraw, unless there is congressional \napproval, sets in motion a chain of events which I think will not lead \nto stability, will not lead to an environment of peace and tranquility, \nor at least minimize violence, but could very well unwittingly, \nunconsciously--and certainly this is not the intent of anyone here \nparticularly--lead to more violence, more instability, which perhaps \nwould force us to withdraw for political reasons long before we could \never sit down and have a vote in this Senate and in the other body on \nwhether we should continue our presence in Kosovo. Essentially, what we \nare doing here today, as I mentioned, is not charting the prerogatives \nof the Senate but trying to assess the consequences of what we will do, \ntrying to look ahead and not to the rear. One could come here, and I \nthink should come here, and question how we got into Kosovo, how we \nwere consulted by the White House. Many of these questions are \nlegitimate. Many of these questions have been raised many other times \non this floor. But today we should be looking ahead. As we look ahead, \nI think the consequences of this act would be detrimental rather than \nhelpful to our international position and to the safety of our forces \non the ground.\n\n  There is a second provision, and that provision is to develop a plan \nto shift responsibility for providing ground forces to European nations \nby July 1, 2001. Again, I do not believe there is anyone in this body \nwho would question the central role that Europe must play in securing \nthe peace, not just in Kosovo but in the entire Balkans. So the plan \nfor the organized shift of responsibilities is sensible. Certainly I \napprove of this. I do not think anyone disapproves of it.\n  There is a final proviso and that is withholding 25 percent of the \nfiscal year 2000 supplemental funds unless the White House certifies \nthat European allies are paying their promised share of reconstruction \nand humanitarian assistance. Again, no one can question or argue that \nthe Europeans should do more, should do their share. Whether or not \nthis amendment would prompt them to do that is another question. But \nthis is an element of the amendment that I believe certainly engenders \nthe kind of debate, and we hope pressure, political and otherwise, that \nwould require the Europeans to pay their share, to carry their load, to \nrespond to a crisis that is in their backyard and not in our backyard.\n  All of these elements together--but most particularly the first \nelement, the deadline for withdrawal if there is no approving vote by \nthe Congress of the United States--are troubling and will, as I \nsuggested, set in motion a series of events that could not only \ndestabilize our position but force us to pull out, not in an organized \nway but in quite a disorganized way.\n  We all are concerned about what appears to be an open-ended \ncommitment. I do not believe this is the way to respond to that \nconcern. Perhaps there is no good way to respond to that concern. \nPerhaps the only way to do so is to begin to work with our allies so, \non a programmed, planned basis, we can substitute additional U.S. \nforces with European forces. Perhaps it is by working with the United \nNations to see that they back up their words with real resources, real \ndollars, so they can begin the reconstruction, and also to work with \nthe European Community so they can do the same in terms of their \ncommitments; also to begin to work with international groups, the \nUnited Nations and others, to develop the capacity to have available \nreal police forces, not those who have been trained to patrol the \nreasonably serene streets of metropolitan areas in the United States \nand Canada and elsewhere, but those police forces that are trained for \nthis type of almost paramilitary operation.\n  Those steps take time. But that is a way to address this issue of an \nopen-ended commitment of our military forces. It is an issue we must \naddress because, regardless of what we do with respect to Kosovo, we \nhave similar challenges in East Timor and other places that require the \nsame kind of international humanitarian and reconstructive aid, as well \nas international police forces.\n  There is another issue that emanates from this amendment, and that is \nthe message we are sending to our allies about our participation in an \ninternational effort. We are in Kosovo because, not only are we a \nmember of NATO, we are the leader of NATO. Our allies have joined us in \nthis effort. This is not a unilateral American response to a problem. \nThis is an international response with our allies through the mechanism \nof NATO. Indeed, I believe if we are signaling our response is \nweakening, that signal will be taken very badly by our allies in Europe \nand around the world.\n\n  We did an extraordinary job with our military forces, our air power, \nin securing our entry into Kosovo, the entry of NATO. It would seem to \nme to be turning away from that great military success at this juncture \nby our own action, essentially signaling to our NATO allies we are no \nlonger prepared to assist\n\n[[Page S4086]]\n\nthem in the efforts in Kosovo. I believe it would, in fact, trigger \ntheir parliaments to conduct the same types of debates we are \nconducting, and the same type of vote if this measure passes. And, as a \nresult, the cohesion, the commitment--not just of the United States but \nof NATO and European forces--would be dissipated and, in fact, we would \nsee perhaps the end of international involvement in Kosovo.\n  The other thing to recognize is that, of the 49,500 troops on the \nground, 5,300 are American forces, about 10 percent of the total. This \nis not a disproportionately American-led operation today on the ground \nin Kosovo. Indeed, if you look at the U.N. international police forces \nin Kosovo, of the 1,900 police officers, 430 are Americans. In terms of \nreconstruction, we are scheduled to pay about 14 percent of the \nreconstruction, 20 percent of the humanitarian aid. These numbers are \nin line with a joint international effort not dominated by the United \nStates, but our shared participation is vital to its success.\n  If we choose to make this judgment with respect to Kosovo, we also \nhave to ask ourselves, reasonably: Will our participation elsewhere be \nquestioned? What about our Australian allies who have shouldered a \ndisproportionate burden in East Timor and have asked us repeatedly both \nfor practical and political reasons to participate with them? Will they \nsuddenly get nervous about our resolve there and curtail their \nactivities in a country which desperately needs international support \nto make the transformation from a dependency, a captured territory, \nreally, of Indonesia, to an independent country?\n  We can see many other places around the world where our resolve might \nbe seriously questioned. So the ramifications of this vote are not just \nwithin the context of Kosovo. They would reach out across the globe \nliterally to raise questions of our role in the world with respect to \nour allies and our adversaries.\n  Speaking of adversaries, one has to ask how would this be interpreted \nby Milosevic in Belgrade? I think he would see this as his salvation. \nAfter losing five wars in the Balkans, after seeing his country \npractically dismembered, after seeing his cities destroyed from the \nair, suddenly we would offer him the hope of some ultimate \njustification because, if we leave, the pressure on our allies to go \nalso will be, perhaps, unstoppable. Also, if we leave, and if my worst \nfears come about that there is renewed interethnic violence between \nSerbs and Albanians within Kosovo, he will be able to stand in his \nfigurative pulpit and claim that he is doing precisely what we did; \nthat he is using his military forces to stop the ethnic cleansing of \nKosovar Serbs by Kosovar Albanians, and that he is justified, morally \nand politically, on the same basis we were, to enter back into Kosovo \nwith force, if necessary, to vindicate the same moral principles we \nclaimed.\n  Would that not be a terrible irony in history? Yet that very well \ncould happen. I believe Milosevic and his colleagues in Belgrade would \nembrace any slight weakening of our resolve.\n  The other aspect we have to look at, and it is one that is geared to \nall of us here but none more so than the sponsors of this amendment, is \nthe status and the safety of our forces.\n  Again, one can always conjure up dangers, particularly when we have \ntroops in as close contact as they are. The simple uncertainty of what \nwe might do a year from now with respect to a vote would, I think, \ninject increased risks to our forces in the field. I do not think we \nshould do that. I do not think it is necessary to do that.\n  We have heard from General Clark. He has been emphatic about his view \nthat this course of action would not be wise or judicious. We have \nheard similarly from Secretary of Defense Cohen.\n  Our troops in the field already face a difficult task. They have \ncombat power, but ultimately it is the resolve and the support of this \nNation that stands behind them which is their greatest weapon.\n  They are in a very difficult and dangerous situation. They are in \nurban areas. Like so many of my colleagues, I traveled to Kosovo last \nJuly with Senator Levin, Senator Sessions, and Senator Landrieu. We \ntraveled through Kosovo. It is and has been a violent land. It is a \nplace where we saw as we went into Prizren, a town in the German \nsector, fires burning by renegades who are still trying to avenge \nthemselves against the Serbs.\n  In that complicated area with cities, I do not think we want to \nunwittingly invite the hotheads, the terrorists, the ideologues to \nbegin attacking our forces because that is not a place where our \nadvantages militarily will come to the fore. In fact, we will be \nseverely disadvantaged.\n  I hope we will reject this amendment. This is always very positive \nand productive because this body should be a place for debate and \ndiscussion. Senator Warner and Senator Byrd have, once again, focused \nour attention on this issue in Kosovo, once again reminding us of how \nwe got into the situation and also reminding us of our obligations to \nlook ahead. In that sense, they have done a great service to this \nSenate, as they have done throughout their careers.\n  If we seize that challenge, if we look ahead, if we try to carefully \nmeasure the likely consequences, this amendment will not advance our \ncause, will not advance our position in the world, will not provide \nadditional support and resolve to those forces within Kosovo that are \nseeking peace and reconciliation. It will, at best, create uncertainty \nand doubt which will generate, in my view, violence and, at worst, be a \ngreen light for those forces that want to finally eliminate their \nethnic rivals or those forces that see this as an opportunity to, once \nagain, get the upper hand on their ethnic rivals.\n  All these suggest we should reject this amendment and that we try, if \nwe are concerned about the long-term status of our forces in that area, \nto work for an acceleration, as part of this amendment calls for, an \nacceleration of international assistance for reconstruction and \nhumanitarian affairs, an acceleration of the deployment of police \nofficers to absorb the responsibilities which now are being held by \nmilitary forces, to accelerate our readiness for peacekeeping around \nthe globe because we know, although we regret, there will be other \nsituations such as this.\n  If we can do that based upon this debate, then we have accomplished a \ngreat deal, but I urge my colleagues to oppose these provisions and \nsupport Senator Levin's amendment to strike so we can send a message to \nour allies, to our soldiers, to our adversaries that we will stand \nbehind our forces in Kosovo.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield back my remaining time to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \nhis typically thoughtful comments. He has made a truly great \ncontribution to this Senate. We spend a lot of time with him on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. He has made an extraordinary \ncontribution not only based on his own intellectual powers but on his \nown experience which is invaluable to us in the Senate. I thank him for \nhis insightful comments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree with my distinguished colleague \nfrom Michigan. We do have a very valued member of our committee in this \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island. It is interesting that he \njoined Senator Chafee, while that great Senator, that tower of \nstrength, was here, and he was always so deferential and respectful to \nSenator Chafee. In his own right, he proudly graduated from West Point \nand served his hitch in the U.S. Army. He reminds me of that when we \nget excessive naval funds through our committee. We thank the Senator. \nWhile I may not agree with his conclusion, his participation on this \ncommittee and this matter is of great importance to us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe Senator Hutchison wants to be \nheard at this point. I have no objection whatsoever to that, even \nthough that is a change in the order of battle.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest to my colleague that he go ahead \nand initiate his remarks, if that is his desire. She is about to \narrive. We can put in a short quorum call.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If we can put in a short quorum call.\n\n[[Page S4087]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. In that time, we can work on the time for the rest of the \nevening.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the issue before this body tomorrow--at \nleast the principal issue--will be whether we are going to set a \ndeadline for the withdrawal of U.S. ground forces from Kosovo by the \nmiddle of next year. I will be coming back to that issue a little bit \nlater in my remarks. But before we directly address that question, I \nwould like to go back a bit in time and talk about how we got here and \nabout NATO's air campaign.\n  That campaign was the correct response to Milosevic's brutal \nrepression of the Kosovo population and was the correct response to \nMilosevic's effort to spread instability in the region.\n  Now that ethnic cleansing has been reversed, for the first time in \nthe 20th century, NATO's peacekeeping mission was the right thing to \ndo, to give the people of Kosovo a chance to live peaceful and \nproductive lives. And NATO's peacekeeping mission is the right thing to \ncontinue, to give that chance to live a chance to flower.\n  We are at a crucial point with respect to Kosovo. Ten months into the \nNATO-led peacekeeping phase of the operation, there are some \nencouraging signs. There are not such encouraging signs, I am afraid, \ninside the Senate.\n  The first and most significant fact in Kosovo is that over one and a \nhalf million people have returned to their homes, homes from which they \nwere driven, and they have returned either from abroad or from the \nwoods.\n  Mass torture, rape, and looting were the substance of daily life in \nKosovo just a year ago. There is still too much violence, but the \ncontrast is stark. When the NATO-led Kosovo force, or KFOR, arrived in \nKosovo in June of 1999, there was a weekly murder rate of about 50. It \nis now down to an average of five--still too high, but comparable to \nlarge cities in the developed world.\n  The discussion taking place within the international community is now \nhow fast, how many, to where in Kosovo the Serbs and other minorities \nshould return. There is still a long way to go in Kosovo before Kosovo \nis safe for all of its former residents, but progress is being made.\n  Dr. Bernard Kouchner, head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, had it \nright when he said that ``Kosovo is emerging from 40 years of \ncommunism, 10 years of apartheid, and a year of ethnic cleansing, and \nthat it is simply unrealistic to expect that a Switzerland would be \ncreated there in less than a year.''\n  Some who maintain that a deadline should be set now for the pull out \nof U.S. combat forces point to the fact that the United States flew \nover 70 percent of the missions in the air campaign. The argument is \nthat it is now the Europeans' turn to bear the peacekeeping burden. \nWell, that is exactly what is happening. The European nations are \nproviding over 80 percent of the peacekeeping troops for Kosovo, and \nthe United States is providing about 15 percent of the troops. The \nEuropeans have responsibility for four of the five peacekeeping sectors \nin Kosovo. The KFOR commander is presently a Spaniard. He was preceded \nby a Brit, and then preceded before that by a German. The Eurocorp, a \nmultilateral command composed of Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, \nand Spain, took over the KFOR headquarters function last month. Last \nweek, NATO announced that an Italian would become the KFOR commander in \nOctober.\n  Moreover, the European nations, either as part of the European Union, \nor individually, have pledged to provide more than 75 percent of the \nfinancial contributions to Kosovo. Now, that brings us to the provision \nthat is included in the military construction appropriations bill. This \nprovision makes the decision now that U.S. ground forces will pull out \nof Kosovo after July of next year. That is the heart of the matter. It \nis a decision in this bill now that those ground forces will pull out \nof Kosovo in the middle of next year.\n  If we leave this language in the bill, Congress will be deciding to \npull our ground forces out next July. We will have an opportunity later \nto reverse that decision if we change our minds. But unless Congress \nchanges its mind, the decision is made. Nothing more needs to be done. \nIt is a self-effectuating decision. If Congress does nothing, those \ntroops--we would be deciding now--must come out in the middle of next \nyear.\n  In another part of the language, it says that if the Europeans do not \nmeet specified percentages of their pledges for financial assistance \nand police contributions, the withdrawal of our forces would start in \nAugust of this year, unless Congress enacts a joint resolution \nproviding otherwise. But if Congress does nothing, the decision is made \nnow. This is not left to a later decision of Congress. We would be \ndeciding now that those troops must come out, if the Europeans do not \nmeet very specified percentages of certain pledges for financial \nassistance.\n  I have been one that has criticized the Europeans for not delivering \non those financial pledges--particularly for not providing more \ncivilian police for Kosovo. I have joined our chairman, Senator Warner, \nin criticizing the Europeans very publicly, very openly. We have talked \nto the foreign and defense ministers from Britain, France, and Germany, \nas well as the Ambassador of the European Union to the United States. I \nhave publicly said it is a little more than hypocritical for \nthe European Union to talk about grand plans for European security and \ndefense identity at the same time they are not appropriately living up \nto their pledges of financial assistance and civilian police for \nKosovo.\n\n  So I believe that we should be continuing to put pressure on the \nEuropeans to live up to our commitments, and I think we ought to live \nup to our own commitments as well. I have a number of concerns with the \nByrd-Warner language relative to the Europeans' commitments.\n  First, I don't agree with the consequences that would follow if the \nPresident is unable to certify that the Europeans are meeting their \nprecise commitment; namely, in the absence of a majority vote of both \nHouses of Congress, our ground forces would automatically have to \nwithdraw from a NATO-led peacekeeping operation. I don't object to \nvoting on that issue, but I strongly believe that the proper way to use \nthe power of the purse is to vote directly on whether or not to cut off \nfunding. That is what we did in Somalia in 1993 with the Byrd \namendment, and in 1994 with the Defense appropriations bill, with that \namendment. But that is very different from what is being proposed now, \nwhich is to require a withdrawal of U.S. forces later, unless a later \nvote authorizes the peacekeeping operation, or unless specific targets \nare met by the Europeans.\n  Throughout our history, while we have used the power of the purse to \ncut off funding for the deployment of our forces, Congress has not, to \nmy knowledge, enacted legislation that would require the Congress to \naffirmatively vote at a later date to allow a deployment to continue. \nThe provision before us basically says if Congress doesn't act in a \nspecific way at a later date, our forces must withdraw from Kosovo, so \nthat the fate of Kosovo may very well be determined by the impetus of \nCongress to act.\n  The power of the purse is a vital power. It is totally appropriate to \nseek to exercise that power. But the power, as wielded here, sets up a \nprocess by which nonaction by the Congress would lead to the withdrawal \nof our forces from Kosovo. The Byrd-Warner provision decides now to \nrequire the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces from Kosovo next July, \nunless Congress changes its mind in the interim. The issue then isn't \nwhether Congress has the power to set deadlines. Of course we have the \npower. If that were the issue before us, the vote on this would be 100-\n0 to maintain that power. The issue before us is whether we want to \nforce the withdrawal of ground forces from Kosovo in July of 2001. That \nwould be an unwise exercise of a power that Congress clearly had.\n  So the language before us isn't about a theoretical principle that \nCongress has the power to set deadlines. The\n\n[[Page S4088]]\n\nByrd-Warner language exercises that power. No further action is needed \nlater, and unless further action is taken later, our ground forces \nwould be withdrawn next July.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will my distinguished colleague yield?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I may finish this one thought, I will be happy to \nyield. That is what it comes down to. The proponents do not want us \nparticipating--by their own words--in NATO-led ground forces, even at a \njunior partner level of 10 or 15 percent because, in the words of the \nproponents in a Dear Colleague letter they sent, ``The Europeans should \nbe responsible for the ground element of the Kosovo peacekeeping \nmission.'' That is what the proponents wrote to all of us. They don't \nwant us participating. They want us out of there. Unless we change our \nmind, we will be out of there because, in their words, ``The Europeans \nshould be responsible for the ground element of the Kosovo peacekeeping \nmission.''\n\n  By the way, I reiterate, we are supplying 15 percent of the forces. \nWe have pleaded with the Europeans for years to become more active in \ntheir own defense, and they have now responded. They are now the senior \npartner, with 80 percent of the ground forces. We are 15 percent, and \nthe other non-Europeans are 5 percent.\n  We are the junior partner right now. But the language in this bill \nsays we don't want to even perform that role. That is what will unravel \nthis mission and endanger this mission in the eyes of NATO and its \nleaders.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is just a question to my distinguished colleague. He \nused the term ``inaction by Congress.'' Indeed, I say to my colleague, \nCongress has been inactive on a number of occasions when we sent our \ntroops abroad and expended our taxpayers' money. That is one of the \npurposes of this bill. To establish a precedent of inaction not \nconceived by the Founding Fathers--indeed, we are given coequal powers.\n  I want to go back to the bill itself, on page 71, ``congressional \npriority procedures,'' and ``joint resolutions, defined.''\n  I interpret that clause in the Byrd-Warner language that only one \nSenator is required, I say to my distinguished colleague. One Senator \ncan bring forth that resolution. I commit to you that I will be that \nSenator, if necessary. So there will not be, in my judgment, inaction \nby the Congress after the President sends his report up.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Congress does nothing, under this language those \ntroops are out of there.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. But I am saying I commit to be \nthe one Senator who requires the Congress to speak on it. So it will \nnot be inaction. Congress will take action. The senior Senator from \nVirginia will be the one who will come to the floor under this \nprovision and demand it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is limited reassurance because it doesn't answer the \nheart of the problem, which is that if Congress does not vote later to \nauthorize those troops, we are deciding now that those troops must \nleave.\n  General Clark told us the problem is that in the year between now and \nthen you have tremendous uncertainty, to put it mildly, as to whether \nCongress will authorize those troops to continue despite the commitment \nof one Senator to vote that way. It is that uncertainty which creates \ndanger for our troops. Those aren't my words. Those are the words of \nGeneral Clark's, who commanded those forces until a few weeks ago. That \nis the uncertainty which creates problems inside of our NATO alliance. \nThat is the problem that creates in Milosevic the hope that he can \nrestore himself to power for 1 year. For 1 year what is going to be the \nlaw of this land is that, unless Congress by majority vote decides to \nauthorize those troops in Kosovo, the American forces must leave.\n\n  It is a dangerous uncertainty. It is a debilitating uncertainty in \nterms of NATO. It is an encouraging uncertainty in terms of Milosevic. \nAnd it is an uncertainty that we should not create. There would be a \nway to avoid this. There is a way that I suggested.\n  The way to avoid this is to guarantee the Senator from Virginia an \nopportunity that he could vote to pull the plug a year from now. That \nis a lot different. That is not this language. That was language which \nI suggested to my good friend from Virginia that we could guarantee a \nyear from now that there would be an opportunity to force the \nwithdrawal of those troops. That doesn't create the year of uncertainty \nwhich this language does because the language in this bill that my \namendment would strike creates the uncertainty because if Congress does \nnothing a year from now, if the majority does not act a year from now \nto authorize these troops, the year of uncertainty between now and then \nwill take a horrendous toll. Those are not my words. Those are the \nwords of General Clark, the expert in the field. It seems to me that is \na significant difference.\n  One other point, and I would be happy to yield further, but I \nprobably want to do this on my good friend's time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will be happy to have all of my \nquestions on my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In the middle of the air campaign, while our fliers were \nputting their lives at risk over Kosovo, the House of Representatives \ncould not even muster a majority to support our air campaign. My good \nfriend says he will be the one to trigger this vote in the Senate. I \nhave no doubt that he would. Once he says something, he means it. I \nwould bet my life on it. I have bet an awful lot on his words many \ntimes, and I have never lost a bet.\n  But I will say this: You can't tell us what the House of \nRepresentatives will do, or what 99 other Senators will do a year from \nnow, and the problem, General Clark tells us, is that year of dangerous \nuncertainty is destabilizing, discourages our allies in NATO, \nencourages Milosevic, and is a real morale buster for our troops. It \nendangers our troops. It puts them at greater risk during this year. \nThat is what General Clark told us in his letter, which I will read in \na few moments.\n  I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. First, the Byrd-Warner amendment is very carefully drawn \nso that the next President of the United States in following up with \nPresident Clinton's report with the next President's report. It is not \nrequired of him to wait until July as is now written. Indeed, Senator \nByrd and I thought we would give it additional time. If the next \nPresident perceives that there is some turbulence and doubt in the \nminds of our allies, he can file the report. Then this Senator pledges \nunder the bill within the 10 days to come forward with that resolution \nand have this body act. I will guarantee. I will draft somebody in the \nHouse to do the same thing.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator guarantee a majority vote in both the \nHouse and Senate?\n  Mr. WARNER. I can't guarantee that.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is the problem.\n  Mr. WARNER. I can guarantee, if the facts of the case are so strong \nand the turbulence so great amongst our NATO allies, then I think this \nChamber will act in a responsible way in the best interests of the \nUnited States and all those involved.\n  Time and time again, I remind my colleagues in this debate, why are \nwe so fearful that if the facts are there to justify the continuation \nof this mission this chamber will not vote in a majority to support the \nnext President in his petition? That is underlying this whole debate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think my friend and I know from a whole lot of debates \nin this Chamber that, while the facts may be clear to either of us or \nboth of us, they may not be clear to a majority of this Chamber the way \nwe see those facts. It is that year of uncertainty. It would be about a \nyear.\n  Mr. WARNER. The President could file this report in March.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It could go up to, let's say, 10 months of uncertainty. \nThat is a dangerous period of time, which is, by the way, not necessary \nto create.\n  If my friend wanted a guaranteed vote on whether or not to pull the \nplug on our forces next year, that can be arranged--a guaranteed vote. \nBut that is not what this is.\n  Let's be very clear on this. This says that unless the majority \ndecides a year from now to authorize something, that automatically \nthen, on automatic pilot, self-effectuating, we are deciding now, and \nthose troops must leave. And it is that dangerous period between now \nand then--whether it is 10 months, 12 months, or 14 months--it is that \ndestabilizing dangerous period which the\n\n[[Page S4089]]\n\nNATO Secretary General and General Clark have told us endangers the \nmission and endangers our troops.\n  It is unheard of, I believe. There is no precedent that we can find \nfor the Senate or the Congress ever deciding in year 1 that unless \nsomething is authorized in year 2, relative to a deployment of forces, \nthat those forces must be withdrawn. We have pulled the plug on \ndeployment.\n  I have voted to pull the plug on deployments. I have voted to end \ndeployments in Haiti. I voted, after my dear friend from Virginia and I \nwent to Somalia, both before and after, to set deadlines and pull our \ntroops out of Somalia.\n  That is not what we are doing here. What we are doing is deciding now \nthat if Congress doesn't authorize a deployment next year--be it May, \nJune, or August--those troops must go. It creates between now and then \na very dangerous period, and a period which is demoralizing for our \ntroops, according to the former commander. That is what we ought to \navoid. It is unnecessary for us to do that.\n  Some people ask, is there anything wrong with exercising the power of \nthe purse? My answer is, I am going to defend the power of the purse. \nSenator Byrd is surely correct in saying we have the power to do what \nthe Senator from Virginia and he proposed that we do. I don't doubt \nthat. I doubt its wisdom--not the power of Congress, but whether it is \nwise for us to do what is being proposed.\n  When it comes to the constitutional power issue, if that were the \nissue before us, whether or not Congress has the power to do what the \nSenator proposed, if that were the question, I would say we have the \npower. I think we would have a 100-0 vote. I hope so in terms of the \nprerogative of this branch of Government. The question isn't power. It \nis wisdom.\n  Is this the right thing to do?\n  Do we want to create this year of uncertainty and instability? Do we \nwant to put into place a self-effectuating, automatic process which \nwould lead to the withdrawal of forces later unless something happens \nbetween now and then? I think the answer clearly is no.\n  I will quote from this letter I referenced, General Clark's letter, \nwhich I have printed in the Record. I use only a few paragraphs from \nthe letter.\n  General Clark wrote that the provisions in the bill before the \nSenate:\n\n       . . .would, if enacted, invalidate the dedication and \n     commitment of our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines, \n     disregarding the sacrifices they and their families have made \n     to help bring peace to the Balkans.\n\n  He also wrote:\n\n       Our service men and women and their families, have made \n     great sacrifices in bringing peace and stability to the \n     Balkans. This amendment introduces uncertainty in the \n     planning and funding of the Kosovo mission. This uncertainty \n     will undermine our service members' confidence in our resolve \n     and may call into question the sacrifices we have asked of \n     them and their families.\n\n  General Clark continues:\n\n       These measures, if adopted, would be seen as a de facto \n     pull-out decision by the United States. They are unlikely to \n     encourage European allies to do more. In fact, these measures \n     would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our \n     Allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and \n     encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in \n     the Balkans.\n\n  He also wrote:\n\n       Our allies would see this as a unilateral, adverse move \n     that splits fifty years of shared burdens, shared risks and \n     shared benefits in NATO.\n       This action will also undermine specific plans and \n     commitments made within the Alliance. At the time that U.S. \n     military and diplomatic personnel are pressing other nations \n     to fulfill and expand their commitment of forces, \n     capabilities and resources, an apparent congressionally \n     mandated pullout would undercut their leadership and all \n     parallel diplomatic efforts.\n\n  General Clark continues:\n\n       Setting a specific deadline for U.S. pull-out would signal \n     to the Albanians the limits of the international security \n     guarantees providing for their protection. This, in turn, \n     would give them cause to rearm and prepare to protect \n     themselves from what they would view as inevitable Serbian \n     reentry. The more radical elements of the Albanian population \n     in Kosovo would be encouraged to increase the level of \n     violence directed against the Serb minority, thereby \n     increasing instability as well as placing U.S. forces on the \n     ground at increased risk.\n\n  I repeat that one sentence because it seems to me when, up until \nrecently, the commander reaches this conclusion, as well thought out it \nis, that our forces on the ground will be at increased risk while they \nare there if this action is taken, we should pay some very significant \nheed to those words.\n  Mr. WARNER. At some point, would the Senator allow asking questions? \nI find very troublesome the accusation by General Clark. I have always \nbelieved General Clark to be a very brilliant field commander, despite \nthe fact he was reversed in his desire to do certain things in Kosovo \nby the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, \ntime and time again. As a matter of fact, I was a supporter with him on \nthe ground troops issue, traveled with him the day before the \nhostilities ceased.\n  That we would do something to place in harm's way those who serve \ntoday and those who serve for the remainder of the time--I looked, as a \nmatter of record, at the cosponsors of this resolution. I think I \ncounted 10 persons who are veterans of previous wars and engagements. \nFor General Clark to be pointing a finger at up to a dozen Members and \nsaying, we veterans are taking an action endangering our people--let me \nask this question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That is not the issue. This is not a personal issue. This \nis an issue of judgment on the effect of a particular proposal. He is \nnot saying that the intent of the proponents is to put our forces on \nthe ground at increased risk. General Clark knows the Members of this \nbody. He knows nobody in this body would intentionally place U.S. \nground forces at increased risk.\n  Mr. WARNER. I could examine the record of your remarks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. What he is saying is, from reading the letter, this action \nwill do that. He is not saying it is intended to do that. He is saying \nthis is what the effect of this action will be. I don't think the \npersons who support the language that is in the bill can fairly believe \nthat General Clark is aiming anything personally at them in terms of \ntheir intention because there is nothing suggesting that.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, 23 Senators have already taken an \naction. They voted on it in the Appropriations Committee. They have \ntaken that action. And you go back and count among the 23 those who \nproudly served in uniform for this country.\n  Let me turn to another point. How do our allies feel, listening to \nthis debate where we are saying they are of little consequence? If we \npull out 2,000 or 3,000 ground combat troops, leaving the support \ntroops in place, why, the sky is falling in, says General Clark. What \ndoes that say to the other 30-plus nations that have their troops \nthere: You are ineffective; You won't hold the line; You break ranks?\n  I think that is a fallacious argument.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Let me try to answer the question of how our allies feel. \nWe have direct evidence on that. We have a letter from Secretary \nGeneral Robertson.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am familiar with that letter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will read now in response to the question of how our \nallies feel from a good friend of ours, George Robertson, whom we both \nknow well, Secretary General of NATO.\n  Mr. WARNER. He is a fine naval man.\n  Mr. LEVIN. He says:\n\n       The question of Congressional prerogatives is an internal \n     matter for the U.S. Congress and the administration to \n     resolve. I'm in no position to comment. Where I do have a \n     concern, however, is that in the way the legislation is \n     written, it would not just affirm the Congressional \n     privilege, but point toward a single policy outcome--the \n     withdrawal of U.S. forces.\n       As Secretary General, the prospect of any NATO ally \n     deciding unilaterally not to take part in a NATO operation \n     causes me deep concern. It risks sending a dangerous signal \n     to the Yugoslavian dictator, Milosevic--that NATO is divided, \n     and that its biggest and most important ally is pulling up \n     stakes.\n\n  That is how our NATO allies feel about this language.\n  Some have argued that Congress has never authorized or even formally \ndebated U.S. involvement in Kosovo since the Senate on March 23, 1999, \nauthorized airstrikes against Yugoslavia.\n  By the way, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter from \nthe Secretary General of NATO, Mr. Robertson, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4090]]\n\n\n                                                    North Atlantic\n\n\n                                          Treaty Organization,\n\n                                          Bruxelles, May 16, 2000.\n     Senator Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle. I am writing to express my \n     concerns about legislation currently under consideration that \n     could result in a U.S. withdrawal from the NATO operation in \n     Kosovo.\n       As I understand it, the principal authors of the Kosovo \n     language have two concerns: to affirm the Congressional \n     prerogative to approve or disapprove U.S. military \n     deployments, and to insist on a proper sharing of burdens \n     among the United States and the European Allies.\n       The question of Congressional prerogatives is an internal \n     matter for the U.S. Congress and Administration to resolve. I \n     am in no position to comment. Where I do have a concern, \n     however, is that in the way the legislation is written, it \n     would not just affirm the Congressional privilege, but point \n     towards a single policy outcome--the withdrawal of U.S. \n     forces. Unless the Congress votes otherwise in a year's time, \n     the Administration would have to begin withdrawing forces. \n     And regardless of any vote, the Administration would be \n     required to produce a plan for total hand-off of the NATO \n     operation to the European Allies.\n       As Secretary General, the prospect of any NATO Ally \n     deciding unilaterally not to take part in a NATO operation \n     causes me deep concern. It risks sending a dangerous signal \n     to the Yugoslav dictator, Milosevic--that NATO is divided, \n     and that its biggest and most important Ally is pulling up \n     stakes. I would hope the question of Congressional privilege \n     being addressed could be dealt with in a way that does not \n     presume a U.S. withdrawal.\n       Concerning the issue of U.S.-European burden-sharing, I \n     agree with those who argue that the U.S. must not carry a \n     disproportionate share of the load. But the facts on the \n     ground today show that this is not the case. European states \n     are providing 80 percent of the forces in KFOR. The \n     Europcorps is providing the NATO headquarters for the \n     operation. The single largest contributor is Italy, with 14 \n     percent of the force. Italy will take over KFOR headquarters \n     in October.\n       The European nations are also carrying by far the largest \n     financial burden in providing assistance to Kosovo, and are \n     providing twice the U.S. contribution of civilian police. The \n     bottom line is that in Kosovo today, burden-sharing is \n     working.\n       In my view, while ensuring proper burden-sharing is \n     important, we should not let that issue distract us from our \n     larger policy objectives. The NATO presence in Kosovo needs \n     to be decided on the merits of our being there--the job that \n     we are doing and that we need to finish.\n       Just over one year ago, NATO aircraft--led largely by the \n     United States--put an end to the most brutal ethnic warfare \n     in Europe since World War II. One and a half million people \n     had been driven from their homes but, thanks to NATO's \n     action, they have been able to return. In a region that has \n     suffered so much--from communism, from de facto apartheid, \n     and then from abhorrent ethnic cleansing--NATO has meant the \n     difference between life and death, between hope and misery.\n       I believe that we owe it to ourselves, if not the people of \n     that region, to finish the job we began. As Secretary General \n     of NATO, I will pursue that goal with the utmost vigour. I \n     hope I can count on continued U.S. support, even recognizing \n     that the European Allies must continue carrying the largest \n     share of the load at this stage.\n       With warm good wishes\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 George Robertson,\n                                                Secretary General.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, some have argued that the Congress has not \nauthorized or debated United States involvement in Kosovo since the \nSenate, in March of 1999, authorized airstrikes against Yugoslavia. \nThat is not correct.\n  On June 10, 1999, during the House of Representatives consideration \nof the Department of Defense authorization bill, the House approved an \namendment offered by Mr. Skelton that deleted language in the bill as \nreported out of committee that would have prohibited any funding for \ncombat or peacekeeping operations in Yugoslavia after September of \n1999. The vote on the House floor was 270-155.\n  Additionally, on May 25, 1999, during the Senate's consideration of \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill, Senator Specter offered \nan amendment that would have prohibited the use of funds for the \ndeployment of United States ground troops in Yugoslavia, except for \npeacekeeping personnel, unless authorized by a joint resolution \nauthorizing the use of military force.\n  Senator Specter's amendment was tabled by a vote of 52-48. Proponents \nof this bill assert that Congress has a constitutional responsibility \nto address policy issues involving the deployment of U.S. troops \noverseas in instances in which American men and women are being sent \ninto potentially dangerous situations.\n  But the language singles out the involvement in Kosovo. The language \nrelates to Kosovo, not to a general principle. The United States has \nbeen enforcing a no-fly zone in Iraq for more than 9 years. U.S. and \nBritish aircraft are being fired upon by Iraqi forces almost daily. \nThey respond by attacking Iraqi air defense and command and control \ninstallations. Our pilots are clearly at risk. Total incremental costs \nfor our operations in the Persian Gulf are $1.2 billion a year. It is \nestimated that for this fiscal year it will be about $1 billion.\n  The United States has been contributing forces to NATO-led \npeacekeeping troops in Bosnia for 5 years. The U.S. contingent in that \neffort is 4,600 troops. With the passage of time, the risk to our \ntroops in Bosnia is probably less than it is in Kosovo, but they are at \nrisk. More than $9 billion has been appropriated since fiscal year 1991 \nfor Bosnia-related operations.\n  We have 3,700 troops in South Korea. In testimony before the Armed \nServices Committee in March of this year, the Director of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency said that war in the Korean peninsula could occur \nat any time. Our troops in South Korea are clearly at risk. It does not \nappear that our U.S. troop deployments in the Persian Gulf or Bosnia or \nKorea are going to end anytime soon. There is no fixed date for the end \nof these deployments. But they are important missions and our troops \nshould remain deployed until those missions are completed.\n  Proponents suggest we are abdicating our responsibility by not \nspecifically authorizing U.S. troops' participation in the NATO \npeacekeeping operation in Kosovo. Surely Congress is not abdicating its \nresponsibility by not having expressly authorized deployments in the \nPersian Gulf, Bosnia, and Korea as a condition of their continued \ndeployment. So the issue before the Senate is not a principle or else \nthat principle would presumably be consistently applied.\n  The issue before us is not the power of Congress. We have that power. \nEvery one of us, I hope, would vote to defend that power. I will as \nlong as I am in the Senate of the United States. If the issue is does \nCongress have the power of the purse to end the deployment, I will \ndefend that principle. But I will not defend its application every time \nthere is an attack on the deployment of our forces or an effort made to \nend the deployment of our forces.\n  The question here is, Is it wise now to say that a year from now, \nunless Congress votes affirmatively and changes its mind, that we are \nsaying now that those forces must leave Kosovo? That is the question. \nIt is the wisdom of the application of the power in these circumstances \nin this way that is the issue before the Senate. It is not the abstract \npower of the purse or the abstract power to force the pullout of \nAmerican forces because there cannot be any doubt that we have that \npower constitutionally. The question is, Is it wise to exercise that \npower now in Kosovo in this way, with the resulting year of dangerous \nuncertainty, as General Clark has outlined to us--endangering the NATO \neffort in Kosovo, endangering the morale of our forces in Kosovo, \nemboldening Milosevic to return to Kosovo? That is the question. Is it \nwise to exercise that power now to be effective a year from now unless \nwe change our mind? That is the only issue, not the abstract power of \nthe Senate.\n\n  I could give many other examples of where we have forces in different \nplaces. I have talked about the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, and South Korea. \nWe have forces in the western Sahara; we have forces in Sinai; we have \nforces in East Timor. We have forces in a number of places around the \nworld--and in many ways I think we are overstretched, by the way. We \nhave forces in so many places, but I do not believe there has been any \nspecific congressional authorization for the deployment of U.S. \nmilitary personnel to any of those deployments. We could cut off \nfunding for those deployments; we have that power. But a failure to \nspecifically authorize them cannot represent an abdication or the loss \nof constitutional power over the purse. It cannot mean\n\n[[Page S4091]]\n\nthat. We have not abdicated our power or abdicated the power of the \npurse by failing to authorize forces in East Timor or Sinai or in \nBosnia or in South Korea or in Germany. We have decided as a Congress \nnot to withdraw those forces. Any one of us at any time on any \nappropriations bill related to defense or on the defense authorization \nbill could offer an amendment saying we want those troops out of there. \nThen we would debate the wisdom of doing that. But the issue is the \nwisdom, not the power.\n  Finally, I hope General Clark's words and those of NATO General \nSecretary Robertson will be with us as we vote on this amendment. Just \nto pick one sentence from General Clark's letter to conclude, this \nlanguage, if it stays in this bill:\n\n       . . . would be seen as a de facto pull-out decision by the \n     United States. Those measures are unlikely to encourage \n     European allies to do more. In fact, these measures would \n     invalidate the policies, commitment and trust of our allies \n     in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and encourage \n     renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in the \n     Balkans.\n\n  That is what the year of uncertainty that this language, if left in \nthis bill, will precipitate. I hope we will avoid that. I hope we will \nstrike this language, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to pick up on that last sentence of \nthe de facto decision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. General Clark, again, is a Rhodes scholar, a brilliant \nofficer, but I do not agree with him about his perception of the \nCongress of the United States. I believe the next President, whoever \nthat may be--Albert Gore or George W. Bush--will be able to assess this \nsituation, come to the Congress, make the case, and the Congress will \nact responsibly. That can be done in an accelerated fashion. It does \nnot have to wait until next July. Indeed, we tried in the amendment to \ngive more time.\n  So I close by saying to all those who want to join behind General \nClark, I feel very strongly that that is a pretty severe indictment of \nthe chain of events that are to be carefully undertaken, first, by \nPresident Clinton; second, by the next President of the United States, \nand then by the Congress. We must remember that we are a coequal \nbranch. We repeat that and repeat that, but in Europe their \nparliamentary forms of government are quite different than ours. There \nis not the coequal stature with the constitution in place, with regard \nto their various forms of legislature, or general assemblies, whatever \nthe case may be. They are quite different and they have to be \nrespectful of how this situation works.\n  I come back to Senator Byrd's statement, which is a brilliant \nstatement, recounting World War I, World War II, and all the \nparticipation that this great Nation has given in this century towards \npeace and stability in Europe.\n  Are they now to turn their back on that history? I say no. I say to \nmy good friend from Michigan, and I say to General Clark, I believe \nthey have gone just a step too far. I have more confidence in the next \nPresident and confidence that this President can make a strong case, \nand I have confidence in the institution of the Congress of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama. \nWho yields time? Does the Senator from Virginia yield time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if my distinguished colleague \nfrom Alabama will forbear. With regard to time on our side, there are a \nnumber of Senators who have indicated a desire to address the Senate \ntomorrow. Tonight I will put in place a UC to enable them to have a \nspecific period of time.\n  I point out, this is a bipartisan decision with which we are dealing \nin the Senate. We have our distinguished elder statesman, Mr. Byrd, \nleading it. We have another distinguished elder statesman, Mr. \nHollings. I ask unanimous consent whereby, from the other side of the \naisle, Senator Torricelli, Senator Cleland, and Senator Feingold each \nhave 6 minutes apiece at their disposal. On our side, we will lead off \ntomorrow morning at 9 o'clock with Senator Roberts, and he desires 15 \nminutes; Senator Warner, myself, during the course of the morning, I \nreserve 20 minutes for myself; Senator Hutchison of Texas desires 7 \nminutes; Senator Inhofe desires 7 minutes; and Senator Snowe desires 7 \nminutes.\n  I want to make those time commitments to guarantee that our \ncolleagues who have indicated to me a desire to speak will have that \ntime tomorrow. My understanding is there will be 5\\1/2\\ hours of debate \ntomorrow prior to the vote at 2:30 p.m. which is fixed by order. The \nleadership may, of course, in some way change that, take leadership \ntime, and so forth. Basically, it is 5\\1/2\\ hours. Senator Byrd, under \na previous order, still has an hour left of his time. So that should be \nrecited. I ask that in the form of a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, I am not sure what the \nrequest is. I am sure we can work something out. We are on the same \nwavelength. I am not sure what the request is.\n  Mr. WARNER. The request is that these Senators I have enumerated be \ngiven those specific times under my control.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia has the right to \ncontrol his time as he sees fit without unanimous consent. That is what \nis throwing me a bit. I do not know exactly for what he needs a \nunanimous consent relative to time under his control.\n  Maybe we can work at it the other way around. My good friend from \nVirginia and I work out these problems every day, and I am sure we can \nwork this one out, even though it is a bit complicated on the time.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: How much time remains to each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 2 hours 50 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is under the 10-hour agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is under the 10-hour agreement.\n  Mr. WARNER. Does that include the 60 minutes allocated to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It does not. The Senator from West Virginia \nstill has 60 minutes remaining, and the Senator from Michigan has 3 \nhours 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, was any of the time that was used up \ntonight deducted from the time of the Senator from Virginia when I was \nspeaking?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Whenever the Senator from Virginia was \nspeaking, the time was charged to him.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. What we then have is a total, it seems \nto me, of approximately 7 hours of time remaining that we have to fit \ninto the period between 9 a.m. and 2:30 p.m., which is 5\\1/2\\ hours; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is anticipated the debate will go on longer \ntonight or time will be yielded back.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will our good friend from Alabama be speaking on this \nissue?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be. I want to talk some time tonight if it is \nnot counted against other people's time.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator can talk tonight for such time as he desires \nbecause there will be, by virtue of the time agreement by the \nleadership containing tomorrow from 9 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., some time \nyielded back by both sides tonight, in my judgment, unless the Senator \nfrom Alabama goes into extensive remarks.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is also true on our side we have a good \nbipartisan group of supporters for our amendment to strike, including \nSenators McCain, Lugar, Lieberman, Hagel, Smith of Oregon, Robb, \nVoinovich, Mack, Lautenberg, Kerry, and Daschle. That is beyond the \nones who have already spoken. I am not trying to allocate time for them \nor others who want to speak on our side tonight, other than to reassure \nthem we are going to do as much as we possibly can with the time we \nhave so that everybody has an opportunity to speak. While the Senator \nfrom Alabama is speaking, I wonder if the Senator from Virginia----\n  Mr. WARNER. I withdraw the unanimous consent request. I have stated \nfor the Record my commitment as the manager of the time to the \ncolleagues I have enumerated. I will somehow tomorrow manage that very \nably to see they are recognized. Then there will be others who will \ncome forward. I will leave it at that.\n\n[[Page S4092]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. If our good friend from Alabama will yield one more \nsecond, it is possible we can at least divide the time tonight after \nthe Senator from Alabama concludes so we will know how much each side \nhas.\n  Mr. WARNER. First, how much time is remaining again with the Senator \nfrom Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 2 hours 50 \nminutes. The Senator from West Virginia has 1 hour. The Senator from \nMichigan has 3 hours 4 minutes; that is less 2 hours 55 seconds divided \nbetween the two Senators for this portion of the debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Virginia has 2 hours and?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. With the addition of the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, that is 3 hours 50 minutes. The Senator from Michigan has?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia plus the Senator \nfrom West Virginia will have 10 minutes less than 4 hours.\n  Mr. WARNER. Understood.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have 4 minutes more than 3 hours, if anybody at this \nhour can figure this out.\n  Mr. WARNER. Our colleague tonight will consume part of my time, and \nwe will almost be in balance at the conclusion of this evening. The \nvote is going to happen at 2:30, so we are running around with \nfractions tonight.\n  Mr. LEVIN. This is my last intervention before my friend from Alabama \nspeaks. I wonder if we can get an idea of approximately how long the \nSenator from Alabama expects to talk tonight.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If it is not disrupting Senator Warner's time, I want \nabout 40 minutes, give or take 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why don't we do 30?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will do my best.\n  Mr. WARNER. It seems to me we are going to have 5\\1/2\\ hours \ntomorrow. We will discuss this together. I will listen to the Senator \nfrom Michigan's views.\n  In order to get some certainty for the opening of this debate \ntomorrow, which will commence immediately after the Senate is formally \nopened and the prayer is given, Senator Roberts from Kansas would be \ngiven 15 minutes to be followed by Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey for \n15 minutes. Then I will only make known that Senator Burns, of course--\nhe is the chairman of the subcommittee for MILCON--will undoubtedly \nrequire some time. I assure him now that that time will likewise be \ngiven to Senator Burns.\n  So the purpose of my unanimous consent is to see that those two \nSenators be recognized in that order for a total of not to exceed 30 \nminutes equally divided, 15 minutes each. I ask unanimous consent that \nthat be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is possible Senator Lautenberg will need 20 minutes. \nThat additional 5 minutes will come out of our time.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is fine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have enjoyed hearing two great \nSenators tonight, Senator John Warner, who chairs our Armed Services \nCommittee, and Senator Carl Levin, who is the ranking member on that \ncommittee. They are able patriots who are skilled advocates and who do \na great job of presenting their viewpoints.\n  I have always said about Senator Levin that if I were in trouble, I \nwould want him to defend me. I think we have a foreign policy situation \nthat is in trouble, and he does a good job of defending it.\n  It is more than a legal question, however. It is a question of \npolicy. It is a question of the commitment of American troops. It is a \nquestion of the wealth of the United States being committed to this \narea of the world.\n  I do believe our troops are doing a great job. Last year, I had the \nprivilege, within 10 days of the end of the bombing in Kosovo, to \ntravel there with Senator Levin and two other Senators. We toured that \narea.\n  I returned there, not too many weeks ago, for my second visit at \nEaster time. We had the privilege of meeting with troops and touring \nthe area and celebrating Easter Sunrise Services with our troops there.\n  Our soldiers--men and women--are extraordinarily skilled. They are \ndoing a great job for our country. They do what we ask of them. They \nhave good morale. I will assure you that the morale of our soldiers is \nnot going to be undermined if the Congress of the United States says: \nWe are going to review this matter come next August or September or \nOctober--which is probably when we would do it because I think that is \nSenator Warner's and Senator Byrd's commitment; it would actually be \nnext October, 17 months from now.\n\n  They are not going to have their morale hurt because we have not \nforgotten them. They are not going to have their morale hurt if the \nMembers of the Senate are discussing what is going on there and \nevaluating the situation. That is a matter that strikes me as really \nnot good to be said. I would dispute that.\n  The intervention and the whole commencement of this exercise in \nKosovo has been a colossal failure of diplomacy and a colossal failure \nof foreign policy. That is my view of it. I do not claim to be a \nthorough foreign policy expert, but I have watched this matter from the \nbeginning. A lot of people have not done so. We have gotten confused \nabout what has happened.\n  Senator John Warner, time and time and time again, since this \ninvolvement in Kosovo began, has done his best to support the \nPresident, even when he had doubts about it. He supported the Secretary \nof Defense; he supported the Chief of Staff; he supported General Clark \nbecause he felt it was his duty to do so. I know he was uneasy about \nthat.\n  But how long do we go? It has been a year now. We are talking about \nhaving a vote a year from now again to see whether or not we want to \ncontinue there. What is so dangerous about that? Why are people so \nafraid to have a debate and a vote? I do not understand that.\n  I think it is our duty, as Members of Congress, who represent the \ntaxpayers of this country--who pay our salaries and pay the cost of \nthat war effort that has come out of our defense budget--to confront \nthis question and make some decisions about it. If anything, I believe \nwe have been too lax. We have been too unwilling to confront the \nchallenges that have occurred and too unwise about how to go about \nthat.\n  So this Warner-Byrd amendment is a bipartisan amendment. It came out \nof the committee 23-3. That is the kind of vote we got in the \ncommittee. It has powerful support, broad bipartisan support. It is not \nextreme. It is not irrational. It is not going to cause NATO to \ncollapse.\n  We have done our bit in Kosovo. Make no mistake about that. We have \ndone our bit there. So the Congress has been patient. We have supported \nthe President. He consistently misled the people of the United States \nand this Congress.\n  I remember upstairs, in the secret room, we had our briefings. And \nthey started talking about this bombing. They said it might be over in \n3 days; it might be over in 10 days. I remember one of our Senators \nasked: What if it is not? What if the bombing does not work? What do we \ndo then? And they said: We believe it is going to work. I decided then \nif we did not have a plan better than that, we did not need to go into \nthis operation.\n  But let me share what really happened.\n  Basically, what happened in this area, as I see it, is Milosevic \nstarted a nationalist campaign in Serbia and Yugoslavia that was very \ndangerous, horrible, unwise, that destabilized this whole area and \nhelped lead to the tragedies that we have today. There is no mistaking \nthat.\n  Remember now, though, before this bombing started we had 1,000-plus \npeacekeepers in Kosovo. We had some violence, periodic violence. This \nwas with KLA guerrillas fighting, ostensibly, the Serb Government.\n  So we had a situation there which was definitely deteriorating in \nsome ways. The Serb and KLA forces were sparring, but it was not out of \ncontrol. We had 1,000 peacekeepers there.\n  We made a number of efforts to negotiate a peace agreement that could \nhave provided for an orderly transition in that area to a more just \nsociety.\n\n[[Page S4093]]\n\nThat was our goal and responsibility. I think it was a challenge that \nwas difficult but could be met.\n  Not long ago, in the Old Senate Chamber, right off the Rotunda of \nthis Capitol, we had Senator George Mitchell, who did the peace \nnegotiations in Northern Ireland, as our speaker at the Majority \nLeader's Lecture Series.\n  He told us how he accomplished it in the face of the intractable \nforces that seemed to be at work. He said: There we kept talking. He \nsaid: I learned from the Senate that people can talk and talk and talk. \nAnd I would let them talk. They would talk and talk and talk. They \nwould completely get everything out of their system. We would stay \nthere into the night, day after day after day. Tensions began to go \ndown. People began to think more clearly about the possibility they \ncould work out their differences.\n  But that is not what happened here. I have often thought if we had \nhad George Mitchell in Yugoslavia instead of the ``masters of the \nuniverse'' that we did have, who thought they could dictate a peace \nagreement and make it happen, we might have avoided this war.\n  The fact is, as the Economist Magazine said a few weeks ago, maybe it \ncould not have been avoided, but it did not have to be started as soon \nas it did, and there was a chance it could have been avoided if we kept \nthe negotiations going. I have no doubt about that.\n  Remember what happened. Our leadership demanded that the Serbs and \nthe KLA--the Kosovars--come to Rambouillet, France, where we would \nbegin to have a peace conference. We were just going to settle this \nthing, like a mama bringing two children together. We were just going \nto bring them together, and we were going to get together and settle \nthis once and for all. And as time went along, the President said: You \nare going to reach a peace agreement, or the United States is going to \nbomb you. NATO is going to bomb you.\n\n  They would not agree. They kept on fussing, and they could not reach \nthe agreement. Things were really tense. Henry Kissinger referred to \nthat as a reckless event; it is a dangerous, high-risk operation to \nrisk everything on a Rambouillet peace conference under those \ncircumstances.\n  I asked Secretary of Defense Cohen--and I serve on the Armed Services \nCommittee--in the history of the United States, had he ever known of a \ncircumstance in which the United States got two contesting, contending \nparties together and said, if you don't agree to the peace agreement I \nwrite up, we are going to bomb you? Of course he said no. This is \nunprecedented, in my observation, in the history of the world.\n  So we did that, and we undertook this reckless gamble, and we were \njust going to force these people to do it. You remember, even the \nKosovars would not agree. They left the agreement, and then the Serbs \nwere going to leave the agreement. Apparently the Americans told the \nKosovars: You come back and sign this thing because we really will bomb \nthese guys. If you will sign it, we will make them sign it. So they \ncame back and the Kosovars signed, but the Serbs would not.\n  By the way, the agreement we were asking them to sign basically said \nwe can send troops throughout Yugoslavia, anywhere we want to--NATO can \nsend troops anywhere.\n  It is very difficult for any nation that had any respect for its \nsovereignty to agree to some of the things that were in that agreement. \nRegardless, they would not sign it. Days went by, time went by, and \npeople were saying: You promised, Mr. President, you were going to \nbomb. You are not going to bomb. You can't be trusted. Your word was \nnot good.\n  He was under investigation and had his credibility questioned \nseverely right in this body by the American people. So it was a \nquestion of would he follow through on his worldwide public commitment \nto start a war. Of course, eventually, he did. He started to bomb.\n  I want to mention how that was conducted, but I will just say this \nabout it. The Air Force general who conducted that war testified in a \npostwar congressional hearing in the Armed Services Committee, and I \nwas there. I remember asking him--he was unhappy with the fact that he \nwas not allowed to start the bombing aggressively, that he was dictated \nto targets he could go after. There were only certain limited targets, \nand it was a slow start. He opposed that privately. He was very \naggressive, and he warned that that was not the way to do a war.\n  If you are going to get involved, you have to go with full force, \naggressively at the beginning. We have learned that over the years in \nthis country. But, oh, no, we had to get all 17 NATO nations to sign \noff on every target. And somebody would object, and they would object, \nand you could not do this target or that target, and only these limited \ntargets so nobody would be injured, and we started off with this slow \nbombing campaign.\n  Now, 3 days after that, the big event happened. Remember, we have \nbeen told repeatedly that the reason this war commenced--and we have \nalmost forgotten the true facts of the situation, but we were told we \nwere commencing and carrying out this war to stop ethnic cleansing. \nThere had not been ethnic cleansing until the bombing started. It was 3 \ndays after the bombing started that Milosevic sent his troops south \ninto one of the most vicious displays of violence that I suppose anyone \nhas ever seen against a basically defenseless people. They burned \nhouses, ran people out, moved families and children. You saw them on \nTV. They were on wagons; they were walking; they were on mules and on \nhorses, trying to survive in those camps. They ran them out.\n\n  I say to you, do not let anybody make the case that we had to bomb to \nstop that kind of ethnic cleansing. The ethnic cleansing started after \nwe started the bombing--3 days. This effort with the NATO air \ncampaign--what a blunder that was.\n  By the way, we also announced that in the conduct of this war we \nwould never use ground troops. That gave Milosevic a serious basis for \nconfidence that certain things would not happen. He would not be \nthreatened by events by which he could otherwise have been threatened. \nWe were unwilling to use troops. He didn't have to prepare certain \ndefenses because we eliminated the possibility that ground troops would \nbe used.\n  We were told this would be a joint air effort and we would have \nplanes from other countries. Others did participate, but 75 percent of \nthe actual combat missions were flown by U.S. pilots. In fact, it is a \ntrue statement to say that NATO meant to deploy the U.S. Air Force. \nThey told our Air Force whom to bomb, when to bomb, and how to do it. \nThey rejected our air commander's advice about how to conduct the war, \nand even General Clark's advice on many matters.\n  So I asked our Air Force commander did he oppose this and did he \nthink it was wrong the way they started controlling the targets he \nthought should have been hit. He said, ``Yes.'' I asked him, ``Did this \nprolong the war?'' He said, ``Yes.'' I said, ``Did it cost innocent \nlives because they didn't follow your advice?'' He said, ``Yes, sir.'' \nWhy? Because President Clinton and Schroder and Tony Blair were \nconducting a political war, not a real war, in many ways.\n  It took 78 days to complete this thing, resulting in the complete \nethnic cleansing of Kosovo and extraordinary damage in Yugoslavia and \nin Kosovo and in areas surrounding there--a colossal disaster. How can \nanybody suggest otherwise? This was not a great victory, as some have \ntried to portray it. It was a disaster that, Lord knows, we should have \ndone everything to avoid. As Henry Kissinger and others told us: If we \nget in there and deploy, it is going to be difficult to get out. We are \ngoing to be stuck. You do not want to be committed in the midst of \nthese hostilities to a long-term occupation in Kosovo and those areas. \nYou will find it difficult to get out.\n  That is exactly what happened. In addition to this, our relationship \nwith Russia soured. Russia is a big-time world power. Russia had the \nopportunity to be our ally. But our relationship with Russia over the \nlast number of years has deteriorated. If you think this war didn't \nhave anything to do with it, you are mistaken. They were very upset \nabout the way this was conducted. It was basically a NATO attack on a \nnon-NATO nation which posed no real military threat to any other NATO \nnation. They didn't like that. They have an identity with the Serbs. So \nit made the Russians very unhappy.\n\n[[Page S4094]]\n\n  Another nation that was very unhappy and with whom our relationship \nsuffered was China. We, in the course of this, hit a Chinese embassy. \nThey didn't like this from the beginning. They didn't like the idea of \nNATO attacking an independent sovereign nation. They opposed that and \nwere paranoid about that. Then we hit their embassy, and that made it \nworse.\n  We were told we had to end this war to help the economic growth and \nprosperity in the Balkans. Well, let me ask you, does anybody believe \nthis war has helped the economic condition in Kosovo, Romania, \nBulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, or Macedonia? It has been a very \nunfortunate setback for those areas. Investment has slowed down \nsubstantially. People are nervous about investing in Yugoslavia and in \nthose other areas. Don't forget, Yugoslavia itself has really been \nsavaged.\n  The whole area has not benefited, in my view, as a result of this \nwar. How can it be argued otherwise?\n  It has been a constant drain on our defense budget. I serve on the \nArmed Services Committee. I am very concerned about our inability to \nfind necessary funds to take care of our soldiers' salaries and health \ncare, and to keep our retention and recruitment up. Every day I see a \nneed to invest in new weapons that we may need to have on the \nbattlefield 10 or 15 years from now. We don't have the money to do it. \nI see $2 billion--$1.7 billion in consecutive years--going into Kosovo. \nThat is real money that could do incredible things for our Defense \nDepartment.\n  We are also troubled by Operation Tempo, the OPTEMPO, and the \nrequirements placed on our men and women in uniform to be away from \nhome.\n  When you are there you see how dedicated our men and women are. When \nI was there this past Easter, we arrived at Camp Eagle Saturday night \nat 7 or 8 o'clock. I was there at 8:30 p.m., and a young officer that I \nknew asked me if I would be interested in speaking to a class. I said \nsure, I would be glad to. It was a political science class. ``Come on \nand go with me.'' I was walking off. This is Easter Sunday, a weekend, \non a Saturday night at 8:30. There is a class going on. Sure enough, \nthere were 25 soldiers studying a college class after a full day at \nwork. The hours are basically 12 hours a day, or 10 hours a day, and \nsometimes 14 or 15 hours a day, counting PD. They give themselves \ntotally to it and are tremendous soldiers. They are doing what they are \ncalled upon to do.\n  We also were there when with the Texas National Guard. We visited \nthem. The Texas National Guard has 700 National Guard members who were \ntaken from their communities and sent there to operate the command \ncenter. They are doing a great job.\n  But with regard to all of the soldiers, guardsmen, and active duty, \nthey have families. They know that this is not an action that is \ncritical to the national security. They feel as if they are helping. \nThey feel as if they may be keeping people from shooting one another. \nBut they wonder if it is ever going to end. Is it getting any better? \nAre they in the long term really being successful in what they are \ndoing? When they call their wives and family--they have young \nchildren--they wonder whether they need to reenlist because they count \nup how many months and weeks and days of the last 1, 2, 3, or 4 years \nthey have been away from their home while their children are growing \nup. They are wondering whether or not they want to reenlist and stay \nin. We can't ask too much of our soldiers. We have a limited number of \ntroops. Our active duty forces are down 40 percent, really more than 40 \npercent in personnel since the wall fell. That is a major reduction.\n  But our OPTEMPO is higher than it has been any time in recent memory. \nWe have troops committed all over the world. It drains us financially. \nIt drains our families and servicemen and servicewomen. It causes them \nto wonder about whether or not they should reenlist.\n  I don't think it is wise. We have to be sure what we do.\n  I suggest that this Congress has been supportive of our troops. We \nmade sure they had sufficient resources to build quarters, if the Army \nasked for them. If you go over there and look at them, they are \npermanent quarters. We are talking about having our troops out shortly. \nWe bring a police force in, and when we create a local government, our \ntroops get out.\n  I was in Bosnia and Kosovo a few weeks ago. When we asked how long \nthey would be here, and how long will it be before you can leave, they \nhad no answer. They just would not say. They would not tell you that \nthey saw any prospect that circumstances were such they could easily \nleave.\n  In Bosnia, after 5 years of commitment, they were just a few weeks \nago having city elections.\n  Can you imagine that? The United Nations is supposed to create civil \ngovernment. We are supposed to be able to get our troops out. It has \nbeen 5 years, and they just now are beginning to have a civil \ngovernment.\n  Many nations committed to sending over 5,000 police to Kosovo. These \nare retired police officers, and police officers who took a leave from \nvarious countries. They were supposed to go into the towns and cities \nin Kosovo and help create law and order, create a legal system, and \ncreate a government. We wanted to have government there. It is not \nhappening.\n  We have committed our police there. But many of the NATO countries \nhave not gotten their police there. They have not been effectively led, \nin my opinion, by the United Nations. The government building plans of \nthe United Nations are not being effectively carried out.\n  What does that mean? Does that mean we just stay there forever?\n  Both Senator Warner and Senator Byrd are saying we need to talk about \nthis thing. We represent the people of the United States of America who \nare putting up $2 billion a year for this operation, and we want to \nknow what is going on.\n  I don't often agree with Barney Frank in the House of \nRepresentatives, but he said in the debate on this issue that we are \njust ``enabling'' the Europeans and the U.N. in their bad habits. We \nare enabling them. We could stay there, stay there, stay there, and \nthey don't have to complete what they promised to complete to create a \ncivil government.\n  Who pays the bill? The American taxpayers pay the bill.\n  We have a responsibility in this Congress. We have not really had a \ndebate in this Congress since we voted on whether or not to allow the \nPresident to proceed with the air war when it happened.\n  We have not discussed this issue seriously. The American people have \nnot heard it discussed here, and neither have we debated it on the \nfloor of this Senate.\n  I salute Senator Warner and Senator Byrd for, if nothing else, \ncausing this debate to be joined.\n  People ask me about it. How did this happen? I thought you had to \ndeclare war. What is the matter with you Congressmen and Senators? The \nPresident just sends troops anywhere, starts dropping bombs anywhere, \nand you guys are just there like a potted plant?\n  That is basically what has happened. We have been sitting here \nallowing it to go on and enabling the Europeans and the U.N. to fail to \nfulfill their responsibilities while the taxpayers pay the bill.\n  I wish it weren't so. I think the people in Kosovo and in Bosnia are \nwonderful people. I don't know how they got into this kind of hatred \nand bitterness that leads to this kind of violence. But it is reality. \nWe have the ability to do something about it.\n  I recall that General MacArthur was able to create a government in \nJapan, and General Marshall and General Eisenhower reestablished \nGermany after being devastated in World War II.\n\n  We have a situation in which nobody is really in charge. Nobody is \nbeing held accountable.\n  At our hearings, the witnesses and even the military witnesses \nstarted talking about the international community. I asked: Who is the \ninternational community? Well, it is the groups of NGOs, private \norganizations, the World Bank, and NATO and all these things. I said: \nDo they meet somewhere? Do they vote? Do they make commitments? Do they \nsign agreements that they will do certain things as a group, this \ninternational community? No. Who does? NATO, U.N., and individual \nnations. That is who makes agreements that stick by them or don't stick \nby them. We have not held the U.N., NATO, and European\n\n[[Page S4095]]\n\nnations accountable. We have enabled them to continue in their bad \nactivities. We need to stop that. We have a responsibility. I am not \nsaying we need to pull out right now.\n  They say: Just vote to cut off funds; that is all you have to do. \nDon't vote for this resolution; it is something next year. Just vote to \ncut off funds.\n  What would happen if we did that? They would say: This is horrible. \nYou can't vote to cut off funds. We haven't made any plans for it. You \njust up and cut off funds; that is an unwise and risky thing.\n  I agree. I don't think it would be wise to vote to cut off all funds \nand bring troops home tomorrow. I am not sure that is a wise process.\n  I like the idea of this amendment that says: NATO and all the \nEuropean nations, if you don't fulfill your commitments, we are getting \nout of there. NATO, other European nations, we expect some progress \nmade in establishing a civil government and we will vote a year from \nnow and debate this issue. We hope things are improving and we can \ncontinue to be phasing down our troops and getting ourselves out of \nthere. But you need to know that we are not a rubber stamp or a potted \nplant. This Congress does not have to keep funding this operation. You \ncan be sure next July we will have that vote and some progress needs to \nbe made. We need to see something working.\n  The truth is, we are stuck. The question is, How do we get unstuck? \nJust vote to get out all at once? I think this kind of legislation is \nfar better. I believe it is the right approach. I salute Chairman \nWarner.\n  Somebody said a majority of the House of Representatives didn't \nvote to support this effort. They didn't vote to support it. They \ndidn't support it. They didn't think it was a good idea. They allowed \nthe President to do it, and they provided the funds to him to do it but \nthey haven't liked it. When called on to vote, they didn't vote for it.\n\n  Mr. President, 39 out of 100 Senators in this body voted against the \nbombing. It has never been a universally supported activity. I don't \nknow why we would have been afraid to have a vote. Why would it be that \nthe Senate would be afraid to set a date to have a debate? I think that \nis what we should do.\n  Let me say one more thing as I begin to close and bring this into \ncontext. I do not believe our Nation should be isolationist. I do not \nbelieve our Nation should withdraw from the world. I do believe there \nmay be times that we are going to have to intervene all by ourselves, \nperhaps to preserve humanitarian rights, to protect the lives of \ninnocent human beings when we have no strategic interest at all. But we \nhave to be careful about that. We provided the military force, the air \nforce to win this war. This is a European area. It is the backdoor of \nEurope. Kosovo has only 2 million people. We will debate in a few days \ngiving aid to Colombia; Colombia is a nation of 38 million. No other \ncountry will help Colombia. On a scale of 1 to 10, they are far, far \nmore important to this country than Kosovo, an agrarian area in the \nbackdoor of Europe where European nations have a much more important \ninterest in it than we do.\n  We helped them. We did our role for NATO. We won the war. We did the \nbombing. We got the Kosovars home. I would never have proposed stopping \nthat bombing after those Kosovar people had been run out of their \nhomes. We had to see it through to the end once it started. I believe \nit could have been avoided. It strikes me odd that many Members on the \nother side of the aisle, the Democratic side of the aisle, tenaciously \nfought President Bush in his effort to deal with the problem in Iraq \nand Kuwait. That effort was clearly in the national interests of the \nUnited States.\n  Saddam Hussein was an expansionist. He moved, using the wealth he had \nand the large population and army he had--unlike little Kosovo--south \ninto an independent nation that had even more oil and took that nation \nof Kuwait. Everybody knew he would be turning his attention next to the \nother gulf states, to Saudi Arabia, and his plan was to take over all \nof the Middle East and all of its oil and use that wealth to create an \narmy that could threaten the peace of the whole region. That was a \nthreat. It was opposed almost unanimously by the Democrats in this \nbody. By only a few votes was President Bush able to convince us of \nthat war, a critical act for the United States. It would have been an \nabsolute disaster had we allowed that to happen. We had to act.\n  That is what the role of the United States is. This didn't meet any \nof those criteria. It does surprise me where we don't have a national \ninterest, people want to involve themselves. Our resources are limited. \nI have been on the budget. We need the best soldiers, the best planes, \nand the best weapons in the world. We never want to see our soldiers be \nsubjected to the kind of attacks of the Iraqi Army, being slaughtered \nby superior force. We never want to see that happen.\n  How do we keep it from happening? We maintain a technological edge. \nHow do we do it? We spend money on it. But if we are spending $2 \nbillion a year in Kosovo, spending money in Haiti, Somalia, or East \nTimor, time and time again, it affects our ability to modernize our \nmilitary. Actually, it was that technology that allowed us to win. \nThere are going to be other challenges. We will have other challenges. \nI believe we can meet them if we are not overdrawn.\n\n  Recently, the Armed Services Committee heard from Ashton Carter, now \na professor at Harvard. He served for several years as a high official \nin the Clinton Department of Defense. He talked about what the United \nStates ought to be doing there. He said we keep talking about being in \na post-cold-war era. He said that has been 10 years. All that means is \nwe haven't developed a foreign policy for the future. That means we \ndon't know what we are doing. We are in a post-cold-war era. We need a \nnew vision for America.\n  He suggested what we ought to do. He gave three lists of threats to \nthis country: the A list, B list, and C list. The A list were threats \nfrom Russia, China, terrorism, and chemical warfare. This war in Kosovo \nhas damaged our relationship with Russia and China.\n  He listed a B list. He said a B list threat would be serious, perhaps \na war in the theater of Northeast Asia or Southeast Asia, a major war \nin one of those areas. That could happen. That could threaten the \nUnited States.\n  He listed a third list, the C list, and this is what he put on the C \nlist: Kosovo, Bosnia, East Timor, Somalia, Haiti. His comments were \nthat we are spending our time and our money reacting to events on the C \nlist and not focusing our time and resources in confronting those \nthreats that jeopardize the freedom and peace of this world.\n  That is what the role of the United States is to be. We have to be \nready for the big threat. There is a limit to how many of these wars in \nwhich we can be involving ourselves.\n  Mr. President, I have great affection for the people I have gotten to \nknow in Kosovo and Bosnia and Croatia. I am impressed with the \nstruggles they are undergoing, and we want to help them, but we have \ndone our bit. We have conducted this war. We have gotten the Kosovar \npeople back home. We have done everything we could. I wish we had done \nit smarter, but we committed and we stayed through and we have gotten \nthem there. Now the question is, Do we stay forever? Are we going to \nhave an ability in this Congress to confront the future? Do we have a \nright to demand the President of the United States submit to us a plan \nfor continuation there so we and the American people can evaluate it \nand vote yes or no? Is that unreasonable? Is that going to destroy \nNATO? Is that going to destroy the morale of our troops? I say no.\n  As a matter of fact, it will be healthy for NATO to realize we are \nnot going to continue to enable bad policies to continue. It will be \ngood for our troops to know we are debating and caring about them, \ntrying to make the right decision about them. I believe the Byrd-Warner \nbill is a reasonable and fair bill practically. I believe it validates \nthe historic constitutional responsibilities of the great U.S. Senate. \nWe are not potted plants. We do have a responsibility, and we ought to \nperform it.\n  I salute Chairman Warner. I have never seen a person I admire more. I \nhave never seen a person with greater commitment to the good of this \ncountry. He believes it is time for us to make some decisions, enter \ninto some debate, and involve the American people.\n\n[[Page S4096]]\n\n  So I say it is the right thing to do. I have enjoyed being there, \nenjoyed meeting our troops. I do not want to do anything that would \nhurt them. But I am not one who believes we have to sit here and get a \nletter from General Wesley Clark and hide under the table. He did not \nget elected. He does not have the responsibility to make choices among \nhealth insurance, defense, and criminal justice, as we do. He does not \nhave to go back to his voters and explain why it is in our critical \nnational interest that their young men and women are committed around \nthe globe, as we do.\n  I believe we can improve this commitment. I believe we can improve \nour effort in the world if we talk about these issues more openly. I \nbelieve this bill will lead us in that direction and I support it. I am \nproud to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                        Maritime Patrol Aircraft\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I do not want this issue to come up \ntomorrow at the markup on the defense bill, so I am doing this tonight \nso there is no misunderstanding.\n  Not long after visiting Joint Interagency Task Force East an learning \nof the lack of readiness in the maritime patrol aircraft fleet, I made \na second trip to Joint Interagency Task Force West and Coast Guard \nPacific Area to determine whether this was a nationwide problem, or \nsimply a problem of resource allocation.\n  Unfortunately, what I learned is that the Coast Guard is in dire need \nof additional maritime patrol aircraft to backfill, supplement, and \nexpand the Coast Guard capability to meet the many defense-related, \ndrug interdiction, maritime enforcement and protection, and other \naviation related missions.\n  This amendment, which has been cleared on both sides of the aisle, is \na first step toward addressing this glaring deficiency in our \noperational readiness in Coast Guard maritime patrolling capability.\n  This amendment provides for the acquisition of six C-130J aircraft \nwhich will provide a unit size capability and allow the better \nallocation of all Coast Guard maritime patrol aircraft resources \nnationwide.\n  I send the amendment to the desk and ask that it be considered as \npart of the managers' package when it is presented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I applaud the Stevens/Coverdell \namendment submitted tonight by the Senator from Alaska, appropriating \nfunds for six C-130Js for the Coast Guard. Senator Stevens knows first \nhand of the Coast Guard's need for additional maritime patrol aircraft \nto meet the multiple aviation missions with which they are tasked. \nThrough my close work with the Coast Guard and their efforts in our \nnation's war on drugs, I have also seen the need for these planes.\n  In 1998, Senator DeWine and I introduced the Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act which restored a balanced drug control strategy by \nrenewing our nation's commitment to international drug eradication and \ninterdiction efforts. A crucial component of this strategy is the work \nthe Coast Guard performs in guarding America's shores from drug \ndealers. One of the many areas the Coast Guard identified as needing \nimprovement to fulfill this mission was their maritime patrol aircraft \nfleet. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Loy said, in reference to the \ndemands placed on the C-130 ``We've lost a full 25 percent or our \navailability while piling on additional mission requirements.'' It \nshould also be noted that the Coast Guard flies their C-130s a third \nmore hours than do the military services each year and the services own \nsignificantly more C-130s than the Coast Guard does.\n  Mr. President, the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act passed the \nCongress just two years ago and now, through this amendment Senator \nDeWine and I have cosponsored with Senator Stevens, we are seeing the \nfruits of that effort. I am pleased to see that Congress is working to \nhelp the Coast Guard meet its many missions, particularly its efforts \nto end the scourge of illegal drugs plaguing this country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, yesterday, the United States Senate took a \nprocedural vote on Senator Daschle's amendment to S. 2521, the military \nconstruction appropriations bill. Senator Daschle lost this procedural \nvote by 42-54.\n  I did not support the Daschle amendment at that time because it was a \nprocedural amendment to an unrelated bill. This unrelated Daschle \namendment kept the Senate away all day from the important business of \nthe military construction appropriations bill. In addition, it appeared \nthat the Daschle amendment might indefinitely delay consideration of \nthis important bill. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I have a responsibility to secure passage of the important \nmilitary construction appropriations bill. This bill provides \ncritically needed funding for military construction projects, improves \nthe quality of life for the men and women who are serving our country \nin the armed forces, and sustains the readiness of our armed forces. \nThese areas are traditionally underfunded, and this bill provides the \nnecessary funds to help make up for this shortfall. For these reasons, \nI did not support the Daschle amendment when it came before me on a \nprocedural vote on May 16, 2000.\n  Subsequent to the procedural vote on the Daschle amendment on May 16, \n2000, Senators Lott and Daschle reached an agreement to have two up or \ndown votes--one on the aforementioned Daschle amendment and another on \nan amendment to be offered by Senator Lott. Under the agreement, debate \non the amendments was limited by a time agreement.\n  Once this leadership agreement was reached, it became apparent that \nthe Daschle amendment would no longer indefinitely delay the military \nconstruction appropriations bill. Therefore, my previous objections to \nthis amendment were no longer relevant.\n  The Daschle amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. After \nstating a number of findings, the amendment states, among other things, \nthat it is the sense of the Senate that ``Congress should immediately \npass a conference report to accompany'' the juvenile justice bill that \nincludes the Senate passed gun-related provisions.\n  During the Senate's debate of the juvenile justice bill in May of \n1999, I supported the Lautenberg amendment, and other amendments to \nclose the gun show loophole in the Brady act. I also supported an \namendment to require licensed firearm dealers to provide a secure gun \nstorage or safety device when a handgun is sold, delivered or \ntransferred. Unfortunately, the juvenile justice bill has been locked \nin a House and Senate conference committee.\n  I remain firm in my stance on these issues. I certainly hope that \nHouse and Senate conferees can reach an agreement in conference on the \njuvenile justice bill. And I will continue to support the common sense \ngun provisions that passed the Senate during the juvenile justice \ndebate. I believe the Senate passed gun-related amendments to the \njuvenile justice bill will help keep guns out of the hands of convicted \nfelons and increase public safety without infringing on the rights of \nlaw-abiding citizens. Therefore, when it became clear that the Daschle \namendment would not indefinitely delay consideration of the military \nconstruction appropriations bill, I supported this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/17/senate-section/article/S4096-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4096]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Mr President, it is a great honor for me to represent \nthe people of South Dakota in the United States Senate. On occasion, I \nhave the opportunity to recognize individual South Dakotans for their \naccomplishments, and, today, it brings me great pleasure to focus the \nattention of everyone in this chamber on one of South Dakota's most \ntalented and determined athletes.\n  Rod DeHaven, a native of Huron, South Dakota, and a graduate of South \nDakota State University, won the U.S.\n\n[[Page S4097]]\n\nOlympic Marathon Trials last week in Pittsburgh. Braving eighty degree \ntemperatures and high humidity, Rod fought off the sweltering weather \nand his competition and completed the race in just over two hours and \nfifteen minutes. Rod's incredible effort and inspiring victory in \nPittsburgh earned him a spot on our Olympic team, and later this year \nhe will travel to Sydney, Australia, to represent the United States in \nthe marathon in the 2000 Olympic games.\n  Anyone who has ever trained for or run a marathon can tell you \nwithout equivocation that the work required to put them in a position \njust to finish the twenty-six mile race is exceptional. Having run my \nfirst marathon last year, I can only imagine the extraordinary effort \nit must take to compete and win at the national and international \nlevel. Rod DeHaven--who, in addition to training for marathons and \nworking full-time as a computer programmer--is also raising two young \nchildren with his wife, Shelli, clearly has the work ethic it takes to \nbe a great long-distance runner.\n  Last week in Pittsburgh, however, Rod proved that he had much more \nthan just a strong work ethic. In outrunning some of this country's \ntoughest competitors in extremely difficult conditions, he also proved \nthat he has the heart and courage of a champion.\n  Rod learned what it takes to be a champion growing up in South \nDakota. As a member of the Huron Tigers cross-country and track teams \nin the eighties, Rod was a cross country state champion in the fall of \n1983, and in track, he was state champion in the mile, two-mile and \ntwo-mile relay in both 1983 and 1984. Rod attended college at South \nDakota State University where he won the North Central Conference cross \ncountry championships as a freshman and the NCAA Division II indoor \n1500 meter championship as a sophomore.\n  South Dakota has produced some tremendous long distance runners \nthrough the years, and Rod DeHaven is the latest in that great line. In \n1964, another young man from South Dakota named Billy Mills stunned the \nworld with his remarkable victory in the 10,000 meters in the Tokyo \nOlympics. Billy's story became legendary, and it is no surprise that in \na state known for hard work, we are now sending another one of our best \nto compete in one of the Olympic Game's most challenging and difficult \nevents.\n  All of South Dakota is pulling for Rod DeHaven as he heads to Sydney, \nand we wish him the best of luck as he strives to be the next gold \nmedal winner from our great state.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/17/senate-section/article/S4097-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nachievements of an outstanding student from Somers, Montana. Each year \nthe American Association of University Women--Montana sponsors an essay \ncontest for high school students in grades 10-12. The subject of this \nessay contest is ``Women in Montana.'' Students are to research and \nwrite about Montana women who have contributed to the quality of life \nof this wonderful State.\n  This year's top essay was written by Adrienne Maxwell, an outstanding \nyoung woman attending Flathead High School. Her essay was chosen the \nbest of all those in Montana and received first place in the contest. \nShe writes about her mother, an immigrant who is no stranger to \nsacrifice and struggles, but believes through hard work comes triumph. \nHer essay tells the story of a woman with the true spirit, drive, and \ndetermination to achieve her goals while making a home for her family \nin a new land and never failing to give generously back to her \ncommunity.\n  I am pleased to acknowledge, on behalf of all Montanans, Adrienne \nMaxwell's achievement and ask that her essay ``Katherine Maxwell: A \nMontana Immigrant'' be printed in the Record.\n\n                 Katherine Maxwell: A Montana Immigrant\n\n                         (By Adrienne Maxwell)\n\n       The first women to come to Montana were often immigrants \n     from other lands. They left their homes, knowing they would \n     probably never again see the friends and relatives they left \n     behind. Once here, they worked hard every day, to make a good \n     life for their families. My mother, Katherine Maxwell, is an \n     immigrant as well, though she arrived in Montana in 1983 and \n     not 1883. She did not face life on the frontier, but has \n     shown some of the same qualities of hard work and \n     determination to succeed shown by early Montana women.\n       As a child in Upper Hutt, New Zealand, Katherine developed \n     a strong work ethic at a young age with the encouragement of \n     her strict, yet supportive parents. The oldest of four \n     children, she was expected to always do her best at school \n     and to do her chores well, and with a good attitude. Her dad \n     was the manager of Carey's department store. In fact, Carey's \n     was where Katherine began working, at age twelve, doing small \n     jobs in the back warehouse. As soon as she reached the legal \n     age of fifteen, she worked during school vacations as a shop \n     assistant. As the ``boss' daughter'', she had to be a model \n     worker.\n       She studied at Victoria University in Wellington, New \n     Zealand's capital city. She majored in History, and minored \n     in English, then obtained a law degree. Part-time jobs in \n     college included working as a nurse's aid in a geriatric \n     hospital, test-tube cleaner in the biochemistry department \n     (``grosser than the hospital''), receptionist in a doctor's \n     office, waitress, and law clerk. Through her hard work, she \n     managed to graduate debt-free. She then worked in the legal \n     department of a government department, and later as an \n     associate attorney with the old established law firm of Lane, \n     Neave, and Co., in Christchurch. She didn't know before she \n     attempted it whether or not she would be a good trial lawyer, \n     but thrown in the proverbial deep end, she swam!\n       However, as a child she had had another dream, a dream of \n     traveling the world. So she saved every penny and made plans \n     for her overseas trip. As a final sacrifice to the travel \n     fund, she sold her first and beloved car, the elephant-\n     colored and shaped ``Horton'', a 1957 Wolsely.\n       Katherine globe-trotted for about four years, picking up \n     odd jobs every now and then, to pay for her next plane \n     ticket. Finally it was time for her to settle down and get \n     serious about a career. Those plans were derailed when, \n     through an odd set of circumstances, involving at least three \n     continents, she fell in love with and married my father, and \n     ended up in Kalispell, Montana, in a little house and their \n     first child, me, was born.\n       Although her life differed markedly from that of a pioneer \n     woman (she spoke English, and had the necessities of life) \n     being a newcomer and far from friends and family, with a new \n     baby to care for was lonely and difficult at first. She \n     adapted, and like those early women, got to work, making a \n     home for her family and becoming part of her community.\n       Although her first, and most important, Montana job was to \n     raise her children, Katherine knew she wanted to help people \n     outside her small family. She believed becoming a lawyer was \n     impossible, as her law degree was not from an ``American Bar \n     Association Approved'' law school. When she heard Montana \n     Inter Country Adoption was looking for a part-time social \n     worker, she thought she could do the job and applied for it. \n     Traveling all over Western Montana, she visited the homes of \n     hopeful adoptive parents, and assessed whether or not this \n     would be a suitable home for a child from overseas who needed \n     a loving family. She loved being a part of creating families, \n     bringing together parents and children. When the agency \n     closed she was forced to think of a new career.\n       As she began to consider a career in law once again, as a \n     paralegal, she realized the\n\n[[Page S4098]]\n\n     fact that she couldn't use a computer or type might be a \n     problem so she went back to school and learned how. When she \n     thought she was qualified, applied for a paralegal position \n     at Warden, Christiansen, Johnson and Berg, the oldest, and \n     largest, law firm in Northwest Montana.\n       She enjoyed working as a paralegal, but missed the \n     responsibility of having her own clients. With the \n     encouragement of her employers, she petitioned the Supreme \n     Court for the opportunity to take the bar exam. Such \n     petitions are rarely successful, and she was shocked when \n     hers was. The review course she took during a sweltering \n     Montana summer, was the hardest work she had ever done. \n     Leaving her family to live in her ``little cell'' of a dorm \n     room was hardly an ideal way to spend June and July. Yet she \n     hoped that if she studied night and day, she could reach her \n     goal. After the three day test was over, she felt \n     discouraged. She could just tell that, despite her efforts, \n     it was too much to cram four years of law school into six \n     weeks. Katherine drove home, and was prepared to take the \n     exam again in a few months' time.\n       Then, in early September, the letter came. To her amazement \n     she had passed the impossible exam and she was a lawyer \n     again.\n       The work didn't stop there. To this day, she continues to \n     get to the office early, and stay late if necessary, working \n     her hardest to make sure her clients get the justice they \n     deserve. Her life story so far may not be one of enduring the \n     rigors of a life in a newly settled land, but she has shown \n     the same qualities: having the drive inside of her, to get up \n     each day, work her hardest, and provide for her family. The \n     true spirit shared by all Montana women has always been that \n     although there will be struggles, through hard work, you will \n     triumph. Katherine Maxwell is the perfect example of this \n     spirit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/17/senate-section/article/S4098-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  YOUTH HONORED FOR VOLUNTEER EFFORTS\n\n Mr. DORGAN.

They were named the top high \nschool and middle level youth volunteers in North Dakota last February, \nand were two out of 104 youth honored out of millions of youth in the \nUnited States.\n  Jason was recognized for his fund-raising efforts for the Make-a-Wish \nFoundation. Scot helped raise funds for a city library expansion \nproject and started a community recycling program. In recognition of \ntheir community involvement, they each received a $1,000 cash award, an \nengraved silver medallion and an all-expense paid trip to Washington, \nD.C., for last week's events.\n  I am honored to have been a part of the 2000 Prudential Spirit of \nCommunity Awards Ceremony on May 8, where Senator Susan Collins and I \nhad the opportunity to recognize the outstanding accomplishments of \nthis group of youth volunteers.\n  The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards were created by Prudential \nin 1995 to encourage youth volunteerism and to identify and reward \nyoung role models. It operates in partnership with the National \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals.\n  We should all take a moment to feel great pride in our nation's \nyouth. These students show exactly what type of compassion and \ncommitment is possible at any age. With their community spirit, our \nfuture is in good hands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/17/senate-section/article/S4098-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4098]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       A TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF HARRY L. GARDNER, SR.\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I rise with great sadness. On \nMonday, May 15, 2000, Harry L. Gardner, Sr.--a quiet giant in the long \nhistory of Delaware civil rights--died. He was a man whose very \npresence, literally, brought calm to the most difficult, seemingly \nintractable problems of race at the height of the civil rights movement \nin Delaware.\n  When citizens first heard that the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King \nhad been assassinated in April of 1968, what was once a cauldron of \nmounting tension between disillusioned African-Americans and Whites \nexploded into a series of violent and destructive acts--on both sides--\nreflective of unrest, resentment, and downright anger.\n  As you may know, of the many inner-cities ravaged by full-scale \nrioting and violence during this time period, Wilmington, Delaware--my \nhometown--was the only urban area where the National Guard occupied the \ncity for an extended period of time. Indeed, for nine months, police \nofficers and guardsmen patrolled the streets of Wilmington in an effort \nto bring order to what was seen by many in the mainstream as chaos.\n  As a young attorney, continually advocating for equity and social \njustice for African-Americans and other minorities, I saw things quite \ndifferently than many of my mainstream counterparts.\n  There were reasons for my own view: my Mom and Dad, who taught many \nlessons about the importance of equality, liberty and justice for all \ncitizens; the people of East Side and East Lake, predominantly African-\nAmerican communities where I spent a few summers life-guarding for \nneighborhood children; and African-American leaders like Harry L. \nGardner, who taught me to believe that if I could not change the world \nand the view of race relations, there was no reason that I could not \nset a standard by which I lived my own life and became an example for \nothers.\n  This was, in fact, the beauty of Harry Gardner. For 35 years, I had \nthe pleasure of knowing a man whose deep respect for people engendered \na deep respect for him. During the period of National Guard occupation, \nHarry was one of a very select group of people who were allowed to talk \nto rioters during racial disturbances. He was depended upon by city \nofficials and neighborhood residents both to help in diffusing \nthreatening situations and to continue to articulate the very \nlegitimate concerns of African-American people. Though quite a \ndifficult tightrope to walk, Harry made it look easy. In no small part, \nit was his ability to touch the heart of diverse groups of people and \nfind common ground that, in effect, saved the city.\n  This, however, is just a portion Harry Gardner's legacy. While a \ncareer officer at the Ferris School, a juvenile correctional facility \nfor adolescent boys, Harry founded Northeast Civic Alliance, chaired \nthe Wilmington Police & Community Advisory Council and the Wilmington \nFire & Community Council and helped start and maintain a group home for \ntroubled youth. Yet, having said all of this, Harry received few \naccolades for his many faithful years of service. He was self-effacing, \nand traded in recognition and reward for diligent, undaunted self \nsacrifice for the voiceless in our community.\n  We may all know a Harry Gardner in our respective communities. A man \nwho changed the way we think through living a reality of public service \nthat surpassed rhetoric and funadmentally changed the way people from \nall different backgrounds see themselves and interact with each other.\n  Dr. W.E.B. DuBois, the famed sociologist and civil rights scholar, \nonce said, ``peace will be my applause.'' Harry, today, we in the \nSenate--and so many others back home-- are all clapping loudly for your \nlife and for its resounding impact in Wilmington and throughout the \nState of Delaware. Your presence will be missed, but your lessons will \nremain in our hearts forever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/17/senate-section/article/S4098-3", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4098-S4099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN RECOGNITION OF THE LAO VETERANS OF AMERICA\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nLao Veterans of America as they mark the 25th Annual Remembrance of the \nUnited States involvement in Laos. During the Vietnam War, many brave \nLaotians and their families chose to fight along side American soldiers \nagainst the North Vietnamese as part of the United States Special \nForces. These brave souls took great risks, and deserve our recognition \nand thanks.\n  Those represented by the Lao Veterans of America served honorably \nduring the conflict in Vietnam. They fought bravely to prevent the \nNorth Vietnamese from invading South Vietnam from Laos, and rescued \nshot down American pilots and brought them to safety. Through their \nactions, countless American lives were saved. These heroic deeds often \nplaced the veterans and their families' lives in great risk as a \nresult.\n\n[[Page S4099]]\n\n  The selfless aid of the Lao Veterans of America is a true testament \nto the cause of freedom around the world. While the causes of this \ntragic conflict may continue to be debated, I believe we can all agree \nthat the sacrifices of the Laotian veterans and their families should \nnot be forgotten, as we owe them a great debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/17/senate-section/article/S4099-1", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/05/17/senate-section/article/S4099-2", "month": "05", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  A 6-MONTH PERIODIC REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO \nSUDAN THAT WAS DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13067 OF NOVEMBER 3, 1997--A \n                   MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 105\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c) and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a \n6-month periodic report on the national emergency with respect to Sudan \nthat was declared in Executive Order 13067 of November 3, 1997.\n                                                  William J.

A resolution adopted by the Board of Commissioners \n     of the Borough of Beach Haven, New Jersey relative to the \n     dumping of dredged material in the ocean; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n       POM-523. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of New Hampshire relative to emission standards \n     for heavy-duty vehicles; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                     House Concurrent Resolution 30\n\n       Whereas, the state of New Hampshire has made significant \n     efforts to improve the state's air quality and reduce air \n     pollutant emissions from many source categories in accordance \n     with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; and\n       Whereas, emissions from mobile sources now contribute a \n     majority of anthropogenic air pollutant emissions within the \n     state and nationwide; and\n       Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     has recently adopted the so-called Tier 2/Gasoline Sulfur \n     Rule which will require significantly reduced emissions from \n     light-duty vehicles such as common passenger vehicles and \n     from sport utility vehicles, will require sport utility \n     vehicle emissions to be reduced to not more than those \n     allowed for common passenger vehicles, and will require \n     significantly decreased levels of sulfur in gasoline during \n     the next few years; and\n       Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     has shown the reductions\n\n[[Page S4102]]\n\n     to be achieved by this adopted Tier 2/Gasoline Sulfur Rule to \n     be cost-effective; and\n       Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     in October, 1999 proposed a strategy to significantly reduce \n     emissions from on-highway heavy-duty vehicles (vehicles of \n     gross vehicle weight over 8,500 pounds), including diesel and \n     gasoline engines used in large commercial trucks, large full-\n     size pickup trucks, passenger vans, and the largest sport \n     utility vehicles; and\n       Whereas, this proposed strategy includes both a first phase \n     of new emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles, and a \n     second phase to be proposed soon which will treat vehicles \n     and fuels as a combined system and introduce both significant \n     additional emission reduction requirements for heavy-duty \n     vehicles and, in order to enable new emissions-control \n     technology on heavy trucks, requirements that the sulfur \n     content of highway diesel fuel be reduced by approximately 90 \n     percent from its current level of 500 parts per million \n     (ppm); and\n       Whereas, diesel vehicle emissions control technology has \n     advanced sufficiently that diesel vehicles can cost-\n     effectively achieve similar emission reductions to \n     requirements recently adopted for gasoline vehicles; and\n       Whereas, non-highway gasoline and diesel vehicles, \n     including construction and farm vehicles and off-road \n     recreational vehicles, as well as other diesel engines, can \n     often achieve emission controls at a similar cost and with \n     similar cost-effectiveness as highway vehicles; and\n       Whereas, reductions in the sulfur content of highway diesel \n     fuel are cost-effective and necessary to enable the use of \n     new diesel vehicle emissions-control technology; and\n       Whereas, changes in fuel formulation are most efficiently \n     and equitably implemented on a nationwide or regionwide \n     basis; and\n       Whereas, in the absence of appropriately stringent \n     nationally applicable standards for heavy-duty vehicle \n     emissions and diesel fuel sulfur, many states may adopt their \n     own standards, resulting in a complex and inefficient \n     regulatory system for vehicles and fuels, with negative \n     financial effects on consumers, manufacturers, and refiners; \n     and\n       Whereas, the estimated cost per ton of emissions reduced in \n     the first phase of the United States Environmental Protection \n     Agency's proposed strategy is less than 1/2 of the cost per \n     ton of the recent Tier 2/Gasoline Sulfur Rule, and less than \n     the cost of many emission reductions currently being required \n     for electricity generation plants; and\n       Whereas, additional financial incentives for vehicle users \n     and fuel suppliers to provide emission reductions beyond \n     those mandated by these rules are likely to produce \n     additional cost-effective emission reductions at minimal \n     cost; and\n       Whereas, Governor Shaheen has written a letter dated \n     February 2, 2000 supporting this concurrent resolution; now, \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring:\n       That the United States Environmental Protection Agency is \n     hereby commended for adopting its so-called Tier 2/Gasoline \n     Sulfur Rule; and\n       That the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     should adopt the new emissions standards for on-highway \n     heavy-duty vehicles proposed in the first phase of its \n     proposed heavy-duty vehicle strategy, without any significant \n     amendment that would weaken the proposed standards; and\n       That the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     should propose and adopt a second phase of integrated vehicle \n     standards and diesel fuel sulfur rules similar to those \n     outlined in its descriptions to date of its heavy-duty \n     vehicle strategy, provided that they are at least as cost-\n     effective as the reductions contained in the Tier 2/Gasoline \n     Sulfur Rule; and\n       That the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     should propose and adopt similar additional integrated \n     vehicle standards and diesel fuel sulfur rules for non-\n     highway gasoline and diesel vehicles, in addition to those \n     for highway vehicles, provided that they are also at least as \n     cost-effective as the reductions contained in the Tier 2/\n     Gasoline Sulfur Rule;

A bill to coordinate and facilitate the development by the \nDepartment of Defense of directed energy technologies, systems, and \nweapons, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n       directed energy coordination and consolidation act of 2000\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the \nDirected Energy Coordination and Consolidation Act of 2000. While \nenactment of the provisions in this bill will greatly enhance and \naccelerate some of the research, development, test and evaluation \nactivities in my home state of New Mexico, I firmly believe taking this \naction is also in our national interest.\n  Last year's Defense Authorization Act required the Defense Department \nto convene the High Energy Laser Executive Review Panel (HELERP). This \nPanel was to make recommendations on a management structure for all \ndefense high energy laser weapons programs. The authorization language \nalso instructed the Panel to address issues in science and technology \nfunding, the industrial base for these technologies, and possible \ncooperation with other agencies.\n  Mr. President, let me briely outline some conclusions and \nrecommendations made by the Panel. The findings include the following:\n  Laser systems are ready for some of today's most challenging weapons \napplications, both offensive and defensive; laser weapons would offer \nthe U.S. an asymmetric technological edge over adversaries for the \nforeseeable future; funding for laser Science and Technology programs \nshould be increased to support acquisition programs and develop new \ntechnologies for future applications; the laser industrial supplier \nbase is fragile in several critical laser technologies and lacks an \nadequate incentive to make investments required to support current and \nanticipated defense needs; DoD should leverage relevant research being \nsupported by the Department of Energy and other agencies, as well as \nthe private sector and academia; and, lastly, as in other critical high \ntech areas, it is increasingly difficult to attract and retain people \nwith the skills necessary for directed energy technology development.\n  In sum, the Panel found that these technologies have matured \nsufficiently to offer solutions to some of the most daunting defense \nchallenges the U.S. currently confronts. However, other findings \nindicated that science and technology funding is inadequate to realize \nthese aims, the industrial base is steadily eroding, and this field \ncannot recruit and retain adequate talent to remain viable. We have the \nmeans, but we're not making the investments required to achieve our \ngoals.\n  As requested by Congress last year, the High Energy Laser Master Plan \napproved by the Defense Department in March of this year proposes a \ndifferent management structure. The Services all approved of this \ndefense-wide management structure for making decisions regarding the \nspecific technologies to pursue for specific defense applications and \nresource allocation.\n  Mr. President, this legislation echoes the findings of the High \nEnergy Laser Executive Review Panel and codifies the proposed \nmanagement structure outlined by the Panel. Furthermore, in accordance \nwith the Panel's findings, the bill authorizes $150 million in defense-\nwide research and development funding for directed energy technologies. \nUp to $50 million of those funds can be utilized to leverage the \ndirected energy expertise and technologies developed within our DOE \nlaboratories. Lastly, this legislation requires that microwave \ntechnology investment decisions also be coordinated within this \nmanagement structure.\n\n[[Page S4104]]\n\n  The bill would relocate the Joint Technology Office (JTO) proposed in \nthe Master Plan from the Pentagon to Albuquerque, New Mexico, by \nJanuary 1, 2001. This Office is currently being established at the \nPentagon. However, the Pentagon is not a focal point for technology \ndevelopments in directed energy. Albuquerque offers a sensible location \nfor the JTO.\n  Support for Albuquerque as a location is offered by the findings of \nthe 912c Tri-Service Armament Panel Report. This Panel Report was an \noutgrowth of the July 1999 DoD ``Plan to Streamline DoD's Science and \nTechnology, Engineering, and Test and Evaluation Infrastructure.'' This \nArmy, Navy and Air Force Senior Steering Group proposed that all DoD \nDirected Energy Science and Technology and Test and Evaluation be \nconsolidated at Kirtland Air Force Base. The Steering Group recommended \ncreation of a DoD Directed Energy Center of Excellence at Kirtland that \nwould be responsible for identifying, advocating, developing, and \ntransitioning directed energy technology to meet all DoD requirements.\n  Now that the High Energy Laser Master Plan has proposed an \nappropriate management structure, the time is right to take action. New \nMexico is already a focal point for a lot of the research, development, \ntest and evaluation activities in this field. Kirtland boasts \ntremendous assets to facilitate this research. White Sands is the \npremiere directed energy testing range. Co-locating the Joint \nTechnology Office among a critical mass of directed energy activities--\nboth Army and Air Force--is not only sensible, it should also serve to \nfacilitate this work.\n  No doubt that the activities of the Air Force's Directed Energy \nDirectorate at Kirtland will be enhanced by this legislation. However, \neach of the Services will be required to compete within this management \nstructure.\n  Let me be clear. Implementation of this management structure, \nregardless of the location of the Joint Technology Office will have no \nimpact on the existing laser programs, such as the Tactical High Energy \nLaser (THEL), Airborne Laser (ABL) or Space-based Laser (SBL). The \nobjective is to grow all directed energy programs desired by any one of \nthe Services, depending on specific applications pursued.\n  Any new programs will be competed--with one exception. The \nlegislation includes a $20 million allocation for the Advanced Tactical \nLaser program under the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program Office in \norder to take a first initial step in addressing some of the industrial \nbase concerns.\n  American dominance relies heavily on our technological superiority. \nUnlike other instances where the Department of Defense is using \noutsourcing or privatization to reduce costs, the attrition within the \nresearch community will require significant renewed investments over a \nlong period of time to rebuild in the future. We are steadily \napproaching this situation in the field of directed energy. The lack of \nemphasis on and investment in revolutionary technologies, such as \ndirected energy, unnecessarily limits the myriad possibilities for \neffective, surgical defense against a range of missile threats and vast \npotential for numerous defense applications.\n  Mr. President, in order to better leverage the federal Government's \ninvestment, ensure adequate stability in the industrial base, and \npromote educational opportunities in directed energy technologies, the \nDirected Energy Coordination and Consolidation Act of 2000 will take a \ncritical first step. I ask my colleagues to join me in ensuring that we \nrigorously pursue directed energy solutions to our nation's defense \nneeds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2573\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I, along with Senators Bingaman, Daschle, \nand Inouye, am introducing legislation to establish an innovative \nfunding mechanism to enhance the ability of Indian tribes to construct, \nrepair, and maintain quality educational facilities. Representatives\n\n[[Page S4107]]\n\nfrom tribal schools in my State of South Dakota have been working with \ntribes nationwide to develop an initiative which I believe will be a \npositive first step toward addressing the serious crisis we are facing \nin Indian education.\n  Mr. President, over 50 percent of the American Indian population in \nthis country is age 24 or younger. Consequently, the need for improved \neducational programs and facilities, and for training the American \nIndian workforce is pressing. American Indians have been, and continue \nto be, disproportionately affected by both poverty and low educational \nachievement. The high school completion rate for Indian people aged 20 \nto 24 was 12.5 percent below the national average. American Indian \nstudents, on average, have scored far lower on the National Assessment \nfor Education Progress indicators than all other students.\n  By ignoring the most fundamental aspect of education; that is, safe, \nquality educational facilities, there is little hope of breaking the \ncycle of low educational achievement, and the unemployment and poverty \nthat result from neglected academic potential.\n  The Indian School Construction Act establishes a bonding authority to \nuse existing tribal education funds for bonds in the municipal finance \nmarket which currently serves local governments across the Nation. \nInstead of funding construction projects directly, these existing funds \nwill be leveraged through bonds to fund substantially more tribal \nschool, construction, maintenance and repair projects.\n  The Bureau of Indian Affairs estimates the tribal school construction \nand repair backlog at over $1 billion. Confounding this backlog, \ninflation and facility deterioration severely increases this amount. \nThe administration's school construction request for fiscal year 2001 \nwas over $62 million. In this budgetary climate, I believe every avenue \nfor efficiently stretching the Federal dollar should be explored.\n  Tribal schools in my State and around the country address the unique \nlearning needs and styles of Indian students, with sensitivity to \nNative cultures, ultimately promoting higher academic achievement. \nThere are strong historical and moral reasons for continued support of \ntribal schools. In keeping with our special trust responsibility to \nsovereign Indian nations, we need to promote the self-determination and \nself-sufficiency of Indian communities. Education is absolutely vital \nto this effort. Allowing the continued deterioration and decay of \ntribal schools through lack of funding would violate the Government's \ncommitment and responsibility to Indian nations and only slow the \nprogress of self-sufficiency.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to closely examine the Indian \nSchool Construction Act and join me in working to make this innovative \nfunding mechanism a reality. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe legislation be added at the end of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2580\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the preservation and restoration of \nhistoric buildings at historically women's public colleges or \nuniversities; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\nhistorically women's public colleges or universities historic building \n                    restoration and preservation act\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to help preserve the heritage of historic women's colleges \nand universities. The United States is presently at mid-point in \nobserving the centennial of the creation of seven unique educational \ninstitutions.\n  There were seven historic women's public colleges or universities \nfounded in the United States between 1884 and 1908 to provide \nindustrial education for women. They include: the University of \nMontevallo in Montevallo, Alabama; the Mississippi University for Women \nin Columbus, Mississippi; the Georgia College and State University in \nMilledgeville, Georgia; the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; \nWinthrop University in Rock Hill, South Carolina; the Texas Woman's \nUniversity in Denton, Texas; and the University of Science and Arts of \nOklahoma, in Chickasha, Oklahoma.\n  These seven public universities all were originally created to \nprovide industrial and vocational education for women who at the time \ncould not attend other public academic institutions. Following the \nindustrial revolution, the United States found it desirable to promote \nagricultural, mechanical, and industrial education. Unfortunately, in \nseven States, the public agricultural and mechanical institutions\n\n[[Page S4109]]\n\ncreated during this period were closed to women. A number of \neducational advocates for women, notably Miss Julia Tutwiler, a native \nof Alabama, had learned extensively about European industrial and \nvocational education and tirelessly advocated the creation of \nindustrial and technical educational opportunities for women. In these \nStates, through major and extended efforts by women like Miss Tutwiler \nand by agrarian organizations, separate public educational institutions \nwere created by the respective State legislatures to provide industrial \nand technical education for women. These schools subsequently became \ncoeducational but retain significant historical and academic features \nof those pioneering efforts to educate women.\n  Currently these public institutions have critical capital needs \nrelated to their historic educational structures. Under this \nlegislation, each school would receive $2 million in federal matching \nfunding each year of the fiscal years 2001-2005. These funds, along \nwith school funds, would be used for the preservation and restoration \nof historic buildings at these colleges and universities.\n  These historically women's public colleges and universities have \ncontributed significantly to the effort to attain equal opportunity \nthrough postsecondary education for women, low-income individuals, and \neducationally disadvantaged Americans.

Mr. President, forty-six years ago today, the \nU.S. Supreme Court in its Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka \ndecision overturned an 1896 ruling that education should be ``separate \nbut equal'' thus outlawing racial segregation in the state school \nsystem. It is important to note that when the ``separate but equal'' \nruling first went into effect in 1896, there were very few colleges and \nuniversities that women could attend. This means that ``separate but \nequal'' meant for men only.\n  Some forty-one years before colleges like the Georgia College and \nState University was founded in 1889, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, an \neminent women's rights leader, drafted a Declaration of Sentiments that \npointed to other areas of life where American women were not treated \nequally. Some of the facts at that time were:\n  Women were not allowed to vote;\n  Women had to submit to laws they had no voice in formulating;\n  Married women had no property rights;\n  Divorce and child custody laws favored men, giving no rights to \nwomen;\n  Most occupations were closed to women, including medicine and law; \nand\n  Women had no means to gain an education since no college or \nuniversity would accept women students.\n  Through the efforts of Ms. Stanton and others, colleges and \nuniversities began to be established with the mission of preparing the \nwomen of our nation to become self-sufficient by affording them an \nopportunity for an education. Today, many of these colleges and \nuniversities are continuing to provide educational opportunities to \nwomen to enable them to continue making significant contributions to \nour country by becoming writers, educators, scientists, heads of state, \npoliticians, civil rights crusaders, artists, entertainers, and \nbusiness leaders. However, some of the historic buildings that were \nbuilt between 1884 and 1908 as institutions of higher learning for \nwomen are beginning to crumble and decay.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of legislation introduced today by \nSenator Sessions which was crafted to allow the preservation and \nrestoration of treasured historic school buildings. The legislation \nwill provide seven colleges and universities with $10 million each for \nfive years to help ensure that some historically significant buildings \nthat were built between 1884 and 1908 at women's public colleges and \nuniversities continue to serve as national symbols of women's early \ncivil rights and as important monuments to the power that knowledge has \nbrought to America's women. I'd like to note that the amounts needed to \nfully rejuvenate the buildings to their former glory is far greater \nthan those provided by this legislation.\n  The list of institutions that need this assistance is quite \nimpressive. One of the seven universities included in this bill is the \nGeorgia College and State University which is located in Georgia's \nantebellum capital, Milledgeville. The University was chartered in 1889 \nas the Georgia Normal and Industrial College and its early emphasis was \non preparing young women for teaching or industrial careers. From the \nbeginning of this prestigious school, the jewels of the university \ncampus have been the former State Governor's mansion and the old \nBaldwin County Court House. General Sherman, while occupying the\n\n[[Page S4110]]\n\ncity of Milledgeville, slept in the mansion and refused to allow it to \nbe burned because he was so impressed with its stateliness. The stately \ncourt house and former Governor's mansion, while continuing to be used \nby the university, are in dire need of repair. The $10 million included \nin the bill for the Georgia College and State University will go a long \nway toward helping to pay the estimated $27 million repair cost for \nthese, and other treasured campus buildings.\n  Today the Georgia College and State University's enrollment has grown \nto an impressive 5,200 students. The institution is now offering more \nthan 65 baccalaureate and 35 graduate degree programs and awards more \nthan 1,100 degrees annually, of which 300 are graduate degrees.\n  It seems that we are living in a disposable world. We have disposable \ntowels, disposable cameras, and disposable contact lenses. Let us not \ndispose of these buildings or the history they represent. I believe \nthat the college and university campus buildings that are to be \npreserved and restored by this legislation will continue to serve our \nnation well by continuing to provide quality education for the leaders \nof tomorrow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Levin, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        McCain, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Cleland, \n        Mr. Kerry, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Bryan):\n  S. 2582.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease disclosure for certain political organizations exempt from tax \nunder section 527; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           legislation regarding section 527 of the tax code\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills \naimed at curtailing the newest threat to the integrity of our nation's \nelection process: the proliferation of so-called stealth PACs operating \nunder Section 527 of the tax code. These groups exploit a recently \ndiscovered loophole in the tax code that allows organizations seeking \nto influence federal elections to fund their election work with \nundisclosed and unlimited contributions at the same time as they claim \nexemption from both federal taxation and the federal election laws.\n  Section 527 of the tax code offers tax exemption to organizations \nprimarily involved in election-related activities, like campaign \ncommittees, party committees and PACs. It defines the type of \norganization it covers as one whose function is, among other things, \n``influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, \nelection, or appointment of any individual to any Federal, State, or \nlocal public office . . . .'' Because the Federal Election Campaign Act \n(``FECA'') uses near identical language to define the entities it \nregulates--organizations that spend or receive money ``for the purpose \nof influencing any election for Federal office''--Section 527 formerly \nhad been generally understood to apply only to those organizations that \nregister as political committees under, and comply with, FECA, unless \nthey focus on State or local activities or do not meet certain other \nspecific FECA requirements).\n  Nevertheless, a number of groups engaged in what they term issue \nadvocacy campaigns and other election-related activity recently began \narguing that the near identical language of FECA and Section 527 \nactually mean two different things. In their view, they can gain \nfreedom from taxation by claiming that they are seeking to influence \nthe election of individuals to Federal office, but may evade regulation \nunder FECA, by asserting that they are not seeking to influence an \nelection for Federal office. As a result--because, unlike other tax-\nexempt groups like 501(c)(3)s and (c)(4)s, Section 527 groups don't \neven have to publicly disclose their existence--these groups gain both \nthe public subsidy of tax exemption and the ability to shield from the \nAmerican public the identity of those spending their money to try to \ninfluence our elections. Indeed, according to news reports, newly-\nformed 527 organizations pushing the agenda of political parties are \nusing the ability to mask the identities of their contributors as a \nmeans of courting wealthy donors seeking anonymity in their efforts to \ninfluence our elections.\n  Because Section 527 organizations are not required to publicly \ndisclose their existence, it is impossible to know the precise scope of \nthis problem. The IRS's private letter rulings, though, make clear that \norganizations intent on running what they call issue ad campaigns and \nengaging in other election-related activity are free to assert Section \n527 status, and news reports provide specific examples of groups taking \nadvantage of these rulings. Roll Call reported the early signs of this \nphenomenon in late 1997, when it published an article on the decision \nof Citizens for Reform and Citizens for the Republic Education Fund, \ntwo Triad Management Services organizations that ran $2 million issue \nad campaigns during the 1996 elections, to switch from 501(c)(4) status \n(which imposes limits on a group's political activity) to 527 status \nafter the 1996 campaigns. A more recent Roll Call report recounted the \nefforts of a team of GOP lawyers and consultants to shop an \norganization called Citizens for the Republican Congress to donors as a \nway to bankroll up to $35 million in pro-Republican issue ads in the 30 \nmost competitive House races. And Common Cause's recent report Under \nThe Radar: The Attack Of The ``Stealth PACs'' On Our Nation's Elections \noffers details on 527 groups set up by politicians (Congressmen J.C. \nWatts and Tom DeLay), industry groups (the pharmaceutical industry-\nfunded Citizens for Better Medicare) and ideological groups from all \nsides of the political spectrum (the Wyly Brothers' Republicans for \nClean Air, Ben & Jerry's Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities and a \n527 set up by the Sierra Club). The advantages conferred by assuming \nthe 527 form--the anonymity provided to both the organization and its \ndonors, the ability to engage in unlimited political activity without \nlosing tax-exempt status, and the exemption from the gift tax imposed \non very large donors--leave no doubt that these groups will proliferate \nas the November election approaches.\n\n  And none of us should doubt that the proliferation of these groups--\nwith their potential to serve as secret slush funds for candidates and \nparties, their ability to run difficult-to-trace attack ads, and their \npromise of anonymity to those seeking to spend huge amounts of money to \ninfluence our elections--poses a real and significant threat to the \nintegrity and fairness of our elections. We all know that the identity \nof the messenger has a lot of influence on how we view a message. In \nthe case of a campaign, an ad or piece of direct mail attacking one \ncandidate or lauding another carries a lot more weight when it is run \nor sent by a group called ``Citizens for Good Government'' or \n``Committee for our Children'' than when a candidate, party or someone \nwith a financial stake in the election publicly acknowledges \nsponsorship of the ad or mailing. Without a rule requiring a group \ninvolved in elections to disclose who is behind it and where the group \ngets its money, the public is deprived of vital information that allows \nit to judge the group's credibility and its message, throwing into \ndoubt the very integrity of our elections. With this incredibly \npowerful tool in their hands, can anyone doubt that come November, we \nwill see more and more candidates, parties and groups with financial \ninterests in the outcome of our elections taking advantage of the 527 \nloophole to run more and more attack ads and issue more and more \nnegative mailings in the name of groups with innocuous-sounding names?\n  But the risk posed by the 527 loophole goes even farther than \ndepriving the American people of critical information. I believe that \nit threatens the very heart of our democratic political process. \nAllowing these groups to operate in the shadows poses a real risk of \ncorruption and makes it difficult for us to vigilantly guard against \nthat risk. The press has reported that a growing number of 527 groups \nhave connections to--or even have been set up by--candidates and \nelected officials. Allowing wealthy individuals to give to these \ngroups--and allowing elected officials to solicit money for these \ngroups--without ever having to disclose their dealings to the public, \nat a minimum,\n\n[[Page S4111]]\n\nleads to an appearance of corruption and sets the conditions that would \nallow actual corruption to thrive. If politicians are allowed to \ncontinue secretly seeking money--particularly sums of money that exceed \nwhat the average American makes in a year--there is no telling what \nwill be asked for in return.\n\n  In the hopes of forestalling the conversion of yet another loophole \ninto yet another sinkhole for the integrity of our elections, I am \njoined today by a distinguished bipartisan coalition in introducing two \nbills addressing the 527 problem. Our first bill--I think of it as our \naspirational bill--would completely close the Section 527 loophole, by \nmaking clear that tax exemption under Section 527 is available only to \norganizations regulated under FECA (unless an organization focuses \nexclusively on State or local elections or does not meet certain other \nexplicit FECA requirements). If this bill were enacted, groups no \nlonger would be able to tell one thing to the IRS to get a tax benefit \nand then deny the same thing to the FEC in order to evade FECA \nregulation.\n  Recognizing that a complete closing of the 527 loophole may not be \npossible to achieve this Congress, however, we are offering a narrower \nalternative--a pragmatic bill--aimed at forcing Section 527 \norganizations to emerge from the shadows and let the public know who \nthey are, where they get their money and how they spend it. The bill \nwould require 527 organizations to disclose their existence to the IRS, \nto file publicly available tax returns and to file with the IRS and \nmake public reports specifying annual expenditures of at least $500 and \nidentifying those who contribute at least $200 annually to the \norganization. Although this won't solve the whole problem, at least it \nwill make sure that no group can hide in the shadows as it spends \nmillions to influence the way we vote and who we choose to run this \ncountry.\n  No doubt opponents of this legislation will claim that our proposal \ninfringes on their First Amendment rights to free speech and \nassociation. But, Mr. President, nothing in our bills infringes on \nthose cherished freedoms in the slightest bit. Our bills do not \nprohibit anyone from speaking, nor do they force any group that does \nnot currently have to comply with FECA or disclose information about \nitself to do either of those things. Our bills speak only to what a \ngroup must do if it wants the public subsidy of tax exemption--\nsomething the Supreme Court has made clear no one has a constitutional \nright to have. As the Court explained in Regan v. Taxation with \nRepresentation of Washington, 461 U.S. 540, 544, 545, 549 (1983), \n``[b]oth tax exemptions and tax-deductibility are a form of subsidy \nthat is administered through the tax system,'' and ``Congressional \nselection of particular entities or persons for entitlement to this \nsort of largesse is obviously a matter of policy and discretion . . .'' \nUnder our bills, any group not wanting to disclose information about \nitself or abide by the election laws would be able to continue doing \nwhatever it is doing now--it would just have to do so without the \npublic subsidy of tax exemption conferred by Section 527.\n  Mr. President, we have become so used to our campaign finance \nsystem's long, slow descent into the muck that it sometimes is hard to \nignite the kind of outrage that should result when a new loophole \nstarts to shred the spirit of yet another law aimed at protecting the \nintegrity of our system. But this new 527 loophole should outrage us, \nand we must act to stop it. The bipartisan coalition joining with me \ntoday is doing just that. I hope all of our colleagues will join us in \nsupporting these proposals, and ask unanimous consent that the text of \nboth bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2582\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I would first like to thank Senator \nLieberman for his hard work in focusing the attention of the nation on \nthe problems Section 527 organizations are creating in our campaign \nfinance system. Today, I join Senator Lieberman and others in \nintroducing two legislative vehicles to address the problems these \norganizations are bringing to our already troubled campaign finance \nsystem.\n  Many years ago, James Madison said, ``A popular government without \npopular information is but a prologue to a tragedy or a farce or \nperhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who \nmean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which \nknowledge gives.''\n  In clearer terms, Francis Bacon conveys the same principle in the \nsaying, ``Knowledge is Power.''\n  Mr. President, most people don't know what a section 527 organization \nis, and that is understandable as it is a highly complex issue. But \nwhat many people do understand is that our campaign finance system is \nbroken and that we must do something to fix it.\n  I have long believed in Justice Brandeis' statement that, ``Sunlight \nis said to be the best of disinfectants.'' People deserve to know \nbefore they step into the voting booth which individuals or \norganizations are sponsoring the advertisements, mailings, and phone \nbanks they may see or hear from during an election. We need to shine \nsome sunlight on these secretive Section 527 organizations so that \npeople will know who or what is trying to influence their vote.\n  Mr. President, the passage of either of these important pieces of \nlegislation would help arm the people with the knowledge they need in \norder to exercise their civic duty and sustain our popular government.\n  We must close the loophole allowing so-called ``Stealth PAC's'' \norganized under Section 527 of the tax code, to hide their donors, \nactivities, even their very existence from public view. Doing so would \nbe an important first step in helping restore the public's confidence \nin our political system.\n  Mr. President, passage of this legislation would be one small step in \neventually achieving our ultimate goal, which is enactment of \nmeaningful campaign finance reform that includes increasing disclosure \nrequirements and the banning of soft money. It is time to work \ntogether. It is time to act. It is time to pass campaign finance \nreform.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining Senators \nLieberman, Daschle, McCain, Feingold, and others today in sponsoring \nthis legislation to close the Section 527 loophole in our campaign \nfinance and tax laws.\n  Section 527 of the IRS Code was originally created by Congress in the \n1970's to provide a category of tax exempt organizations for political \nparties and political committees. While contributions to a political \nparty or political committee are not tax deductible to the contributor, \nCongress did provide a tax exemption to the political organization for \nthe money contributed. At the time Congress established the tax \nexemption, it assumed that since the sole stated purpose of such \norganizations is to influence elections, the organizations would be \nfiling a more complete disclosure with the FEC under the campaign \nfinance laws and consequently it wasn't necessary to require disclosure \nwith the IRS. Once a federal court ruled in 1996 that coverage under \nthe federal election laws required advocating the election or defeat of \na specific candidate and not just seeking to influence the outcome of \nan election, the backbone of disclosure for Section 527 political \norganizations dissolved. Section 527 organizations could get the tax \nexemption for a political organization without having to follow the \nrequirements--both the disclosure requirements and the contribution \nlimits--of the federal election laws. Thus, an organization can state \nopenly to the IRS that it is spending money for the sole purpose of \ninfluencing an election and get a tax exemption under Section 527, yet \nit can avoid registering with the Federal Election Commission because \nit can argue that its influence is not directed at a specific \ncandidate. That's the kind of Alice-in-Wonderland logic we've got with \nthis loophole.\n  Today we are offering two alternative solutions to the Section 527 \nproblem. One bill would apply filing requirements to Section 527 \norganizations that are required of other tax exemption organizations in \nthe Tax Code and add new requirements to disclose contributions to the \npublic; the other would require a Section 527 organization to comply \nwith the federal election laws, as was originally contemplated when \nCongress created Section 527 in the first place. Given the limited \nnumber of legislative days remaining, we think it wise to pass, at a \nminimum, the bill requiring disclosure under tax code, although as a \nlong-term solution, we favor the bill requiring disclosure and limits \nunder the federal campaign laws.\n  Mr. President, the Section 527 loophole in our federal campaign laws \nis a bipartisan problem that requires and deserves a bipartisan \nsolution. Supporters of both parties have Section 527 organizations. \nThis is a loophole in our laws that you can drive not only a truck \nthrough, but a convoy of trucks. And that's what's happening as we \nspeak. Individuals and organizations that want to affect our federal \nelections but don't want to be restricted by our federal election laws \nare making tracks to Section 527 and establishing Section 527 \norganizations to run their election ads--without disclosure, without \ncontribution limits.\n  Now those ads--like other sham issue ads--can't say ``vote for'' or \n``don't\n\n[[Page S4114]]\n\nelect'', but they can go right up to that line and make essentially the \nsame point.\n  Mr. President, even if a Member of this body doesn't support campaign \nfinance reform, he or she can support this legislation, because it is \nabout disclosure and it eliminates an unintended consequence of the \nconvergence of two laws--the tax laws and the campaign finance laws. \nCongress never intended to allow Section 527 organizations to escape \nboth disclosure and campaign finance limits. Yet that's what's happened \nas a result of recent interpretations by the IRS and a U.S. District \nJudge. Our legislation reverses these interpretations and reinstates \nCongressional intent.\n  In late January of this year, the staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation released a study of the Disclosure Provisions Relating to Tax-\nExempt Organizations. In that study, the bipartisan staff addressed \nSection 527 organizations and the JCT staff recommended: that 527 \norganizations be required to ``disclose information relating to their \nactivities to the public . . .''; and that 527 organizations ``be \nrequired to file an annual return even if the organizations do not have \ntaxable income and that the annual return should be expanded to include \nmore information regarding the activities of the organization.'' \n[Section 527 organizations currently aren't even required to file a tax \nreturn.]\n  The JCT report said, ``This recommendation is consistent with the \nrecommendation that all tax returns relating to tax-exempt \norganizations should be disclosable.''\n  As the 2000 campaign evolves and we get closer to November, the \nAmerican public is going to be seeing the consequences--the real life \nconsequences of this loophole in our campaign finance laws. Candidates \nfrom both parties are going to be hit with ads by groups with names \nthat sound like responsible civic organizations but which in reality \nare nothing more than well financed political opponents. But the damage \nfrom such ads will be incurred well before a candidate can even catch \nhis or her breath much the less make any headway in identifying the \nsource of the money behind the ads. That's why we need this legislation \nnow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 2584. A bill to provide for the allocation of interest accruing to \nthe Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              coal accountability and retired employee act\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Coal \nAccountability and Retired Employee Act for the 21st Century. This \nlegislation would authorize a transfer of interest from the Abandoned \nMine Reclamation Fund to the United Mine Worker Combined Benefit Fund \nso that we can keep our promise of paying for our retired coal miner's \nhealth benefits.\n  In the 1992 Coal Act, a promise was made to retired coal miners and \ntheir families that they would have health benefits. In a few short \nmonths, the available funds for these health benefits will be \nexhausted. We cannot allow this to happen. We made a promise--we must \nkeep it.\n  Last week, Senator Rockefeller introduced similar legislation to \nauthorize a transfer from general revenues to pay for the shortfall in \nthe retiree health benefits fund. Senator Rockefeller has been a leader \non this issue for many years and I strongly support his approach. Last \nyear, thanks to the dogged determination of Senator Byrd, we were able \nto postpone the inevitable by getting additional funding. This funding, \nhowever, will run out in several months. The time has come to make good \non the promise to the retired coal miners. This legislation will give \nretired coal miners and their families the health benefits they \ndeserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. \n        Rockefeller):\n  S. 2585. A bill to amend titles IV and XX of the Social Security Act \nto restore funding for the Social Services Block Grant, to restore the \nability of the States to transfer up to 10 percent of TANF funds to \ncarry out activities under such block grant, and to require an annual \nreport on such activities by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               protecting the social services block grant\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senators \nJeffords, Grassley, and Rockefeller to introduce a bill to restore \ncritical funding to the Social Services Block Grant (SSBG).\n  Mr. President, the Social Services Block Grant, Title XX of the \nSocial Security Act, was created in 1981 by combining funding for \nsocial services and related staff training, and was intended to be the \nprimary source of federal funds for social services. Funds are \nallocated to states on a per capita basis and they can use them to \naddress abuse and neglect and to encourage self sufficiency and \nindependence.\n  Since its creation, SSBG has successfully provided states with funds \nto address the social service needs they see as most pressing. States \nhave broad flexibility in determining which services meet the needs of \ntheir unique populations, who should deliver the services and which \nfamilies and individuals to serve. The array of needed programs covered \nunder this important block grant range from adoption services to adult \nprotective services--from home delivered meals to day care--from \neducation and training programs to residential treatment services.\n  In the 1996 welfare law, an agreement was made between Congress and \nthe States to decrease the SSBG from $2.8b to $2.38b until welfare \nreform was firmly established. The Finance Committee guaranteed states \nthat SSBG would be funded at $2.38 billion per year until FY03 when it \nwould be restored to $2.8b. In order to allow them to continue to fund \ncritical social service programs, Congress allowed states to transfer \n10 percent of its Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) block \ngrant to SSBG. This was an important promise that has been broken. This \nlegislation allows us to return to our promise and an agreement that \nwas critical to the success of the new welfare system.\n  As members of the Finance Committee, we have an acute understanding \nof the value of the programs over which we have oversight \nresponsibilities. We have consistently worked, with some success, to \nensure the foundation of SSBG.\n  This overarching commitment was exemplified during the FY 2000 budget \nprocess. The Senate showed its bipartisan support for this important \nprogram by voting 57-39 to restore Title XX funding to its authorized \nlevel of $2.38 billion. Unfortunately, in the final omnibus \nappropriations bill, Title XX funding was cut from its authorized level \nof $2.38 billion to $1.775 billion. This $600 million cut is having a \ndirect impact on the availability of necessary services for the \nnation's neediest citizens.\n\n  This year, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and \nHuman Services and Education has included draconian cuts to this \ncritical program by decreasing the funding levels from $1.7 billion to \n$600 million. This level of reduction is simply unacceptable and would \nvirtually bankrupt the program.\n  Our bill would ensure that Title XX funds would remain available to \nsupport needed services for children and families in crisis. The block \ngrant has also been one of the only funding sources available for \ncommunity-based services for elderly and disabled persons. It is \nunconscionable that this critical source of funding for the most basic \nand necessary of social services has been cut by over $1 billion in a \nshort five years, and that the Senate Appropriations Committee would \nsuggest a billion dollar cut in one year alone.\n  If adequate funding for this program is not restored to SSBG, \nvulnerable children, families, elderly, and disabled persons will be \nwithout the assistance they need to live independently. Title XX \nprovides the support necessary for families in crisis, the elderly, and \nmany persons with both physical and mental disabilities to live \nindependently in the community. These funds also provide support \nthrough childcare and counseling, both of which are necessary for \npersons with multiple barriers to employment to successfully leave the \nTANF rolls.\n  The importance of the Social Services Block Grant is not only \nrecognized\n\n[[Page S4115]]\n\nby state and local governments, but also by non profit providers across \nthe country who have joined together with governments in support of \nthis block grant. Congress needs to also recognize the Social Services \nBlock Grant as the critical safety-net program that it is, and pass our \nbill to restore funding to the levels necessary to keep our promise to \nour neediest citizens.\n  I hope that my Senate colleagues will join us in cosponsoring this \ncritical piece of legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my esteemed \ncolleagues, Senators Graham and Jeffords, in introducing this important \npiece of legislation. Title XX, the Social Services Block Grant, is \ncrucial to states. Congress needs to meet its earlier commitment to \nthis program and restore funding to the level authorized in 1996.\n  The Social Services Block Grant allows states the flexibility to fill \nin the gaps in their human services system. Through this funding, \nstates, local governments and non-profit organizations can supplement \nother federal programs and leverage additional funding and resources to \nsupport an array of social service programs that are critical to those \nin need.\n  Millions of elderly people have benefitted from Title XX as have \nhundreds of thousand of individuals with disabilities. States use these \nfunds to help support crucial services such as respite care for the \nelderly, adult protective services, supported living and transportation \nfor the disabled. In recent years, more than a quarter of these funds \nhave been used to support children's services. Child protective \nservices, foster care and adoption programs have all been supplemented \nwith these funds.\n  In my home state of Iowa, Social Services Block Grant funds are used \nto supplement numerous service programs. One program uses these funds \nto help transport individuals with developmental disabilities to their \njobs and so that they may receive medical treatment. Funds are also \nused to help people with disabilities live in their communities, saving \nsignificant amounts of money that would otherwise go to caring for them \nin institutions.\n  Congress has consistently cut this important program in order to pay \nfor other things. It is time that we restore funding to the level we \nauthorized in 1996. Without this funding, important services that \nprotect children, the elderly and the disabled will not be provided. I \nurge my other colleagues in the Senate to support our efforts to \nrestore this program to the necessary level of funding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day":
