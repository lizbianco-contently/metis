Mr. President, today I rise to commemorate the second \nanniversary of National Tartan Day. I will be assisting those who do \nnot have on their plaids, their Tartans, during the day to make sure \nyou have one for your lapel--if not around your neck. We welcome our \nspecial guest chaplain in the Senate, the Right Reverend John Cairns, \nModerator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. It is my \nunderstanding that the office of Moderator is the highest honor that \nthe Church of Scotland can bestow on a minister. The Moderator has had \na distinguished career in the ministry, and we are truly privileged to \nhave him as our guest for today's Tartan Day activities.\n  I remind my colleagues that the resolution which established National \nTartan Day was Senate Resolution 155. It passed by unanimous consent on \nMarch 20th of 1998. As an American of Scottish descent, I appreciate \nthe efforts of individuals, clan organizations, and other groups such \nas the Scottish Coalition, who were instrumental in generating support \nfor the resolution. These groups have worked diligently to foster \nnational awareness of the important role that Americans of Scottish \ndescent have played in the progress of our country.\n  The purpose of National Tartan Day is to recognize the contributions \nthat Americans of Scottish ancestry have made to our national heritage. \nIt also recognizes the contributions that Americans of Scottish \nancestry continue to make to our country. National Tartan Day is an \nopportunity to pause and reflect on the role Scottish Americans have \nplayed in advancing democracy and freedom. They have helped shape this \nNation. Their contributions are innumerable. In fact, I myself was \nsurprised to learn that three-fourths of all American Presidents can \ntrace their roots to Scotland.\n  In addition to recognizing Americans of Scottish ancestry, National \nTartan Day reminds us of the importance of freedom. It honors those who \nstrived for freedom from an oppressive government on April 6, 1320. It \nwas on that day that the Declaration of Arbroath, the Scottish \nDeclaration of Independence, was signed. This important document served \nas the model for America's Declaration of Independence.\n  In demanding their independence from England, the men of Arbroath \nwrote, ``We fight for liberty alone, which no good man loses but with \nhis life.'' These words are applicable today to the heroism of our \nAmerican veterans and active duty forces who know the precious cost of \nfighting for liberty.\n  Senate Resolution 155 has served as a catalyst for the many States, \ncities, and counties that have passed similar resolutions recognizing \nthe important contributions of Scottish Americans.\n  I hail originally from Carroll County, MS, where the neighborhood was \nmade up of Watsons, my mother's family; McCains, Senator John McCain's \nfamily; McCalebs, McLeans, McKellys, and the list goes on and on. Most \nof them were ``Macs.'' I don't know how the Watsons got in there.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who supported this resolution in the \npast and who helped to remind the world of the\n\n[[Page S2270]]\n\nstand for liberty taken on April 6--almost 700 years ago--in Arbroath, \nScotland. A call for liberty which still echoes through our history and \nthe history of many nations across the globe.\n  It has been my hope that this annual event will grow in prominence \neach year, similar to St. Patrick's Day and Columbus Day, and the \nceremonies and activities taking place today and over the next few days \ndemonstrate that these goals are coming to fruition. I believe April 6 \ncan also serve as a day to recognize those nations that have not \nachieved the principles of freedom which we hold dear. The example of \nthe Scotsmen at Arbroath--their courage--their desire for freedom--\nserves as a beacon to countries still striving for liberty today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2270-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Senate will resume consideration of S. \nCon. Res. 101, the budget resolution. By a previous order, there will \nbe two back-to-back votes beginning at 10:30 a.m. The vote on the Byrd \namendment will be the first, to be followed by a vote on the Roth \namendment. Following the votes, the Durbin amendment regarding tax cuts \nwill be the pending amendment.\n  For the information of all Senators, the so-called vote-arama--and I \nhope it will not rise to that level; maybe it will just be a few votes \nwe will have to take one after the other--is expected to begin at some \npoint this evening. I do want to emphasize, though, unless we are \nsuccessful, on both sides of the aisle--let me say, Senator Reid has \nbeen working very hard on the Democratic side of the aisle. They have a \nreasonably low number of amendments still pending. We hope to reduce \nthe number on this side of the aisle, too. We should be able to \ndetermine by late this afternoon whether we can finish tonight or we \nwill go over to tomorrow. I think we need to go ahead and tell our \ncolleagues they should plan on being in and having votes in the morning \nbecause at this point, with some 60 amendments pending, I do not see \nhow we can finish it tonight by any kind of reasonable hour.\n  I will stay in touch with Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg, \nthe floor managers, and Senator Reid and Senator Nickles on our side, \nto assess the additional time that might be needed. Senators should \nadjust their schedules accordingly.\n  I know there is an event tonight, a dinner. But we can finish tonight \nor we can finish tomorrow, or whatever it takes. We have to complete \nour work. There are only about 8\\1/2\\ hours remaining of time, so we \nshould be able to finish that all right today. The remainder of the \ntime will be determined by how many amendments we have remaining.\n  I will be glad to yield to Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me just verify, as the one who is working with \nthese amendments, Senators should not assume it is very likely that we \nfinish tonight. I reported that to the leader earlier this morning. I \ndo not know how many amendments are pending on the other side. We are \nworking with our people who have about 31 amendments, most of them \nsense-of-the-Senate amendments. I will give my colleague that list soon \nand see if he can help us. I will work at it and talk some Senators \ninto understanding they would not have to offer them; they could offer \nthem some other time when the Senate is considering another matter.\n  If you just look at 8\\1/2\\ hours plus whatever it is going to take \nfor half those amendments in vote-arama, I assume we will be in \ntomorrow.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have been urging Senators, and I know Senator Daschle has \nalso, to prepare to be in session on this Friday, knowing the budget \nresolution was headed for this date for at least a couple of weeks. So \nwe should proceed with that in mind. If we get a lot of cooperation and \nsomething could be worked out, that would be different, but I do not \nsee how we can predict anything at this point but having votes on \nFriday morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2270-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2270]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESERVATION OF LEADERSHIP TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending amendment is the Durbin amendment, \namendment No. 2953. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The minority yields 20 minutes off the resolution to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 20 \nminutes, with the time coming off the resolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid and Senator \nLautenberg for yielding me this time.\n  The amendment I have offered is a straightforward opportunity for \nMembers of the Senate to go on record in reference to the proposed tax \ncut by George W. Bush, the nominal candidate for President on the \nRepublican side.\n  The reason I am offering this amendment is I believe it offers a \nclear choice to the Members of the Senate and certainly to the people \nof this Nation. Every one of us understands we have been going through \na period of unprecedented prosperity in America. In fact, I believe we \nhave set records in terms of the period of economic growth without \nrecession. This is not an accident. It is by design of an \nadministration that has been determined to continue to bring Federal \nspending under control, to keep interest rates manageable, and to \nencourage growth in the economy. This policy of the administration is \ncomplemented by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board under \nChairman Alan Greenspan.\n  We are now at an unusual point in our history where we are \nconsidering the possibility of surpluses. That is something that would \nhave been unthinkable a few years ago in Washington when we were \ndrowning in red ink with deficit after deficit piling on to our \nnational debt. It reached such a point of desperation that a proposal \nwas made in the Congress to amend the Constitution of the United States \nand give to the Federal judiciary the power to rein in the spending of \nCongress.\n  It was an unprecedented transfer of power to the judiciary away from \nthe legislative branch of Government. Some people were so despondent \nand so desperate, they were prepared to back such a constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget. It is hard to imagine that was only \nabout 4 years ago.\n  Today in the course of debating the budget resolution, our focus is \nthe use of the surplus, the revenues we will generate from our economy \nfar and above what is necessary for the needs of Government and current \nprograms. There is a difference of opinion about what to do with this \nsurplus.\n  On the Democratic side, we believe the first priority should be the \nreduction of our national debt. We collect each day in America $1 \nbillion in taxes from individuals, businesses, and families, and that \nmoney is used for the sole purpose of paying interest on our national \ndebt. That $1 billion does not educate a child; it does not build a \nroad; it does not make America any safer. It pays interest on debt, a \ndebt primarily held by foreign bond holders.\n  We believe on the Democratic side that our first priority should be \nto\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\nbring down this debt and reduce these interest costs so we can say to \nour children: You are not going to inherit our mortgage, a mortgage \nwhich we incurred for our needs in our generation. We are going to give \nyou a better chance to build your America in the vision of your future \ninstead of being saddled with our old debt.\n  That is the highest priority on the Democratic side, and my \ncolleagues will hear it expounded by the Democratic leader, Senator \nLautenberg, when he offers his Democratic alternative to the budget.\n  The way we reduce this debt is by investing money in Social Security \nso that system will be available for seniors and the disabled for \ndecades to come and also, of course, and by investing in Medicare. \nMedicare is a word which many people in this Chamber fear to use. They \nare afraid on the other side of the aisle to even make reference to \nMedicare and its future. But for 40 million-plus Americans, Medicare is \nan important word in their everyday life. That Medicare system provides \nhealth insurance for the elderly and disabled of America. It has been, \nfrankly, one of the most successful programs in the modern era because \nit represents a commitment by the Federal Government that no one, when \nthey have reached a certain age, will go wanting when it comes to \nquality health care, and it has worked.\n\n  In the 40 years since the institution of Medicare, our seniors have \nlived longer; they have had a better life; they are more independent; \nthey are healthier; they are stronger, and Medicare has a lot to do \nwith it. We on the Democratic side believe that part of the surplus \ngenerated in this economy should be dedicated to Medicare's future to \nmake sure this health insurance is around for many years to come.\n  We also believe we should target tax cuts. We think we can take an \nappropriate amount of this surplus and convert it into tax cuts which \nfamilies really need. I will give two specific examples. We on the \nDemocratic side believe that we should have a targeted tax cut so \nfamilies can deduct college education expenses. How many families do we \nknow that have sent a son or daughter off to college and then worried \nabout how much debt that child incurred in the course of their higher \neducation?\n  By providing the deductibility of college education expenses as a \ntargeted tax cut on the Democratic side, we will provide some relief to \nthese families, up to, say, $2,800, for example, each year which will \ndefray the cost of college education expenses. I hope it will be more \nin the future, but that depends, of course, on the economy and how it \nis moving and whether the surpluses continue.\n  Secondly, the largest growing group of Americans are those over the \nage of 85. People who have parents and grandparents who are now \nreaching their golden years find they need additional care, in many \ninstances. Whether it is in the nature of a visiting nurse or in a \nnursing home, this additional care can be costly. We have proposed on \nthe Democratic side a targeted tax cut that will allow families to \ndefray some expenses of long-term care for a parent or aging relative. \nWe believe this is sensible and reflects what modern families have to \ndeal with and struggle with on a daily basis. So our targeted tax cuts \ncome right behind our plan for debt reduction.\n  Finally, the last piece in our proposal on the Democratic side is our \ninvestment in our future. We understand, and most historians will \nagree, the 20th century had a lot to do with education. We want to make \ncertain the 21st century is an American century as well, and that means \ninvesting in our children to make certain they have the very best \neducation, the very best teachers, and the schools are modernized so \nthey can accommodate the new technology.\n  Along with the President, we invest money for education, as well as \nfor an important program I have found to be immensely popular across \nIllinois and around the Nation. That program is a prescription drug \nbenefit. The idea behind it, of course, is we will find a way under \nMedicare to provide a prescription drug benefit for the elderly and \ndisabled that will help them pay for their drugs and also keep them in \na position, if they have an expensive pharmaceutical bill, of not \nhaving to choose between food or medicine.\n  We also believe the cost element is important in this debate on a \nprescription drug benefit. We believe prescription drugs in America \nshould be fairly priced. Pharmaceutical companies are entitled to a \nprofit--they need it for future research--but when we hear stories \nabout exactly the same drug made in America costing half as much in \nCanada and costing less if one buys it for their dog than if they buy \nit for their aunt, people are saying this is an outrage. We ought to \nhave prescription drugs fairly priced so this benefit under Medicare \nwill work.\n\n  That is a condensation of the Democratic approach to our surplus, our \nfuture, and our budget priorities.\n  On the other side, George W. Bush, the Governor of Texas running for \nPresident of the United States, has a much different view of America. \nHe believes we should change dramatically and radically the path we \nhave followed over the past 7\\1/2\\ years.\n  He has proposed, instead of reducing debt, investing in Social \nSecurity, investing in Medicare, targeted tax cuts, education, and \nhealth care, that we should have a massive tax cut, a tax cut primarily \nfor the wealthiest people in America.\n  Take a look at the first year of this tax cut and one can understand \nthis graphic. This graphic shows the American economy moving forward, \nsteaming into the ocean. Look at this tiny little $168 billion cap of \nan iceberg. This is the first year of the George W. Bush tax cut. Look \nwhat comes and follows. This tax cut grows in size and eventually, I \nbelieve, could endanger the economy and its growth.\n  My position on that is not unique nor is it partisan. Chairman Alan \nGreenspan has said: Tax cuts are not our highest priority in America. \nOur highest priority is debt reduction. That is the Democratic \nalternative. I think Chairman Greenspan is right. I think George W. \nBush is wrong.\n  The amendment which I offer is an up-or-down vote by the Members of \nthe Senate about whether they want to follow the course that has led to \nsuch economic progress or whether they want to sign up for the George \nW. Bush tax cut.\n  Let me tell you what this tax cut would cost America. It would cost \nus, in the first 5 years, $483 billion; then, over a 10-year period of \ntime, more than $1.2 trillion. It is a substantial investment in tax \ncuts.\n  As I have said many times on the floor, every politician likes to \nstand up and call for a tax cut. It is one of the most popular speeches \nwe can make. But it may not be the most responsible thing to do. The \nAmerican people are thinking twice about this promise by George W. Bush \nof a tax cut of this magnitude because they understand that every \nproposal has its cost.\n  Let me show you a chart.\n  The impact of the Bush tax plan is to not only spend the surplus that \nwe have discussed but to reach beyond the surplus, which we are \ngenerating in our Government, and to call on spending the Social \nSecurity trust fund for the George Bush tax cut.\n  Those on the Senate floor who want to vote in favor of the Bush tax \nplan are really saying we should reach into the Social Security trust \nfund surplus and take the money out of Social Security to fund this \nGeorge W. Bush tax plan.\n\n  This chart shows that in the first 5 years of the George Bush tax \ncut, we have a non-Social Security surplus of $171 billion. George Bush \nwould spend not only that but another $312 billion to fund this tax \ncut. Where does he find the additional money? He has to take it from \nthe Social Security trust fund. In raiding the Social Security trust \nfund, I believe he breaks faith with a promise made, on a bipartisan \nbasis, by Congress that we would make certain the fund is protected.\n  Let's take a closer look at what it means in terms of the Republican \nbudget resolution, as well.\n  Recalling again the $171 billion non-Social Security surplus, on the \nRepublican side, in their budget resolution, they call for a tax cut in \nthe neighborhood of $168 billion to $223 billion over a 5-year period. \nYou will note, this is perilously close and in many instances exceeds, \nagain, the non-Social Security surplus.\n\n[[Page S2272]]\n\n  In order to fund this plan, they will either have to reach deep into \nthe Social Security trust fund or, as an alternative, will have to make \ncuts in spending.\n  Cuts in spending may sound harmless today, but when we put them on \nthe spot and ask, ``Where will you cut,'' they refuse to point to it. \nMany of us believe that investments in education, in our \ninfrastructure, and in our Nation's defense are too important to be \nleft in this uncertainty.\n  Looking again at the Bush tax cut--the original figure of $483 \nbillion that he proposed, plus an additional $60 billion in interest--\nit shows you the disparity between the non-Social Security surplus and \nthe Bush tax cut. This is the tax cut I am asking my colleagues in the \nSenate to vote on yes or no today. I will be voting no. I will be \nvoting against a tax cut which threatens the Social Security trust \nfund. I hope my colleagues will stand up and be counted as to whether \nthey believe the Bush tax cut is good policy for the future of America.\n  Let's take a closer look at what this tax cut means to American \nfamilies. Most families who I represent could certainly use a tax cut. \nI think, in many instances, it would be helpful to them to meet their \nexpenses and to provide for their future.\n  Take a close look at the Bush tax cut and the winners and the losers. \nFamilies making over $301,000 a year, under the George Bush tax cut, \nwould see an annual tax break of over $50,000. Think of it--a family \nalready making $300,000 a year, plus a $50,000 tax break under the \nGeorge Bush tax cut. Sixty percent of working families in America, with \nincomes below $39,300, would see an annual tax break, under the Bush \ntax cut, of $249.\n  My colleagues in the Senate will have their choice. Do they want to \nsupport the Bush tax cut, which threatens Social Security by raiding \nthe Social Security trust fund, and provides virtually no tax relief to \n60 percent of America's working families, at the same time providing a \ngenerous $50,000-plus tax cut for those making over $300,000 a year?\n  Many on the Republican side have already appeared with George W. \nBush, put their arms around him and endorsed him. If they endorse his \ntax cut, they have a chance to vote for it today.\n  Twice in the Senate Budget Committee they ran away from this \ndecision. They refused to face a vote, up or down, on the Bush tax cut. \nToday they will have another clear choice, a choice as to whether or \nnot they believe America is moving in the right direction--whether we \nshould take the Democratic alternative of reducing debt, investing in \nSocial Security and Medicare, with targeted tax cuts for families, with \ninvestments in education--or whether they will take what I consider to \nbe a risky and dangerous course and follow the suggestion of the \nPresidential candidate of the Republican Party, George W. Bush.\n  This morning's Roll Call newspaper spelled out that the George Bush \ntax plan makes it virtually impossible for him to meet the needs of \nAmerica's future--to fund the prescription drug benefit, to fund \nadditional medical research, things that Americans understand to be an \nimportant part of our future.\n  George W. Bush has made his choice. He has decided this tax cut is \nmore important than those other things. It is time for the Senate to \nmake its choice. It is time for the Senate to stand up and be counted.\n  I hope, unlike in the Senate Budget Committee, my colleagues in the \nSenate--whether they are for or against this tax cut--will stand up and \nbe counted. If they believe, as I do, that America is moving in the \nright direction and that taking this risky strategy could imperil our \nfuture, I hope they will join me in voting no on this tax cut.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we scheduled \nto vote at 10:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senate is scheduled to have \na 10-minute debate at 10:30 a.m., which will be followed by a vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is there a vote following that, also?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Following that vote, there will be a 2-minute \ndebate on the Roth amendment, which will be followed by a vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I hope all Senators heard that. Let me repeat it. We \nwill have a 10-minute debate starting at 10:30 on the Byrd amendment, \nto be followed by an up-or-down vote. When that vote is completed, \nthere will be 2 minutes to debate the next amendment.\n  What did the Chair say the second amendment is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Roth amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Roth amendment on ANWR. After 2 minutes of debate, \nthere will be a vote on or in relation to that. So Senators ought to \nknow that is going to occur.\n  I say to the Senator, I am at some point going to use some time. I \ncould take 5 minutes now--or 10--and discuss it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, Mr. President, let me see if I understand the \namendment Senator Durbin has offered, which he claims to be Governor \nBush's tax proposal.\n  On page 4, line 4, what I note is that there is a reduction in \nrevenues in the resolution by $4.8 billion. I wonder if the Senator \nwould confirm that that is correct. I am reading it off the Senator's \namendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not have a copy. I sent my copy to the desk. I will \nhave a copy in a moment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All right. On page 4, line 4, revenues in the \nresolution are reduced by $4.8 billion. Is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. On page 4 of this amendment? I am sorry, I say to the \nSenator, I do not see that reference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On the bottom of the first page of the amendment, it \nsays: ``On page 4, line 4, decrease the amount by $4,843,000,000.'' Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could you tell me what year that is?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It begins in the year 2002.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. 2001?\n  Mr. DURBIN. 2002. I am sorry, it is 2001. I stand corrected.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator know there is no tax cut in 2001 in \nthe Bush proposal?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Governor Bush has offered two proposals. The first \nproposal is the one that we have followed in offering this amendment. \nHe has come back to offer a second proposal starting with 2002. We \nstuck with his original proposal, which is the period of time which \nthis budget resolution we are considering on the floor addresses.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My next question was going to be, did you know that \nGovernor Bush's tax plan covered 2002 through 2006? You have it \nstarting in 2001 with almost $5 billion, but you have given an \nexplanation for that. There are two plans out there, and you chose one \nover the other.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct. I chose the first one he offered, the \none that mirrors this budget resolution in terms of the period of time \nthat we are addressing.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is it fair to assume that a candidate for President is \nnot bound by the economic assumptions that we make in the Senate or \nthat the CBO makes or OMB makes?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I conclude that a Presidential candidate can assume \nanything he or she wants to assume. In fairness, if somebody is going \nto make the cornerstone of their campaign a tax cut, it should make \nsense and should hold up when anyone analyzes it. With the figures I \nbrought to the floor today, I suggest that Bush's proposed tax cut \nwould invade the Social Security surplus by virtually any estimation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me make a point to the Senator, and I thank the \nSenator for yielding. Presidential candidate George W. Bush had three \nof the best economists in America working with him on this tax \nproposal. Interestingly enough, they made economic assumptions \ndifferent from the Congressional Budget Office, or the OMB, for the \nnext 5 years.\n  Interestingly enough, the assumptions of the Congressional Budget \nOffice and the OMB have been wrong, and most of the time they have been \nwrong by underestimating the performance of the economy. They have \nunderestimated the growth in the economy, underestimated the revenue \nstream, and each year, we have come along later on and had to make \nadjustments to it. He is entitled to use his economic assumptions, \nwhich I have read and are very\n\n[[Page S2273]]\n\nrealistic. And that makes a very big difference if one has slight \neconomic assumptions of a positive nature higher than one would assume \nin our budget.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Which assumptions did the Senator use in drawing up the \nbudget resolution he proposes today?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am bound by the rules of the Senate to use the CBO. \nThe President doesn't, however. He uses OMB. Frequently, we are \ndifferent. As a matter of fact, over the last 3 years, we have gone to \nthe President's numbers, and we have gone back to CBO's numbers because \nwe are trying to find out which is more apt to be right. So there is \nnothing precise about this. One is entitled--just as President Clinton \ndid when he ran for office--to use his own economic experts as he puts \nhis plan together.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator saying, then, that Presidential candidate \nGeorge W. Bush is using assumptions that come from neither the CBO or \nOMB, but much more optimistic ones to justify his massive tax cut?\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Absolutely, except they are not markedly different, but \nthey are different. There is only one Bush plan, as far as the Senator \nfrom New Mexico knows. It is December 1, 1999. I have a copy of it in \nfront of me. What has been offered in the Senate is not the Bush plan. \nNonetheless, I don't want to argue that exclusively. I can let \neverybody know that it isn't the Bush plan.\n  I think what is more important is that soon-to-be-President Bush is \nentitled to put a budget and a tax plan together, and he is entitled to \nuse his best economic advisers. Let me suggest something. I honestly \nbelieve that if George W. Bush were the President instead of Bill \nClinton being the President, there would be a couple of huge changes \nthis year that would make it a lot easier to achieve the Bush tax plan.\n  First of all, we would not have a President recommending that \ndomestic spending grow at 14 percent a year. That is what we are \nfighting with here--not with a President who is trying to have small \nGovernment so he could give some relief to the taxpayers. We are \narguing with a President who has the largest increase in discretionary \nspending since the Jimmy Carter years. That is a lot, when you can beat \none of those years with inflation in double digits. This year it is 14 \npercent. That is what he is asking for. We have to compete with that in \nour budgets. We can't just do what a Republican President, who isn't \nelected yet, would recommend as to how we spend money.\n  As a matter of fact, I have already said that I believe this budget \nresolution is kind of a holding budget resolution because I believe \neither man--Bush or Gore--when elected, will ask us to dramatically \nchange this budget. I know George W. Bush will because he will find \nways to consolidate and change the priorities of domestic spending in a \nsignificant way. When he does that, I have no doubt that he will be \nable to recommend to the Congress a very good tax plan.\n  Frankly, if we wanted to debate the value of a tax plan and its worth \nin society, its soundness, we could have a debate on his precise plan. \nIt is a pretty good plan. Frankly, it does a lot of things that a huge \nmajority of this Senate would like to see done to the Tax Code of the \nUnited States.\n  So we will have a vote on this amendment. Everybody should understand \nthat it is not really the Bush plan. Everybody should understand that \nBush will do his own plan. He will do his own plan on taxes, and he \ntold us what it probably will be. He will do his own budget. It is very \nimportant we understand that. It won't be this budget because we have \nto work off a President's budget with increases of the type I just \nexplained to you. He will have his own budget to work off of. I believe \nhe didn't start his tax cut until one year later because he wanted the \nopportunity to work on a budget and a fiscal plan for this Nation along \nwith a tax plan.\n  At some point in time, we will either have a vote in relationship to \nthe Durbin amendment, or we will have a second-degree amendment to it. \nIf he insists later on, he can have a vote on his. That is ultimately \nthe way the rules work.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \ncharged to the quorum call I will soon initiate be charged equally to \nboth sides under this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield all of our time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair would like to announce that there \nwill be two minutes equally divided on the Byrd-Warner amendment at \n10:30.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2943\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \nByrd-Warner amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nAmendment by the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. In \nsupporting this Amendment, however, I would like to make clear my views \non the question of the repeal of the federal gas tax.\n  I do not think that, under present circumstances, repeal of the \nfederal gas tax is necessary or warranted. Yes, gas prices have gone up \nprecipitously over the past several months--to more than $2 a gallon in \nCalifornia--but there is some evidence that prices may now be easing.\n  More important, I have discussed this issue with the chief executive \nofficers of several major U.S. oil companies, and none could promise \nthat any of these savings would be passed on to consumers. Market \nforces--supply and demand--dictate how much, if any, of a fuel tax cut \nwould be seen at the pump.\n  For California, repealing more than 9 cents of the federal gasoline \ntax merely triggers an automatic increase in the state gasoline tax. \nUnder the California tax code, if the federal gas tax drops below 9 \ncents per gallon and if Federal Highway Trust Fund payments to \nCalifornia are reduced accordingly, the state tax goes up.\n  In other words, if all federal fuel taxes are eliminated and funding \nfor the highway trust fund is therefore reduced, the overall tax will \nremain the same in California and Californians hurt by high gasoline \nprices will not benefit.\n  I am also concerned that repeal of the federal fuel tax may endanger \nthe Highway Trust Fund and imperil important highway projects. The \nhighway trust fund, which is funded by the federal fuel tax, provides \nabout half a billion dollars a year for California, money which is used \nto seismically retrofit bridges to protect them against earthquakes; \nreplace the I-80, which was destroyed by the 1992 earthquake; repair \npotholes; and otherwise maintain our roads and bridges.\n  The bottom line is that the current spike in gas prices is due to a \nsupply squeeze: There is simply not enough oil in the market to meet \ndemand. Although I was pleased that members of OPEC, as well as Norway, \nMexico, and Venezuela, have agreed to increase production somewhat, it \nis still unclear if these production increases will be sufficient to \nmeet demand over the next several months.\n  For that reason, I think it is important to underscore that just as I \ndo not feel we should repeal the federal fuel tax now, I do not believe \nwe should precipitously foreclose our options.\n  Alongside initiatives to increase fuel efficiency and develop \nalternate sources, suspension or repeal of a portion of the federal \nfuel tax in a way that benefits the consumer and does not harm highway \nspending may be necessary later if this crisis does not ease, and I \nintend to continue keeping a close eye on this issue.\n\n[[Page S2274]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, 2 years ago Congress enacted landmark \ntransportation legislation, the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury. In that legislation we restored the trust to the highway trust \nfund and we set forth highway funding levels that State and local \ngovernments could expect to receive over the 6-year life of TEA-21.\n  There are efforts now to reduce the gas tax revenues going into the \nhighway trust fund, thereby endangering the promises we have made \nregarding funding levels for the Nation's highways and bridges.\n  This amendment puts the Senate on record in opposition to any efforts \nto repeal or to reduce gas tax revenues, either temporarily or \npermanently. In adopting this amendment, the Senate will confirm the \nposition that it took in enacting TEA-21, that all gas tax revenues \nshould go to the States for critical transportation infrastructure \nneeds and that we meant it when we said we were restoring the ``trust'' \nto the highway trust fund.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again I commend the distinguished Senator \nfrom West Virginia for his leadership on this issue--not only this \nparticular measure before the Senate, but it goes all the way back to \nwhen I was privileged to be bringing to the floor the ISTEA, TEA-21 \nlegislation. Then, in the course of that deliberation, we took the 4.3 \ncents out of the general revenue and put it in the highway trust fund \nfor the express purpose to improve our Nation's highways.\n  I commend the leadership.\n  I also express my gratitude to the myriad organizations, from the \nNational Governors' Association, the League of Cities and Communities, \nand hundreds of others that have worked so hard to keep the Congress \nwell informed about the needs of our infrastructure, of transportation.\n  I wish to add one word, and that is ``stability.'' This Nation must \nhave stability in the funding to make this program successful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2943. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 57, I voted ``aye.'' \nIt was my intention to vote ``nay.'' Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be recorded as a ``nay.'' This would not affect the outcome of \nthe vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to thank the 64 \nSenators who joined this morning in making an affirmative statement in \nopposition to any reduction in the gasoline tax. The vote this morning \non\nthe Byrd-Warner-Baucus-Voinovich-Lautenberg-Bond amendment represented \na defining victory for those Senators that want to keep the ``trust'' \nin the Highway Trust Fund and assure that every penny of highway \nspending is backed up by fuel taxes deposited into that Trust Fund. It \nwas a defeat for any effort to reduce the gas tax or substitute gas tax \nrevenues with general revenues in the distribution of federal highway \nfunds.\n  I especially want to thank the original cosponsors of my amendment \nwho joined with me to protect the Highway Trust Fund. It is no \ncoincidence that all of these original cosponsors are members of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee that has jurisdiction over the \nTrust Fund. They are the experts in this area. They know better than \nanyone the threat that is posed by reckless proposals to alter the \nfunding stream to the Trust Fund. They know better than anyone that \nmonkeying around with the funding stream to the Trust Fund poses great \ndanger to our ability to provide our states, counties and cities with a \nconsistent, predictable and growing allocation of federal dollars for \nthe repair and expansion of their highways and bridges.\n  During the debate over the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury, Senator John Warner served as the Chairman of the Surface \nTransportation Subcommittee. Senator Max Baucus served as the Ranking \nMember of that subcommittee as well as the full Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. It would be impossible to overemphasize the \ncontributions those two Senators made to that landmark legislation. \nSenator Warner permanently altered the long-standing debate over so-\ncalled ``donor'' states by guaranteeing each state a fair return on its \ninvestment to the Trust Fund. Senator Baucus saw to it that the \nlegislation recognized the unique circumstances of the rural Western \nstates, those states with relatively few citizens but a great many \nmiles of highway. When Senator Gramm of Texas and I developed an \namendment to assure that the 4.3 cent gas tax would be fully spent on \nhighway construction, we were just two non-Committee members with a \ngood idea. When Senators Warner and Baucus agreed to join as original \ncosponsors and lend their prestige and expertise to our amendment, our \ngood idea became a genuine movement that garnered 54 co-sponsors and \nwould eventually result in our adding close to $26 billion in \nguaranteed spending to the highway bill.\n  Senator Voinovich was not in the Senate during the debate over TEA-\n21. He was, however, one of the most outspoken governors on the \nimportance of adequate transportation funding. He has been diligently \nattentive to transportation issues since he assumed the Chairmanship of \nthe Surface Transportation Subcommittee from Senator Warner. I \nappreciate very much his leadership in this area.\n  Senator Lautenberg, like Senator Bond, has the unique role of serving \non both the Environment and Public Works Committee and the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee. Indeed, Senator Lautenberg \nhas served either as the Chairman or the Ranking Member of that \nsubcommittee for more than a dozen years. As such, his name is always \nat the center of every transportation debate. He represents the most \ncongested state in the nation and, as such, has been a national leader \nin protecting and expanding our nation's rail and transit systems. \nSenator Bond should be credited for his longstanding efforts at \nstreamlining the environmental review processes that govern our highway \nconstruction enterprise. As a Senator from\n\n[[Page S2275]]\n\na mountainous state that is sorely in need of improved highways, I \napplaud his efforts at ensuring that our highways can be built more \nexpeditiously but in an environmentally friendly manner.\n  Mr. President, our victory this morning was the result of the \nleadership of these fine Senators as well as the efforts of our other \ncosponsors--Senators Robb, Bingaman, Reid, Lincoln, and others. It was \na victory for every American that drives on our nation's highways. It \nwas a victory for the integrity of the Highway Trust Fund. It was a \ndefeat for any proposal to de-link our federal highway spending from \nthe level of gas tax revenues.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2955\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 2 minutes, equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join the distinguished \nSenator from Delaware in voicing my strenuous objections to opening the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, and in urging our \ncolleagues not to sacrifice this natural wonder at the altar of short-\nterm economic expediency.\n  I recognize that ANWR is once again a tempting target at this moment \nof record high oil and gasoline prices and low consumer patience. \nProponents of drilling, as they have many times before, hold out the \npromise of a quick fix to this recent price spike and a long-term \nsolution to our dependence on foreign oil. They go so far as to portray \nthe refuge as a kind of energy security blanket that will protect us \nfrom the whims of foreign producers.\n  But appealing as that sounds, the truth remains that ANWR is not the \nanswer to our current oil woes. Opening this pristine place of \nwilderness to drilling will not bring down gas prices months or years \nfrom now, let alone in the immediate future. And it will not yield \nanywhere near the amount of crude needed to successfully wean us from \nour addiction to OPEC in years to come. What it will do, we know from \nplenty of analysis and experience, is immeasurable and irreversible \ndamage to one of the last pure preserves of its kind in the world and \none of G-d's most awesome creations. That is the real price at issue \nhere, and it is far too high to pay for the modest benefit it will \nbring to our domestic oil supply and to those who produce it.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues that ``modest'' is a generous \ncharacterization. The fact is that we have no guarantees about the \npotential recovery of oil in ANWR. More than 20 different independent \nand federal studies have been completed on the amount of oil in ANWR, \nand estimates vary wildly. One of those, completed during the Reagan \nAdministration, determined that there was only a one in five chance of \nfinding any commercially recoverable oil at all. More recently, an \nassessment by the U.S. Geological Survey estimates that 5.2 billion \nbarrels of oil would be ``economically recoverable'' from the refuge \nfor the rest of its life. Compared against projections of the potential \nfor an aggressive program to produce biomass ethanol to displace oil--\n2.5 million barrels per day by 2030 and over 3 million per day in \n2035--the oil promise of the Refuge is minuscule. The Refuge would \nprobably never meet more than a negligible percentage of our Nation's \nenergy needs at any given time.\n  In exchange for this minimal return, we would threaten one of the \nmost unique animal and plant habitats in the world. Consider the fate \nof the Porcupine Caribou Herd, for which the Coastal Plain within the \nrefuge is an important calving ground. An Environmental Impact \nStatement issued by the Interior Department in 1995 shows that \ndevelopment of ANWR will likely have significant negative effects on \nthe PCH, displacing them to areas of higher predator density, reducing \nthe amount and quality of forage species available during calving, and \nrestricting the animals' access to areas where they can get relief from \ninsects. Experts predict similar risks await polar bears, muskoxen, \nbrown bears, snow geese, wolves, seals, and whales.\n  That is if all goes well with the drilling, which is not a safe \nassumption. Data from the Alaska Department of Conservation show that \nthe Trans-Alaska and Prudhoe Bay oil fields have caused an average of \n427 spills annually since 1996. The most common spills involve crude \nand diesel oil, but more than 40 substances, from acid to waste oil, \ncould be released. What is more, current oil operations in Alaska's \nNorth Slope emits about 56,427 tons of nitrous oxides, which contribute \nto smog and acid rain, and about 24,000 tons of methane, a greenhouse \ngas, per year. Drilling for more oil in ANWR thus compounds the serious \nproblem of global climate change, generating methane emissions in \naddition to the carbon dioxide emissions that result from increased \ndependence on oil resources.\n  It is this lopsided tradeoff--uncertain dividends for likely \ndevastation--that has generated cries of outrage from practically every \nenvironmental group every time Congress has attempted to open ANWR to \ndrilling, generated several veto threats from President Clinton, and \nprompted editorials in newspapers from Seattle to Tampa to Des Moines \nto Atlanta questioning the wisdom of such a move. It was not right \nthen, it's not right now, and it won't be right come the next price \nspike.\n  Nor is it right to mislead the public into thinking a quick fix \nexists. The reality is we don't have any easy answers to our foreign \noil addiction. There is no untapped domestic oil oasis out there that \nwill end our dependence on foreign oil and minimize our vulnerability \nto fluctuations of the global market. But that is not to say we are \nhelpless. In fact, there are several steps we as a nation could take \nover the next year that would go a long way toward curing our OPEC \naddiction.\n  The solution, I would argue to my colleagues, is nurturing \nalternative energy sources and improving our energy efficiency. First, \nwe should invest more in exploring the power potential of wind and \ngeothermal energy, fuel cells, and organic materials, and developing \nlong-range strategies for harnessing these renewable energy sources. We \nhave made a good start this year by passing legislation sponsored by \nSenator Lugar to spur more research into harvesting energy from common \ncrops. I hope we will build on that progress by adopting the \nPresident's budget recommendation of increased funding for research, \ndevelopment, and deployment of renewable energy technologies by 30 \npercent. Second, we should take stock of the domestic energy market and \nevaluate national and individual consumer decisions affecting our own \nenergy supply and efficiency. In some areas the results are \nencouraging. As the President has noted, conservation measures taken by \nU.S. businesses have significantly improved the efficiency of the \noverall economy. During the crisis of the 1970s, nearly nine percent of \nour GDP was spent on oil, compared with only three percent today. But \nwe can and should do better.\n  The promise of this approach was spelled out in detail by leading \nexperts at a recent hearing held by the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. To cite just one example, Dr. John Holdren, the Director of \nthe Program on Science, Technology, and Public Policy at Harvard \nUniversity's Kennedy School of Government, and Chairman of the \nPresident's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology, stated \nthat if the U.S. increases its efficiency by 2.2 percent per year, it \ncould reduce its dependence on oil by more than 50 percent, \napproximately 5.5 million barrels of oil per day. This goal is more \nthan realistic, for as Dr. Holdren noted, the U.S. decreased its energy \nintensity by 1.7 percent from 1972 to 1979 and by 3.2 percent from 1979 \nto 1982.\n  In short, we don't have to defile the Alaskan wilderness to declare \nour energy independence. Assaulting ANWR is bad energy policy, it's \neven worse environmental policy, and it's simply not necessary to help \nthe American consumer and protect our economy. For that reason, I \nimplore my colleagues to once again stand as firm as the tundra and \nuphold the ban on drilling in the Arctic Refuge.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes to \naddress the assumption in the budget of oil leasing revenues from \nactivities within the Section 1002 area of Alaska.\n  First, however, I think it's important to understand just a few of \nthe facts surrounding the current state of the Clinton energy policy. \nIn 1977, the Carter Administration and Congress responded to the energy \ncrisis by creating the Department of Energy and\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\ncharging it with increasing U.S. energy security and reducing our \nreliance on foreign oil. In the early 1970's, our Nation relied upon \nforeign oil to meet roughly 35 percent of our needs. Today, after \ninvesting billions of dollars into the Department of Energy, our Nation \nis now reliant upon foreign oil to meet almost 60 percent of our needs. \nThat reliance will increase to 65 percent by 2020.\n  Those numbers are real, they're tangible, and everyone has been able \nto see it happening. The Clinton Administration has had seven years to \nrespond to our growing reliance on foreign oil and to increase our \ndomestic energy security. So you might ask, what have they done to \nimprove the situation? I regret to say they've done very little. Since \n1992, U.S. oil production has decreased by 17 percent while at the same \ntime our energy consumption has increased by 14 percent. In 1990, U.S. \njobs in oil and gas exploration and production were roughly 405,000 \ntoday those jobs have been reduced to roughly 290,000, a 27 percent \ndecline. And in 1990, the U.S. was home to 657 working oil rigs. Today, \nthere are only 153 working oil rigs scattered across the Nation a 77 \npercent decline.\n  Likewise, since coming to office, President Clinton has known that \nthe U.S. Department of Energy was obligated by contract to pick up and \nremove spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear reactors across the \ncountry. In my home state of Minnesota, the Department's failure to \nremove nuclear fuel could force the shutdown of two nuclear reactors \nand the loss of 20 percent of Minnesota's generation capacity. Again, \nnot only has this Administration failed to respond, I believe they've \nmade the situation even worse by rejecting legislation that has passed \nboth Houses of Congress with overwhelming, bipartisan majorities. Those \nbills would have not only moved waste from states, thereby fulfilling \nthe Department's obligation, they would have helped ensure the \ncontinued use of emissions-free nuclear power well into the future.\n  As if that weren't enough, the Clinton Administration has taken a \nvery hostile approach to coal-fired generation, they've termed \nhydropower a non-renewable resource and are now working to breach dams \nin the Northwest, and they've closed vast areas of land to exploration \nfor natural gas reserves.\n  When confronted with the truth about high oil costs and increasing \nreliance on foreign oil, the only thing this Administration can say is \nthat they support renewable energy sources. Well, I too, am a strong \nsupporter of renewable energy technologies. I've been a strong \nproponent of the development and promotion of ethanol and biodiesel as \na means of reducing our reliance on foreign oil and improving the \nenvironment. I was a cosponsor of legislation signed into law last year \nextending the tax credit for electricity generated from wind and \nexpanding that tax credit to electricity generated from poultry waste. \nI have written letters in each of the past two years to Senate \nappropriators supporting significant increases in renewable energy \nprograms, and I was one of 39 Senators to vote in support of a $75 \nmillion increase for renewable energy programs last year. I wrote to \nPresident Clinton this year asking him to include more money for \nrenewable energy programs in his budget. However, I know that simply \ncalling for increased funding for renewable energy can't even approach \nthe loss of generation in hydropower, nuclear, coal, and other sources \nthat this Administration has pursued through its energy policies.\n\n  I think it's clear that, since coming to Washington in 1993, this \nAdministration has been asleep at the wheel in developing a coherent \nenergy policy. They're more interested in pursuing the limited agenda \nof a few interest groups than in planning for the energy needs of a \ngrowing economy.\n  Instead of strapping on the same blinders that narrowly guide the \nClinton Administration, I believe Congress must put all of our options \non the table and begin to plan for the long-term energy needs of our \nnation's consumers. One of those options is clearly the topic we're \ndiscussing today, our nation's tremendous oil reserves in the Section \n1002 area of Alaska.\n  Mr. President, history shows that for two decades, Congress has \nplaced special consideration upon this area because of its potential \nfor significant oil and gas reserves. In 1980, Congress passed the \nAlaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act--or ANILCA. In addition \nto setting aside over 100 million acres of Alaska for National Parks, \nRefuges, and Wilderness, the ANILCA legislation specifically left open \nthe future management of a 1.5 million-acre area on the coastal plain \nof the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The legislation also required \nthe Department of Interior to undertake geological and biological \nstudies of the Section 1002 area and report back to Congress.\n  After more than five years of conducting these studies, the \nDepartment of Interior, in 1987, recommended to Congress that the \nSection 1002 area be made available for oil and gas exploration and \nproduction, and that it be done in an environmentally sound manner.\n  Congress has responded to this recommendation a number of times since \nreceiving it from the Department of Interior. In fact, both Houses of \nCongress passed an authorization for oil and gas leasing in the Section \n1002 area as part of the 1995 budget reconciliation legislation, but it \nwas eventually vetoed by President Clinton.\n  Today, as a result of increasing prices for oil and decreasing \ndomestic oil and gas production, we find ourselves again debating some \ndecades-old questions. Do we move forward in an environmentally sound \nmanner to develop domestic oil and gas reserves, or do we ask other \nnations to produce oil for us without similar environmental safeguards? \nDo we keep American jobs and investments inside our borders, or do we \nship our jobs and industries to foreign nations? Do we increase our \nenergy and national security while we have a chance to do so, or do we \nrun around the world begging friend and foe alike to ``feel our pain'' \nevery time we have an oil supply disruption? For me, the answer is \nsimple.\n  This budget resolution assumes that we're going to move forward to \ndevelop oil and gas reserves in the Section 1002 area of Alaska--our \nnation's most promising deposit of recoverable oil and gas. In 1998, \nthe U.S. Geological Survey produced an assessment of estimated in-place \noil resources reaffirming previous studies that showed the tremendous \npotential of the Section 1002 area. In fact, it showed that Section \n1002 contains as much as 16 billion barrels of recoverable oil--enough \nto offset 30 years worth of Saudi Arabian imports. Clearly, this area \nhas great potential for easing the growing vulnerability we have to oil \nsupply disruptions abroad.\n  I think it is important to note that we're not talking about turning \nthe Section 1002 area over to oil companies and then walking away \nforever. If we're going to allow oil and gas exploration and \nproduction, it will be done in an environmentally sound manner and with \ndue consideration to the needs of fish and wildlife populations. \nSenator Murkowski has introduced legislation that accomplishes those \nvery goals. S. 2214--The Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Energy Security \nAct--contains a number of provisions to protect the environment. The \nbill directs the Secretary of Interior to issue regulations that \nprotect fish and wildlife, their habitat, subsistence resources, and \nthe environment of the Coastal Plain of Alaska. The bill provides the \nSecretary with the authority to close areas of the Coastal Plain, on a \nseasonal basis, to protect caribou calving and other fish and wildlife \nspecies. The bill would also require those obtaining federal leases to \ncomply with federal and state environmental laws, reclaim leased lands \nto the condition in which they were found, and ensure the protection of \nfish, wildlife, and the environment. To ensure these actions are done, \nthe Secretary will require bonds to any lands and surface waters \naffected and conduct semi-annual inspections of every facility to \nensure compliance with all environmental regulations.\n  To my colleagues who oppose exploration of the Section 1002 area, do \nyou think other nations on whom we rely for our oil supplies are \nemploying similar protections? Do you think Iran, Libya, or Iraq are \ngoing the extra mile to protect wildlife? Do you think the OPEC nations \nare holding themselves to these stringent environmental standards? We \nall know the answer is an emphatic NO. Yet this Administration is \nopposing any exploration of the\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\nSection 1002 area for environmental reasons, while at the same time \nbegging Iran, Iraq, Libya and others to increase their production for \nus. I ask my colleagues, who are the real environmentalists here? \nCertainly not the Clinton Administration. It's clear to me that this \nAdministration's policy against exploration in the Section 1002 area, \nwhen compared against its policy of begging for increased oil \nproduction abroad, is a net loss for American jobs, family checkbooks, \ndomestic energy security, and the environment.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take a hard look at the \nintellectual dishonesty of refusing to explore our domestic oil and gas \nreserves for environmental reasons, while asking other nations to find \nand produce more oil with significantly fewer environmental protections \nthan we require. I support the inclusion of this assumption in the \nbudget resolution and I hope we vote to maintain it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there will be 2 minutes of debate, and \nthen we will have another vote. Votes don't count against this time. So \nif you take 20, 30 minutes on a vote, we just have to add that much \nmore to the resolution because we are not counting vote time under the \nstatute. I hope you will stay around and vote shortly, after the debate \nis completed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, my amendment would simply protect the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge from oil drilling. Following in the footsteps \nof conservationist President Theodore Roosevelt, President Dwight \nEisenhower set aside this Arctic wilderness area for all time and all \ngenerations.\n  While my amendment protects a wilderness, it also protects a legacy. \nIt is a legacy forged of foresight and conservation that has been \nhanded down from generation to generation. I hope we will pass this \nlegacy on today to future generations--just as we have received it from \npast ones. My amendment will insure that we do.\n  This is not a partisan debate. The President I have named were both \nRepublicans. I am joined in support of my amendment by many Democrats. \nTogether, both parties have a stake in this wilderness area. I hope \ntoday that both parties will join hands in protecting it. I urge my \ncolleagues to support my amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague. This is truly a bipartisan effort. \nAs this budget stands, it is the most antienvironmental budget in \nhistory because it is the first time any budget resolution has called \nfor drilling in a wildlife refuge. We know that when President \nEisenhower declared this a refuge, he never envisioned drilling in it. \nDrilling in a refuge is not only unnecessary; it is destructive.\n  Please support the Roth-Boxer amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret to do this, but my colleague \nfrom Delaware is wrong. I was there. President Eisenhower set aside an \narctic wildlife range that was open to oil and gas exploration. It was \nnot until 1980 that it was designated an area subject to oil and gas \nexploration. An environmental impact statement was provided by the \nCongress. It was not set aside by President Eisenhower or anybody as \nwilderness yet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska, Mr. Murkowski, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have had this issue in the budget \npackage before. Make no mistake, if the amendment of the Senator from \nDelaware is adopted, the Senate will go on record in support of a \nfailed energy policy that rewards the price fixers in OPEC and the \nmilitary ambitions of Saddam Hussein.\n  The Department of Commerce has indicated that our 56-percent reliance \non foreign oil threatens the national security. One out of two barrels \nis imported. Our growing dependence on imported oil will mean 30 giant \nsupertankers loaded with 500,000 barrels of crude oil will dock in this \ncountry every single day of the year. That is more than 10,000 ships a \nyear. That is surely an environmental disaster waiting to happen.\n  America has the highest environmental standards and laws in the \nworld. By increasing energy imports, we are simply exporting \nenvironmental problems to other countries.\n  Former Senator Mark Hatfield said, ``I would vote to open up that \nsmall sliver of ANWR any day, rather than send American boys overseas \nto risk their lives in a war over oil.''\n  Mr. President, yesterday the issue of exports of Alaskan oil came up \non the floor. I indicated at that time that when export contracts are \ncompleted this April, British Petroleum has assured me that it will \ncease exports of Alaska crude.\n  I have a letter dated March 23, 2000, from BP's Vice President for \nU.S. Government Affairs, Larry Burton, reiterating BP's pledge on \nexports. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               BP Amoco Corp.,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2000.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I would like to respond to your inquiry \n     regarding BP Amoco's plans concerning Alaska North Slope oil \n     exports. Pending completion of contracts due at the end of \n     April, at this time we do not have subsequent plans to \n     export.\n       We applaud the Administration and the Congress for its \n     wisdom to permit the market to work and to remove an \n     historical penalty imposed on Alaska North Slope oil. The \n     West Coast is part of the global crude market. The ultimate \n     destination of Alaskan crude has no effect on either West \n     Coast supply or gasoline prices. Once our acquisition of ARCO \n     is complete, we would expect to run all of our Alaska crude \n     through ARCO's excellent West Coast refining and marketing \n     network.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Larry D. Burton.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin for offering his \nversion of the tax cut proposed by Governor Bush. I believe he will get \nan opportunity next year to vote on it. I look forward to having that \nopportunity. I intend to vote for it when it is offered by then-\nPresident George Bush. I hope and believe it will pass the Senate by an \noverwhelming margin.\n  But let me try, if I might, to explain the dilemma we have in terms \nof trying to do the Bush tax cut now, as if this were a serious \nproposal. Then I want to discuss my substitute.\n  Quite aside from the fact the years do not actually match up because \nif George Bush is elected President, he will take the oath on January \n20 of next year, and therefore his tax cut would begin in fiscal year \n2002 in all probability, but let me explain the problem. I am grateful \nfor the opportunity because it tells a story that miraculously the \ngeneral public does not appear to understand; that is, why can't we \nhave Clinton's budget and George Bush's tax cut?\n  The reason we cannot--it is an old fact of life--you can't have your \ncake and eat it too. President Clinton has proposed a budget that, in \nthe 5 years from 2002 through 2006, would spend, relative to what we \nare spending now, an additional $494 billion. For the years that this \ntax cut amendment would be in force, the President's budget that was \nsubmitted this year, if enacted, would raise spending by $494 billion.\n  During that same period, the Bush tax cut, if adopted, would reduce \ntaxes by $483 billion. That gives rise to two points. First of all, we \ncannot increase spending on some 80 new programs and program expansions \nwhich President Clinton has proposed, increasing spending by half a \ntrillion dollars in 5 years--we cannot have the Government spend all \nthat money and at the same time give it back to working families so \nthey can spend it. We cannot do both. We are going to have to choose.\n  The question we are all going to have to answer--and by ``all'' I do \nnot mean just 100 Members of the Senate; I mean every voter in \nAmerica--the question we are going to have to answer is: Do we want \nthese 80 new programs and program expansions so we can spend in \nWashington another $500 billion over the first 5 years of the new \nPresidency, or would we rather eliminate the marriage penalty?\n  Today, Americans meet, fall in love and get married and they discover \nthey end up paying about $1,200 of additional taxes for the right to be \nmarried. Let me make it clear. My wife is worth $1,200--a bargain at \nthe price. But it seems to me she ought to get the money and not the \nFederal Government.\n  How can it make sense in America, if you have a janitor with three \nchildren and a waitress with two children, they meet, their dreams come \ntrue, they fall in love--under the American Tax Code they both lose \ntheir earned-income tax credit and they are suddenly in the 28-percent \ntax bracket? So they look at the dollars and cents and many of them \ndecide not to get married.\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\n  How does it make sense? If two people get out of college, meet, and \nfall in love and get married, forming the most powerful bond for human \nhappiness and progress in world history, why is that a taxable event? \nWhy is love and marriage taxed by the Federal Government?\n  Governor Bush says it should not be taxed. If he is elected \nPresident, he wants to repeal the marriage penalty so love and marriage \nare not taxable events.\n  If you agree with Senator Durbin, and if you agree with the Vice \nPresident, Al Gore, then you believe you can spend that money in \nWashington better than all of those married couples could spend it, and \nyou do not want to eliminate the marriage penalty. You want all these \nnew government programs.\n\n  Rather than starting a new spending spree, spending $494 billion on \nsome 80 new and expanded programs, Governor Bush has proposed that he \nwould rather eliminate the death tax.\n  What does the death tax do? Death is a taxable event under the \nAmerican Tax Code. Americans work their whole lives, they build up a \nsmall business, they build up a family farm, they pay taxes on every \ndollar they earn in their lives. Yet when they die and leave their \nlife's work to their children, the people they built the life's work \nfor, too often in America those children have to sell the farm or sell \nthe business to give Government up to 55 cents out of every dollar of \ntheir life's work. They paid taxes on every dollar they earned, but \nbecause they accumulated, because they saved, because they sacrificed, \ntheir children end up having to sell the business and sell the family \nfarm in order to give another tax to Government.\n  Senator Durbin and Vice President Gore say: Don't do that. Don't \nrepeal the marriage penalty. Don't repeal the death tax. Let us spend \nthis money for you in Washington.\n  You think that by keeping the farm your daddy and mama worked a \nlifetime for that you would be better off, but they say: You would not. \nLet us take your farm because we are going to give you all these \nGovernment programs.\n  They say: Look, you think you know how to spend an extra $1,200 on \nyour children, but you are wrong. Al Gore and Senator Durbin know \nbetter how to spend that money than you do.\n  This amendment is really about choice. President Clinton gives us one \nchoice, and George Bush gives us another.\n  President Clinton's choice is, between 2004 and 2006, some 80 new and \nexpanded programs will get $494 billion. That is what he wants to do. \nHe can spend this money and make everything wonderful for you and your \nfamily, and if you believe that, you ought to elect Al Gore as \nPresident because that is his program. In fact, he wants to spend far \nmore than President Clinton does.\n  Governor Bush believes you can spend that money better than the \nGovernment. So rather than giving the Government another $494 billion \nto spend--we are not talking about Social Security; we are not talking \nabout Medicare; we are talking about spending basically on \ndiscretionary programs.\n  The President's discretionary nondefense budget goes up by a whopping \n14 percent when one makes the adjustments for all the phony revenues \nand shifting when somebody is paying and when they are not paying.\n  If you believe President Clinton and Vice President Gore are right, \nthat we would be better off spending the $494 billion in Washington on \nyour behalf to help you and your family, then you ought to be for \nspending this money. But if you believe repealing the marriage penalty \nand repealing the death tax so your family can keep more money to spend \non their children so you don't have to sell your farm or sell your \nbusiness--and 73 percent of small businesses do not make it into the \nsecond generation, in part because of death taxes. If you believe you \nwould be better off spending $483 billion, along with every other \nfamily in America, than having Washington spend $494 billion for you, \nthen you are going to get to vote on it. This is going to be on the \nballot in November, but it is going to have Al Gore's name next to the \nspending and it is going to have George Bush's name next to the tax \nreductions.\n\n  How people are being confused is that many of our colleagues and the \nVice President and President say George Bush wants to give $483 billion \nin tax cuts, he wants to stop penalizing couples for getting married, \nhe wants to stop taking farms away from people when they die, and he \nwants to reduce tax rates across the board, and that is dangerous.\n  I say to Senator Domenici, they say it is dangerous to give back $483 \nbillion in tax refunds to working people, but they do not say it is \ndangerous to spend $494 billion. I ask the question: If it is dangerous \nto give it back to the American people and let them spend it, how come \nit is not dangerous to spend it right here in Washington, DC? How can \nit be irresponsible for Governor Bush to be talking about $483 billion \nin tax reductions, letting working people keep more of what they earn, \nand how come it is not irresponsible for President Clinton to be \ntalking about spending $494 billion more in Washington?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to make an observation and see if \nmy colleague agrees with me. As a matter of fact, if we took President \nClinton's budget and adopted it--and it has a 14-percent increase in \nnondefense discretionary spending; that is, 13 appropriations bills \nless defense and military construction. It has a 14-percent increase. I \nbelieve it was the Senator who found that is the highest increase in \ndomestic discretionary spending since the years of Jimmy Carter's \nPresidency when inflation was rampant.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Exactly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How many years does my colleague think it would take to \neat up all the surplus and be right there ready to use the Social \nSecurity surplus if we increased that spending 14 percent a year for \nthe next few years? How many years?\n  Mr. GRAMM. It would take 3 years to consume the entire surplus. Why \nis it less dangerous to let them spend the whole thing in 3 years than \ngiving a tax cut and giving most of that surplus back? The reason this \namendment is so important is that I do not think we are ready to debate \nthe Presidential campaign on the floor of the Senate.\n  The point is, our colleague from Illinois has offered an amendment \nthat he claims will have us voting on the Bush tax cut. Here is the \ndilemma: We cannot have Clinton spending and the Bush tax cut. We have \nto choose between the two. That is what the election is about. If you \nwant this spending, you ought to vote for Al Gore, and if you would \nrather repeal the marriage penalty so we do not charge young couples \n$1,200 a year for the right to be married, if you think we ought to \nrepeal the death tax so that you do not have to sell your daddy's and \nmama's farm when they die on which they spent a lifetime and paid taxes \non every dollar they earned, plowed money back into that farm, skimped \nfor it, sacrificed for it--or if you are a small business--if you think \nyou should not have to sell it just because they die, then you ought to \nvote for Governor Bush.\n  We cannot adopt the Bush tax cut now because we have the Clinton \nbudget before us. We are going to get an opportunity next year to have \na Bush budget and the Bush tax cut. At that time, I hope we will get \nvotes from some of our Democrats. I predict today that we will get at \nleast 15 of them who will vote for it.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield. Let me talk a little bit about \nmy amendment, and then I will yield.\n  Now that we are into Presidential politics, I have offered a \nsubstitute, and that is, we ought to vote on the Gore tax increase. As \nmany of my colleagues know, because they probably received a signed \ncopy, our Vice President has written a book, ``Earth in the Balance.'' \nThe principal proposal of this book is as follows:\n  He wants a coordinated program to accomplish the strategic goal of \ncompletely eliminating the internal combustion engine over, say, 25 \nyears. That means the pickup you have your umbrella and gun slung \nacross the back of is going to be gone. That means this new car you \neither have today or are hoping to buy is going to be gone.\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\n Eliminating the internal combustion engine is a pretty dramatic \nchange, especially over a 25-year period.\n  He goes on to say the reason he wants to do this is--talking again \nabout these cars and these trucks:\n\n       Their cumulative impact on the global environment is posing \n     a mortal threat to the security of every nation that is more \n     deadly than any military enemy we are ever again likely to \n     face.\n\n  There is no way we can eliminate the internal combustion engine \nwithout starting out over the next 5 years, maybe now with a $1.50-a-\ngallon tax, maybe in 4 years another $1.50, and to get rid of the \ninternal combustion engine we would have to get gasoline up $10, $20, \n$50 a gallon.\n  Since our colleague from Illinois decided today was the day we ought \nto begin to debate the Presidential campaign on the floor of the \nSenate, I thought we ought to have an opportunity for Senators to go on \nrecord saying they do not agree with the Vice President; they are not \nquite ready to kiss the internal combustion engine goodbye. I am still \nhoping to get a four-wheel-drive truck. I am not ready to let Al Gore \ncome in and impose his values that say it is OK for my people who live \nin rural areas of my State and commute 40, 50 miles a day to work to \ntry another mode of transportation to get rid of their car or pickup.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am not ready to do that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Senator will get his 30 minutes. I have my 30 minutes, \nwith all due respect.\n  What I have done is offer an amendment that says it is the sense of \nthe Senate we should not to be doing this; we should not be raising \ngasoline taxes so the Vice President can get rid of our cars and our \ntrucks.\n  Since the Senator from Illinois decided today we ought to vote on the \ntwo alternatives, his argument is that it is OK for President Clinton \nin his budget to spend a new $494 billion in taxes but it is not all \nright, it is risky, I say to Senator Domenici, it is terribly risky if, \ninstead of us spending it, we let the taxpayers spend it. I do not get \nit. I do not understand how it is not risky for us to spend it but \nsomehow it is risky to repeal the marriage penalty or the death tax.\n  So what I have offered, since we cannot do the Bush tax cut until \nGeorge Bush becomes President--and I would like to hurry the day; if we \ncould do something today that could make it come sooner, God knows, I \nwould sign on as a cosponsor. But I do not think we are going to be \nable to do it before the Constitution says we can. In any case, what I \nhave done, since we have started this debate, is I have taken the Vice \nPresident's book, and I have put in the first installments of what \nwould be required to get rid of all the internal combustion engines, \nand the first installment would be a $1.50 tax on gasoline today, then \nanother $1.50 tax 4 years from now. That would only start it. We would \nhave to go up from there. But I want to take a conservative approach, \nas I always do.\n  Finally, for those who say, OK, the Vice President wrote this book, \nbut he did not mean it. This book was written for environmentalists. He \nmeant it for them, but he did not mean it for people in Texas or New \nMexico--let me read his response when he was asked about it.\n  He said, ``There is not a statement in that book that I don't \nendorse, not one.''\n  I do not endorse them. I am against raising gasoline taxes. I am \nagainst taking away my pickup truck. I am opposed to it.\n  I thought this was going to be saved for us to vote on in the \nelection. But since our colleague from Illinois decided to debate the \nPresidential campaign today, let's debate it.\n  Let me conclude with this remark, and then I will reserve the \nremainder of my time and let our colleague speak.\n  I am happy to say the man I support for President wants to cut your \ntaxes. I am proud of it. I want the world to know it. I suspect our \ncolleague from Illinois is not going to be proud of the fact that Al \nGore wants to raise gasoline taxes as part of a program for a \n``coordinated global program to accomplish the strategic goal of \ncompletely eliminating the internal combustion engine.''\n  So we are offering a sense of the Senate today to say we are not for \nthat. He may be for it. Al Gore is for it. He says he is for it. He \nwrote the book. He said he was for it as late as 4-26-99. The point is, \nnot that he is not for it--he is for it --but that we are against it. \nThat is the purpose of this amendment.\n  Should we be debating the Presidential campaign on the floor of the \nSenate? I do not know whether we should or not. But since our colleague \nfrom Illinois decided to bring it up, I thought we ought to give people \nan alternative. It is the same choice they are going to have on \nelection day, on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November \nof this year.\n  It is a profound choice. The lives of every American family will be \nchanged if we repeal the death tax, if we repeal the marriage penalty, \nif we cut tax rates. The life of every American family will be changed \nif we have confiscatory taxes on gasoline to achieve some extremist \ngoal of eliminating the internal combustion engine.\n  Improve it? Yes. Make it more efficient? Yes. Make it more \nenvironmental friendly? Yes. But kiss it and modern civilization good-\nbye as part of some extremist environmental agenda? I say, no. I say, \nno. I believe the Senate will say no today. They are going to say no \ntoday. I would not be surprised if all 100 Senators said no.\n  The American people are going to say no in November.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment offered by the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the statements of the Vice President that my \ngood friend from Texas referred to are certainly valid. He stands by \nthose.\n  I am wondering if the Senator from Texas stands by the statement he \nmade on August 5, 1993, when we were working on the budget Deficit \nReduction Act, which has set this economy on fire doing great things \nfor the economy.\n  My friend from Texas, speaking about the President's deficit \nreduction plan, said:\n\n       This program is going to make the economy weaker. Hundreds \n     of thousands of people are going to lose their jobs as a \n     result of this program.\n\n  He also went on to say:\n\n       I believe hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose \n     their jobs as a result of this program. I believe that Bill \n     Clinton will be one of those people.\n\n  He further said:\n\n       I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill \n     the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, \n     the deficit 4 years from today will be higher than it is \n     today and not lower. When all is said and done, people will \n     pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, \n     Government will spend more money, and the American people \n     will be worse off.\n\n  I yield to the Senator, under the resolution, 20 minutes. If the \nSenator needs more time, it is available.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield so I can respond?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Texas would not yield for a question. \nBut I would like to ask him a question. I hope I am not inviting a \nspeech. It is a very simple question.\n  I am holding Vice President Gore's book, ``Earth in the Balance'' in \nmy hand. Can the Senator from Texas tell me which page he refers to \nwhen he says that Vice President Gore has called for a $3 gasoline tax \nincrease? I want to turn to that page immediately. Can the Senator give \nme the number of the page?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would be happy to respond by saying he calls for the \nelimination of the internal combustion engine over 25 years. Does \nanybody believe that you could achieve that without taxes driving up \nthe price of gasoline? I think----\n  Mr. DURBIN. I reclaim my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. He tells us what he wants, but he does not tell us the bad \nnews about how we get it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I reclaim my time, Mr. President.\n  If you have been around politics for about 5 minutes 30 seconds, you \nknow\n\n[[Page S2281]]\n\nthat when you do not have an answer, you answer a question with a \nquestion. That is what has happened.\n  Vice President Gore does not propose a $3 gasoline tax increase. He \nnever has. The Senator from Texas knows it. He is coming to the floor \ntrying to suggest a tax increase that he has dreamed up of $3 a gallon \nbecause he does not want to face the music when it comes to the real \ntax increases and cuts proposed by the Republican candidate for \nPresident, his Governor from the State of Texas, George W. Bush.\n\n  That is for real. That is the cornerstone of his campaign. You cannot \nstand it, Senator, but it is a fact. You make up taxes and put it in \nthe mouth of Al Gore. We take the words spoken by George Bush.\n  When I ask the Senate to vote on George W. Bush's tax cut--the \nmainstay of his campaign--you would think the Republicans would rally \nbehind George W. Bush. This is their man. This is the one they want to \nsee elected to the White House. But they run, in the words of our \nformer Senator Dale Bumpers, like the devil runs from holy water, when \nit comes to a vote on the George W. Bush tax cut. They cannot stand the \nthought of going on record for what the Senator from Texas says he is \nso very proud of. He is so very proud of George W. Bush's tax cut, he \nhas offered a substitute to it. He does not want to be on the record. \nHe does not want to go back to Texas and try to explain that tax cut. I \ndo not blame him. It is a bad idea. It is bad policy.\n  I make no apology for bringing to the floor of the Senate the major \nissues in the Presidential campaign. For goodness sakes, what would the \nworld think if the Senate stopped talking to itself and talking about \nissues that are being debated in America? This is the No. 1 issue in \nthe campaign. I make no apology for bringing it to the floor, asking \nDemocrats on this side and Republicans on the other, to go on record: \nDo you support it or don't you?\n  I make no apology for the progress we have made in this Nation over \nthe last 7\\1/2\\ years under the Clinton-Gore administration. I tell the \nSenator from Texas and anyone following this debate, I would gladly run \non the record of this administration and our economy. I would take it \nto every State in the Union because we know what has happened: \nUnemployment is down, housing starts are up, business creation is up, \ninflation is under control. We have seen America prosper in a way that \nhas never happened in our history.\n  It bothers my Republican friends to acknowledge this fact. They think \nit dropped out of Heaven. They do not think the President had anything \nto do with it. We know better. We know that on the floor of this \nSenate, and in the House of Representatives, President Clinton's budget \nplan, that started reducing the deficits and moving us in the right \ndirection, was passed without a single--not one--Republican vote in \nsupport. It kills them.\n  Senator Gramm was just quoted on the floor. He said it would be the \nend of--I have forgotten his exact words--but the end of civilization \nas we know it if the Clinton plan passed. Well, guess what. It did \npass, and America got a lot better. American families know we are \nmoving in the right direction. It is interesting to me that my \nRepublican friend from Texas just loves this Bush tax cut to pieces, \nbut he can't bring himself to go on record to vote for it. He doesn't \nwant to have to go back home and explain it--even in Texas, Governor \nBush's own State.\n\n  I am offering the Bush tax cut as he has proposed it in his own \nwords. Senator Gramm is offering a figment of his imagination about \nwhat Al Gore might have said. When I ask him for a specific page in \nthis book, where there is a $3 gas tax increase, I get a question back \nto me. Well, if you have been through the first grade, you know how to \nopen a book and go to the right page. That is what the teacher teaches \nyou. Senator Gramm can't take us to the right page in Vice President \nGore's book referring to a $3 gas tax because it isn't there. He is \nmaking it up.\n  Look at what the so-called fair Bush tax cut means to American \nfamilies. If you happen to have an income of $31,100 a year, it means a \n$500-per-year tax break under the Bush tax cut. But, boy, if you are in \nan income category over $300,000, there is a $50,000-a-year tax cut \ncoming from the Bush proposal, the one for which I want the Senate to \ngo on record.\n  Is this fair? It isn't fair whether you drive a pickup truck or walk \nalong the shoulder of the highway. It isn't fair to working families \nwho have to drive pickup trucks to survive. I think we ought to vote, \nand I think the Senator from Texas ought to withdraw his amendment so \nwe can vote up or down on something of which he is so proud.\n  Look at what happened to the deficits under various Presidents. I \nthink the record is clear. I am sure it hurts my Republican colleagues \nto acknowledge the obvious. We have seen the deficits grow under \nPresidents Reagan and Bush. But look at what has happened under \nPresident Clinton. The deficits have come down.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I quoted the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Phil Gramm of Texas, where he says, verbatim, among \nother things, on August 5 in the Congressional Record:\n\n       The deficit 4 years from today will be higher than it is \n     today and not lower.\n\n  Does the Senator's chart indicate that that statement is totally \nwithout foundation and not true?\n  Mr. DURBIN. It indicates that when you are asking the Senator from \nTexas, Mr. Gramm, for advice on where the economy is going, you ought \nto do just the opposite. He said the deficit is going up but the \ndeficit went down.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, on October 6, 1993, a few \nweeks after he made the statement about the deficit increasing, he said \nthis: ``This program''--he meant the Clinton deficit reduction plan--\n``is going to make the economy weaker. Hundreds of thousands of people \nare going to lose their jobs as a result of this program.''\n  Is the Senator from Illinois aware that we have created 21 million \njobs since this statement was made that hundreds of thousands of people \nwould lose their jobs?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I even have it on good authority that they have created \nnew jobs in Texas because of the prosperity coming forth from this \nadministration. I can't believe the Senator from Texas, who is in close \ntouch with his State, hasn't noticed that, and that with the Clinton-\nGore approach on our economy, with the help of the Federal Reserve, \nAmerica is moving in the right direction. Even Texas may be moving in \nthe right direction. I don't want to speak for that State.\n\n  Mr. REID. Here is another statement from August 6, 1993: ``I believe \nthat hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose their jobs as a \nresult of this program.''\n  He is speaking of the Clinton deficit reduction plan.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Who said that?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. He further said, ``I believe \nthat Bill Clinton will be one of those people. We have a Presidential \nelection coming up soon.''\n  Would the Senator comment on the statements made about President \nClinton losing his job and hundreds of thousands of people losing their \njobs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, of course, President Clinton was reelected in a \nrather decisive victory over former Senator Bob Dole. The American \npeople like the way America is moving forward. I am sure it has been \npainful for Senator Gramm and others who opposed the President's \nsuggested policy to get America back on track to realize they were \nwrong. The facts have shown them to be wrong. In fact, we have had the \nlongest period of growth and prosperity in America's economic history.\n  They want to change that, I say to the Senator from Nevada. Their \nPresidential candidate, George W. Bush, doesn't like the way things \nhave been going. He thinks that instead of the policies that have \nbrought America forward, we ought to change it all--a dramatic, \nradical, and risky tax cut that would go to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica.\n  When I asked the Republicans in the Senate to vote up or down on \nwhether they want to stand by Governor Bush, they came in with a \nsubstitute. They want to change the subject and invent a tax that they \ncannot even identify with Vice President Al Gore. Vice President Gore \nhas not called for a $3 gas tax increase.\n  I think the Vice President is right to heighten our awareness of the \nneed to do something to improve air quality in America. I might say to \nthe Senator from Texas--he may not know this--\n\n[[Page S2282]]\n\nabout 6 years ago, the Vice President, along with President Clinton, \nwent to the major automobile makers of the United States and challenged \nthem to come up with a more fuel-efficient engine, and it is possible, \neven in my lifetime, that what we know as the internal combustion \nengine will be gone, and we will have something that is cheaper to \noperate and safer for the environment. Whether you are from Texas or \nIllinois, that would be a good change.\n  When I listen to the critics of Vice President Gore on the \nenvironment, I find it hard to believe. I can't believe that even in \nthe State of Texas you aren't at least sensitive to air and water \nquality. But to say that anybody who brings up the environment is some \npinheaded professor that parks his bicycle straight overstates the \ncase. The American people, particularly younger people in this country, \nwant a cleaner nation, with air that is safe to breathe and water that \nis safe to drink. If the Vice President is heightening our awareness of \nenvironmental issues, so about be it. All political leaders should do \nthat.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, there has been a lot of \ndiscussion in the last few weeks about the cost of fossil fuel, \ngasoline, and diesel fuel being so expensive. It has come to my \nattention that 56 percent of the fuel that we use in this country comes \nfrom foreign nations. Does the Senator think the Vice President was \nconcerned about that and was trying to do something so we would be less \ndependent on the oil barons of the Middle East?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from Nevada is exactly right. It is \nabout time America gets serious about an energy policy. I can recall \nthat in previous administrations we had statements of fuel efficiency \non vehicles and on appliances, and, frankly, some people on the other \nside of the aisle thought that was a heavyhanded move by the \nGovernment. They have been fighting off that information at a time when \nwe should have it. We ought to be looking to alternative sources, not \nonly alternative sources for fuel, responsible sources in the United \nStates, but also alternative fuels. This is not radical thinking. It is \nsensible that we would look for alternatives to our dependence on \nforeign fuel. I think when Vice President Gore raises environmental \nconcerns, those are concerns most Americans share.\n  Let me go on to another point raised by the Senator from Texas. He \nraised the marriage tax penalty, which is imposed on people who, \nbecause their combined incomes bring them to a higher tax rate, pay \nmore after they are married than before. I say to the Senator from \nTexas--he probably knows this--the Democrats, the Republicans, and the \nPresident agree that this should be changed. There is no controversy \nhere. For him to raise it in the debate baffles me.\n  Second, when it comes to the estate tax, do you know what percentage \nof Americans pay the estate tax? I will answer this question. It is 1.3 \npercent of the estates that pay the estate tax.\n  Now, yesterday, I had a chance to meet a gentleman by the name of \nBill Gates, who runs Microsoft Corporation. He has had a bad month. His \nnet worth went down from $70 billion to $52 billion. When he passes \naway, I don't believe it is unreasonable that he would pay some taxes \nback to the America, which has given him a chance to succeed, to pay \nfor education and opportunities for the next generation.\n  Obviously, the Senator from Texas thinks that is unfair and unjust. I \ndo not. I do concur with his belief that we ought to change the estate \ntax law so that family farmers and family businesses can pass their \nenterprises on without penalty, under most circumstances. I already \nintroduced a resolution to that effect in the Senate last year. I hope \nwe can do that. But to eliminate the estate tax on Bill Gates doesn't \nstrike me as the progressive thinking of the Senator from Texas. He is \nentitled to his point of view.\n\n  Let me talk to you about his conjecture that President Clinton in his \nbudget is going to dramatically increase spending.\n  The Senator from Texas will never tell you on what specifics \nPresident Clinton wants to spend money. You would think it is a \nwasteful expenditure here, there, and the other place. My guess is, if \nyou take a close look at the specific areas of spending, you will find \nthat most American families agree. There are areas where we should \nspend more taxpayer dollars.\n  Let me give you a couple of illustrations.\n  Can we start with education? Is there anyone who couldn't believe we \nshould invest in education, hold the teachers and the establishment of \neducation accountable for what comes out of the classroom but give them \nthe resources to do a good job; pay teachers a decent salary; put the \ncomputers and technology in the classroom so they can teach adequately; \nand make sure schools are modernized for the 21st century?\n  I think that is one of the ``wasteful'' programs the Senator from \nTexas would have us eliminate so we can give a tax cut to the \nwealthiest people in American.\n  Look at some of the proposals by President Clinton for spending. I \nguess the Senator from Texas should have taken a look at this list. It \nappears he wants to spend some more money on additional defense for \nAmerica. I don't think that is altogether a bad idea. I think that is \npart of the preamble of the Constitution--that the United States wants \nto provide for the common defense. And I am glad President Clinton has \nshown leadership there.\n  When it comes to foreign assistance, he, for example, wants to invest \nmoney to make America's embassies overseas safe from terrorism. Is that \na wasteful expenditure we should do away with in the name of a $50,000-\na-year tax cut that George W. Bush proposes for people making over \n$300,000 a year?\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Environmental toxic cleanup: The President wants to spend more on \nthat. So do I. I don't want those toxic chemicals in the soil leeching \ninto ground water and contaminating water supplies across America.\n  The President is right, and the American people know it.\n  In the area of agriculture, we had an effort to help our farmers \nacross America struggling through the most difficult times. Yes. That \nis President Clinton's proposal for spending. Is it a valid one? You \nbet it is. For 2 straight years, we have passed emergency \nappropriations for farmers.\n  I take it the Senator from Texas doesn't believe we should do that; \ninstead, we should take the George W. Bush tax cut and give a $50,000-\na-year tax break to some of the wealthiest people in this country.\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Investments in transportation: So that the FAA can have modern \nequipment; so that when we get on an airplane with our family we have \npeace of mind that the best technology is available.\n  Yes, President Clinton wants to spend money on that, and apparently \nthe Senator from Texas thinks that is wasteful.\n  I don't know how he gets back and forth to Texas. When I travel to \nIllinois, it is on an airplane. I want it safe for me and my family and \nfor all of the other people who use it.\n  In the education area, the President's proposal would not only \nmodernize our classrooms but increase the number of teachers so we have \nsmaller class sizes.\n  A national literacy program that both Presidential candidates agree \non so kids by the third grade can read and write: Is that a good \nproposal and a goal for the 21st century? I think so. But the Senator \nfrom Texas, obviously, takes exception. He thinks that is another \nwasteful Government expenditure.\n  He would rather give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in America. I \nthink that is wrong. That is what elections are about.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator outlined very clearly the importance of certain \nspending taking place in this country. I would like the Senator to \ncomment on the fact that when President Bush took office, the yearly \ndeficits, not counting the Social Security surpluses which made the \ndeficit look smaller, were about $300 billion a year.\n  In addition to the President requesting some spending that the \nSenator outlined so clearly, what is the status of the deficits of this \ncountry since President Clinton became President?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am glad the Senator asked. As Senator Byrd carries the\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\nConstitution in his pocket, I carry with me a card which has a record \nof what is happening under the Clinton-Gore administration. Record \nbudget deficits have been erased.\n  In 1992, the deficit was a record $292 billion. The Congressional \nBudget Office said it was going to grow to $455 billion by the year \n2000, this year. Instead, we have a projected $167 billion surplus, the \nthird one in a row. That is $622 billion in savings not drained by the \nGovernment in 1 year alone. And we have had the largest paydown of debt \nin the history of the United States--$297 billion.\n  All the deficit hawks on the other side of the aisle hate to hear \nthese numbers, but they are the facts.\n  Under the Clinton-Gore administration, we have addressed the deficit \nsituation. We are no longer talking about a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget but are moving in the right direction. The American \npeople want us to continue doing that.\n  We have people who visit this Capitol at this time of year, usually \nclassrooms from across America. These young men and women who come to \nwatch this Senate and visit our offices deserve an America with a \nreduced national debt. That is the goal of the President's proposal and \nhis budget. It is one not shared by George W. Bush. He believes we \nshould give a massive and risky tax cut across the board. We believe \ntargeted tax cuts make more sense and deficit and debt reduction are \nabsolute priorities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Illinois has \nexpired.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator from Illinois an additional 15 minutes \nunder the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Historically, my friend from Illinois talked about what has \nhappened since Bush was no longer President and how the deficit came \ndown. From where did this huge national debt of $5 trillion come?\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from Nevada can remember that we \naccumulated more debt in the history of the United States with the \nelection in 1980 of President Reagan until President Clinton, and about \n1994 or 1995 started to turn the corner, than we had accumulated in the \nentire history of the United States, more debt than we had accumulated \nin our entire history.\n  We collect $1 billion in taxes every day to pay interest on the debt \nthat we accumulated during the Reagan-Bush era. President Clinton has \nfinally moved away from that. We are starting to reduce that debt, and \nwe think that is the highest priority. But it isn't the highest \npriority of Gov. George W. Bush. He believes the highest priority is a \ntax cut--a tax cut for some of wealthiest people in this country.\n  We believe we should target the tax cut to the families who need it. \nFor example, a lot of families send their kids to college. They know it \nis a very expensive undertaking.\n  We propose on the Democratic side that you be able to deduct from \nyour taxes college education expenses. This gives a helping hand to \nmiddle-income families across America so that the kids will finish \nschool with less debt, and maybe no debt.\n  I think that is a targeted tax cut that makes sense. It makes a lot \nmore sense than a $50,000-a-year tax cut for somebody making $300,000 a \nyear. That is the George W. Bush tax cut.\n  We also want to target the tax cut to help pay for long-term care. \nFamilies know when their parents and grandparents are elderly that it \nis expensive to care for them. They want to give them the best. It \ntakes a lot from their savings. We give a tax cut for that purpose--a \ntargeted tax cut to help pay for long-term care. That is a sensible \napproach.\n  We think the highest priority should be debt reduction. We are not \nthe only ones who suggest it. For anyone who believes this is a \npartisan proposal, take a look at this particular article that appeared \nin the Washington Post. This is from the business section. Alan \nGreenspan, not known to be a Democrat, the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board: ``Pay down the debt first.''\n  That newspaper was obviously not delivered in Texas because neither \nthe Senator who is speaking today on behalf of his amendment nor the \nPresidential candidate on the Republican side heard the news. Greenspan \nsaid debt reduction should be the highest priority--not in their book. \nFrom their point of view, the highest priority is making sure the \nwealthiest people in this country pay less in taxes. That to me doesn't \nmake sense. Let us pay down this awful debt that has been accumulated \nduring the Reagan-Bush years.\n  Let us try to put this behind us so future generations have more \nflexibility in their own lives; so that we have less demand for \ncapital; and interest rates coming down.\n  So those who are following the debate understand where we are, I put \nforward on the floor the Bush tax cut asking the Democrats and \nRepublicans to go on the record one way or the other. The Senator from \nTexas says: No. Let's try a substitute. He dreams up a gas tax increase \nand cannot point to one page in Vice President Gore's book that \nenumerates that increase, and he wants us to vote on that.\n  I encourage my friends on the floor to turn down the Gramm gas tax \nincrease. We don't need a $3 increase. Nobody on this side of the aisle \ncalled for it.\n\n  I think Senator Gramm should understand at this point in time it \nwould be devastating. That is what he wants to vote on because he \ndoesn't want to vote on the Bush tax cut, which is well documented. \nThat is painful, I am sure, but I think it is important we do it.\n  Back to the estate tax for a second. In 1995, approximately 2.3 \nmillion people died in America; 31,000 out of 2.3 million ended up \npaying the Federal estate tax, 1.37 percent. The vast majority of our \nNation's citizens simply do not leave estates valued at $600,000 or \nmore, which is the present annual tax threshold, which is going to \nincrease to $1 million, which I support.\n  The Senator from Texas would have us believe everyone passing away \nhas as their last act, before the undertaker wheels them out, filing a \nFederal tax form for the Federal estate tax. It doesn't happen. The \nvast majority, over 98 percent of the American people, don't pay this \ntax. Some of the wealthiest people in this country do. He thinks we \nshould wage this Presidential campaign over the 1.37 percent of the \npopulation. I think that is a mistake.\n  I think, honestly, those who have done well in America and prospered \nand made millions of dollars and left huge estates owe something back \nto America. That is part of the cost of living and prospering in this \ncountry, as far as I am concerned. We see that differently.\n  The Senator wants to preserve and protect those in the highest income \ncategories, give them the Bush tax cut, and turn his back on things \nsuch as education spending--which he thinks is wasteful government \nspending. I disagree.\n  There are some radicals on his side of the aisle who want to \neliminate the Department of Education. That is a serious mistake. I am \nnot going to put those words in the mouth of any single Senator, but we \nhave heard it over and over from the other side of the aisle. They \nwould take away the authority of the Department of Education to provide \nfor the 5, 6, or 7 percent of Federal aid to education across America. \nI think that is a mistake, too.\n  The President understands, as most American families do, that \neducation is critical for our future. If the Senator from Texas wants \nto walk away from this commitment to education, I think he is walking \naway from a commitment which is important for our children to make sure \nthey have the skills and education not only to prosper in this Nation \nbut to be able to compete in a global economy. He may think a tax cut \nfor wealthy people is more important than making certain that our kids \nare well educated, but I disagree with that. I think most American \nfamilies understand they get one chance to educate their kids, and they \nwant to do it right.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. We have talked about income taxes; that is what the Senator \nfrom Texas talked about and that is what the Bush tax cut mainly talks \nabout, the Federal income tax.\n  Is the Senator aware of the article that ran in the Washington Post 8 \nor 9 days ago, and then ran all over the country, indicating that the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\nincome tax now is at a 40 to 50-year low?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, the Senator from Nevada is correct. Despite all the \nstatements to the contrary, Federal taxes have been going down on \nAmerican families and they have been held to the 1970 level. We have \nbeen making real progress in that regard.\n  What we have tried to do when the Democrats had a voice in the \nprocess is make sure that tax cuts went to working families. Those are \nthe folks who need a helping hand. If there is an increased tax burden \nin this country, it comes primarily from State and local sources and \nfrom payroll taxes associated with the Medicare and Social Security \nprograms which, quite honestly, we have to sustain until we address \nmeaningful reform.\n  On that subject, let me add, President Clinton and Vice President \nGore are talking about investing this surplus back into Social Security \nand back into Medicare to reduce their debt and to make certain those \nprograms will be here for decades to come. The Republican side of the \naisle does not want to address those issues, and they should. Instead, \nthey want the George W. Bush tax cut. Instead of putting this money \ninto debt reduction and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, \nproviding for prescription drug benefits under Medicare, they would \ngive a tax cut to the wealthiest people in our country. That is the \nclear choice in the Presidential campaign.\n  The Senator from Texas does not believe I should raise this issue on \nthe floor of the Senate. He says since I have, it is open season for \ndebate on it. I welcome the debate. For goodness sakes, if we cannot \ncome to this floor and debate the issues that are central to the most \nimportant choice Americans will make in the year 2000 in the \nPresidential election, then this great deliberative body has lost its \nway. I think it is important that all Members come to the floor and be \nrecorded on this vote.\n  I invite the Senator from Texas to withdraw his substitute amendment \nso he can have an up-or-down vote on the Bush tax cut. Surely Gramm \nwants to go back to Texas and see your Governor and say: I stood by \nyou. I was with you to the bitter end. I defended you against your \ncritics. I am for the Bush tax cut.\n  Certainly you don't want to go back and say to your Governor: I \ndidn't want to vote on your tax cut so I put up a substitute. I dreamed \nup an Al Gore gas tax. I did my darnedest to avoid being on the record.\n  I am certain Texas pride demands standing by your Governor, as many \non your side of the aisle, I am sure, want to do. In order to do that, \nyou have to take away the substitute amendment. You have to face the \nmusic. You have to understand that if you are going to buy this tax cut \nfrom George W. Bush, you have to go on the record and do it and not \njust make speeches when you are off the Senate floor.\n  I yield back the time offered to me by Senator Reid under the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. How much time did the Senator have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He had 5 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President after listening to that, I feel like a \nmosquito in a nudist colony. I don't know quite where to hit.\n  Let me start at the beginning. Bill Clinton's plan was not just the \nlargest tax increase in American history; it was a stimulation package \nof $16 billion where spending exploded before the tax increase ever \nwent into effect. Republicans in the Senate killed that stimulation \nplan.\n  Bill Clinton's plan was to have the Government take over and run the \nhealth care bill. I remember distinctly somebody standing up and saying \nthe Clinton health care bill will pass over my cold, dead, political \nbody. That political body is still alive and the Clinton health care \nbill is dead.\n  Bill Clinton, when he sent Congress a budget in 1995, proposed a $200 \nbillion deficit, and his budget had a $200 billion deficit through this \nyear. Who lost their jobs? When we killed the Clinton health care bill \nand defeated the stimulus package, they lost their jobs. We elected a \nRepublican majority in both Houses of Congress. When we elected a \nRepublican majority, we rejected the Clinton budget and the deficit \nstarted to go away and we have a surplus today.\n  In terms of a reasonable policy to protect the environment, forgive \nme, but completely eliminating the internal combustion engine is not a \nreasonable policy to protect the environment. It is an extremist policy \nthat deserves to be rejected and it will be rejected. They are ashamed \nof it.\n  I ask the following question: How is he going to eliminate the \ninternal combustion engine? Maybe they are just going to confiscate the \ncars or trucks. Maybe they are going to take us off to prison.\n  If you don't do it with taxes, how do you do it? The point is, they \ndon't know how you would do it--at least they don't know before the \nelection. The American people are going to want to know.\n  They are for eliminating the marriage penalty--baloney. Where's the \nbeef? Their tax cut actually raises taxes for 5 years. Middle-income \nAmericans would get virtually no tax relief under their policy.\n  Finally, as to this ``tax the wealthy,'' what a phony issue that is. \nIn the President's first budget, they proposed raising taxes on people \nearning $25,000 a year who were drawing Social Security. That is what \nthey call ``rich.''\n  They were able to take a family making $44,000 a year and under \nClinton's first budget make it $75,000 by saying: To tax somebody, you \ncount the rent value of the home they own; you count the value of their \nlife insurance; you count the value of their parking place.\n  To the Democrats, anybody who works and makes money is rich. Whenever \nwe try to cut anybody's taxes, they are always rich. They have every \nexcuse in the world to do anything except to give the American people a \ntax cut.\n  Finally, let me say again the part of the story that they are not \ntelling is the following: Their budget, which they support, proposes \nthat over the next 5 years we spend $494 billion on new and expanded \nprograms. That is the Clinton budget.\n\n  What Governor Bush is proposing is that rather than spend all this \nmoney on these programs, we give part of it back to working families. \nWhy is it not risky for us to spend $494 billion on new programs, which \nis the Clinton budget that they support, and why is it risky for \nGovernor Bush to propose giving less than that amount back to families \nto let them spend it?\n  I have 3 minutes remaining. I yield to Senator Domenici.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have heard an interesting political \ndiscussion today. The idea we should be debating the Bush tax cut on \nthe Senate floor is totally political. It brought a political answer. \nSo we are now engaged in a Presidential election instead of a budget.\n  The truth of the matter is, we do not have before us a Bush budget. \nWhat we have before us is the budget of the President of the United \nStates. For those on the Democrat side who are talking about Bush's \nbudget, let me say they have never offered the President's budget. \nNobody has dared offer it because it is so bad that even they know they \nwould not get the votes for it.\n  That is not the kind of budget we are going to get next year, if \nGeorge Bush is President. He is going to give us a budget that calls \nfor less Government but priorities in Government. There is going to be \nsufficient money left over in his budget to have a tax cut, tax relief \nfor the American taxpayer, and take care of the Social Security trust \nfund. There is no doubt in my mind he will present that kind of budget.\n  We can argue all we want today about what fits in this year's budget. \nWe are operating against the competition of a budget from the \nPresident. We are not working with a President who wants to have tax \nrelief. As a matter of fact, this President's budget sets the way to \nincrease taxes in the first year, not decrease them, and to increase \nthem over the first 5 years, not decrease them. As a matter of fact, it \nis a tax increase budget. We have to compete with that and try to get \nour business done, having to work with him in the appropriations \nprocess. Now we have somebody coming down here telling us Bush's budget \ndoes not fit in ``your'' budget. Of course, it doesn't fit in our \nbudget because we have not yet seen what President-elect Bush would \nsubmit to us to do with all these duplicative programs. We heard there \nare\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\n342 programs in economic development. He is not going to leave those \naround. He is going to provide a completely different tone, a different \nkind of budget with high priorities in education and the issues he has \ndescribed.\n  I want to close by saying it is somewhat of a lark to come down here \nand talk about how big the deficit got following Jimmy Carter. Ronald \nReagan had to take over an America whose military had gone right down \nthe drain, an America that had an economy that was dead weak. He had to \nsit there and let the inflation come out of that and then, yes, build \nback defense and provide some tax relief for the American people. That \nwas a great economy. He took over when it was a basket case.\n  If we want to debate things past, I will conclude by saying: Does \nanybody believe this robust economy of America was made robust because \nBill Clinton and the Democrats increased taxes $293 billion? Does \nanybody really believe that? I am certain a majority of American \neconomists would say it was coming back strong, we plunked this on top \nof it, and it didn't break the economy; it just let it go ahead. It \nprobably would be stronger if we had not adopted the $293 billion. That \nis my guess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Is there time remaining with the majority?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All their time has expired.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2985 To Amendment No. 2953\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I send a perfecting amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. Is that amendment in order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment. Therefore, a second-degree amendment would not be in order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't understand. We have a second-degree pending. \nWhat kind of amendment is he sending? Is it amending the second-degree \namendment or the underlying amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is a second-degree perfecting amendment, \nbut it is an amendment to his own amendment which the Senator has the \nright to modify. It can be accepted as a modification.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to my friend, I did not think we were going to be \ndoing this. That is what you kind of said to me. But that is all right. \nI thought we were going to vote on second degrees, you would have \nanother round of votes on your own, but it is OK if you want to change \nthat now.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New Mexico, we are not changing \nanything. In all due respect, if their amendment had been prepared \nproperly, there wouldn't have been an opportunity for us to do our \namendment. We think there should be an up-or-down vote. We said all \nalong we are going to get an up-or-down vote, no matter how long it \ntakes, whether the majority is going to approve their Presidential \nnominee's tax cut; it is as simple as that. We asked for an up-or-down \nvote for the last 24 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is it an \nappropriate time for a Senator to send an amendment to the desk? Is it \nappropriate for a Senator to send an amendment to the desk unrelated to \nthe pending amendment, the one that has just been debated, and ask it \nbe placed in the queue for consideration?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent this amendment be placed in the \nqueue for consideration.\n  Mr. REID. Objection--just lining it up for later on? OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't know what the words ``queue it up'' mean. We \nought to get it straight. I don't object to his sending an amendment to \nthe desk, but I do object to gaining any kind of preferential treatment \nfor that amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have not requested any preferential \ntreatment. I simply wish to send it to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to submit an \namendment. The amendment is submitted. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This is the perfecting amendment to the \nunderlying Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So Senators would like a vote on the Durbin amendment? \nIs that what all this is about? Is that it?\n  Mr. REID. That is it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's just do it.\n  Mr. REID. That will be perfect. We think that would be very \nappropriate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we agree we are going to vote on the Gramm \namendment and then we will vote on the Durbin amendment, regardless of \nwhat happens to the Gramm amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from New Mexico yield?\n  Mr. REID. I think the staff is preparing an appropriate unanimous-\nconsent agreement. I think we can work this out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What we are going to do is have a vote on Senator \nDurbin's amendment, then have a vote on Senator Gramm's amendment?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from New Mexico to yield for a moment.\n  Mr. REID. We yield time under the resolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from New Mexico allow us, despite all \nthe debate this morning, to describe our actual amendments before the \nactual vote?\n  Mr. REID. We usually have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That will be fine. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes \nrelative to the following amendments be scheduled to occur at 2 p.m. in \nthe sequence listed, with no second-degree amendments in order, where \napplicable, prior to the votes, and there be 2 minutes prior to each \nvote for explanation, and all votes after the first vote in the \nsequence be limited to 10 minutes. The amendments are as follows: Reid \namendment No. 2985, which I understand is a Durbin amendment, \nessentially--is that correct, Senator?--and then Gramm amendment No. \n2973--and Senator Gramm is here. it is the same amendment to which he \nhas been speaking--and then Durbin amendment No. 2953, as amended, if \namended.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that following the allotted 1 hour of \ndebate, the pending amendments be laid aside until the stacked votes. \nIt may be that there is no time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand Senator McCain has an \namendment. We have agreed heretofore on the floor--the minority and \nmajority--that he would proceed as the next amendment. To do that, we \nhave to yield back time that we have on the pending amendment. I yield \nback any time I have.\n  Mr. REID. As does the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I thank Senator Domenici and Senator Reid \nfor allowing me to propose this amendment. I don't intend to take a \nvery long time. I know there are many other pending amendments.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment to the \nCongressional budget resolution for fiscal years 2001 through 2005 that \nwould provide the funding necessary to end the ``food stamp army'' once \nand for all.\n  This amendment increases the defense budget by $28 million over five \nyears--an average of less than $6 million per year--to pay for an \nadditional allowance of $180 a month to military families who are \neligible for food stamps. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates the amendment would save millions of dollars in the food \nstamp program by removing servicemembers from the food stamp rolls for \ngood.\n  Last week, I introduced S. 2322, the ``Remove Servicemembers from \nFood Stamps Act of 2000'', that will provide junior enlisted \nservicemembers who are eligible for food stamps in the paygrade E-1 \nthrough E-5 an additional subsistence allowance of $180 a month. A not-\nyet-published Department of Defense report estimates that approximately \n6,300 servicemembers receive food stamps, while the General Accounting \nOffice and Congressional Research Service place this number at around \n13,500. Regardless of this disparity, the fact that just one \nservicemember is on food stamps is a national disgrace, and this \nsituation cries out for repair.\n  In recent years, annual military pay increases have barely kept pace \nwith inflation--lagging at least 8 percent behind the pay increases in \nthe private sector during the same period. To put the impact of such \ntrends in plain dollar amounts, the lowest enlisted rank, an E-1, \ncurrently earns as little as $12,067 per year, plus $2,766 in \nallowances, which is well below the poverty level for a family of four. \nIn fact, the\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\nnumber of men and women in the military earning less than $20,000 per \nyear constitutes 45 percent of the Army, 46 percent of the Marine \nCorps, 26 percent of the Navy, and 18 percent of the Air Force. Of \nthese servicemembers, 111,600 have families and 6,515 are single \nparents.\n  Because of this serious disparity in military versus civilian pay, \nthe Congress took action last year to significantly increase military \npay across the board. The Senate-passed military pay bill, S. 4, \nincluded the same food stamp relief plan in S. 2322, and it was also \napproved by the Senate as part of the National Defense Authorization \nbill. However, I was greatly disappointed when the Senate-approved food \nstamp relief provision was rejected by conferees from the House of \nRepresentatives despite the strong support of Admiral Jay Johnson, the \nChief of Naval Operations, and General Jim Jones, the Commandant of the \nMarine Corps. With thousands of military families on food stamps, and \npossibly thousands more eligible for the program, I cannot understand \nthe Congress' refusal to rectify this problem in last year's National \nDefense Authorization Act.\n  It is outrageous that Admirals and Generals received a 17 percent pay \nraise last year, while enlisted families continue to line up for free \nfood and furniture. Last year, we poured hundreds of millions of \ndollars into programs the military did not request and that were not \nidentified by the Joint Chiefs as a priority item. It is difficult to \nreconcile how Congress could waste $7.4 billion on pork-barrel spending \nin the defense budget last year alone, yet refuse to provide a few \nmillion dollars to get military families off food stamps.\n  It is unconscionable that the men and women who are willing to \nsacrifice their lives for their country have to rely on food stamps to \nmake ends meet, and it is an abrogation of our responsibility as \nSenators to let this disgrace go on. Sadly, politics, not military \nnecessity, remains the rule, not the exception.\n  I will not stand by and watch as our military is permitted to erode \nto the breaking point due to the President's lack of foresight and the \nCongress' lack of compassion. These military men and women on food \nstamps--our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines--are the very same \nAmericans that the President and Congress have sent into harm's way in \nrecent years in Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo, and East Timor. They \ndeserve our continuing respect, our unwavering support, and a living \nwage.\n  S. 2322 is supported by The American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign \nWars, the National Association for Uniformed Services, the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, The Retired Officer's Association and every enlisted \nassociation or organization that specifically supports enlisted \nservicemember issues in the Military Coalition and in the National \nMilitary/Veterans Alliance. Associations include the Non Commissioned \nOfficers Association, the Retired Enlisted Association, the Fleet \nReserve Association, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the U.S. \nCoast Guard Chief Petty Officers Association, the Enlisted Association \nof the National Guard of the U.S., and the Naval Enlisted Reserve \nAssociation. I ask unanimous consent to include their letters of \nsupport in the Record following my remarks.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to the budget \nresolution that provides the funding for the food stamp relief in S. \n2322. It is a step in the right direction toward meeting our \nresponsibilities to our servicemembers and their families.\n  Mr. President, we must end the days of a ``food stamp Army'' once and \nfor all. Our military personnel and their families deserve better.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from various \nservice organizations in support of this amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2000.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of more then 4 million \n     members of The American Legion family we want to thank you \n     for introducing S. 2322, the ``Remove Servicemembers from \n     Food Stamps Act of 2000.'' This critical legislation provides \n     junior enlisted servicemembers in the pay grade E-1, through \n     E-5, who are eligible for food stamps, an additional \n     subsistence allowance of $180 a month.\n       The American Legion continues to support quality of life \n     features for members of the Armed Forces and their dependents \n     as well as military retirees. People are the foundation of \n     the Nation's fighting forces.\n       Military pay must be reasonably comparable to compensation \n     in the private sector if the Armed Forces aspire to compete \n     for quality volunteers and retain an experienced military \n     force for the long term.\n       With military families on food stamps, passage of relief \n     legislation to compensate junior enlisted servicemembers with \n     an additional subsistence allowance is critical to \n     maintaining adequate morale and ensuring retention of \n     America's military families in the Armed Forces.\n       American Legion National Commander Alan Lance's first hand \n     observations after meeting with soldiers, sailors and airmen \n     in Kosovo, Bosnia, and aboard the aircraft carrier, USS \n     George Washington serves to reaffirm your resolve in \n     assisting America's enlisted sons and daughters in uniform.\n       Thank you again for recognizing the sacrifice of America's \n     men and women in uniform. America's servicemembers stand in \n     harm's way in Somalla, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo, and East Timor. \n     They deserve continuing respect, unwavering support, and a \n     living wage from a grateful nation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Steve A.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 2 million members of \n     the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW) I \n     thank you for taking the initiative to introduce your bill \n     titled ``Remove Servicemembers from Food Stamps Act of \n     2000.'' We certainly share your concern that today, \n     regretfully, several thousand enlisted members of our active \n     duty force participate in the food stamp program. They do \n     this out of necessity rather than opportunism.\n       In our collective judgment the $180 per month Special \n     Subsistence Allowance (SSA) you propose is an equitable \n     amount of money in addition to the presently authorized Basic \n     Allowance for Subsistence (BAS) paid to those servicemembers \n     with dependents in the rank of E-1 through E-5. We also \n     strongly agree with your proposed termination of date for SSA \n     being after September 30, 2005.\n       In closing, and based on the above facts, the VFW will \n     support all efforts to have your proposed piece of \n     legislation enacted immediately in law. It is a national \n     disgrace to require even a few military families today to \n     need food stamps as part of their lifestyle. Thank you again \n     for having the courage and the time to address this \n     unconscionable situation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John W.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: This letter is being provided to you \n     on behalf of the National Association for Uniformed Services \n     to express our strong support for your bill to establish a \n     special subsistence allowance for members of the Uniformed \n     Services eligible for food stamps.\n       It is disgraceful that the level of compensation of any of \n     the nation's warriors is so low that they qualify for food \n     stamps. This legislation would help those with the most \n     serious problems and is a necessary and welcome step toward \n     correcting the inequitable compensation provided to members \n     of the Uniformed Services.\n       We appreciate your long-standing concerns for our men and \n     women in uniform and strongly support the ``Remove \n     Servicemembers from Food Stamps Act of 2000.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard D.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the Disabled American \n     Veterans (DAV), I commend you for introducing the ``Remove \n     Servicemembers from Food Stamps Act of 2000.'' Your efforts \n     on behalf of the men and women who serve our nation in its \n     Armed Forces is greatly appreciated.\n       It is indeed unconscionable that the men and women who are \n     willing to sacrifice their lives in defense of our nation and \n     its ideals are forced to depend on food stamps to feed their \n     families. It also effects the nation's state of military \n     readiness when our servicemembers deployed around the world \n     must worry about their loved ones at home,\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\n     and whether their needs are being met. This is not conducive \n     to a strong national defense.\n       These military men and women, who are continually put in \n     harm's way by the President and the Congress, should never \n     have to rely on charity to make ends meet. We must never let \n     our defenders of freedom down, especially when they are \n     deployed in protection of world freedoms.\n       The delegates to our last National Convention, held August \n     21-25, 1999, in Orlando, Florida, passed Resolution No. 052, \n     which calls for adequate funding for the defense of our \n     nation, both at home and abroad. I have enclosed a copy of \n     this resolution for your information.\n       Thank you again for your efforts on behalf of our nation's \n     military members and for your support of veterans' issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joseph A.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the nearly 400,000 \n     members of The Retired Officers Association (TROA), I am \n     writing to express TROA's support for your bill, S. 2322, the \n     ``Remove Service Members from Food Stamps Act of 2000.''\n       All Americans are concerned when thousands of younger \n     families serving their Nation in uniform have become eligible \n     for public assistance. TROA believes strongly that the \n     ultimate answer is to increase military pay sufficiently to \n     restore pay comparability with the private sector and wipe \n     out the double-digit military pay raise gap that has \n     accumulated over almost two decades. In addition, housing \n     allowances must be increased to fully offset the cost of \n     adequate housing for each pay grade.\n       Until the Executive and Legislative Branches are prepared \n     to allocate the funding required to accomplish these goals, \n     the only way to resolve the food stamp issue is a special \n     allowance such as provided for in S. 2322.\n       TROA applauds your concern for the well-being of our men \n     and women in uniform, and particularly for those in lower \n     grades for whom past pay constraints pose the most \n     significant impacts on their standard of living.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Paul W.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The Non Commissioned Officers \n     Association of the USA (NCOA) is writing to state its strong \n     support for the ``Remove Servicemembers from Food Stamps Act \n     of 2000,'' legislation that you are preparing to introduce in \n     the very near future. In these times of unprecedented \n     prosperity in America, it is impossible to reconcile how even \n     one U.S. Armed Forces member should be in the position of \n     qualifying for food stamps.\n       The fact that this legislation is needed is a further \n     statement on how Congress and the Administration have allowed \n     military basic pay and other components of the total \n     compensation package to seriously erode. While the Remove \n     Servicemembers from Food Stamps Act of 2000 will not solve \n     the underlying problems, NCOA believes it is a positive, \n     compassionate step in the right direction. This legislation \n     demands the full support of all of your Senate colleagues--it \n     is the right thing to do.\n       The Association extends its sincere appreciation for your \n     leadership and support for the enlisted men and women of the \n     U.S. Armed Forces. Count on NCOA's support to get this \n     legislation enacted.\n       Sincerely,\n                                                    Larry D.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 110,000 members and \n     auxiliary of The Retired Enlisted Association (TREA), TREA \n     National President Fred Athans and TREA National Auxiliary \n     President Kay Claman, I would like to express our support for \n     your efforts on behalf of these members of the Armed Forces \n     currently receiving food stamps.\n       As we enter into the 21st Century, it is unconscionable \n     that individuals who are serving this great nation are forced \n     to rely on government assistance in order to properly support \n     their families. As you are certainly aware, today's military \n     is ``doing more with less'' than any time in the recent past. \n     Those in uniform are spending more hours on the job with an \n     ever increasing operational tempo, yet many of these \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines cannot properly feed \n     their children. the time has come to address this issue once \n     and for all.\n       TREA strongly supports your amendment to the budget \n     resolution which will provide for the Department of Defense \n     to ensure today's military personnel, particularly the junior \n     enlisted force--the future non-commissioned officers, can \n     take care of their families without relying on food stamps.\n       In closing, I would again like to thank you for your \n     leadership and attention to this very important issue. If \n     TREA can be of any further assistance please do not hesitate \n     to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mark H.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Please be advised that the Fleet \n     Reserve Association (FRA) endorses your proposed bill, the \n     ``Remove Service Members from Food Stamps Act of 2000.'' The \n     bill will certainly alleviate the unfavorable publicity \n     concerning junior enlisted members of the Armed Forces who \n     must depend upon food stamps to supplement their meager pay. \n     In addition, the Association understands that the Chief of \n     Naval Operations and the Commandant of the Marine Corps \n     support the proposal.\n       The unfortunate fact that junior enlisted members are \n     forced to rely on food stamps reflects the inadequacy of \n     military compensation. Although there was progress toward \n     closing the significant pay gap between military and civilian \n     pay levels last year, more must be done and this measure \n     helps address this reality.\n       Petty Officers and Non-commissioned Officers are the \n     backbone of the military services and deserve fair and \n     equitable compensation for their great service to our Nation. \n     Retaining these essential personnel must be a high priority \n     and FRA remains committed to improving their pay and \n     benefits.\n       FRA salutes you for your strong commitment to the men and \n     women serving in our Nation's uniformed services.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Charles L.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 150,000 members of \n     the Air Force Sergeants Association, I thank you for \n     introducing legislation important to the enlisted men and \n     women of all components of the Air Force. This bill would \n     provide $180 dollars a month to any military member who meets \n     the food stamp income qualification threshold. As you \n     indicated, it is unconscionable that our nation allows these \n     brave men and women to subsist below the poverty level. As \n     such, your legislation would provide some much-needed \n     monetary relief to this group until such time as our national \n     leaders correct the situation.\n       Indeed, the lowest ranking members of our Armed Forces \n     often express their dismay as they observe this country's \n     spending priorities. In so many different ways, we fail to \n     thank them for their sacrifice. In so many ways, we \n     communicate to them (by the things we do and don't support) \n     that they are just not very important to this nation.\n       Again, Senator, thank you for introducing this legislation \n     to provide those who meet the food stamp program threshold \n     with an additional monthly stipend. The message this \n     legislation sends is, ``We are proud of you, we honor you, we \n     depend on you, and we will support you and your families.' As \n     always, this association is ready to support you on this \n     legislation and other matters of mutual concern.\n           Sincerly,\n                                                  James E.

John McCain,\n     Senate Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The Enlisted Association of the \n     National Guard of the United States applauds your efforts to \n     assist our Junior Enlisted members within the military.\n       Although we ask these young men and women to endanger \n     themselves for their country, their country does not provide \n     adequate pay and allowances to provide support for their \n     families.\n       In the FY 00 Authorization Bill, Congress authorized a mid-\n     year increase for supposedly mid-grade service members. \n     However, in some cases, high-ranking officers making tens of \n     thousands of dollars received upwards of a 17% salary \n     increase, while junior grades received a 5.2% increase \n     overall.\n       We spend millions of dollars yearly recruiting individuals \n     to join the military. Why can't we find enough monies to \n     enable those who serve in the military to feed their \n     families?\n       Senator McCain, we wholeheartedly endorse your legislation \n     to help our Junior Enlisted members.\n       Working for America's Best!\n                                       MSG Michael P.

Pierman,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to provide a couple of brief \nanecdotes which are sometimes disturbing. In a July 20, 1999, piece in \nthe Washington Post entitled ``Feeling the Pinch of A Military Salary; \nFor Some Families Pay Doesn't Cover The Basics,'' it starts out by \ndescribing:\n\n       On a muggy Saturday at Quantico Marine Corps Base, about \n     two dozen Marines and family members quietly poked through \n     piles of discarded furniture, clothing, and household goods \n     in what has become a weekly ritual at the big Northern \n     Virginia installation. At 8 a.m., the patch of lawn was \n     covered with beds, tables, dressers, and desks. Within 45 \n     minutes, almost all the furniture was gone. The price was \n     right--Everything was free.\n       The items had been gathered by volunteers who go \n     ``trashin'' every Tuesday, scouring garbage left at curbs on \n     the base. Every Saturday, they give away what they collect to \n     needy, eager Marine families.\n       ``We're talking about the basics of life here, and they \n     don't have it,'' said Lisa Joles, a Marine wife who created \n     the Volunteer Network 2 years ago. ``Sometimes, they don't \n     have a thing. I didn't know how large the problem was until I \n     got to Quantico.''\n       One result is that members of the military routinely work \n     second jobs, often without permission from superiors, \n     military officials acknowledged. Enlisted men and women sell \n     goods at Potomac Mills, flip hamburgers at fast food \n     restaurants, do construction work, and deliver packages for \n     UPS. ``It seems like everybody who has been here a while has \n     a part-time job,'' said Marine Lance Corporal Robert Hayes, \n     who has a second job as a mover. ``You really don't have \n     enough money to make it to the next paycheck otherwise.''\n       Several evenings each week, as soon as he finishes duty at \n     Quantico, Lance Corporal Harry Schein darts off base, picks \n     up his 14-month-old son from day care and drops him off with \n     the boy's mother. Then he drives up I-95 to Arlington and \n     joins a group of Marines who moonlight moving office \n     furniture until about 11 p.m. On Saturdays and Sundays, he \n     works from 4 p.m. until midnight as a security guard in \n     Alexandria.\n\n  The stories go on and on. About a year ago, there was a piece on 20/\n20 shown out at Camp Pendleton. Enlisted men and women and their \nfamilies were lining up for cartons of food. We have a lot of retention \nproblems in the military and we have a lot of recruiting problems. \nThese, I know, are going to be well ventilated by the Armed Services \nCommittee as time goes on. In my earlier years, it would have been hard \nfor me to comprehend these kinds of conditions prevailing among the men \nand women in the military, particularly in the All Volunteer Force.\n  Mr. President, I ask for a recorded vote on this amendment, and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the managers, Senator Domenici and Senator Reid.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield off his time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the remainder of my time after Senator Domenici \nspeaks, or after anyone else who wants to speak on this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  We will try to stack this vote, if it is all right with the Senator. \nWe are going to have the three votes.\n  I commend Senator McCain. I hope what he is suggesting on the floor \nhappens, because the truth is, the U.S. Department of Defense is making \nit very difficult for this to happen. We have worked with them on a \nnumber of occasions. You would actually be shocked at some of the \ncorrespondence I have received.\n  I want to quote one piece of correspondence. When I said, why don't \nyou tell us how to take care of the food stamp problem, this is what \nthe Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Edwin Dorn, wrote \nto me: It would be a mistake to give higher pay to military personnel \nwho had ``a larger family than he or she can afford.''\n  You can see why that becomes part of the issue, as the Senator from \nArizona understands. We have an all-volunteer military that we have \nasked to stay on for long periods of time. It is not like draftees who \nspend 2 years in uniform. They have families. They have children. In \nfact, we have not quite figured it out. Maybe the Senator from Arizona \ncan figure it out in his committee. With this targeting of money \ntoday--not a lot of money--we will start solving the problem with those \nwho are not earning much. That is the intent of the proposal of the \nSenator from Arizona.\n  But essentially it is very difficult for the military to come up with \na conclusion that we have to make sure we don't penalize big families \nin the military. I never heard of any implication that we had an all-\nvolunteer military and we were going to start by saying to them: Don't \nhave too many children.\n  I believe the Senator from Arizona would join me in saying that is an \nabsurd policy. What if they have five children? I think that is all \nright. If they want to serve 30 years in the military with five \nchildren, we ought to give them the benefits they deserve. Because they \nhave that many children, we ought not to cause them to be on food \nstamps. That is the basic problem we have.\n  I want to put in the Record letters I wrote in 1996, the response I \nreceived from Edwin Dorn and from Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1996.\n     Hon. Edwin Dorn,\n     Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, \n         Department of Defense, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Under Secretary Dorn: I am writing to express my very \n     strong concern about an issue involving the fundamental \n     quality of life of many U.S. military personnel. I am also \n     requesting that as the defense Department official with \n     purview over the 8th Quadrennial Review of Military \n     Compensation you look into the matter and consider solutions \n     as the Review Commission prepares to make its recommendations \n     on the military compensation system to Congress this summer.\n       The issue that troubles me is the fact that according to \n     Department of Defense (DoD) estimates, there are currently \n     almost 12,000 active duty military personnel whose families \n     qualify for and receive food stamps. I further understand \n     from DoD research that while pay for single enlisted \n     personnel is sufficiently high such that none qualify for \n     food stamps or other forms of welfare, married personnel with \n     families with as few as one dependent, for an E-1, do in some \n     cases qualify. I also understand that even sergeants and some \n     junior officers can qualify, depending on their number of \n     dependents and pay allotments. Furthermore, many of these \n     military personnel live off base and receive an additional \n     housing allowance in their paycheck and yet their pay remains \n     sufficiently low that they still qualify for food stamps.\n       Frankly, I do not believe it is acceptable that the men and \n     women who serve in our Armed Forces and who experience all \n     the rigors of prolonged overseas deployments, family \n     separations, other sacrifices the Nation asks of them should \n     have pay so low that they must accept food stamps, or any \n     other form of welfare. This situation reflects extremely \n     poorly on the ``Quality of Life'' for Armed Forces personnel \n     that is described to be the primary point of emphasis in The \n     President's defense budget. This situation not only fails to \n     reward U.S. military personnel at an appropriate level, it \n     will also exacerbate recruiting and retention problems for \n     the military services, especially as the pool of available \n     quality recruits shrinks and as downsizing in the services \n     has finally ended.\n       According to DoD calculations, under the existing military \n     compensation system, a supplemental allowance by family based \n     on grade and number of dependents could put the pay of \n     virtually all current military food stamp recipients above \n     the gross income eligibility criteria for food stamps and \n     would cost $72.6 million. This is, of course, only one \n     possible solution to this problem. Because I know, you and \n     the 8th Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation are \n     considering the entire compensation of that complex system, I \n     do not want to presume the optimal solution. I do, however, \n     want to impress on you\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\n     the need to address the problem and to seek a level of \n     compensation for Armed Forces personnel that precludes \n     overall compensation so low that their families qualify for \n     food stamps or any other form of welfare.\n       I very much appreciate your taking my concerns into \n     consideration. I look forward to working with you on this \n     important issue after the 8th Quadrennial Review of Military \n     Compensation makes its report to Congress this summer.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Peter V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1996.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici: Thank you for your May 15 letter \n     about military families on food stamps. I share your concern \n     for this problem and have given a lot of thought to it. For \n     those reasons. I am especially apologetic about the slowness \n     of my response to you.\n       The Department has studied this issue twice recently, in \n     1991 and in 1995, and thus I elected not to include it in the \n     Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation. Their studies \n     confirm an insight contained in your letter; the number of \n     military families eligible for food stamps is largely an \n     artifact of a system that does not count the value of \n     military housing when computing food stamp eligibility. If we \n     were to control for value of housing and for family size \n     (another criterion), the number of military families in this \n     category in 1995 would drop from 12,000 to fewer than 5,000.\n       This computation does not dispose of the problem. I remain \n     concerned that thousands of military families are eligible \n     for food stamps, and that they are regarded by some as \n     impoverished. However, my concern is tempered by the \n     realization that the military member and his/her spouse have \n     made a decision to increase the size of his/her family. The \n     Department does a number of things to accommodate \n     servicemembers' personal choices. As the number of dependents \n     increases, for example, the member become eligible for larger \n     family quarters. And, there is no limit on the number of \n     minor dependents eligible for the Defense health program.\n       This is a difficult issue because it requires us to weigh \n     our concern for military family members against the military \n     member's obligation to exercise judgment. I do not believe it \n     would be prudent to adapt the military compensation system \n     further to accommodate a member's decision to have a larger \n     family that he/she can afford.\n       I appreciate and share your concern for the quality of life \n     of military families. If thee is additional information I can \n     provide, I shall be happy to do so.\n           Sincerely,\n     Edwin Dorn.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 1997.\n     Hon. William S. Cohen,\n     Secretary of Defense, Department of Defense, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Cohen: During your inaugural press \n     conference on January 31, you were asked a question about the \n     12,000 Armed Forces personnel who are currently using \n     foodstamps. You responded to the question by stating that it \n     is ``not acceptable'' for service men and women to be \n     foodstamp recipients. Responding to the same question, \n     General Shalikashvili stated that he believed that the \n     condition of these military families should be changed. Your \n     and General Shalikashvili's responses to this question were, \n     for me, very welcome news; that so many military families \n     qualify for foodstamps does not indicate that the \n     Administration is serious about ``quality of life'' for our \n     Armed Forces; it indicates the opposite.\n       Last year, I had an exchange of correspondence on this \n     subject with under Secretary Dorn, urging him to address the \n     problem. Unfortunately, he chose not to review this matter \n     during last year's Quadrennial Review of Military \n     Compensation. Under Secretary Dorn also seemed to argue that \n     family size is purely a matter of choice to service men and \n     women and that he ``did not believe it would be prudent to . \n     . . accommodate a [service] member's decision to have a \n     larger family than he/she can afford.'' A copy of this \n     exchange of correspondence is enclosed.\n       I hope that you will agree with me that the time has come \n     to take action on this matter and to adjust compensation for \n     those enlisted personnel who you judge to be truly in need. I \n     am in complete agreement with you that the current situation \n     is not acceptable, and I would be very happy to work with you \n     to resolve it.\n           With best regards,\n                                                 Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pete: Thank you for your letter of February 11, \n     expressing your concern about military members who receive \n     food stamp benefits. You are correct. I did say that it was \n     unacceptable to have members of the military on food stamps \n     during the January 31, 1997 press conference. However, both \n     General Shalikashvili and I believe that this is a very \n     complex issue, which not only involves the Department's \n     compensation system, but also the structure of government \n     food stamp programs.\n       I will continue to closely monitor this issue, as I am \n     committed to ensuring that our service men and women enjoy \n     the quality of life they have earned and deserve.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                             Bill.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Arizona that \nthis is not a lot of money he is asking for here. I guess technically \nyou can't direct it in a budget resolution. But I think when we vote \nfor this this afternoon--I hope everyone will vote for it--we will be \nsaying: Let's begin to solve this problem. Let's not sit around and say \nfamilies within the military are too big. Let's fix it.\n  Am I kind of speaking for what the Senator from Arizona is worried \nabout? Am I on the right track?\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, yes, he is doing exactly what \nI had in mind. I appreciate very much his long-term commitment on this \nissue. It is long overdue. We should fix it. I share his \ndissatisfaction with the Department of Defense in its responsibility \ntowards these young men and women.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe all time has been yielded on our side. Are we \nready for another amendment?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will withhold the unanimous consent request, \nI want to consult with our leader. I am pretty sure it is OK. I want to \ndoublecheck.\n  We have so many amendments to be offered, and we know the other side \nis next in line to offer the next amendment. Until their Member shows \nup, we would like Senator Reed to speak off the resolution about an \namendment which he will offer at a subsequent time.\n  Mr. President, the minority yields the time on the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we yield time to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Nevada \nfor yielding time. I am going to take a moment to discuss an amendment \nthat I will propose later today.\n  On May 20 of last year, this Senate passed effective, commonsense gun \nsafety legislation as part of the juvenile justice bill. The vote was \noverwhelming--73-25. It was in response to the tragedy at Columbine \nHigh school, a tragedy that shook the very foundation of America's \nsense of security, their sense of the well-being for their children. In \nresponse to that great tragedy, this Senate acted. It passed a \ncommonsense gun control provision that would close loopholes in our \nNation's gun laws--not only to help prevent future Columbines but to \ntry to stop this pervasive wave of gun violence that is sweeping \nAmerica and claiming 12 children each and every day.\n  Yet here we are, almost 1 year from the day of the Columbine tragedy, \nand we still have not brought to this floor the conference report so \nthat we can vote upon it and send it to the President for his \nsignature.\n  Leadership, both the House and the Senate, has stood idly by while \nall of America asked us for a very simple request to get on with the \nbusiness we started last May to bring the juvenile justice bill to the \nfloor for a vote, for passage we hope, and for the signature of the \nPresident.\n  What happened in the intervening year is that this conference \ncommittee met only once last August. In effect, the message that I \nthink is being communicated is there is a hope and an expectation by \nthe Republican leadership in the House and Senate that this problem \nwill go away, that people will forget about Columbine, and that people \nwill forget about this tragedy. We cannot forget. We have to take \nactive steps to ensure that the measure we pass will at least come back \nfor a clear vote and, hopefully, come back so we can incorporate it in \nreal legislation.\n\n  It is very unusual that a conference would take this long. I can \nrecall being part of a financial service modernization bill--very \ncontentious legislation;\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\nlegislation that involved numerous interest groups; legislation that \neffectively failed at the very last moment in the last Congress; and, \nagain, in this Congress--that was subject to a tumultuous series of \nlegislative maneuvers on both sides of Congress. Yet it only took us 3 \nmonths to rationalize, to compromise, and to ultimately pass this bill \nin the conference.\n  We just spent 1 month dealing with the issues of transportation in \nthe Transportation Act, a $209 billion legislative initiative.\n  My suggestion is pretty clear, that this is not routine business as \nusual by taking this long for a conference. It represents a deliberate \ndecision not to act, a deliberate decision to try by stalling, by \ndelay, by tying this up with the approaching elections so that \neffectively what we will do is end prematurely the important steps we \nbegan last May 20 by adopting commonsense gun control legislation.\n  This is something the American people clearly want. It is something \nthat, when they are asked, they will overwhelmingly say are commonsense \nmeasures.\n  A poll was recently conducted in which over 90 percent of Americans \nresponded by saying they wanted child safety locks. In this group, 85 \npercent of the gun owners responded saying they, too, wanted child \nsafety locks. They also want us to close the loopholes on the gun shows \nby an overwhelming majority. Yet despite overwhelming public support, \ndespite our already accomplished legislation in this party the bill \nlanguishes in conference.\n\n  In this debate, there is a great hue and cry that we don't need more \nlaws, just enforce the ones on the books. In this debate, law \nenforcement is on our side. They recognize that in addition to \nenforcing the laws, we need other commonsense laws that will give them \nadditional tools, that will go to the heart of many issues that have to \nbe addressed if we want a sane and peaceful society.\n  This chart indicates the number of associations of law enforcement \nofficials that are strongly supportive of our initiative, including the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police and the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers. Police are on our side. They stand with \nus to demand we take effective, prompt action to send this juvenile \njustice legislation to the President for his signature.\n  In addition to that, I was this morning with a group of police \nofficers from my home State of Rhode Island and others from Maryland. \nThey were quite clear; they want to see prompt action. When we have the \nAmerican people overwhelmingly supporting this provision, when we have \nlaw enforcement, those men and women who stand most in the line of \nfire, demanding this legislation be passed, it is indeed puzzling we \nare not taking effective steps to pass this legislation.\n  Let me briefly review what is at issue in the juvenile justice bill \nso we can be clear about the nature of this legislation. First, in the \njuvenile justice bill we passed an amendment requiring that a secure \nstorage or safety device be sold with all handguns. Unlike virtually \nevery other product in the United States, firearms produced in this \ncountry are not subject to regulation by the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission.\n  Again, one of the great ironies of present-day America is that a toy \ngun is subject to safety provisions of the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission; a real gun that can cause real harm and real damage--death \nin many cases--is not subject to such regulation. As a result, \nmanufacturers of firearms produce weapons lacking, in some cases, even \nthe most rudimentary safety features designed to prevent the accidental \nor intentional shooting of children or by children.\n  The tragic consequences are undeniable. Each year, suicides and \naccidental shootings make up more than half of the tens of thousands of \ngun deaths in the United States. Kids are frequently the victims. This \nis an important point. The gun lobby tries to suggest that the victims \nof shootings are being waylaid by armed desperados who are law breakers \nwho will never follow laws. In fact, the reason they are on the streets \nis that the laws are ineffectual for putting them behind bars. More \nthan half the shootings are accidents, with no criminal intent, or \nsuicide, in which the individual is so depressed and despondent, they \nare seizing a weapon to destroy themselves.\n  We have been shocked recently by the tragic death of Kayla Rowland, a \n6-year-old shot by another 6-year-old in Mount Morris Township, MI. I \nbelieve if a Member came to this floor last May 20 and predicted that a \n6-year-old child would be shot by another 6-year-old child in a \nschoolroom in the United States, we would have been hooted down as \nhysterical demagogs. Sadly and tragically, that has happened.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't want my remarks to interrupt his statement. I \nask unanimous consent a vote in relation to the pending McCain \namendment, No. 2988, occur in the stacked sequence under the same terms \nas outlined in the previous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In light of this agreement, there will now be three \nrecorded votes at 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, as I pointed out, we were all shocked by the \ndeath of Kayla Rowland. That week, People magazine conducted a review \nof other deaths of children which are symptomatic of what is happening \nin America. They don't capture the headlines across the country as the \ntragic death of that 6-year-old did, but they suggest what is happening \nday in and day out--the 12 children in America killed each day.\n  I will recite some of the stories in which youngsters were killed by \nfirearms. A woman in Carroll County, MD, 18 years old, died of an \naccidental gunshot wound to the head after she and her friends were \nadmiring her father's .22-caliber revolver. Her parents were out of the \ncountry. They were doing missionary work in Costa Rica.\n  A simple safety lock on that weapon perhaps could have saved that \nyoung woman's life. This is one of those classic accidents the gun \nlobby doesn't want to talk about because it can be effective and should \nbe passed by our legislation which will put trigger locks on the \nweapons. It is not a question of irresponsible, reckless parents whose \nmoral or ethical values contribute to the death of a child. These \nparents are missionaries, literally doing the Lord's work, in Costa \nRica, when their child accidentally shoots herself.\n  A 6-year-old boy and a friend in Shopiere, WI, were horsing around \nwith a .22-caliber pistol his mother kept for protection and usually \nstored in her dresser. After posing with the gun for a photograph, the \nboy pointed the gun at his head. It went off, killing him. As his \ngrandmother said: It was kid's play, total kid's play.\n  Again, would a trigger lock have helped? Perhaps.\n  How about the 15-year-old boy in San Bernardino, CA, who found his \nstepfather's handgun while his pregnant mother slept, and he used it to \nshoot himself.\n  A 16-year-old girl in Altoona, PA, argued with her father, a gun \ncollector, about her curfew, and then took a .22-caliber handgun from \nunder his mattress while he was out and shot herself in the head.\n  All of these young lives were lost in just 1 week in America. We \ncould catalog such deaths every week in America.\n  The gun lobby says we don't need gun locks; we don't need gun laws; \nwe just have to do a better job enforcing those already on the books. \nHow is law enforcement going to save the lives of kids such as those I \nhave talked about? They are not hardened criminals. They are not in bad \nfamilies. They are not out robbing banks or terrorizing in gangs.\n  The only way they can be helped is through prevention--not \nenforcement but prevention. That is what will save these kids. \nPrevention is the key--not to the exclusion of enforcement; we have to \nenforce our laws and be tough.\n  Later today, Senator Durbin will introduce a resolution that will \namend it and ask us to put more resources into enforcement. I strongly \nsupport that. But we need prevention and enforcement. We require safety \ncaps on bottles of aspirin and bottles of prescription drugs. It makes \nno sense that we don't require the same types of safety devices on \nhandguns.\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\n  We have to do it. It is included in our juvenile justice bill. If we \nmaintain it in conference and bring it to the floor, we can save many \nchildren in this country.\n  Regarding gun shows--and I see my colleague from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg, who was the leader in this effort--with the help of Vice \nPresident Gore, by one vote we were able to pass sensible rules to \nclose the gun show loophole to require that background checks would \nalways be conducted for all the thousands of gun shows around the \ncountry.\n  Currently at most gun shows, one-fourth or more of the dealers are \nunlicensed. Therefore, they do not have to perform a Brady law \nbackground check. This is a serious loophole. If someone is a felon, if \nsomeone has a shady background, if someone is irrational and looking \nfor a gun, he or she would go to a gun show, go to a licensed dealer, \nand then the dealer would explain they have to do a gun check. Then \nwhat would happen? That person would certainly keep looking around \nuntil he found an unlicensed dealer who had a whole cache of guns and \nsay, Do I have to do a background check?\n  No, no, not at all.\n  We can see in that supermarket, that bazaar of guns, that is where, \nlikely, those people who do not want a check can go and today they will \nbe able to get a handgun.\n  It is just common sense to effectively enforce the Brady law, to make \nsure this gun show loophole is closed, and closed in a way that allows \nfor checking those people who should be checked, the ones for whom you \nmight have to find State records that are not available on a weekend; \nfor whom you might need indeed more than 72 hours to conduct a \nbackground check.\n  Another is the ban on juvenile possession of assault weapons. There \nis absolutely no reason a youngster should have an assault weapon. \nThese weapons were designed to kill people.\n  I served in the Army at the point where the transition was made \nbetween the old M-14 weapon, which was a rifle that had great accuracy, \nthat was part of what some people derided as the old musket Army of \naimed fire, and the tactics of the strategists back in the 1960s who \nsaid: We do not need aimed fire; we just need a weapon that, in close \nquarters, can deliver massive rates of fire, high rates of cyclical \nfire. The whole purpose being not hunting, not target shooting, but \ndestroying other people, which is the nature of warfare. That is where \nthe assault weapon comes. No child needs to have those.\n  A ban on the importation of large-capacity clips is another \nprovision. It is illegal for these clips to be produced by American \nmanufacturers, but through another loophole they can be imported into \nthe country. Once again, if you are a sportsman out hunting, you do not \nneed a magazine that can accommodate 45 rounds. People who need these \ntypes of magazines are folks who should not have them, in a sense, \nbecause the potential for violence, the potential for criminal activity \nis much more enhanced, I believe, when you have a magazine that has 40 \nor 50 rounds rather than those old-fashioned hunting rifles which are \npart and parcel of the American story.\n  In addition to these provisions, the underlying legislation would \nincrease the enforcement capacity of Federal agents and local agents by \nexpanding the successful youth crime gun interdiction initiative to 250 \ncities by the year 2003, enhancing the efforts to trace guns used in \ncrime and identify and arrest adults who sell guns to children. All of \nthese other worthy provisions are there; also, increased penalties on \nso-called straw purchases--those individuals who buy guns knowing the \nultimate recipient is unable to have the gun either because of a \ncriminal record or because of age. It would keep guns out of the hands \nof violent offenders. It would also allow the Federal Trade Commission \nand Attorney General to study the extent to which the gun industry \nmarkets and distributes its products to juveniles.\n\n  They are all reasonable measures. All should be done. But what has \nbeen done? Because of the inaction, and deliberate inaction, of the \nleadership, nothing has been done. The American people have waited too \nlong. Later today, I will be offering, along with 22 of my colleagues, \na sense-of-the-Senate resolution calling on the juvenile justice \nconferees to complete and submit the conference report before April 20, \nthe first anniversary of the Columbine shooting, and to include in the \nconference report the amendments I have just discussed, that were \npassed by this Senate, seeking to limit access to firearms by \njuveniles, convicted felons, and other persons prohibited by law from \npurchasing or possessing firearms.\n  Will the passage of this amendment stop every gun crime in this \ncountry? No, but it will save lives, the lives of those children I \ntalked about, the lives of children shot accidentally, the lives, \nperhaps, of people who, if they do not have easy access to firearms, \nmay think a moment before taking their lives.\n  If we do these things: Close the gun show loophole, require safety \nlocks to be sold with handguns, if we ban the importation of large-\ncapacity clips and juvenile possession of assault weapons, we will \nbring some sense to our gun laws and we will provide a meaningful \nmemorial to those children who died at Columbine and those children who \ndie each day by gun violence.\n  I notice my colleagues from New Mexico and from Vermont are here. I \nsuspect they would like to speak also. As a result, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee, off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island, and \nI thank the other Senator from Rhode Island, and I thank the Senator \nfrom Nevada and the Senator from New Jersey. I am proud to cosponsor \nthe amendment to report the juvenile justice conference by April 20. I \nthink the distinguished senior Senator from Rhode Island does the whole \nSenate and the country a service by his amendment.\n  Congress has kept the country waiting too long for action on juvenile \njustice legislation. It kept the country waiting too long for action on \nsensible gun laws. In fact, we are almost up to the first-year \nanniversary of the shooting in Columbine High School in Littleton, CO.\n  This morning I was watching the news, seeing some of these young \npeople talking about what they went through, and the memories all came \nback about what had happened there when 14 students and a teacher lost \ntheir lives, nearly 12 months ago, on April 20, 1999.\n  I mention that date, April 20, 1999, because it has been 11 months \nsince then that the Senate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice \nbill. This bill was not a close call. The vote was 73-25. It was a \nbipartisan bill. It included some very modest but, I believe, effective \ngun safety measures. Ten months ago, the House passed its own juvenile \ncrime bill.\n  Then we did not meet or have a conference; we did not meet to talk \nabout it until about 8 months ago. Then we met only briefly. We did \nnothing and recessed for a 4- or 5-week vacation.\n  Now it is very easy to see what has happened. By delaying and \ndelaying and delaying, some might have the best of all possible worlds. \nThey could say: Yes, I stood up and voted for some modest gun safety \nlaws; and at the same time they could say to the powerful gun lobby: \nDon't worry, it is not going anywhere. We have that bottled up \nsomewhere in a committee, a committee of conference that never meets. \nNobody even knows where it is. I doubt if there are 10 people in the \nHouse or the Senate who could even name the members of it.\n  The majority in Congress convened this conference on August 5, 1999, \nless than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for its long August \nrecess.\n  You do not have to be a cynic to recognize this for what it was: a \ntransparent ploy to deflect criticism for delays while ensuring the \nconference did not have enough time to prepare comprehensive juvenile \njustice legislation to send to the President before school began in \nSeptember, 1999.\n  This is a serious matter. The Senate Democrats and the House \nDemocrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile justice \nconference and work with Republicans to have an\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\neffective juvenile justice conference report, one that has reasonable \ngun safety provisions, something along the lines of what we passed 3-1 \nhere in the Senate. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership would not \nact.\n  I know they are facing fierce opposition from the gun lobby. One only \nhas to turn on the television set to see an aging actor telling us why \nwe should not be protecting our young children. I wish instead of \nlistening to somebody who is acting a role and playing a role and has \nmade their livelihood acting out other people's fantasies, they would \nlisten to the Nation's law enforcement officers. These are the men and \nwomen whom we ask every single day to put their lives on the line for \nus. These are the people who die protecting us. These are the people \nmost concerned about effective gun laws.\n  Ten national law enforcement organizations, representing thousands of \nlaw enforcement officers, have endorsed the Senate-passed gun safety \namendments, and they support loophole-free firearms laws, from the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, Major Cities Chiefs, National Sheriffs \nAssociation, and on and on.\n  I spent 8 years in law enforcement. I know how much they care. They \nbelieve in keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have \nthem. I am not talking about people who use guns for sports and \nhunting. I am talking about criminals and unsupervised children.\n  These thousands of law enforcement officers are asking us to do our \nduty. Instead of taking all these recesses and vacations, we should \nstay here a couple of days and pass juvenile justice legislation.\n  Every parent, every teacher, every student in this country is \nconcerned about school violence. We know there is not any one thing \nthat will stop school violence, but we do know that in the Hatch-Leahy \njuvenile justice bill there are provisions that help bring about safety \nin our schools. Don't we owe it to the parents, don't we owe it to the \nstudents, don't we owe it to the teachers to make this a safer country? \nWe do not owe or should not owe anything to any powerful lobby, left or \nright. We owe our privilege of serving here to the people who sent us \nhere, and the vast majority of people who sent us here, Republicans and \nDemocrats, want us to move forward on this sensible piece of \nlegislation.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as a matter of formality, I will yield time \noff the resolution to the manager of this bill. I do it for a specific \nreason. There has been a lot of attention focused in recent months on \ngun violence in America. The Senator from New Jersey, who has decided \nto retire from the Senate, has been the leader on this issue for many \nyears. For example, 33,000 people have been prevented from having guns \nas a result of the initial work done by the Senator from New Jersey. \nThose are people who commit acts of domestic violence and are convicted \nof crimes dealing with domestic violence. Those people can no longer \nhave permits to carry weapons. They can no longer have handguns.\n  One of the few pioneers in the Senate on the Brady bill was the \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Lautenberg. He was the person who \ninitially started the work in the Senate and in the Congress on the \nBrady bill. What does that mean? It means that over 400,000 felons who \nhave attempted to purchase weapons have been prevented from buying \nthose guns.\n  In addition to that, of course, he sponsored a law eliminating \nfunding of an ATF program that allowed convicted felons with weapons \nviolations to apply for and waive probation. In short, it is very good \nthat we have so much attention focused on guns and gun violence and \nlegislation dealing with guns.\n  Before yielding time to the Senator from New Jersey, I want the \nrecord to reflect that we are dealing with gun legislation more easily \ntoday than we were when this man had the vision to act on some of these \nlaws. Jim Brady depended on Frank Lautenberg to pass the Brady bill.\n  I commend and applaud the Senator from New Jersey for the work he has \ndone, and I yield to him such time as he may consume, off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nhis courtesy and kind remarks.\n  We have done a lot of work. I commend Senator Reed from Rhode Island \nfor his leadership. He had a career in the military before he came to \nthe Congress. He used that background to understand the problem and to \nput it into perspective. I commend him for his leadership on gun \nviolence issues.\n  I was pleased to hear from our friend from Vermont, the ranking \nmember on the Judiciary Committee. Vermont is known to have a lot of \nhunters. Vermont is known as a place where there are a lot of guns. As \nI heard Senator Leahy say, a lot of these hunters were disappointed at \nthe unwillingness of the gun lobby, personified by the National Rifle \nAssociation, in their organization's unwillingness to step forward and \nmake some commonsense adjustments to the law, getting legislation on \nthe books that says guns should not be available willy-nilly to people \nwho want to buy a lethal weapon.\n  I hope we will soon deal with an amendment that will codify our \ninterest in controlling gun violence. We are soon coming upon a very \nimportant anniversary. April 20 is the 1-year anniversary of the awful \ntragedy at Columbine High School. Few can forget that awful day, the \nshock we all felt when we heard about young people in the high school \nbeing assaulted by gunmen and looking at the pictures on television and \nseeing a young man reaching out for help, fearful for his life, and \nyoung people running frantically from the school to get out of the way \nof the bullets. The consequences were disastrous: 12 classmates were \nkilled, the 2 killers, and a teacher. Twenty-three other students and \nteachers wounded. I shutter when I recall that bloody carnage.\n  No parent or grandparent can avoid thanking the Lord for the safety \nof their own families when they see the horror of those moments. Yet \nthat assault was not only an assault on Columbine High School, it was \nan assault on the sensibilities of our country--the innocent young \npeople scared, desperate, running away from gunmen.\n  Frankly, I thought that would be the ultimate outrage; that would be \nthe ultimate insult to the lawfulness of our society, to our respect \nfor law, to our respect for life; that this would be it and people \nwould stand up and say: Enough; we have had enough; we want to make a \nchange. The cries of people, the tearful students who lost friends and \nthose who lost relatives, sons and daughters, sent an image across this \ncountry which I thought would shake through the halls of this Congress \nwhich says: Hey, listen, it's time.\n  Poll after poll was done at that time. The numbers were that 80 to 90 \npercent of the people said they wanted the gun show loophole closed. \nThere are over 4,000 gun shows a year where anyone--any thief, any \nfelon, anyone who is listed on the 10 most wanted list of the FBI--can \nwalk up, take the money out of their pocket, put it down on the table, \nand nobody asks: What is your name? Where do you live? From what town \ndo you come?\n  That is not what the American people want. I do not understand the \nNRA and other members of the gun lobby who say this is somehow an \nintrusion on their personal rights. Where are the personal rights of \nthe family to know that when their children go to school each and every \nday, they will return home in the same healthy condition as when they \nwent to school?\n\n  Everyone here has to be aware that on May 14 we are going to have the \nMillion Mom March. I met with people from New Jersey who are \nparticipating. I will tell you something. If you talk to women's \ngroups, talk to individual women across this country about what really \ncounts with them, what is the most important thing on their agenda: Is \nit equal opportunity for jobs? Is it to make sure that pay scales are \nthe same for men and women? What is it that is the most important \nthing? I will tell you what the most important thing is: To know their \nchildren are safe when they go to school. The Million Mom March is \norganized around that precept that children should be safe, that this \nsociety of ours has had enough of guns and the havoc it wreaks in our \nNation.\n  That tragic day, almost a year ago, was enough to offend women across \nthe\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\ncountry to organize a million person march in State after State where \nit will be taking place.\n  But what has the Congress done to answer the anguished cries of \npeople who have lost a child? Anybody who knows a family who has lost a \nchild, particularly to violence--I guess it does not matter how you \nlose a child; once you lose a child, it is a terrible thing. The family \nnever recovers. The circumstances never change. Columbine High School \nwill never be the same, even though they had yet another crazy incident \nthere.\n  What happens to those cries? What happens to those pleas? They fall \non deaf ears. That is what happens. Not enough people listen, to say: \nYou know what. Yes, we understand there is some debate about the \npossession of a weapon. But there is nothing in the Constitution--no \nmatter how hard the proponents of guns try--that says you cannot wait a \nfew days while we check to see who you are before we give you a gun. \nBefore we give you an automobile, we check out who you are.\n  What is it that prevents us from saying, look, come on; get together, \ngun lovers, NRA and the others? What is it that says we have to permit \ngun purchases by anonymous buyers? There isn't anything in the \nConstitution that says that. There isn't anything in the Constitution \nthat says you should not have to have a license, that you should not \nhave to be trained before you buy a gun.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island, who is going to propose this \namendment, as I indicated, was in the Army as an officer. He is a West \nPoint graduate. He served in Vietnam. He knows what it is to be in war. \nHe served during the period of the Vietnam conflict. I served in Europe \nduring World War II when the shooting was going on. I know what the \npurpose of a gun is. I learned how to use it. I have never owned one \nsince I got my discharge, I can tell you.\n  But what is it that prevents us from taking up the simplest, \ncommonsense legislation? It is the gun lobby. The response to the cries \nof the people who want their kids to be able to go to school safely and \nreturn is: No, we have a greater allegiance to the NRA and the gun \nlobby than we have to families across America. What an outrage. But it \ndoes not get anything done.\n  I am hoping, with Senator Reed's leadership, we are going to get \nsomething done today.\n  Congress has done nothing since that time to protect families from \ngun violence. When I wrote the law to prohibit domestic abusers from \ngetting guns, it was said that it was an unnecessary thing, it was an \nimposition of law on our citizens. But 33,000--I thank the Senator from \nNevada for mentioning it--33,000 domestic abusers have been prevented \nfrom owning a gun. We know something else.\n  We know the statistics show that about 150,000 times a year a gun is \nput to the head of a woman, often in front of her children, and a man \nthreatens to blow her brains out. There is no visible wound, but I \nguarantee you, there are wounds that carry through life. The children \nnever forget. But we cannot act on it.\n  We are now waiting for something to happen. We are waiting for the \njuvenile justice bill, which passed overwhelmingly and went to the \nHouse, with our gun-loophole-show closer, and it died. The conference \ncommittee has been appointed, but nothing has happened since that time.\n  We have had support in the past from Senators on the other side of \nthe aisle on the gun show amendment. Senators DeWine, Fitzgerald, \nLugar, Voinovich, Warner, and Senator Chafee--who is no longer with \nus--voted for my amendment at that time.\n  The final juvenile justice bill, as we heard from Senator Leahy, \npassed by a vote of 73-25. So there was strong bipartisan support for \nmoving forward on juvenile crime and trying to reduce gun violence.\n  But that was back on May 20--11 months ago. What has happened since \nthen? Shootings have not stopped. We saw a 6-year-old murder another 6-\nyear-old in Michigan.\n  From Mount Morris, MI, to Los Angeles, CA; from Fort Worth, TX, as \nyoungsters in a prayer session were violated by a gun-wielding \nassaulter, to Conyers, GA; no community is safe from gun violence.\n  But while the vast majority of Americans want Congress to act, some \nspecial interests--the National Rifle Association, the gun lobby--have \nworked with their few allies in Congress, where less than 3 million \nmembers of the NRA determine what actions we take on behalf of 260 \nmillion Americans.\n  It is not right. Sooner or later, the voters are going to rebel and \nsay: If you do not vote to put common sense into gun possession in this \ncountry, we are going to vote you out of office. That is what ought to \nhappen. Boy, if one time that happens in an area where this is the \ndominant subject, that would be the end of the gun lobby.\n  It is the same old reaction. Every time Congress wants to pass gun \nsafety laws, the NRA works hard to prevent its passage. Lately, we \nheard a lot of criticism about the enforcement of gun laws. But this is \nkind of a joke because the rhetoric ignores the facts. The number of \nFederal firearms cases prosecuted by the U.S. attorneys increased 16 \npercent from 1992 to 1999--4,754 in 1992 to 5,500 in 1999.\n  So the suggestion that law enforcement is not fighting gun crimes is \njust wrong. But more importantly, this rhetoric suggests a false choice \nbetween enforcement or stronger laws. What we need is both.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, but not without making mention of \nthe fact that Smith & Wesson, a prominent gun manufacturer, has agreed \nthat they need to do more on gun safety. The company reached an \nagreement with the administration that will incorporate many of the \nmeasures stalled in the conference committee: Background checks at gun \nshows, child safety locks, and preventing the use of ammunition clips \nwith more than 10 rounds.\n\n  Congress ought not be trailing behind gun manufacturers when it comes \nto gun safety. The conference committee ought to complete its job. I \nsupport Senator Reed's resolution. When it is presented, I hope that \nall of my colleagues will vote for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2985\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes available, evenly divided, \non the Reid amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Reid yields to Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment and urge the Senate \nto go on record opposing the George W. Bush tax cut. It is a risky \nproposal. It threatens our economy. It raids the Social Security trust \nfund. It provides no funding protection for Social Security or \nMedicare. It eliminates needed investments in education. Sadly, the tax \ncuts go primarily to the wealthiest people in America. The Bush tax cut \nis a $50,000 tax cut if you make over $300,000 a year. For 60 percent \nof American families, it is a tax cut of $249.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues who say they have endorsed George W. \nBush and his plan have a chance to follow the admonition of that noted \npolitical philosopher, Tammy Wynette, who said: ``Stand by your man.'' \nBut for those who want this economy to continue to prosper, and America \nto continue to be strong, vote ``no'' on the George W. Bush tax cut.\n  (Mr. VOINOVICH assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, even though Senators Reid and Durbin \nhave been talking about it for a couple of hours, and Senator Gramm and \nI spoke on it for about a half hour, essentially, the tax plan George \nW. Bush has is not part of the President's proposal, but it will be \npart of President-elect George W. Bush's budget. So we wait for him to \ndeliver his budget, which will indeed accommodate his tax cut. All this \nis a political scuffle here today in advance of his budget. He hasn't \neven had a chance to give us one and tell us what kind of Government he \nwants.\n  They want us to adopt this while we are fighting over a Clinton \nbudget that increases spending beyond anything President George W. Bush \nwould do. I commend soon-to-be-President-elect Bush for suggesting a \nmajor tax reform. When the American people actually see it, they are \ngoing to think it is good for America. It will fit in his budget. That \nis an important time.\n  I move to table the Reid amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the motion to table amendment No. 2985.

There are 2 minutes of debate. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to close the debate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to make my statement.\n  Senator Gramm came to the floor and waved Vice President Gore's book, \nsaying it calls for a $3 tax increase but could not point out the page. \nIt is not in there, nor is there a statement made by the Vice President \nto that effect.\n  Because of the political pain my Republican colleagues have \nexperienced in just voting against the tax program which Governor \nGeorge W. Bush proposed, they are asking Members to vote against a tax \nprogram which Vice President Gore has never proposed.\n  This is easy. Vote yes; save a copy of the last roll call.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in his book ``Earth in the Balance,'' the \nVice President calls for the complete elimination of the internal \ncombustion engine.\n  I have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that says we should not \nundertake that activity, that raising the price of gasoline to the \ndegree that would be required to achieve that goal would be devastating \nto the American economy.\n  I believe the Vice President saying we should have a policy to \ncompletely eliminate the internal combustion engine in 25 years is \nirresponsible policy. It ought to be rejected. The only way to achieve \nit would be astronomical taxes, rationing, and confiscating people's \ncars or trucks. I want the world to know and the Vice President to know \nwe are against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2973. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Who yields time on the McCain amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will take the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not think anybody objects to this \namendment. This is an effort to say to the Department of Defense we \nwant them to fix the problem of food stamps in the military. It adds a \nsmall amount of money over the years to target the solving of the food \nstamp problem in the military.\n  That is essentially the McCain amendment. We should adopt it. He \nwants a rollcall vote. I believe the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am not sure who controls time in \nopposition. I do not oppose it, but I would like 30 seconds. I ask \nunanimous consent that I have 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am going to vote for the amendment--I \nbelieve most Members will--but we want to make sure we do not create an \ninequity, an unfairness in the process. We will be paying different \namounts of money to the same people, same rank, and we may actually be \ngiving the extra money to the wrong people.\n  Senator McCain's amendment, it seems to me, has exactly the right \npurpose: to get rid of food stamps going to some members. But we have \nto do it right. Senator Warner is going to be holding hearings in our \ncommittee on this whole food stamp situation. We, hopefully, can \naccomplish this goal in a way which does not create a discriminatory \nsituation.\n  I have one last fact. We all should be glad to know the number of our \nservice members on food stamps has gone down, from 19,400 in 1991 to \n11,900 in 1995, to 6,300 in 1999. The number of people on food stamps \nhas been going down dramatically, not only numerically but also as a \npercentage of the force.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It doesn't call for the passage of any specific school \nconstruction or renovation proposal that has been discussed. It simply \nsets aside the money to pay for them. Five years ago, the unmet needs \nin our schools nationally totaled about $185 billion. Today, those \nunmet needs total over $306 billion.\n  We hear a lot about State surpluses. If we used all of the fiscal \nyear 1999 surpluses from all of the States, we would still only address \nabout 10 percent of the unmet backlog in terms of school construction \nand school modernization.\n  I showed this picture last night. I will show this one again. This is \na picture of Loudon County High School, just outside the beltway. This \nis a trailer being put in place in the parking lot. There are a number \nof trailers in the parking lot. There are over 3,000 trailers currently \nin use in Virginia alone. Loudon County needs 22 new schools at an \naverage cost of $18 million each. That is over $400 million for one \ncounty alone.\n  School enrollment is at record levels. Currently, there are 53.2 \nmillion students in the United States. In the next 10 years, it will \nincrease by another 1 million students. The average school today is 42 \nyears old. The last major investment in schools was made back in the \nEisenhower administration. It was a $1 billion investment then. The \nsame amount of money today, in current terms, would be $5.4 billion. \nThis amendment simply sets aside $5.9 billion over the next 5 years to \naccomplish at least a portion of the pressing unmet school construction \nneeds in this country today. I hope it will be the wisdom of my \ncolleagues to agree to this particular amendment and vote for schools.\n\n  I think I adequately covered the amendment last night. I yield to my \ndistinguished colleague from Georgia or others who may wish to address \nthis particular amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia has been \ndebating this for an extended period of time. School construction and \nrenovation is traditionally the responsibility of local and State \ngovernments. It traditionally has been and it still is.\n  The Robb amendment, in effect, has the effect of raising taxes by \n$4.2 billion over 5 years to have the Federal Government take over part \nof this responsibility. Even under the President's proposal, which \nwould cost even more, we would only be able to cover about one-fourth \nof the total cost of improving schools, according to the General \nAccounting Office.\n  As we have said repeatedly over the last couple of days, this budget \nresolution includes more money for education than the President--$600 \nmillion more in 2001 and $2.2 billion more over 5 years. We have made \nplenty of room for different options on education policy in this budget \nresolution.\n  All of these issues will be discussed and debated in the ESEA \nreauthorization coming up in May. The spending increase in this \namendment is unnecessary.\n  In addition, if the Federal Government is going to become a major and \ndirect party in the issue of school construction, along with it will \ncome the same kind of intervention that the last two Congresses have \nbeen endeavoring to undo. They have been trying to make it more \nflexible, not less.\n  It is my personal opinion, given the way school construction has been \nmanaged, that any Federal program of this nature will by necessity have \nthe tendency to pick winners and losers because as everybody \nacknowledges, it doesn't get to the total requirement and it will also \nhave the effect of rewarding local jurisdictions that have been less \nattentive to the work that they are responsible for or for which they \nare responsible.\n  Invariably, districts that have gotten the job done or are in the \nbusiness of doing it will be second-class citizens to those \njurisdictions that have overlooked or not been attentive to the nature \nof their responsibility of school construction.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 1 minute 40 \nseconds and the Senator from Virginia has 2 minutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield the floor to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I respond to my distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia by saying, first of all, this is not an amendment to raise \ntaxes. This is simply an amendment to give up $5.9 billion of the tax \ncut that is in the resolution.\n  Second, there are no Federal strings attached. One of the benefits of \nthis particular approach is we are not dealing with school policy, \nwhich can be very sensitive. We are dealing with bricks and mortar. For \nthe most part, we are doing this through a tax credit that leverages \nthe money so they can get a whole lot more bang for the buck. It is a \nway to keep us from being involved in local school policy. It provides \nmaximum flexibility in the way the funds are used.\n  Finally, with all due respect to my distinguished colleague, he \ntalked about less attentive. You can translate ``less attentive'' into \n``less resourced.'' Most of the Federal programs designed to help are \nfor those localities and institutions that simply don't have the \nresources to meet the critical needs of their students. This is \ndesigned to help some of those localities, including localities with \nvery old schools that have leaking roofs and simply don't have modern \nheating, air conditioning, ventilation, and other accommodations that \nare part of the modern school system or could not have the modern \ntechnology.\n  This gives them a chance to compete on a more equal footing. I hope \nit will\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\nbe the pleasure of our colleagues to set aside this part of the tax cut \nfor the very important purpose of investing ultimately in our children, \nby investing in a nonintervention, nonintrusive way in school policy, \nin the bricks and mortar that will provide the kind of environment \nwhere they can learn.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the bottom line, whether you call it a \ntax increase or reduction of a tax relief proposal, the net effect is \nbetween $4 billion and $6 billion is not going to be in the checking \naccounts of American citizens if this amendment is adopted that could \ntheoretically otherwise be there. Taxpayers will have less if the \namendment is adopted.\n  The second point the Senator from Virginia makes about underresourced \nhas merit. But so does mine. Yes, there are some school districts that \nare underresourced; those are the responsibility of those States, not \nthe Federal Government.\n  It is equally true that many of these jurisdictions do have the \nresources and for whatever reason have not made that the priority it \nmaybe ought to have been. There is no doubt about it. We can name any \nnumber of jurisdictions that have underequipped schools that sit in \nmunicipalities or counties that have innumerable resources.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I take a moment to commend my \ncolleagues--Senator Robb, Senator Harkin, Senator Lautenberg, and \nSenator Dorgan, for bringing this important amendment to the floor.\n  I commend the work they have done and their commitment to school \nmodernization which means so much to our communities and the children \nwho attend the public schools in this country.\n  I have heard the other side say throughout this debate they have made \na commitment to education. But I am concerned, as I look at their \nbudget, that a real commitment is missing. I believe that part of \nmaking a real commitment to education requires providing resources to \nour schools. Today, my colleagues are offering an amendment as a way to \noffer this choice.\n  Today, a record 53.2 million children are enrolled in elementary and \nsecondary schools. By 2009, this number will reach 54.2 million. As a \nresult, local communities need to build or modernize 6,000 public \nschools, and repair an additional 8,300 public schools. In addition, \nthe average public school building in this country is 42 years old. \nThese schools need improvements.\n  What kind of message do we send to our children when they can go to \nshopping malls, movies theaters, and baseball stadiums that are \nsignificantly nicer than their schools? What kind of message does that \nsend about our priorities?\n  This amendment would once again provide us with a clear choice on the \nissue of education. Do we want a tax cut, or do we want to provide to \nmodernize our schools. This amendment would allow the federal \ngovernment to take a roll as a partner in helping our districts meet \nthe pressing need of modernizing our school buildings.\n  The amendment would provide $1.3 billion in grants and loans to help \nschools address urgent facilities issues, and provide tax credit bonds \nto help communities finance the cost of new construction and major \nrepairs for schools.\n  This Congress has made a commitment over the past two years to \nreducing class size. This program is truly making a difference in our \nschools. I believe we have the opportunity this year to continue the \nefforts to reducing class size, and providing funds for school to make \nsure they have the facilities to provide for these smaller classes.\n  A decent sized class in an adequate facility is not too much for our \nchildren. I hope you are all able to make this choice and support this \namendment.\n  Mr. ROBB. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine seconds.\n  Mr. ROBB. I yield the entire 9 seconds to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wholeheartedly support the amendment of \nthe Senator from Virginia. It is what is needed for this country. It is \na national obligation. We ought to be rebuilding and modernizing our \nschools. The Senator from Virginia has it right.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3010 to Amendment No. 2965\n\n(Purpose: To reduce revenue cuts by $5.9 billion over the next 5 years)\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I send the substitute to the Robb amendment No. 2965 \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3010 to amendment 2965.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 9, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 11, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 18, line 7, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 18, line 8, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 18, line 11, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 18, line 12, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 18, line 15, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 18, line 16, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 18, line 19, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 18, line 20, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 18, line 23, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 18, line 24, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 29, line 3, decrease the amount by $1.\n       On page 29, line 4, decrease the amount by $1.\n       On page 29, after line 5, insert the following:\n       In lieu of the language proposed to be inserted, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec.   . (a) The Senate finds that on March 2, 2000, the \n     Senate passed S. 1134, by a vote of 61-37, the Affordable \n     Education Act of 2000, which--\n       (1) authorizes up to 2.5 billion dollars a year in new bond \n     authority to allow public-private partnerships to build new \n     schools;\n       (2) allows small school districts to build more schools by \n     providing them greater flexibility in dealing with complex \n     IRS regulations;\n       (3) allows 14,000,000 families or 20,000,000 children to \n     benefit from Education Savings Accounts, which would generate \n     $12,000,000,000 in new resources for kindergarten through \n     college education;\n       (4) allows 1,000,000 college students in State pre-paid \n     tuition plans to receive tax relief to make college more \n     affordable;\n       (5) allows 1,000,000 workers studying part-time to receive \n     education assistance through their employers;\n       (6) guarantees that every college student and recent \n     college graduate in America will receive a tax break on the \n     interest on their student loans;\n       (7) gives all of our Nation's elementary and secondary \n     school teachers needed tax relief for their professional \n     development expenses;\n       (8) gives America's teachers needed tax relief by providing \n     them a deduction for their out-of-pocket classroom expenses;\n       (9) allows America's classrooms to benefit from new \n     technology by encouraging the charitable donation of \n     computers to the classroom;\n       (b) Therefore, it is the Sense of the Senate that this \n     budget resolution assumes that\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\n     Congress should pass, and the President should sign \n     significant education tax relief legislation for America's \n     teachers and students.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Parliamentary inquiry: It is my understanding that \nwith the second-degree amendment before the Senate, there is now an \nhour equally divided on this measure; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On the second-degree amendment, that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, the bipartisan education savings \naccount which was passed in March and had been threatened by a veto \nfrom the President makes education more affordable for millions of \nAmericans. I might say, during that debate of our proposal to empower \nparents, to empower local school districts and communities, there was a \nsimilar debate with the Senator from Virginia on a similar subject. We \nprevailed at that time.\n  At that time, the Senator from Virginia basically was attempting to \nfund this idea of his by removing the loss of tax revenue that occurs \nin the education savings account. As I understand the amendment now, it \nwould reduce the tax relief in the budget resolution. So it is a very \nsimilar debate that is occurring between the Senator from Virginia and \nour side.\n  I want to refresh the Senate on what has passed the Senate and will \nsoon find its way to the President's desk. As I said a little earlier, \nthe President has at least given an indication that he would veto it, \nso I think it is entirely appropriate that we reassert our position in \nthe budget resolution.\n  The education savings account starts with the current law, which \nallows families to save up to $500 per year while the interest in an \naccount is exempt from taxes as long as the savings are used for \ncollege education. We have taken the same proposal and expanded it to \n$2,000 per year instead of $500, and we have said a family can use the \nsavings in that account anywhere in the education of the child, from \nkindergarten through college--even after college if the student is a \ndependent.\n  We have taken what everybody on both sides of the aisle has said is a \ngrand idea and expanded it. Everybody is a winner: Public education, \nprivate education, home schooling education, kindergarten through \ncollege. It remains puzzling to me that this bipartisan proposal, \nsupported by Members on both sides of the aisle, is now threatened by \nthe President.\n\n  On State prepaid tuition relief, the legislation makes interest \nearned on qualified public and private school higher education tuition \nplans tax free. Some 41 States today--I think soon it will be all--\noffer a State prepaid tuition plan to help parents prepare their \nstudents for the cost of college. The problem is, when those benefits \ncome to the student, they get taxed, so it is diminished significantly. \nUnder this proposal, that tax would no longer hit the savings account. \nIt would be there and available for the family to help that child \nthrough college.\n  The proposal extends employer-provided educational assistance for \nundergraduate studies; in other words, it helps make it possible for \nemployers to assist employees in their continuing education. It is \nestimated that some million employees will be the beneficiaries of this \nproposal that has now passed the Senate.\n  I failed to mention that it is estimated those who would open \neducation savings accounts, such as those we are enumerating here, are \n14 million families who are the custodians, those who are taking care \nof 20 million children. That is about 40 percent of the entire \npopulation in school in the United States.\n  The proposal repeals the 60-month rule on student loan interest \ndeductions and allows many individuals to claim tax deductions on \ninterest they pay on their student loans without the imposition of a \ntime limit. Currently, you have an exemption on that kind of benefit, \nbut it runs out after a certain number of years. This removes the time \nlimit.\n  With regard to school construction, the Affordable Education Act \ncontains a provision originally offered by Senator Graham of Florida to \ncreate a new category of exempt bonds for privately owned, publicly \noperated K-12 schools. So we do not obviate or ignore the issue of \nconstruction problems in the country. This provision would make \navailable up to $2.5 billion each year in school construction bonds, \nenough to build hundreds of new schools in America every year. But it \nwould be totally controlled locally. It would not be the Federal \nGovernment picking which schools, it would be the districts themselves \ndeciding whether they wanted to use this new provision in order to deal \nwith school construction needs in their district.\n  The bill would allow school districts to issue more tax-exempt bonds \nfor school construction without having to comply with complex IRS \narbitrage rebate rules. This would lower the cost of school \nconstruction for many small and rural school districts.\n  The billions of dollars in Federal assistance are on top of what \nState and local governments are already doing to build schools without, \nas I said a moment ago, Federal interference from Washington or any \nselection being made by Federal bureaucrats. According to the U.S. \nCensus Bureau, State and local governments spent $13 billion in 1999 on \npublic school and university facilities. An American school and \nuniversity survey shows, between 1990 and 1999, public school \nconstruction expenditures increased by 60 percent--that is without the \nFederal Government; they have done that on their own, making their own \ndecisions--while overall economic activity only increased by 32 \npercent, and student population increased by only 10 percent.\n\n  So, in summary, what this sense of the Senate does is ask the \nPresident to recognize how many winners are generated by the Senate's \nidea on the Affordable School Act: 14 million families will benefit, 20 \nmillion schoolchildren; there will be $12 billion in new savings \nwithout the Federal Government investing a dime; 1 million college \nstudents in State prepaid tuition plans; 1 million workers receiving \neducation assistance; countless schools will be built across the \ncountry; and countless Americans will receive a break on the interest \nthey pay on their student loans.\n  Reserving the remainder of my time, I yield the floor so we might \nhear from the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Coverdell \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Under the resolution, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia. I did not see the movie ``Groundhog Day,'' but this reminds me \nof ``Groundhog Day.'' We have been here before. We wasted an entire \nweek of the Senate's valuable time on the precise bill that the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia is now presenting to us as an \nalternative.\n  I listened as the clerk read the language of the initial part of the \nbill, taking all the amounts that would be put aside to help schools \nand reducing them to a single dollar. In Virginia, we call that the \nshad treatment: You leave the skeleton but you surgically remove the \nentire skeletal structure so there is nothing remaining. Then you \nsubstitute a piece of legislation that has already passed this body, \nnotwithstanding the fact that the authors and proponents of the \nlegislation knew from the very beginning this particular bill would not \nbe signed by the President.\n  With all due respect to my distinguished colleague from Georgia, he \nknew and they knew from the beginning we were wasting a week on that \nparticular legislation. To suggest this is a possible new development \nor a surprise now, with all due respect, is a bit disingenuous.\n  We have the same problem as before. We are trying to do an end run to \nbring about vouchers. With this legislation, this Senate would be \nfinding a way to put a disproportionate amount of money--if I recall \nthe figures; I do not have them in front of me--about $37 or so per \nfamily for those students who, for the most part, are already sending\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\ntheir children to private schools or parochial schools and about, if I \nrecall, $7 for those in public schools.\n  This is designed to get around the difficulty the distinguished \nSenator found in incorporating a voucher provision. Vouchers address 10 \npercent of the population. Our responsibility is to the 90 percent of \nthe children who are in schools in America who do not have access to \nthem. Even if we were to make vouchers available to every schoolchild \nin America, we only have infrastructure that can support a little over \n10 percent of the population. This takes money that would otherwise be \navailable, in this case, for much needed school construction which the \nStates cannot afford and which, by his own admission, would help \ndisproportionately those school districts that do not have the \nresources, that do not get a chance to play on a level playing field.\n  It would take the money we could use to leverage to build even more \nschools and renovate even more schools to run the voucher route, again, \nin a bill that will not even go to the President. This particular \nresolution does not go to the President for signature. It will have no \nimpact on whatever the President chooses to do about the particular \nlegislation the Senator and those who supported his position passed \nlast time around.\n  Let's not support vouchers in another form to find a way to make it \nimpossible for the Federal Government, without strings attached, to \nprovide support for bricks and mortar in local school districts and \ndivisions that need the assistance. We want to move away from a \nsituation where we have trailers instead of classrooms. If colleagues \nsupport the underlying amendment, they will be supporting school \nconstruction and renovation. If they support the substitute, they will \nbe supporting school vouchers. I hope it will be the pleasure of this \nbody to reject the substitute and support the underlying amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin, off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank our minority whip for yielding me \nthis time. I do speak strongly in favor of the underlying Robb \namendment of which I am a cosponsor.\n  Senator Robb has it right when he tries to invest in rebuilding and \nmodernizing our public schools. States and local communities are \nstruggling right now to renovate existing schools. School construction \nand modernization is necessary for our kids in the 21st century.\n  The average school in America right now, as Senator Robb said, is 42 \nyears old. Technology is placing new demands on our schools. As a \nresult of increased use of technology, many schools must install new \nwiring, telephone lines, and electrical assistance. The demand for the \nInternet is at an all-time high, but in the Nation's poorest schools \nonly 39 percent of classrooms have Internet access.\n  In 1998, the American Society of Civil Engineers issued a report on \nour Nation's infrastructure. The report found many problems with a lot \nof our infrastructure, but the most startling finding was with respect \nto our Nation's public schools.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers reported that public schools \nare in worst condition than any other sector of our national \ninfrastructure. This is an alarming fact. I ask unanimous consent that \na copy of the American Society of Civil Engineers report card be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS--1998 REPORT CARD FOR AMERICA'S\n                             INFRASTRUCTURE\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Subject                  Grade              Comments\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoads.........................

Total Investment Needs = $1.3\n  Trillion (estimated five-year need). Each category was evaluated on\n  the basis of condition and performance, capacity vs. need, and funding\n  vs. need.\nA = Exceptional; B = Good; C = Mediocre; D = Poor; F = Inadequate.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, because of increasing enrollments and \naging buildings, local and State expenditures for school construction \nhave increased dramatically by 39 percent in the last several years. \nHowever, this increase has not been enough to address the needs.\n  The National Education Association recently surveyed States about \ntheir need to modernize public schools and upgrade education \ntechnologies. According to their preliminary report, $254 billion is \nneeded to modernize school facilities; $54 billion is needed to upgrade \neducation technology. In my State of Iowa, for example, $3.4 billion is \nneeded for school facilities and $540 million for education technology.\n  It is a national disgrace that the nicest places our children see are \nshopping malls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and some of the most \nrundown places they see are their public schools. What kind of a signal \ndoes that send about the value we place on them, their education, and \ntheir future? How can we prepare our kids for the 21st century in \nschools that did not even make the grade in the 20th century?\n  This amendment by Senator Robb provides a comprehensive two-pronged \nresponse: $1.3 billion each year to make grants and no-interest loans \nfor emergency repairs to schools.\n  The second part of this strategy is to underwrite the cost of \nbuilding nearly $25 billion of new school facilities. This amendment \nprovides the tax credits to subsidize the interest on new construction \nprojects to modernize public schools.\n  Last year, six Iowa school districts received grants to underwrite \nthe cost of building new school facilities. Over and over, school \nofficials said the availability of the Federal grant was responsible \nfor convincing local citizens to support a school bond issue to finance \nthe bulk of the project. Modern, up-to-date school buildings are \nessential for student achievement.\n  Studies show students in overcrowded schools, or schools in poor \nfiscal condition, scored significantly lower on math and reading than \ntheir peers in less crowded conditions.\n  This is a very serious national problem. In Iowa alone during the \n1990s, there were 100 fires in Iowa public schools. During the previous \ndecade,\n\n[[Page S2300]]\n\nthere were only 20. The wiring is getting old, schools are catching on \nfire, water pipes are bursting, and they do not have the new technology \nour students need.\n  If there is one thing that cries out for our intervention on a \nnational level, it is this issue: to upgrade and modernize our schools \nand to build new schools where needed. All one has to do is read \nJonathan Kozol's book ``Savage Inequalities: Children in America's \nSchools'' to understand in this system of ours in America where schools \nare financed by local bond issues, that if you have an area with high-\nincome residents, high property values, you get pretty darn good \nschools. But go to areas where there are low-income people and low \nproperty values; that is where we find the poor schools.\n  Yet a child educated in one of those poor schools does not stay in \nthat local school district. That child moves to Iowa, California, \nVirginia, Georgia, or anywhere else and becomes a burden on all of \nsociety. That is why this cries out for a national solution.\n  To hear my friends on the other side, they say leave it up to the \nlocal school districts and let them handle it. Sure, if you live in a \nrich school district, you are fine.\n  But if you live in a poor area of America--rural or urban--you do not \nhave the wherewithal to build those new schools and to get the wiring \nand the upgrading that you need.\n  That is why it is a national problem. It requires a national \nsolution. That is why I hope the Coverdell amendment will be defeated \nand that we could get to the underlying Robb amendment and let the kids \nof this country and their parents and their families know that this \nnational effort is going to go forward to rebuild our schools.\n  I compliment the Senator from Virginia for his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  The Senator from Virginia and I have an honorable disagreement about \nhow the Federal Government ought to respond to being a better partner \nin education. But the one issue that I would take some exception to and \nwould like to clarify is the question of whether this is designed to be \na voucher. It is not a voucher. The good Senator from New Jersey, Mr. \nTorricelli, who vehemently does not support vouchers, is a coauthor \nbecause he does not view this as a voucher.\n  I would not say that of the 70 percent of the families who would open \nan account who are in public schools, some family somewhere with that \nsavings account might not make a change. But it would be statistically \ninsignificant. If they did, I think it is a right that they should \nhave.\n  As the Senator from Virginia said, 90 percent-plus of our students \nare in public schools. I venture to say that 10 years from now, 90 \npercent-plus of our students are still going to be in public schools.\n  The proposal is not designed to be a disguise for vouchers. It never \nhas been. As I said, 70 percent of the people who open these accounts \nare estimated to have children in public schools and 30 percent are in \nsome other school.\n  Of the $12 billion that will be saved and used for schools, it is \ndivided about 50-50. In my view, that is because those families who \nhave the child in the private school know they have a higher hurdle, \nthat they have to pay the local school taxes and the tuition, so they \ntend to save more.\n  It may not be persuasive to the Senator from Virginia, but I did want \nto make the point that I never viewed this, and I think generally \nspeaking it has never been viewed, as a voucher.\n  I yield the floor. When the Senator from Virginia concludes his \nremarks, I think we are both prepared to yield back time on this \nsubstitute amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I request, from the Senator from Nevada, 2 minutes from the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Virginia is given 2 minutes from the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I will be very brief.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for the clarification. I did not \nsuggest that this was a voucher. I suggested it was an end run around \nthe difficulty in establishing vouchers. The fact is that three-\nquarters of the benefits under the education IRA that the distinguished \nSenator from Georgia was able to pass through this body, which will be \nvetoed by the President of the United States, would go to people who \nare already enrolled in private schools. So it may not be a duck, but \nit certainly looks, talks, and walks like a duck.\n  With respect to the need, I suggest to the Senator from Georgia--and \nI do this in a friendly spirit--looking at all of the schools and the \ncurrent estimates, Georgia faces an $8.5 billion shortfall for school \nmodernization, which includes $7.1 billion for infrastructure and $1.5 \nbillion for technology needs. There is projected a 26.5-percent \nincrease in this shortfall in the decade ahead. Georgia would be among \nthe States to benefit from this particular provision.\n  But the bottom line is that we have a choice between a plan that we \nknow the President would support and sign, which would provide some \n6,000 schools built or modernized and some 25,000 schools repaired, as \nopposed to the alternative, where we would have 198 schools built or \nmodernized and none repaired.\n  At the same time, we would be transferring funds that could be used \nto support public education that would be supporting private education. \nIt is as simple as that. I ask our colleagues to reject the substitute \nand support the underlying amendment.\n  With that, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The ranking member of the Budget Committee, who has been \nworking today with his staff to resolve our vote-athon later, to get \nrid of a lot of these amendments that are around, is yielded 5 minutes \noff the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend from Nevada.\n  I commend the Senator from Virginia for his very thoughtful \namendment. I listened carefully to what he had to say. Senator Robb has \nthe respect of all of us, regardless on which side of the aisle your \npolitical initiation or interests fall.\n  As he said, if it looks like and sounds like and talks like it, then \nwe kind of know what it is. I think that is a proper characterization, \nin all fairness to the distinguished Senator from Georgia. If it is a \ntax-saving device that later can be used for contributions to private \nschools, it obviously is. If it is not a voucher, it sure enough \nresembles one so much that the disguise is more than penetrable.\n  But I wish to talk about the Robb amendment. Senator Robb talks about \nthe need to modernize our Nation's schools. Boy, I salute that. I am \nthe product of public education. In fact, my parents barely could \nafford to send me to a free school.\n  I have taken an interest in the community from which I came, \nPaterson, NJ. It is industrialized, one of the poorest cities in the \nState of New Jersey--in fact, one of the poorest cities in America in \nranking.\n  I looked at the situation with the schools there, schools that I \nattended. In particular, I looked at one school, a school that we \ncalled school No. 6, that I attended where they are barely able to keep \nplaster on the walls and keep the place in fit condition. I also went \nto high school in the same city for a while. Knowing my age, one \nrecognizes how old those schools might be. The fact is, we both \nweathered storms, the schools and I, over a lot of years. But wear and \ntear shows.\n  We look at these schools and see how inadequately prepared they are \nfor contemporary times. We question what we ought to do there. Since I \ncome out of the computer business, those are my roots. I am a member of \nsomething that probably is not noticeable on everybody's calendar, but \nI am a member of the Information Processing Hall of Fame, which is in \nDallas, TX. My former colleague, Bill Bradley, was a Hall of Famer, but \nof a much more recognizable Hall of Fame, also a much more recognizable \nparticipant.\n  But what I know is that unless we go to the Patersons of the country, \nunless\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\nwe go to the cities of the country that are in desperate need of \nimprovements in the physical structure of their schools, we are going \nto find ourselves leaving out a significant portion of our population--\nwhether rural or urban.\n  I do not mean to boast, but I personally made a contribution to a \nschool in Paterson and stood there and pulled wires with people from \nthe telephone company, who, on a voluntary basis, all pulled wires. And \nI paid for some small part of the installation of cable that would \nenable this school, if they ever got the equipment, to at least hook up \nto the Internet and the world outside their physical building.\n  That is necessary. It is not that we are being good to these kids. We \nare being good to America. We have to have people who can learn, and we \ndon't care what their background is. If they have the capacity to \nlearn, we ought to give them the tools, as the most advanced country, \nthe largest power in the world that has students who can learn but who \ndon't always get the benefits of the proper tools for an education. \nThat includes the simplest thing, not just pulling cable to hook them \nup to the Internet, but to make sure the buildings are sound enough to \nprovide reasonable temperatures in the summer and the winter.\n  Nothing is more discouraging to the learning process than to expect \nsomeone to function in a school that doesn't have the basic comforts. \nWe have all heard the horror stories about sanitary facilities located \nfloors away from where the classrooms are, where windows are broken, \nkids can be injured by falling plaster or, worse, even today, asbestos \nstill used in the construction.\n  I commend the Senator from Virginia for standing up for what is \nright. It is a small cost, when you think about it, as to what we might \nget in return on investment. Those of us who are in the business world \ndo look at return on investment, and this is one really good one.\n  I hope we are going to get by the partisan divide. We are worried \nabout the digital divide, but we also have to worry about the partisan \ndivide as we discuss the budget and its requirements. We have to kick \nthis football. This is where the game starts, right here in the budget \nresolution. What we ought to do is have a good clean kickoff and make \nsure we do it right. I hope when the roll is taken, we defeat the \nCoverdell amendment and support the Robb amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time on the pending \namendment? If neither side yields time on the amendment, it will be \ndeducted equally from both sides.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on the Coverdell substitute, we are \nprepared to yield back our time. It is the understanding that the other \nside will do the same.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back our time.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3013 to Amendment No. 2965\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the need to \n                    reduce gun violence in America.)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Reed, for \n     himself, Mr. Daschle, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n     Lautenberg, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Kohl, \n     Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Robb, Mr. Kennedy, \n     Mr. Biden, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Reid, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n     Bryan, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. L. \n     Chafee, proposes an amendment numbered 3013 to Amendment No. \n     2965.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NEED TO REDUCE GUN \n                   VIOLENCE IN AMERICA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) On average, 12 children die from gun fire everyday in \n     America.\n       (2) On May 20, 1999, the Senate passed the Violent and \n     Repeat Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act, by a \n     vote of 73 to 25, in part, to stem gun-related violence in \n     the United States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in function 750 of this resolution assume \n     that Congress should--\n       (1) pass the conference report to accompany H.R. 1501, the \n     Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and \n     Rehabilitation Act, including Senate-passed provisions, with \n     the purpose of limiting access to firearms by juveniles, \n     convicted felons, and other persons prohibited by law from \n     purchasing or possessing firearms; and\n       (2) consider H.R. 1501 not later than April 20, 2000.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will take time now on the resolution to \nsay this to the acting manager of the bill so the majority knows what \nwe are doing. This matter has already been debated. The Senator from \nRhode Island came earlier today and debated this amendment. Therefore, \nwhat we are going to do to use our half hour of time allotted under the \nsecond-degree amendment is time will be yielded to the Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski, who also is going to, at a subsequent time, \noffer an amendment on the digital divide. Her half hour will be on the \ndigital divide, not on the Reed amendment. You, of course, would have \nyour half hour to speak about anything the majority cares to. I wanted \nto explain that to the majority.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. You are essentially using your half hour to deal with \nthe Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. REID. On another amendment, that's right. Mr. President, under \nthe resolution, that is what we are going to do. It should move this \nmatter along. The Senator from Maryland--when she gets here--will \nspeak.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a minute? I want to make sure \nI haven't inadvertently lost the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Without losing my right to the floor, I say to the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, what we have here now is we have filed \na second-degree amendment to the pending amendment. We have an hour of \ndebate, which the Senator from Maryland is going to use at this time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. A second degree to my pending amendment?\n  Mr. REID. No, the Robb amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have a question. Did Senator Coverdell not offer a \nsubstitute to the Robb amendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, we have offered a substitute and we \nyielded back time.\n  Mr. REID. The same problem of this morning.\n  I yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Parliamentary inquiry to my Democratic whip: Am I \noffering my amendment now or only speaking on it?\n  Mr. REID. We offered it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am ready to do it anyway. Thanks to you and the \nDemocratic leadership, President Bill Clinton, and Al Gore, we are \ntalking about a plan to cross the digital divide. A few minutes \nearlier, Senator Chuck Robb of Virginia spoke eloquently and \npersuasively about how we needed to deal with the problem of wiring \nschools in the United States. I absolutely support that Robb amendment \nbecause we have schools that are deteriorating, and they are in such \nbad shape we can't wire them for the Internet.\n  While we are creating a new physical infrastructure for our schools, \nwe also need to look to the future. We want to help our children by \nmaking sure that public education gets them ready for the new future \nand a new economy. This is why I believe very strongly that no child in \nthe United States of America should ever face the digital divide.\n  What is the digital divide? The divide is between those who have \naccess to technology and who have access to learning and how to use the \ntechnology. If you are on the right side and have access to technology, \nand access to those who will teach you how to use it, both as a person \nand a community, you will feel very empowered and have a bright future. \nBut if you are on the wrong side of the divide, where you don't have \naccess to technology--Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am still disturbed, if the Senator will \nyield about the procedure.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Point of order: I call for regular order. The regular \norder is my amendment.\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this was an amendment in the second-degree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has the floor. As \nlong as she has the floor, no one else can call for regular order with \nrespect to amendments.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I have the floor. I in no way mean to \nhave sharp elbows with the Senator from Alaska. I was only trying to \nget order to continue my presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is entitled to be heard.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If people want to argue about who has the floor, they \ncan go off the floor and continue those arguments. Mr. President, I \nwould like, if we are going to have exchanges----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will those who are having discussions in the \nright side of the well take their conversations off the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  What I was talking about was that if you have access to technology \nand access to those who can teach you technology, your future as a \nperson, a community, and even our country, is bright. But if you are on \nthe wrong side of the divide and don't have access to technology, and \nwill never know how to learn to use technology, your future is quite \ndismal and, as a person, you could end up functionally obsolete in the \nUnited States of America.\n  The Presiding Officer comes from the State of Washington, which is \none of the most robust, high-tech States in the United States of \nAmerica. He knows from his conversations with those tech tycoons that \nwhat we are facing in the United States of America is a workforce \nshortage of people who know how to use technology. Also, not only in \nthe new ``dot-coms'' or the new ``dot-commers,'' what we also face is a \nskill shortage, even in the old economy.\n  In my own hometown of Baltimore, where they make steel or build \nautomobiles, we have gone from smokestacks to ``cyberstacks.'' Walk \nwith me along the minivan plant in Baltimore or come with me in the \nsteaming steelmills of Baltimore, and you will see steelworkers and \nautomobile workers are now tech workers.\n  I want to be sure that every person in the United States of America \nis ready for that new economy. That is why we want to emphasize K \nthrough 12. We will practice the basics from K through 12. We are going \nto ensure that no child is left out or left behind in this new economy. \nWe want to practice in the budget the ABCs. We want to make sure there \nis universal access to technology in schools, libraries, and community \ncenters. We want to practice the ``B'' which is the ``best'' trained \nteachers. We also want to practice a ``C'' called ``computer'' literacy \nfor every child by the time they finish the eighth grade.\n\n  Those are our national goals. That is what I hope we are able to do. \nBut in order to do that, we have to put our resources with our national \ncommitment.\n  First of all, I truly believe that the Government cannot do this \nalone. That is why an amendment I will be offering later on will put \naside $200 million in tax incentives to encourage public-private \npartnership.\n  Why is this important? Because the Government can't do it alone. The \nprivate sector is already doing important, exciting work, and improving \naccess to technology. But technology empowerment can't be limited to a \nfew ZIP Codes, or recycled factories, where great work is being done in \nmy own hometown. We need to encourage private sector donations of high-\nquality technology, sponsorship of community centers, and the \nsponsorship of training. I have seen many examples in my own hometown.\n  While we look forward to providing technology, one of the most \nimportant things is to make sure our teachers are trained. If our \nteachers are not trained, our technology could end up in closets and \nour children could be left not learning what they need to learn. The \nbudget amendment calls for $600 million for teacher training.\n  Everywhere I go, teachers tell me they want to help their students \ncross the digital divide. But they need the training to do this. \nTechnology without training is a hollow opportunity.\n  In my own home State of Maryland, the superintendent of public \neducation established what we call a ``tech academy'' so that public \nschoolteachers could come from across the State to learn how to use \nthis. Guess what. Six hundred teachers came and 400 had to be turned \naway. We now have an incredible waiting list.\n  No teacher should have to stand in line to learn how to use \ntechnology so they can teach children how to use technology. This is \nwhy we want to make sure that young people coming up in our teacher \nschools learn technology. Those teachers who are the fourth grade \nreading specialists should know as much about technology as some \ncomputer whiz.\n  In addition to that, our amendment provides access--$400 million--for \nschool technology and school libraries, for hardware and software \ntechnology everywhere. We want to make sure our school libraries are \nhigh-tech media centers.\n  Why is this important?\n  In my own community, in some schools we have a ratio of one computer \nper five children.\n  To the Senator from Georgia, I would note that in some of our private \nschools it will be mandated that every child come with a laptop.\n  But I say to my colleague and others who are listening, if you are a \npoor child, it is more likely you live in a poor neighborhood. The poor \nneighborhood has poorer schools. They do not have technology in their \nclassroom or a media center in their library.\n\n  Please, in the United States of America, with all the money we are \ngoing to spend in this budget, let's put $400 million to be sure our \nschools and our libraries do have the hardware and software where they \nneed it.\n  Our children don't only learn in schools and in libraries, though \nthose are crucial places. Many of them learn out in the community. This \nis why our amendment will provide $100 million to create 1,000 \ncommunity technology centers. Community leaders have told me that we \nneed to bring technology to where the children learn. They don't learn \nonly in schools; they learn in communities.\n  I saw for myself what technology meant to a community center at a \npublic housing project. The adults learned technology during the day \nand the children learned technology through structured afterschool \nactivities sponsored by the Boys and Girls Clubs in the afternoon.\n  In my own town of Baltimore, I spoke to the Urban League to see what \nthey were doing to help get our children ready for the future. They \ntold me they had to forage for funds, and there was not one Federal \ndollar available to help the Urban League help those children get ready \nfor the future.\n  Certainly, if we can spend $18,000 a year on one person in prison, we \ncan spend the money to create 1,000 community centers to keep our \nchildren in school and get ready for the new economy.\n  Mr. President, in addition to that, speaking of the Boys and Girls \nClubs, we are including in our amendment Senator Biden's excellent \nproposal to provide $20 million to place computers and trained \npersonnel in those Boys and Girls Clubs. What a tremendous opportunity.\n  In April we are celebrating Boys and Girls Clubs Month. There are \ngreat alumni from the Boys and Girls Club. Michael Jordan is one; \nPresident Bill Clinton went to one when his mother worked as a nurse \nand the Boys and Girls Clubs was one of his afterschool activities. \nBoys and Girls Clubs have been training and helping young people stay \non the right track for a number of years. We not only want to teach \nthem about hoop dreams; we want to team them about technology. This is \nwhy this is so crucial.\n  We will also provide $25 million to create an e-Corps within \nAmeriCorps. This will provide funds for 2,000 volunteers to teach \ntechnology in their schools and community centers.\n  In addition, we want to make sure we provide private sector \ndeployment of broadband networks in underserved urban and rural \ncommunities. We need these funds to build the super information highway \nwith on and off ramps for all.\n  I have in my State the Mountain Counties, a nice tourism word for \nAppalachia. With the old economy fading in coal mining and without the \nrailroad jobs and so on, we are trying to\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\ncreate a super information highway there. Guess what. If you are a \nconstituent in Cumberland, your on and off ramp is in Pittsburgh. This \nmakes service slow and unreliable. It slows down e-commerce and \nprevents new jobs from coming to an area that badly needs them. These \nfunds will be used to help the private sector bring the super \ninformation highway to every corner.\n\n  We need to test new ways to bring technology into the home, with \ninnovative applications. We need to look out for Native Americans. We \nare living in a very exciting time. The opportunities are tremendous to \nuse technology to improve our lives, to use technology to remove the \nbarriers caused by income, race, ethnicity, or geography. If we can \nhelp every one of our children and make sure they cross this digital \ndivide, this will be the most important legislation this United States \ncan pass. It will be as important as the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nTechnology is the tool, but empowerment is the outcome.\n  It could mean, through the work we do here, the death of distance as \na barrier for economic development. But it also could mean the death of \ndiscrimination because poor children and children of color would be \nable to leapfrog into the future.\n  My amendment takes the Federal dollars and makes public investments \nin our schools, our community-based organizations, our libraries, our \nteachers, and, most of all, our children. At the right time, I will be \noffering my amendment. That is, indeed, a brief summary of this \namendment.\n  Obviously, this isn't the most compelling thing on Senators' minds, \nand it is disappointing I have had to speak in an environment where \neverybody else's conversation was more important than the person \nspeaking. That is OK because deep down I know America is listening. \nDeep down, I know this is a very important coalition issue. It brings \npeople together of all different geographies, rural and urban, whether \npoor white or a child from a family of African, Latino, or Native \nAmerican background. It also means if you are disabled, you will be \nable to learn the tools needed to ensure, though you might have a \nphysical disability, you will not have barriers.\n  This amendment is about hope. This amendment is about opportunity. \nThis amendment is about one more rung on the opportunity ladder of the \nUnited States of America. I think it has broad-based appeal on a \nbipartisan basis. I hope when the time comes to offer my amendment and \nwhen we have a rollcall vote, the men and women of the Senate will vote \nto ensure that our children can have a future and many children can \nleapfrog into the future, leaving behind the legacies of poverty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the National \nDigital Empowerment Amendment to be offered by my colleague, Senator \nMikulski. Let me begin by expressing my deep thanks to Senator Mikulski \nfor her leadership in the Senate in crafting this initiative. And I \nshould mention that she has not only worked with her Senate colleagues \non this, but has reached across to the House of Representatives, \njoining with the members of the Congressional Black and Hispanic \nCaucuses, to ensure that it addresses the digital divide in a \ncomprehensive and extensive way. She has also sought out the opinions \nof parents, teachers, children, business people and working people all \nacross our State and the Nation to ensure that every community can reap \nthe benefits of technology.\n  Moreover, I am pleased that members of the technology sector of our \neconomy are participating so fully and have played such a key role in \nhelping to develop this initiative. With the technological giants \njoining us in this effort, we are off to a great start in helping to \nensure that every man, woman and child in our country will have the \nopportunity to access the Internet.\n  I believe we have a tremendous opportunity right now, with our \neconomic prosperity, to begin closing this digital divide. We have the \nlowest unemployment rate and the lowest inflation rate in our country \nin more than 30 years. In our African-American and Hispanic \ncommunities, unemployment has fallen to some of the lowest levels in \nhistory.\n  And to help sustain this economic recovery, we must provide the tools \nto enable our people to obtain the skills necessary to compete in a \nglobal economy--an economy that is growing by leaps and bounds in part \ndue to the technology sector and the opportunities it presents.\n  We are the world's leader of this technological revolution and our \nchildren are on the cusp of enjoying the full benefits of what it has \nto offer. In order to assist them in this endeavor, we must move \nforward to empowering each and every community with the technological \nskills and resources it requires. We can take a major step in this \nregard by passing this legislation--America's future deserves no less. \nSo I lend my strong support to this amendment and I urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on amendment No. 3013 of the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island, Mr. Reid. It is a second-degree perfecting amendment \nto the Robb amendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It was my intention to delay debate on my amendment \nuntil the Robb amendment and the second-degree amendment were finished. \nAs I understand it, a substitute was filed rather than a second-degree. \nI am not sure that process is over. I want to keep our commitment. I \napologize to the Senator from Maryland; I thought that was over when I \ncame to the floor.\n  I am prepared to allow my good friend from Georgia to complete this \nprocess, if that is the desire of the Senate. We will get to my \namendment when this amendment is disposed of.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alaska, and the manager of the \nbill, we are still on the Robb amendment. We have whatever time is left \non our side.\n  We have one more speaker on our side.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I understand there was confusion. I was yielded 30 \nminutes, and I have consumed 16 minutes. I yield my 14 minutes back to \nthe Democratic whip to use such time as he deems appropriate.\n  Mr. REID. We have no more amendments to offer on this particular \nmeasure. Does the majority wish to spend more time on this amendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We have 30 minutes allotted on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In answer to the question of the Senator from Nevada, \nyes, we have several speakers on the amendment and will probably use \nthe majority of the 30 minutes on our side.\n  Mr. REID. We don't appear to have any speakers.\n  There was no attempt--and I explained this in detail to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico--to do anything other than complete the work on the \nRobb amendment.\n  There are a lot of people I might try to take advantage of, but one \nof them is not the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the Senator's comments. I was misinformed. \nI apologize to the Senator.\n  I want to make certain when the time comes, we get to the floor as \nintended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the Reed amendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry. Under this circumstance, the time is \nbeing equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, it is equally divided.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, unless the majority is ready to proceed, we \nhave a Senator to speak, and I can yield him some time off the \nresolution. But if the Senator from Idaho is ready to proceed?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. We are. Mr. President, I yield up to 10 minutes of our \ntime to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I ask a question of the Senator \nwho has been managing? How much time does he have on his amendment?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The full 30 minutes, well, minus--what is it, 25 \nminutes?\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 25 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I want to be brief, but I think it is \nimportant to respond for the record because we have had a Senator stand \nup and suggest we ought to instruct the judiciary committees that are \nin conference now over juvenile justice--and he is doing it based on \nguns and guns alone. So for a few moments let me talk about what is in \nthe juvenile justice bill that has been covered up by the debate that \nhas produced no results for this country and, most importantly, should \nnot.\n  I know the Senator has not talked about the alcohol prevention for \nminors that is in the bill or the cultural violence issues or the gangs \nor the juvenile Brady bill and the gun safety provisions that were \nalready in a bill before Columbine and before Senators came to the \nfloor and began to muck up the process of a very well thought out \njuvenile crime bill. There are provisions for juvenile offenders to \nallow the U.S. attorney to prosecute juveniles as adults for violent \nfelonies and serious drug offenses. It treats Federal delinquency \nrecords for serious crimes such as murder and rape and armed robbery \nand assault similar to records of adults and other offenders.\n  Why are we stymied? Why has the Congress not rushed to judgment on \ngun laws? More gun laws--adding more to the 35,000 gun laws that are \nalready on the books of America's cities, counties, State, and Federal \nGovernment. Let me tell you why.\n  In a recent poll by Zogby, recognized by most as a very creditable \npollster, here was the question asked of the American citizens: Which \nof the following is the best way to solve the gun violence in America? \nMr. President, 52 percent said prosecuting criminals who use a gun in \nthe commission of a crime--well over a majority of the American people \nare saying no more laws; Attorney General Janet Reno, go after the \ncriminal who misuses his or her rights under the Constitution.\n\n  Then 15 percent said having parents and schools teach self-control. \nNow we are up to 67 percent of the American people who, when asked the \nquestion, are saying: Don't pass more laws; enforce the ones you have. \nWork on the cultural problems that America has. Only 2 percent of the \nAmerican people say Congress should legislate more gun laws--only 2 \npercent.\n  So when the Senator from California brought this amendment to the \nfloor some time ago, and it was defeated, that was the reason it was \ndefeated. Now the Senator from Connecticut comes forward with the \nidentical amendment and is going to ask the Senate to repeat the \naction. A political ``gotcha'' is what they think it is.\n  America is very aware of what we are doing here. It is not what we \nare not doing here. They know we are not passing more gun laws. They \nknow the reason is because that does not work. Only 2 percent of the \nAmerican public are willing to suggest that somehow the Congress can \nmiraculously change the culture of our society or the violence in \nAmerica. The juvenile justice bill itself, absent what was put on it by \nthis Senate, will go a great deal further in curbing juvenile crime \nthan anything else.\n  The Senate will vote its will on this issue, and it should. That is \nappropriate. But it will not be voting the will of America, an America \nthat is saying to this Justice Department: Get busy and enforce the \nlaw; saying to the parents of school-age children of America: Get \ninvolved in the lives of your children. Work with them in developing \nself-control. Work with your schools and your communities. That is not \npassing a law. That is changing your schedule as a parent. That is \ntaking time out of your busy lives to get involved with your kids.\n  That was the tragedy of Columbine and that is the tragedy of America \ntoday. Somehow we have become so busy we cannot give our children time. \nWhen violence erupts in America as a result of a juvenile offender and \na misdirected child, we run to the Congress of the United States and \nsay: Fix it.\n  We cannot fix these kinds of things, and the American people innately \nknow it. That is why they so clearly said to the Senator from \nCalifornia or to the Senator from Connecticut or to other Senators: \nStacking up laws and stacking up law books does not a safer world make. \nThat is why the Senate has rejected it. That is why the House has \nrejected it. That is why my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ngain absolutely no value and political traction on this issue--because \nthe American people have it figured out.\n  I am not surprised. The American people are collectively much \nbrighter than most of us. I ask the Senate to reject this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from California for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the assistant Democratic leader \nfor this time. I came to talk about the Mikulski amendment, which I was \nhonored to carry for her in the Budget Committee. But I also feel the \nneed to respond to my friend from Idaho, who is an eloquent voice for \nthe status quo when it comes to gun violence.\n  The Senate did act, the Senate did act on five sensible gun laws. The \nfact is, we should be pushing for them because over his opposition we \ndid pass those laws and they are stuck in the conference committee. The \nReid amendment would simply call on the conference committee to do its \nwork and report these laws out so we can turn around the tragedy that \nis meeting too many families, too many children.\n  I heard a statistic the other day: 75 percent of all gun murders of \nchildren in the world occur in the United States of America, the land \nof the free and the home of the brave. It does not matter how brave a \nchild is. Twelve a day are killed. I say to my friend from Rhode \nIsland, I appreciate him offering his amendment.\n  Also, I say to the Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, I was honored \nto offer a very similar amendment in the Budget Committee. The good \nnews is that amendment was adopted unanimously, and Chairman Domenici \naccepted it. The difference between Senator Mikulski's amendment, which \nI cosponsor with her, and the one in the committee is that this one has \nsolid numbers behind it. The amendment in the committee was a general \nvow of support from the Budget Committee to bridge that digital divide. \nWe offer in this amendment a comprehensive approach to building human \ncapital and physical infrastructure that is needed for sustained \nsuccess in this century.\n  I want to make two points about the great need we face for our \nchildren. We have a public education system in this Nation that is \nessentially a great equalizer. It gives all children a chance to grow \nup and be what they want to be, in my case a Senator. I want to see \nthat occur for all of our children. It will not occur if they do not \nhave access to computers and teachers who understand how to use the \ncomputers.\n  I come from a State that boasts Silicon Valley. In Los Angeles, we \nhave a similar high-tech area. In San Diego, we have a magnificent \nhigh-tech area, and it is moving all over our State. Those companies \nhave to go to foreign countries to get human capital. People are being \noffered very high salaries to come to America. Therefore, we must train \nour young people or all those good jobs will not go to Americans, and \nthat will be a very sad situation, indeed.\n  The last point I will make is that if you have young children or if \nyou have grandchildren--and I am fortunate to have a grandchild--you \ncan see that 2- and 3-year-olds find their way on computers. A lasting \nmemory I have of my grandson is at the age of 2\\1/2\\, with his thumb \nstuck in his mouth, his blanket hanging down, and the other hand on the \nmouse figuring out how to use the computer. Now he is 5. I hate to \nadmit it, but he understands computers probably as well as I do. At \nleast when the computer freezes up, he figures out a way to make it \nwork.\n  If children are gravitating in that direction and they can understand \nat that age--because their brain capacity is expanding at amazing rates \nat age 3, 4, and 5--we have to make sure our families can give them \nthis opportunity. It is the right thing to do for them. It is the right \nthing to do for our education system. It is the right thing to do for \nour Nation.\n  The Mikulski-Boxer amendment, which is supported by many others too\n\n[[Page S2305]]\n\nnumerous to mention, is so important. Since we can look back at the \nbudget vote and see that a similar amendment was, in fact, adopted \nacross the board by the committee in a bipartisan vote, this is the \nlogical next step--to put the numbers behind the idea that every single \nchild in America should come on board this information age and do well \nin school, do well in the family, and do well in a future career.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank my assistant minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. How much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-one minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia and welcome the opportunity to share a few remarks about \nviolence in America and what we can do to make our streets and \ncommunities safer and, specifically, what we ought to do about firearms \nin America.\n  Over half the homes in America have a gun. It is a traditional part \nof American life, and it will always be. It is protected by the second \namendment to the Constitution. It provides the right to keep and bear \narms. That is a tradition and a legal right given to the American \npeople, unless it is taken away by an amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  However, even though we have firearms, firearms are dangerous and \nthey should not be in the hands of people who are dangerous.\n  We have a string of laws that help us deal with that, laws that I \nused to enforce for 15 years as a Federal prosecutor, and 12 years as \nU.S. attorney. We had a project under President Bush called Project \nTriggerlock, which he promoted and I promoted in my district. I sent \nout a newsletter to every sheriff and every chief of police telling \nthem that we were willing and able to use tough Federal firearms \nlegislation to help them crack down on crime where firearms were used; \nthat we would prosecute people who had been convicted of a felony who \npossessed a firearm; that we would, indeed, prosecute them aggressively \nif they wanted to bring those cases to the Federal prosecutors. We \nincreased those prosecutions substantially. I believe that helped \nreduce crime. I believe it helped make our communities safer.\n  Years went by and President Clinton took office. I expected, since he \ntalked so much about illegal guns and stopping guns--they talk about \nthis inanimate object, a metal firearm as if it is an evil force, when, \nobviously, the person behind it is the one who causes the trouble. I \nthought we would see a further step-up of the prosecution of laws.\n  As one can see from the chart behind me, exactly the opposite \noccurred. It is astounding to me. I left office in 1992, and under \nPresident Bush's administration, there were 7,048 prosecutions of \ncriminals for illegal use of guns under existing laws then, and we have \nmore laws today than we had then. Look what happened. They steadfastly \nset about to reduce those gun prosecutions to 3,807 in 1998. I find \nthat astounding.\n  I came to this body 3 years ago. I know how to pull out the \nDepartment of Justice statistics book. I used it every day as a Federal \nprosecutor. I could see how my district was doing and other districts \nwere doing. I looked at the numbers. It was stunning to me.\n  In the last 3 years I have been here, I do not believe I have missed \none opportunity to call those numbers to the attention of the Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, the Deputy Attorney General of the United \nStates, the Associate Attorney General of the United States, or the \nChief of the Criminal Division. It has been 10, 15, or more times. Most \nof the time I have had this very chart with me.\n  I said: I am astounded.\n  They said: The States are prosecuting more cases, and we are trying \nto go after big gun cases.\n  Fundamentally, the numbers went down. The intensity of the effort \nwent down.\n  Then an experiment occurred. The U.S. attorney in Richmond, VA, \nappointed by President Clinton, got with the chief of police in \nRichmond, who is a young, aggressive African American, to do something \nabout gun violence in Richmond. So they attempted to do what we called \nProject Triggerlock. They called it Triggerlock with Steroids. They \nprosecuted the types of cases we were doing, and they ran TV \nadvertisements and announcements. They thought the combination would \nhelp.\n  They credited their efforts in Richmond, VA--President Clinton's own \nappointee--with a 30-percent reduction in the number of deaths and \nmurders in Richmond, VA--40 percent. It may be more than that over 2 \nyears, but 30 percent was the number they testified to in a hearing I \nheld.\n  Oddly enough, the day before the hearing, which was going to be on a \nMonday, the President, the Department of Justice, and Janet Reno tried \ntheir best to put off the hearing. They did not want to go into these \nnumbers. They did not want to talk about them. Finally we said: We are \ngoing to have this hearing; we have been talking about it for years.\n  So we set it and went forward. Then that Saturday before the hearing \nwas to be held, President Clinton dedicated his national radio address \nto Project Exile in Richmond and bragged about how good it was. He said \nin that radio address: I am directing the Attorney General of the \nUnited States and the Secretary of the Treasury--which has the Bureau \nof Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms that does most of the \ninvestigations--to step up their prosecution of criminals with guns.\n  A month or so later, the Attorney General came before the committee \non another matter, and I asked her about it. She apparently had not \ndone anything about it. I remember asking her: How did she get the \nmessage from the President? Did she have to turn on the radio or did he \nsend it to her in writing? He said it on the radio: I am directing you \nto enhance these prosecutions. He should; but it has not been done.\n  A lot of other laws have been passed in recent years that are \nsupposed to work. I am telling you about the 7,000 prosecutions of \nfelons who were in the possession of a gun during the commission of a \ncrime, the 7,000 prosecutions of felons, in the possession of automatic \nweapons, lying on their forms when they applied to buy one, and that \nsort of thing. That is the bread and butter of prosecuting gun cases. \nThat is the meat and potatoes of it. We passed a lot of other laws.\n  They want to pass another law to go even further than what this \nCongress has passed to restrict the sale of guns at a gun show saying \nit is going to affect crime in America. That is absolutely bogus. That \nis baloney. That is politics.\n  We tried to reach a reasonable agreement, but I am not going to vote \nfor some sort of restriction on gun shows that says to people who have \nbeen doing this for 50 years that they have to wait 3 days before they \ncan sell a gun. By then the show is closed and has gone back to a State \nsomewhere far away. That is not necessary.\n  We have tried to reach an accord with the White House on that. They \ndo not want an accord. They think they can get a political issue.\n  Let me show you what I am talking about, what is really important on \nguns.\n  They passed a law called 922(q), title 18, involving the possession \nof firearms on school grounds. That was a few years ago before I came \nto the Senate. It was not too many years ago.\n  In 1997, they had five prosecutions in the whole United States. In \n1998, they had eight prosecutions in the whole United States. They \npassed a law that it is unlawful to transfer firearms to juveniles. I \nsupport that law. I support the one on the possession of firearms on \nschool grounds, too. But, look, in 1997, they prosecuted five of those \ncases; and in 1998, six of those cases.\n  Another law deals with the possession or transfer of a semiautomatic \nweapon; that is, the assault weapons. You remember we had to have this \nassault weapon ban. It was worthy of debate.\n  An assault weapon looks like a military M-16, an AK-47, but it really \nis not. The assault weapons are semiautomatic, not fully automatic as \nare the military weapons. If it is fully automatic, if it is a machine \ngun, an automatic weapon, it has been illegal since the days of Al \nCapone. I do not believe I have ever failed to prosecute a case in\n\n[[Page S2306]]\n\nAlabama when a person had an automatic weapon, a machine gun.\n  We did not need these new laws to prosecute that. But if they had a \nweapon that looked like an M-16, they wanted to make it illegal, even \nthough it fired one shot. That was eventually done. That was going to \nstop crime in America. Right?\n  In 1997, there were four prosecutions; in 1998, there were four \nprosecutions.\n  Look, we want to reduce crime in America. We want to reduce the \nincidence of illegal weapons. Children do not need to be playing with \nweapons. Everybody who has a weapon in their home needs to keep that \nweapon locked up.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield another 5 minutes to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we want to do the right thing. But there \nis a constitutional right to keep and bear arms in this country. How \nfar do we want to go? These laws that are not being enforced, does that \nsuggest this administration is guilty of hypocrisy?\n  They said this was so important, that we had to pass it, and we were \ngoing to enforce these laws. But their prosecutions have plummeted \nunder the administration.\n  I say to the people of America, and the Members of this Senate, if we \nreplicated, throughout this country, Project Exile in Richmond, and if \nit were carried out under existing laws, that all these laws and those \ngun laws were enforced steadfastly--if criminals who are using guns are \ngiven enhanced sentences, as Federal law requires; if you carry a \nfirearm during a drug deal, you must receive 5 years without parole \nconsecutive to any sentence you receive for the drug offense--the word \nstarts getting out.\n  It did in Mobile, AL, where I prosecuted. Drug dealers quit carrying \nguns because if they carried a gun, they would be taken to Federal \ncourt, and when they were prosecuted, they would be sentenced and sent \noff, in exile, to some Federal prison way out of the State.\n  It does work. It worked in Richmond. That is what we need to do. We \nneed to be skeptical of the news media that always judges whether or \nnot somebody is against gun violence by whether they vote for every \nbill the Clinton administration proposes. If you do not vote for every \nbill they propose, then you are for gun violence.\n  I was a prosecutor. I prosecuted a lot more cases, firearms cases, \nthan the Clinton administration did and my brother U.S. attorneys did. \nSo that offends me. I do not believe it is right.\n  This amendment that has been proposed, this sense of the Senate, is \njust a political deal. I worked hard with Senator Hatch, and others on \nthe Judiciary Committee, to pass a juvenile crime bill that I believe \nwill work to reduce crime in America. It has some gun amendments on it \nthat restrict gun use in America. It makes it a felony to sell one of \nthese assault weapons to a young person. And there are other offenses \nwe added to that. But they are not going to really affect crime in \nAmerica, frankly. Certainly, they will not if they do not get enforced.\n  I suggest that what we need to do is to enforce the laws we have. I \nknow Mr. Wayne LaPierre, the executive director of the National Rifle \nAssociation, made the comment that the President wanted violence in \nAmerica, and that is why he would not enforce these laws. He got so mad \nabout it, he said he thought it was deliberate. I do not agree with \nthat.\n  But I will say to you right now what I said in the hearings before my \ncommittee: There have been good and decent people all over America who \nare dead today because this administration will not enforce and carry \nout a proven program such as Project Exile in Richmond, VA, to target \ncriminals who are using guns to kill people.\n  They claim they have had a 30-percent reduction in murder in \nRichmond. Think what would happen if every city in America could \nachieve that by carrying out such a program. It could be done if the \nAttorney General would direct it, if the President would insist on it, \nand we would get about that business--instead of just talking about \nguns, talking about some new esoteric law, some wording in some \ntransaction at a gun show, as if that is going to make a difference.\n  Trust me. I have been there. I prosecuted these cases. I care about \nthis issue. I believe we need to quit playing politics. We need to pass \nthat juvenile crime bill. It is a good bill. It is being held up \nbecause we will not go as far as the President wants to go on gun show \nlegislation. The House voted it down substantially, with some \nDemocratic opposition. We need to get that legislation passed, quit \nplaying politics with this issue, and get on with the business of the \nSenate.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, from the resolution, I yield 5 minutes to \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, the sponsor of the legislation which is \nthe subject matter of this discussion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  My resolution is very clear. It asks that the conferees return the \nreport back to us on the juvenile justice bill so we can vote up or \ndown on the measures we passed on May 20 of last year, in response to \nColumbine, which provide for safety locks on handguns, ban large clips \nfor automatic weapons, and would also close the gun show loophole. All \nof these measures are supported by an extraordinary majority of \nAmericans.\n  Nearly 90 percent of Americans favor requiring child safety locks on \nall new handguns, including 85 percent of the gun owners who were \nsurveyed. In addition, 89 percent also favor background checks on all \nsales at gun shows. This is what the American people want. It is not \nwhat the gun lobby wants. That is why we have waited 1 year, not in \nprinciples compromise and debate but essentially trying to strangle \nthis measure we passed so that it won't come back to the floor.\n  There has been one meeting of the conferees, which is just trying to \nkill it off by indifference, hoping we will forget about Columbine, \nthat we will forget about the violence that is plaguing the country.\n  Anyone who is suggesting that these measures are designed to end \ncrime in America is being slightly hyperbolic. What it might do is \nprevent those hundreds, perhaps thousands, of deaths a year by handguns \nthrough accidents, through suicides, through the mishandling of \nweapons. That in itself will be a great achievement.\n  I had the opportunity this morning to talk about some of the \nincidents involving children, young people, who might have been \ndeterred, not from criminal activity but gun accidents, gun violence. I \nwas particularly shocked in my home community of Providence by a bunch \nof young people, 16-, 17-year-olds, horsing around, getting into a \nlittle bit of an ego contest. What happened? They were in a place \nwhere, when they turned around, somebody in the crowd had a gun. Not \nthe two young people wrestling but somebody had a gun. They got the \nweapon. One person, out of a sense of just total irrationality, fired, \nhitting the other young man in the head, critically wounding the young \nman, and was so distraught by remorse for what he had done that he ran \ninto a backyard and killed himself.\n  That is what we are talking about in terms of gun violence. There is \nno law that would prevent that.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REED. I would like to finish my remarks.\n  We can do much more, and we should do much more. I have heard people \nsay all weapons should be secured in the home, if they are stored \nthere. The child safety lock will ensure that takes place.\n  On the gun show loophole, the GAO has done a report that suggested, \nunder the Brady instant check, 73 percent of these background checks \nare finished almost immediately, conducted almost simultaneously with \nthe request, that 95 percent of all checks are completed within 2 \nhours. It is only those checks that raise serious questions that go \nbeyond 2 hours, which will in no way interfere with the operation of a \ngun show. It is in those checks where the most likely violations occur \nin terms of getting a weapon which you should not have. In fact, \nthose people are 20 times more likely to be unable to acquire a weapon.\n\n[[Page S2307]]\n\n  In the nature of a gun show, many of the dealers at gun shows are \nlicensed gun dealers. They are subject to the Brady law. They have to \ndo the background check. We can't abandon reason when we come to the \nfloor. If you are looking for a weapon and you know you are going to \nface a Brady check when you go to a gun show, where are you going to \ngo? You will go not to the licensed gun dealer but someone who is \nselling guns and doesn't have to do a background check. Then you will \nhope, if any check is done, it will be done so arbitrarily that you \nwon't be caught. That is what the statistics show in the GAO report.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield on one point?\n  Mr. REED. I would like to finish. My colleagues want to speak on \nother matters. Let me say something about this mantra about \nenforcement: You just have to enforce the laws.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. REED. I ask for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Two minutes under the resolution.\n  Mr. REED. The NRA, the gun lobby, talks about enforcement. They have \npersistently, over decades, frustrated real enforcement. For 10 years \nthey refused to support the Brady bill and told their members it would \neffectively destroy the right to bear arms in America, resulting in \ntotal, strict gun control on all Americans.\n  With respect to the operation of inspections, in 1986 the McClure-\nVolkmer Act was supported strongly by the NRA--$1.5 million of lobbying \nactivity. That legislation limits ATF's ability to conduct unannounced \ninspections. If you want to enforce the law, that is fine. Then why \ndoes the gun lobby go ahead and try to constrain the law so that we \ncan't effectively enforce laws that are on the books already? If you \nlook at the number of ATF agents, it has declined. Fortunately, they \nhave increased over the last year. As a result, we have more \nprosecutions, more referrals.\n  The Wall Street Journal suggests, based upon evidence from a Chicago \ninvestigation:\n\n       While firearm-rights enthusiasts argue that there are \n     enough gun laws on the books, and the problem is merely lax \n     enforcement, the Chicago case illustrates that in some areas, \n     the gun laws have holes and enforcement is harder than one \n     might think.\n\n  That is the Wall Street Journal, not some radical newspaper in this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to yield time now to Senator \nGraham of Florida. Senator Graham and some of his colleagues--Senator \nBayh, Senator Edwards, Senator Landrieu--have a very important \neducation amendment they have been waiting to offer. They will not be \nable to offer it now, but they will offer it at some subsequent time. \nThe 25 minutes remaining under this amendment are going to be divided \namong them to speak on this very important education amendment. I yield \n5 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have a Senator who wants to speak on \nthe actual amendment itself, Mr. Hatch.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to wait for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. We have other people to speak. We will hear from Senator \nGraham and then go to you. How much time do you wish to take?\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time do we have left on this side?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do we have 6 minutes remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield Senator Hatch 4 minutes of that.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Graham is going to speak for 5 minutes, and then \nSenator Hatch is going to speak on the Reed amendment. Then we will go \nback to the other individuals.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will be offering an amendment, which is \ndescribed as Graham amendment No. 1, in which I am joined by Senators \nLieberman, Bayh, Landrieu, Lincoln, Breaux, Robb, and Edwards, which \nrelates to a new approach to the Federal role in primary and secondary \neducation.\n  This is the first major legislative initiative of the Senate New \nDemocrats. We are a group of Democrats who feel passionately about the \nimportance of a partnership between the Federal Government and the \nState and local school districts for the benefit of our children, but \nwe feel pragmatic as to the means by which we can achieve that \nappropriate partnership.\n  We are going to advocate that that partnership has several \nfundamental principles. One of those is accountability for student \nresults. A second is additional resources.\n  If I could put it in a common form, we believe you will not make the \ncow bigger by just weighing the cow every day; that you have to provide \nthe resources in order to be able to achieve the goals, the high goals, \nand to meet the accountability standards we believe are necessary to \nset for our children in order to achieve our national objectives.\n  We also are believers in the principle of greater flexibility at the \nState and local levels; that our Federal programs should be more \nfocused and concentrated. We believe the primary focus of Federal \nprograms should be on the children in the greatest need, the at-risk \nchildren, the children who too often fall through the cracks of current \nAmerican education.\n  Individual members of our group will speak to the various principles \nof this legislation. I want to use the remainder of my time to talk \nabout the issue of accountability because, in my opinion, that is a \ncentral and fundamental issue. It is a word that has many different \nmeanings. Some people define accountability in the context of an \naccountant--that accountability is to be certain you have properly \naccounted for all of those things that were input into the education \nsystem; that you have the appropriate number of books in the school \nlibrary, as an example. We believe those are important.\n  We do not believe that is the accountability the Federal Government \nshould be looking for from States and local school districts. We also \ndo not believe that accountability is accountability for student \nperformance alone. We recognize that student performance is heavily \ninfluenced by many factors, particularly the socioeconomic \ncircumstances of the family of the student. The challenge, rather, is \nan accountability that focuses on those aspects of the experience in \nthe school and the classroom that has contributed to the students' \neducational growth and development.\n  So we will be attempting to present an accountability that is school \nbased, school focused, but is determined by how much educational value \nthe school experience has added to the students' progress.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an opinion \narticle that appeared in the Tallahassee Democrat entitled ``Bush Plan \nGrades Students Poverty Levels,'' as illustration of these different \napproaches to the concept of accountability.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Tallahassee Democrat, Aug. 16, 1999]\n\n                Bush Plan Grades Students Poverty Levels\n\n                         (By Walter Tschinkel)\n\n       The Bush administration and the legislature, after months \n     of lobbying, wrangling, dealing and agonizing, has given us \n     the \n     A+ Plan with its school accountability \n     report (www.firn.edu/doe/schoolgrades/account.htm). Upon \n     analysis, it turns out to be merely an elaborate and \n     expensive way to grade schools on the poverty or affluence of \n     their students.\n       The Bush/Brogan report assigns each school a grade \n     primarily on its raw, overall standardized test scores. \n     Because standardized test performance is reliably predicted \n     by poverty, the poverty-level of a school is by far the \n     strongest predictor of that school's grade from the governor. \n     In fact, if you tell me the percent of a school's students \n     who are on supported lunch (an indicator of low family \n     income). I will tell you its Bush/Brogan grade with 80 \n     percent accuracy.\n       If you think I'm bluffing, let me show you that it's true. \n     Let us simply classify schools by their affluence/poverty \n     makeup--very affluent, moderately affluent, moderately poor, \n     very poor--with the most affluent schools get an A, the next \n     group getting a B, and so on. The table shows how closely the \n     grades based on poverty correspond to those assigned by the \n     Bush/Brogan School Accountability Report. Simply by \n     considering\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\n     school/affluence/poverty, we are able to assign the same \n     grade as the Bush/Brogan `performance-based' system with 26 \n     out of 33 schools in Leon County. And we did this without \n     looking at a single test score.\n\n\n                 scores don't tell us about performance\n\n       Is this a fair, or even a sensible, way to grade our \n     schools? Only if you think poverty should be punished. Does \n     the Bush/Brogan grade tell us anything new about a schools' \n     educational performance? Of course it does not. It tells us \n     what proportion of the student body comes from poor families.\n       It is not my purpose to dwell on the poverty-performance \n     link. But no school grading system that does not take this \n     socioeconomic factor into account is useful in telling us how \n     well our schools are really doing. Would it not be much \n     fairer to adjust school performance for poverty before \n     grading them?\n       I think it would, and hereby offer the Prof. Walter's \n     Level-Playing-Field School-Grading System as an alternative \n     to the Bush/Brogan School Accountability Report.\n       We begin with a so-called regression analysis of the school \n     performance data (three standardized tests) against the \n     poverty level of the student body. This statistical method \n     shows about 80 percent of the test scores are predicted by \n     the poverty level of the student body. I detailed this \n     relationship in a March 14 My View column (also found on my \n     website at www.fsu.edu/biology/faculty/wrt.html). For every \n     percent that poverty increases, the school's scores drop by \n     an average of 1.6 points. The most affluent schools, those \n     with fewer than 15 percent poor students, have scores higher \n     than 230, while the poorest, with more than 75 percent poor \n     students, have scores below 120, less than about half those \n     of the most affluent schools. Next, we take the difference \n     between each school's actual test scores and the test score \n     predicted by the regression for a school of that \n     socioeconomic condition. These differences tell us how much \n     better or worse than average a school tested, given its \n     particular level of poverty. By doing this, we have removed \n     the effect of poverty on test scores. The result is that the \n     maximum difference in test scores has shrunk from 175 points \n     to only about 70 (the lost 105 points are the effect of \n     poverty). Differences less than zero indicate that (with \n     poverty effects removed) a school did less well than average; \n     above zero indicate that it did better than average.\n       My scale assigns letter grades as follows: above 25 gets an \n     A; between 5 and 25 gets a B; between -20 and 5 gets a C; \n     between -35 and -20 gets a D; anything below -35 gets an F. \n     The table below lists our elementary and middle schools in \n     the order of the grades assigned by the Bush/Brogan Plan.\n       When graded according to the Level-Field system, we can \n     recognize that schools like Riley, Hartsfield, and Woodville \n     are doing relatively well compared to other schools of \n     similar socioeconomic makeup. My system recognizes this and \n     rewards them with A's and B's instead of the C's and D's \n     assigned by the Bush/Brogan system.\n       On the other hand, my system also shows that schools like \n     Swift Creek, Buck Lake and Griffin do not deserve their Bush/\n     Brogan A's because they are only average as compared to other \n     schools of similar socioeconomic makeup. Hence, the Level-\n     Field system assigns them a C, because the Level-Field system \n     does not reward schools for being lucky enough to be teaching \n     mostly affluent students.\n       The case of Griffin highlights another flaw of the Bush/\n     Brogan plan. Giffin received an A, not because of its \n     terrific performance on standardized tests, but because (1) \n     the percent of long absences or suspensions was below state \n     averages; (2) greater than 95 percent of the student body was \n     tested; (3) no subgroup fell below minimum criterion; (4) \n     reading scores improved without a decline in math and writing \n     over 1998.\n       Only the last two can actually be considered academic \n     performance. The first two are bureaucratic tricks. It is a \n     bit like requiring that an athlete run the 100-yard dash in \n     10 seconds, but you credit him with half a second if he wears \n     the right color shorts, and another half second if she pulls \n     her socks up before starting. Neither has anything to do with \n     performance, and both serve to obscure real performance.\n\n\n                    insist on better grading system\n\n       You may ask, ``Well, how are we supposed to know how our \n     schools are really doing?'' I suggest that we insist on a \n     much more sophisticated analysis of school data by the state \n     Department of Education, instead of letting it just plunk it \n     onto their web site or onto a newspaper page so the public \n     can worry about what it means.\n       At the very least, school performance needs to be adjusted \n     for the nature of the student body. Better yet, let us not \n     pretend that a single number can adequately assess the \n     performance of our schools. Performance must be measured, not \n     by any single number, but by the relationship between what \n     goes into a school and what comes out. The large and \n     expensive bureaucracy at DOE can reasonably be expected to \n     explain to the public how the data are related to each other, \n     what they mean and how our schools are really doing. This \n     will allow us to discover what works and what doesn't work, \n     and thus to spend money more effectively.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this group of Senate Democrats appreciates \nthis opportunity and accepts the challenge. We understand that \neducation is fundamental to the growth of America today and even more \nfundamental to our progress tomorrow. Our willingness to invest \nintelligently in our children is a test of our Nation's intelligence \nabout shaping its future. I am pleased to be joined by my colleagues in \nthis effort and look forward to their illumination on these principles \nof our education proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Domenici, chairman of the \nBudget Committee, for his outstanding leadership on the budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I feel compelled to make some short remarks today \nbecause the topic has strayed away from the budget and focused once \nagain on gun control. This topic--and many misleading statements about \nit--are paraded out year after year when the Senate considers the \nbudget resolution.\n  This year, I hope we can see through the rhetoric and focus on what \nobjective observers already know to be true: The statistics prove that \nthe Clinton administration has failed to enforce federal gun laws. For \nexample:\n  Between 1992 and 1998, so-called Triggerlock prosecutions--\nprosecutions of defendants who use a firearm in the commission of a \nfelony--dropped nearly 50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800.\n  Despite over 6,000 incidents of children carrying guns into public \nschools last year, the Clinton Justice Department prosecuted only eight \ncases under the federal law against possessing firearms on school \ngrounds in 1998, and only five such cases in 1997.\n  It is a federal law to transfer a firearm to a juvenile, yet the \nClinton Justice Department prosecuted only six cases in 1998, and only \nfive in 1997.\n  Similarly, for all its talk about the dangers of semiautomatic \nassault weapons, the Clinton Justice Department has an equally abysmal \nrecord for prosecuting cases under the current laws governing those \nweapons. The Clinton administration brought only four cases in 1998, \nand only four in 1997, under the federal law criminalizing the transfer \nor possession of semiautomatic assault weapons.\n  Now, Mr. President, you will not hear the Clinton administration or \nthe gun control advocates in Congress talk about these statistics, even \nthough it is these statistics--not a wish-list of more laws and \nregulations--that reveal the true story of gun misuse in America. \nInstead, the number that gun control advocates talk about is the \n500,000 felons and other prohibited purchasers that the Brady \nbackground check prevented from buying firearms since the Brady law was \nenacted.\n  Let me point out that with the original Brady law this administration \nwanted was a 7-day delay once you tried to buy a weapon. We reduced it \nto 5 days. We knew that wasn't going to work, so we instituted an \ninstant check system so you can find out immediately whether a person \nis capable of purchasing a weapon. It was our instant check system that \ncaught these, according to the President, 500,000 people. Actually, it \nwas about 400,000 people.\n  But even this statistic points out the Clinton administration's lack \nof commitment to enforcing federal gun laws. Every one of those 500,000 \npeople who were thwarted in their attempts to purchase firearms \nviolated 18 U.S.C. section 922(a)(6) by stating under oath that they \nwere not disqualified from purchasing a firearm. How many of those \n500,000 were prosecuted between 1996-1999? Only about 200 were even \nreferred for prosecution.\n  Mr. President, the only thing worse than this poor enforcement record \nis the Clinton administration's disingenuous and concerted effort to \nblame the lack of federal gun prosecutions on a lack of resources. The \nfacts demonstrate that, during the period when federal gun prosecutions \ndecreased nearly 50 percent, the overall budget of the Department of \nJustice has increased by 54 percent.\n  The Clinton administration also tries to hide its failure to \nprosecute gun crimes behind its never-ending calls for more federal gun \ncontrol laws. The irony of the administration's position was evident at \nan oversight hearing last year, when I questioned Attorney General Reno \nabout the decline in federal firearms prosecutions. She replied\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\nthat many firearms violations have been prosecuted in state court, and \nshe indicated that state court is the proper forum for these cases. As \nchairman of the board of the Federalist Society, I agree that most \nfirearms crimes can be prosecuted in state court as well as federal \ncourt. Nevertheless, I find it ironic and hypocritical for the \nadministration to argue that crimes involving firearms should be \nprosecuted in state court at the same time they are calling for more \nfederal gun control laws. If the administration really believes that \nits dismal record on gun prosecutions is because gun laws are a state \nissue, it should be consistent and stop pressuring Congress for even \nmore federal gun control laws that it does not intend to enforce.\n  The relevance of all this to the budget resolution is that there are \nseveral actions the Justice Department could take right now--with no \nadditional laws or resources--that would have a positive impact on \nreducing crime in America. First, the Justice Department should use \nstate law enforcement grants to encourage States to enact mandatory \nminimum sentences for firearm offenses based on 18 U.S.C. 924(c), and \nto prosecute such offenses in state court. The key to Project \nTriggerlock is the 5-year mandatory minimum prison sentence for any \nperson who uses or carries a firearm in a crime of violence or serious \ndrug trafficking offense. This 5-year prison sentence is in addition to \nthe prison term for the underlying crime. As I mentioned earlier, most \nof these gun crimes can be prosecuted in state court as well as federal \ncourt. By encouraging States to enact stronger penalties for gun \ncrimes, there will be less need to prosecute these cases in federal \ncourt.\n\n  Mr. President, there is a precedent for the federal government \nencouraging States to increase prison sentences. The Truth-in-\nSentencing Grant Program provides prison construction funds to States \nthat adopt truth-in-sentencing laws. Truth-in-sentencing laws require \nviolent criminals to serve at least 85 percent of their sentences. Due \nto truth-in-sentencing grants, more than 70 percent of prison \nadmissions last year occurred in states requiring criminals to serve at \nleast 85 percent of their sentence.\n  Another positive step the Justice Department should take is using the \nfunds provided in the budget resolution to designate at least one \nassistant United States attorney in each district to prosecute federal \nfirearms violations. As the U.S. attorney's office in Richmond, \nVirginia has shown, federal prosecutors, in cooperation with state and \nlocal law enforcement, can help reduce violent crime. The U.S. \nattorney's offices should focus their efforts on federal firearms \nviolations until the States enact stronger sentences for state firearm \noffenses.\n  Finally, the Justice Department should place mental health \nadjudications on the National Instant Check System (NICS). It is a \nfederal crime for any person who has been adjudicated as a mental \ndefective or who has been committed to a mental institution to possess \nor purchase a firearm. Despite this commonsense federal law, mental \nhealth adjudications are not placed on the NICS system. Consequently, \nmentally ill persons can buy firearms from licensed dealers because the \ndealers are not notified by the NICS system of the mental \ndisqualification. The NICS system will never reach its potential until \nmental health adjudications are included. These commonsense ideas would \ngo a lot further toward reducing the number of crimes committed with \nfirearms than the administration's current practice of ignoring federal \nviolations, asking for more gun restrictions, and blaming lack of \nfunding for their abysmal record of prosecutions.\n  It is pathetic that there are 2,000 laws, rules, and regulations on \nthe books that aren't being taken care of now, and now we have some who \nsay let's have a political recitation here on this resolution to try to \nembarrass people instead of standing up and doing something about the \nmisuse of weapons in our society.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to use my 2 minutes to express to \nthe Senate--referring to no singular Senator but all of us--this budget \nresolution idea has become preposterous. Any kind of sense of the \nSenate is in order, including one to instruct the committee that is in \nconference. We are going so far overboard that we are making this floor \nmuch like a circus. Actually, I am hopeful it won't be too long from \nnow that the Parliamentarian will reverse himself. I don't know how we \nwill do it. Maybe we will instruct him to do it himself. A \nParliamentarian ruled that senses of the Senate were in order on budget \nresolutions even if they did nothing to the resolution.\n  Now we are dreaming them up. We have a gun amendment on a budget \nresolution. We have instructions to a committee in conference on a \nBudget Committee. I don't know what kind of points people are making, \nbut if anybody thinks they are effective just because they win one of \nthese sense of the Senates, let me say, constituents and politicians \ndon't believe they are effective because they do nothing.\n  So if you want to run a TV ad that you got something passed in a \nsense of the Senate, I hope the other guy is smart enough to say that \nis baloney; it did nothing. We would be out of here if we didn't have \nthese--out of here as far as substantive amendments. It is getting \nworse, not better, on both sides. On our side, we have 20 sense-of-the-\nSenate resolutions. I am going to ask them to file them pretty soon and \nsee how many have the courage to call them up and have votes on those.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nIndiana to speak on the education amendment that will be offered at a \nsubsequent time.\n  Mr. BAYH. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my colleagues. I \nparticularly express my appreciation to Senator Graham, and my \ncolleagues, Senators Edwards, Landrieu, Lieberman, Lincoln, and others, \nwho are also speaking on the issue that has been near and dear to my \nheart for many years. It is the cause of improving the public education \nsystem in this country and the opportunity that we give to \nschoolchildren across the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, for more than 100 years, our Republic has been \ndedicated to the proposition that every child growing up in our \ncountry--every child, not just a few, not just the privileged and the \nelite--should have access to a quality public education.\n  In the 1960s, there was a growing recognition, particularly for those \nchildren in our country who are less fortunate, that the dream of a \ngood education was a promise unfulfilled, and the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act was born.\n  We gather here today to say that for too many of our young people the \ndream of a good education is still a promise unfulfilled, the status \nquo is not good enough, that we must do better, that we must have a \nsignificant rethinking and rededication to the principle that a good \neducation is essential for opportunity and for every child growing up \nin our country.\n  That is what the Graham amendment is really all about. It begins with \nresources in the recognition that if we don't give our public schools \nthe tools with which to get the job done, we can't possibly expect them \nto succeed.\n  The Graham amendment calls for setting aside an additional $15 \nbillion in resources for reform and improvement in public education \nover the next 5 years. This is about one-tenth of the size of the tax \ncut included in the budget resolution before us.\n  While I favor cutting taxes, and in fact have sponsored and supported \nseveral of the measures that would reduce taxes in our country, I \nbelieve investing in education is just as important to the future well-\nbeing of this Nation.\n  I don't think a Member of the Senate can possibly say that cutting \ntaxes is 10 times more important than putting quality public school \nteachers in every classroom in this country, or 10 times more important \nthan ensuring that the latest educational technology is available to \nour students, or 10 times more important than ensuring that remedial \nhelp is available to our young people who need to do better reading, \nwriting, and basic science.\n  Making these investments is vitally important to the important \nchallenge of improving public education for every child. But Senator \nGraham's approach does not just throw money at the problem. It deals \nwith fundamental reform and starts with accountability and a\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\nrecognition that we need to focus not just upon how much money is spent \nbut, instead, how much our children learn.\n  We need to focus on outcomes of the process, just as we add inputs \nnecessary to achieving additional success. We need to also focus on \nhigh academic standards that are important to the success of all of our \nchildren. This is important because there is a growing gap between the \nhaves and have-nots in our society, and there is just as much gap in \nknowledge and learning as in anything else.\n  We must ensure that every child gets good access to education and is \nheld to these high educational standards to ensure that for the first \ntime in the history of our Nation we don't experience the creation of \nan underclass characterized by people who do not have enough knowledge \nand learning to participate in the opportunities of the 21st century.\n  Just briefly, this approach is targeted on things that are important, \nsuch as adding good teachers, the latest technology, and focusing upon \nstudents who are at greatest risk, which is at the heart of the \nchallenge we face as a country.\n  In closing, let me say this: The cause of educating our children is, \nby definition, the cause of shaping our future. But in doing so, we \nstay in touch with the fullest wellsprings of our past. It was Thomas \nJefferson, the third President of the United States, who, after his \npublic career, founded the University of Virginia and dedicated his \nlife to the cause of education, who once said that, ``a society that \nexpects to be both ignorant and free is expecting something that never \nhas been and never shall be.''\n  As we debate this amendment, I urge my colleagues to support it \nbecause, in doing so, we not only ensure the future well-being of our \neconomy, not only what kind of society we will one day have, but the \nvitality of our democracy itself.\n  I thank my colleagues for their forbearance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last May, in the wake of the Columbine \nmassacre, this Senate took action, passing a comprehensive juvenile \njustice bill that would begin the long process of addressing the \nproblems that plague the youth in this country.\n  Parts of the bill addressed our crisis of violence.\n  These provisions included: A comprehensive package of measures I \nauthored with Senator Hatch to fight criminal gangs; increased \npenalties for adults who recruit children into criminal activity or \nprovide them with firearms; the James Guelff Body Armor Act, an \namendment I authored, which contains reforms to take body armor out of \nthe hands of criminals and put it into the hands of police; and other \nprovisions related to juvenile confinement, juvenile record-keeping, \nand countless other important issues.\n  Parts of the bill addressed our crisis of guns: a ban on juvenile \npossession of assault weapons and high capacity ammunition magazines; a \nprovision to close the gun show loophole; a requirement that safety \nlocks be included with every handgun sold in America; and my provision \nto ban the importation of large capacity ammunition magazines.\n  But the crisis in leadership remains.\n  Despite passage by both Houses of Congress almost one year ago, the \nconference committee on this bill has met only once--in early August of \nlast year. No real issues have been discussed. No progress has been \nmade. The bills sit in legislative purgatory, apparently never to see \nthe light of day again.\n  It now seems clear that these bills will die a quiet death at the end \nof this short session. As a result, all of the important issues we \ndebated will remain un-addressed. Gang violence, juvenile detention, \nfirearm regulation reform, and a host of other problems will remain \nunsolved.\n  And nobody within the walls of this Chamber or elsewhere has any \ndoubt why this stalemate persists. This bill would have passed months \nago were it not for those four, simple, targeted gun measures buried \nwithin the text of the bill.\n  This, Mr. President, demonstrates just how deeply this Congress is \ndominated by just one special interest group--these people who \nfervently resist any regulations on firearms, no matter how mild, no \nmatter how targeted, and no matter how much the American people want \nit.\n  Some argue that we don't need more gun control laws--enforcing our \ncurrent laws would be enough. But those arguments miss the point \nentirely.\n  Of course we should be enforcing our current laws. And we are. The \nevidence clearly shows that gun prosecutions are up. In fact; since \n1992, the total number of federal and state prosecutions has increased \nsharply--about 25 percent more criminals are sent to prison for state \nand federal weapons offenses now than in 1992 (from 20,681 to 25,186).\n  The number of higher-level federal firearms offenders sent to prison \n(those sentenced to five or more years) has gone up more than 34 \npercent (from 1049 to 1406) in six years.\n  The number of inmates in federal prisons on firearm or arson charges \n(the two are counted together) increased 51 percent from 1993 to 1998, \nto 8,979.\n  And we are working to improve this situation.\n  Just last week, my colleague Senator Kohl and I introduced \nlegislation that would expand Project Exile to 50 cities and provide \nlaw enforcement with ballistics technology that will make it far easier \nto identify and to punish the perpetrators of gun violence.\n  Early last year, I wrote the Secretary of the Treasury several times \nto demand greater attention to those who violate the Brady Law. I asked \nwhy so few violators had been prosecuted, and I was told that the \nresources just aren't there.\n  That is why I support the President's request to fund at least 500 \nadditional ATF agents and 1,000 new prosecutors to focus on guns.\n  But enforcing our current laws has been made tougher by the concerted \nefforts of the NRA to disparage and to destroy the very people tasked \nwith enforcing those laws. The NRA called AFT agents ``jack-booted \nthugs,'' in a letter that was completely contradictory to what they are \nsaying they want now.\n  In fact, every time the opportunity arises to increase federal law \nenforcement capabilities by increasing ATF investigatory ability, the \nNRA fights it tooth and nail:\n\n  The NRA fought the Brady bill for 10 years.\n  They successfully defeated all attempts to allow the Consumer \nProducts Safety Commission to regulate the safety of firearms.\n  In 1986, the NRA got legislation passed which restricts ATF \ninspection of gun dealers to once per year. Even dealers who are the \nsource for hundreds of crime guns cannot be routinely inspected more \nthan once a year without a special court warrant.\n  For years, the NRA has successfully blocked ATF computerization of \ngun sale records from gun dealers that have gone out of business. As a \nresult, when a gun is traced as part of a criminal investigation, the \nfiles must often be retrieved manually from warehouses where the old \nrecords are kept. This can add days or even weeks to the time it takes \nto start tracking down the perpetrators of gun violence. By the time \nthe records are found, the trail may already be cold.\n  And most importantly, the NRA fights against funding our law \nenforcement agencies at levels adequate to enforce our current laws. As \nformer New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton has said, \n``The NRA has strenuously opposed increased financing for the [ATF] and \nhas successfully lobbied against giving it the authority to quickly \ninvestigate the origins of guns sales.''\n  The ATF has been left underfunded, understaffed, and unable to \nadequately enforce our current gun laws.\n  And the simple fact is that our current laws--even if fully \nenforced--are just not enough. Those laws are riddled with NRA-induced \nloopholes. Guns are still too easy to get. And too many children die \nevery day for us to ignore the problem. The Columbine incident shocked \nthis nation and this Congress to its core--as did the school shootings \nin Jonesboro, Arkansas; West Paducah, Kentucky; Pearl, Mississippi; \nSpringfield, Oregon; and Edinboro, Pennsylvania. And in my own state of \nCalifornia, we saw a hateful bigot kill a\n\n[[Page S2311]]\n\npostal worker and then wound five others at the North Valley Jewish \nCommunity Center in Granada Hills.\n  Those incidents were tragic. But countless incidents go relatively \nunreported, but with equally tragic results. Every day in this country, \nanother dozen children die of gunshot wounds.\n  A new study published in the April issue of the American Journal of \nPublic Health found that over a third of American children live in a \nhome where there is also a gun--in 43% of those homes, the firearm is \nstored unlocked.\n  Who knows how may lives could be saved if trigger locks were made \navailable to gun owners?\n  The pictures of those young children in Granada Hills being led away \nfrom the scene of the tragedy were not only heart-wrenching but also \nclearly depicted the trickle-down of gun crimes in this country. The \nvictims of gun violence get younger, and younger.\n  We must close the gun law loopholes for those children.\n  We must pass the juvenile justice bill so that we can at least begin \nthe process of solving some of these problems.\n  We must pass this bill for the fifth grader from San Francisco who \nwrote me that ``One day I saw a neighbor of mine get shot on her way to \nthe candy house. She got shot 4 times. She got shot 3 times in her side \nand once in her leg. Now she's paralyzed for life. That really hurt me \nand a lot of other people. She was only 12 years old and she was a nice \nlittle girl.''\n  We should pass this bill for the other fifth grader who told me \n``every year I hear at least 20 gunshots. I am scared at night because \nI think it's going to be a drive-by. I even sometimes can't go outside \nto recess because gunshots are heard.''\n  We must pass this bill for the little girl who wrote me that ``I do \nnot like to be locked in my room just because my mom feels I can't be \nsafe in my own neighborhood and I think everybody deserves to live just \nlike human beings.''\n  We must pass this bill so that the next six year old child who \ndecides to seek revenge on a classmate is not able to find a gun so \neasily.\n  And so that the next kindergartner who gets a timeout from the \nteacher and tries to bring his grandfather's gun to school the next day \nto get revenge is likewise left without a weapon.\n  I say, enough is enough. The least this Congress can do is turn to \nthe juvenile justice bill and move forward with the Senate-passed gun \nprovisions. These provisions are no-brainers. And there is no excuse \nfor inaction.\n  Before I conclude, I want to talk briefly about the problem of gang \nviolence in this country. This is a problem that I have taken seriously \nfor many years--every since my days on the San Francisco County Board \nof Supervisors and as Mayor for 9 years when I worked to create the \ncity's first anti-gang task force after the infamous gang massacre at \nthe Golden Dragon Restaurant in 1977. In those shooting, gang members \nkilled five people, including two tourists, and injured 11 others.\n  For the last 4 years in the Senate, I have worked with Senator Hatch \nto craft national legislation giving law enforcement the tools they \nneed to fight gang crime and gang violence.\n  Criminal youth gangs have become a national problem, extending their \nvirulent reach and bringing with them murder, drive-by shootings, drug \nsales, intimidation, and destruction of theft of property.\n  Gangs plague more than 4,700 cities in all 50 states.\n  There are some 25,000 gangs with over 650,000 members, and the \nproblem continues to spread.\n  In Los Angeles, for example, there are currently 408 gangs with more \nthan 64,000 members. This is 15,000 more members than 10 years ago.\n  That means that there are currently more gang members in L.A. alone \nthan there are people in most of America's cities and towns. For \ninstance, the number of gang members in L.A. is almost double the \npopulation of the largest city in Vermont.\n  And these gang members do not stay in California. The state \n``exports'' more gang members than any other state.\n  For instance, two of the largest gangs, the Bloods and Crips--with \nmore than 60,000 members--are based in Southern California, but operate \nin more than 119 cities in the West and Midwest. In fact, one recent \nsurvey found gangs claiming affiliation with the Bloods and/or Crips in \n180 cities in 42 states. (Department of Justice)\n  The mere existence of gangs is a terrible social problem. Gang \nmembers are far more likely to commit crimes than non-gang youths, even \nthose who may have grown up under similar circumstances.\n  This is especially true for homicides; drive-by shootings; using, \nselling, and stealing drugs; auto theft; carrying concealed weapons in \nschool; and intimidating or assaulting victims and witnesses.\n  In fact, the Los Angeles Police Department has told me that almost \nhalf of violent crime in the city is committed by gang members.\n  And the problem is just as acute in other cities, big and small. Just \na few months ago in my home city of San Francisco, for example, an \ninnocent bystander was caught in the crossfire between two warring \ngangs in the Mission District. He was shot through both legs and may be \ncrippled for life. A brave witness assisted police in apprehending the \nperpetrators. But gang members later cornered the witness, held a \nautomatic gun to his head and threatened to blow his head off if he \ncontinued to help the police.\n  Also, recently in San Francisco, gang members stuck an assault weapon \nin the face of a victim in an attempted robbery. When the victim \nresisted, he was shot 17 times. The victim survived but will never walk \nagain.\n  Let me give some specifics about gang-sponsored violent crime.\n  Killings: Around the country, every year, gang members kill over \n3,000 people. Last year in Los Angeles alone, there were 136 gang-\nrelated killings.\n  Drugs: A survey of law enforcement agencies suggests that about 75% \nof gang members are involved in illegal drug sales; that about one-\nthird of gangs are organized specifically for the purpose of \ntrafficking in drugs; and that gangs make over 30% of crack cocaine and \nmarijuana sales. (Department of Justice)\n  Guns: Ninety percent of gang members report that their fellow gang \nmembers carry concealed weapons and 80% report that those members had \ntaken guns to school. Worse, the study showed that gang members favor \npowerful, lethal weapons over smaller caliber handguns. (Ohio State \nUniversity study).\n  The Senate-passed juvenile justice bill includes a number of key \nmeasures to address this complex problem. The bill:\n  Provides $100 million annually in federal aid for certain intense \ngang activity areas, so those communities can afford to create joint \ntask forces with federal and local law enforcement and to support \ncommunity gang prevention efforts;\n  Increases sentences for interstate drug gang activity;\n  Makes it a Federal offense to recruit youngsters into a gang;\n  Enables Federal law enforcement to prosecute gangs who cross state \nlines to commit gang crimes such as drive-by shootings; and\n  Increases penalties for transferring handguns to minors.\n  Since we passed the juvenile justice bill last May, an estimated \n30,000 people have died from gunshot wounds, including 3,700 children.\n  If history is any judge, millions of large capacity ammunition \nfeeding devices have been approved for import--in the year preceding \nthe juvenile justice bill, more than 11 million of those clips were \napproved.\n  All of the commonsense gun, gang, and other provisions in the \njuvenile justice bill are now at risk of disappearing without a trace, \nand I urge the majority to proceed with the conference and come to a \ncompromise.\n  The compromise should preserve intact the Senate-passed gun control \nlegislation, which represents the bare minimum we should do this year \nto stem the gun violence that is increasingly common on our streets and \nin our schools.\n  I also urge this body to pass the President's gun enforcement \ninitiative. That initiative, which will fund more than 500 new ATF \nagents and 1,000 new prosecutors, is vital to the enforcement of our \ncurrent gun laws.\n  The crisis of leadership has come to a head. It is time for this \nCongress to take serious and bipartisan steps to stem the tide of youth \nand gun violence that continues to plague this nation.\n\n[[Page S2312]]\n\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes off the resolution to the \nranking member of the Budget Committee, Senator Lautenberg, to speak on \nthe Reed amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will try to consolidate my remarks \nbecause I know everybody is anxious to complete work on the budget \nresolution.\n  I am compelled, as I listen to the discussion here, to talk to the \nReed amendment and to talk to those who would disparage our efforts to \nhave sensible gun violence control in this society.\n  I heard it said that what we need in law enforcement is more \nenforcement; that what we need is a more sincere effort, as if to imply \nthat President Clinton and his administration want to let criminals \nwander the streets. It is somewhat akin to the argument we hear from \nthose who are NRA spokespersons who say President Clinton is looking \nfor more killings to make his political case. It is an outrageous \nthing. We hear that all we have to do is note how many laws are on the \nbooks.\n  I ask the question: Is the deciding factor how many laws we have on \nthe books?\n  I heard someone say today we have 20,000 laws on the books related to \nguns. But in this country we kill more than 20,000 a year with guns. We \nkill over 30,000. That is only a page per victim, if you want to judge \nit on that basis. It is outrageous.\n  That is not the problem. The problem is that people here don't \nbelieve guns kill. People here don't believe a gun is a lethal weapon. \nPeople here don't believe we ought to know who it is who buys a gun at \na gun show. That is the problem.\n  This morning, I had the privilege of standing with Senator Reed and \nthe head of the State police department from Maryland. What he was \nadvocating was more law enforcement, more laws to give them the tools \nto work with.\n  We had police officers from the area around Providence, RI. They were \nasking the same thing. They said, give us the tools. It is said, you \nhave enough tools, like the weight of the number of the bills, the \nnumbers of pieces of legislation that you have--again, as if that were \nthe yardstick by which we measure the performance of the society.\n  Go tell the parents of the kids who were killed in Columbine or those \nwho stood in prayer in Fort Worth, TX, or the kids who attended the \nschool in Los Angeles who ran away in fear of a gunman's weapon or in \nConyers, GA. Tell those families we have enough laws on the books. Tell \nthem we don't enforce the laws sufficiently--that they will accept that \nas OK. Well, then I can understand the sacrifice that was made in my \nfamily, my home, and the school.\n  I said earlier today that we have a Million Mom March headed for \nWashington on May 14 this year--a million women from across the \ncountry. What are they saying to us? They are saying to us, if you \nreally want to protect women's rights, then tell us our children can go \nto school, enter the school safely, and leave in the same condition at \nthe end of the day.\n  These are hollow arguments.\n  I hear that we don't prosecute enough.\n  In 1996, there were 22 percent more criminals behind bars for weapons \noffenses than in 1992. Firearms crimes put 25,000-plus in jail in 1996 \ncompared to 20,681 in 1992.\n  Prosecutions were up 16 percent in 1996 compared to 1992.\n  In 1992, there were 4,754 Federal firearm prosecutions; 1999, 5,500.\n  The argument misses the point when it comes to talking about law \nenforcement, when in some cases there is no law to enforce. Anybody can \nwalk up at a gun show, go to an unlicensed dealer--an unlicensed dealer \ncan operate in most gun shows, and he is kind of the piggy bank for \nthose who want to escape identity--put their money on the table, and he \nwon't ask them a question. He just gives them as many guns as they can \ncarry, or maybe more than they can carry, in one trip if they want to \nbuy them. Whether you are on the Ten Most Wanted list or you are Osama \nbin Laden, a terrorist who took refuge in Afghanistan, it doesn't \nmatter; you can buy a gun.\n\n  We are trying to defend in some peculiar way the right of people to \nbuy guns anonymously. We don't know who they are; we don't know where \nthey are taking the guns. We do know in the Columbine killing, a young \nwoman related to that killing testified before the Colorado \nLegislature. Robyn Anderson testified she and the two boys, Eric Harris \nand Dylan Klebold who killed the other students, went to the Tanner gun \nshow on a Saturday. She testified:\n\n       I remember this as being November or December of 1998. When \n     Eric and Dylan had gone the previous day, a dealer told them \n     they needed to bring someone back who was 18. They were both \n     17 at the time. This was a private--not a licensed dealer. \n     While we were walking around Eric and Dylan kept asking \n     sellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy \n     their guns from someone who was private--and not licensed--\n     because there would be no paperwork or background check.\n       They bought guns from three sellers. They were all private. \n     They paid cash. There was no receipt. I was not asked any \n     questions at all. There was no background check. All I had to \n     do was show my driver's license to prove I was 18. Dylan got \n     a shotgun. Eric got a shotgun and a black rifle that he \n     bought clips for.\n\n  The rest, unfortunately, is history. She says:\n\n       I don't know if Eric and Dylan could have been able to get \n     guns from another source, but I would not have helped them. \n     It was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I \n     wouldn't have helped them to buy the guns if I faced a \n     background check.\n\n  We may need a couple more laws. Despite the fact there are some \n20,000 on the books, that hasn't protected approximately 33,000 who \nlose their lives every year. There are 13,000 homicides, a bunch to \nsuicides, a bunch to accidents.\n  I think the ultimate example of carelessness with guns in our society \nwas when the 6-year-old killed the 6-year-old in Michigan. The gun was \nleft out casually where the child could reach it. Shouldn't we have \nlaws that say a person who owns a gun is responsible for keeping it out \nof the hands of children? I certainly think so.\n  We are finding the NRA has a broad reach. It reaches into this \nChamber. The hand of the NRA muffles sound. It muffles the sound of \ntearful parents--not necessarily those who lost children but those who \nare afraid their children might get lost. Those are the sounds we hear, \nthe parents and the grandparents who are saying, in poll after poll: \nFor crying out loud, close that loophole; close that gun show loophole.\n  It is common sense. It doesn't make sense to the gun lobby because \nthey are afraid one inch is a yard. It is ridiculous when we are \ntalking about human lives.\n  I agree with the Senator from New Mexico that we are doing some silly \nthings. But the silliest is to defend against some sensible gun \nlegislation. Ask the people around the country. I know what they want \nto see. They want their kids protected, their households protected, \ntheir communities protected.\n  One thing we have yet to try in this country is to know who owns guns \nand where the guns will be. We had an incredible battle some years ago \nwhen we tried to put the Brady law into place. It is demonstrated on \nthis placard: Gun show loophole goes right through the Brady law. Under \nBrady, 400,000 people, judged not fit to own a gun, were denied gun \npermits. We still argue about whether or not there is enough time to \ncheck applicants' backgrounds sufficiently to make sure they are not \nunfit to own a gun. They want to reduce the time from 3 business days \nto 24 hours. The FBI will tell you; they are out there hunting for \n1,500 guns that were sold improperly because they didn't have time to \ncheck the information.\n\n  As we near the close of this debate on a budget resolution, citizens \nacross this country should be aware not only did we work on the \nnumbers, not only did we work on the resources, not only did we work on \nthe guns, we also worked on protecting your children when they go to \nschool. We know the costs that guns have exacted on our society. Yet we \ncannot pass sensible gun legislation.\n  I commend the Senator from Rhode Island for his amendment. I \nsincerely hope we can get past the partisan discussion and look into \nthe faces of the families, distant though they are, listen to the pleas \nof the mothers, the fathers, the grandfathers, grandmothers,\n\n[[Page S2313]]\n\nbrothers, and sisters and say we have done the right thing--we have \ntried to reduce gun violence in our society.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished minority whip \nfor his tremendous cooperation. Without his help and cooperation, we \nwouldn't be where we are. We might, indeed, get this budget resolution \nfinished. Many thanks for that go to Senator Reid.\n  In the interest of orderliness, I ask consent that all first-degree \namendments to the pending budget resolution be submitted at the desk by \n7 p.m. this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Members, for first-degree amendments, walk up and file \nthem. You don't have to stand on the floor. Just give them to the clerk \nso we can have a list of all of them filed and they will have a number \nand we can work with them in an orderly fashion to finish this task.\n  I also ask any subsequent second-degree amendments offered from the \nfloor must be relevant to the first-degree amendment that they are \namending.\n  Mr. REID. It would be tremendously helpful, especially to the staff, \nif after the amendment is filed at the desk there be a copy left with \nboth managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think that is an excellent suggestion. We will \nunderstand where we are.\n  On behalf of the leader, let me one more time say any Member who has \nnot submitted their first-degree amendment at the desk must do so by 7 \np.m. in order for it to be available to be called up for consideration \nduring the remainder of the budget resolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the time on the Reed amendment, I \noffer 10 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina to speak about his \neducation amendment or on whatever else he chooses to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note the presence of the Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer.\n  During the debate on this ANWR amendment, the distinguished Senator \nstated this was the first budget resolution that ever addressed ANWR, \nand in the meantime called it an antienvironment resolution.\n  I clarify, and I think she agrees, that in 1996 in the budget \nresolution we not only referred to ANWR but we reconciled the ANWR \ninstruction to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I wonder if \nthe Senator would acknowledge that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I absolutely acknowledge it and state that was one of the \nreasons the President vetoed that legislation and we beat it back. We \nwill have this fight again. My friend is absolutely right. It is the \nsecond time that ANWR was put into a budget resolution. He is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Since we are clarifying the record, could I ask the \nSenator from California whether or not she discussed the photograph \nthat she displayed on the floor?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, we have gotten confirmation. This has to do with \nSenator Murkowski. We have gotten confirmation from the biologist who \ntook that photo, that that photo is in the proposed ruling area, and he \nhas sent us chapter and verse of exactly where he was.\n  Senator Domenici is correct, this is the second time we had this in. \nWe beat it back the last time, and I hope we can beat it back this \ntime.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Edwards, the Senator from North Carolina, is to be \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, first I would like to speak on the Graham \namendment. The single most important thing we do as a country is \neducate our children. What we should be doing in this debate is talking \nabout making this decade the education decade. We have great roads, \ngreat technology, great airports, a great economy in this country. We \nshould be working toward making our schools the envy of the world. \nInstead, we have children who go to the local mall and go to beautiful, \nshiny buildings and stores and then the next morning go to schools that \nare falling down, with roofs leaking, with floors that are covered over \nwith patchwork carpet. We have to do better.\n  We need to send a clear and unmistakable signal to the American \npeople that we are committed and dedicated to doing what is necessary \nto improve our public schools. I have filed a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment that provides for two things: First, that the level of \neducation spending will be maintained at the current level, taking \ninflation into account over the next 10 years. Second, that we commit a \nminimum of 10 percent of the non-Social Security surplus to spending on \neducation.\n  It is a very simple resolution. It is intended to signal our \ncommitment to do what is necessary to support our public schools. I \nalso, though, want to speak about the Graham amendment which does some \nvery important things that need to be done in our public schools. There \nare basically five components to the Graham amendment.\n  No. 1, it invests the resources that are so desperately needed in our \neducation system; resources that can be used to rebuild crumbling \nschools; resources that can be used to modernize schools where the roof \nis leaking, where kids have to go outside to get to the restroom, where \nkids are going to school in mobile classrooms. Those resources are \ndesperately needed. We need to show our commitment, and the Graham \namendment does that.\n  No. 2, it provides for local control. Those of us supporting this \namendment believe very strongly that the school system should not be \nrun from Washington, DC; that, instead, our schools should be run at \nthe local level. It is local folks who know what is needed in the local \nschools. That is where the control should be. That is what the Graham \namendment provides. That is what the American people believe in and \nsupport.\n  No. 3, accountability. Senator Graham talked about accountability. We \ncannot simply continue throwing money at our education system. We need \nto provide those systems with the resources they need for all the \nthings we have talked about: crumbling schools, technology, afterschool \nprograms, hiring more teachers, and reducing class size so the teachers \ncan do their jobs.\n  But we need to hold these schools accountable. We need to make sure \nthey are performing; that schools that are not doing well are \nimproving; that kids who are going to schools that are not performing \nwell will be getting the kind of education they need and deserve. \nAccountability is absolutely crucial to making our public education \nsystem work. The Graham amendment provides for accountability. It is a \ncritical component of what needs to be done in our education system in \nthis country.\n  No. 4, this amendment targets those kids who are most in need, the \nkids in this country who are having the most problems in the poorest \nareas, in the rural areas, particularly in places such as rural North \nCarolina, rural eastern and western North Carolina--chronically \neconomically disadvantaged areas where the kids are not on a level \nplaying field. They do not have a chance. They do not have self-esteem. \nThey don't feel as if they can compete with kids who go to school in \nricher, urban areas.\n\n  We need to give these children a chance. We need to put them on the \nlaunching pad with all other children so they can compete. That is what \nthis amendment does. It targets the money to those kids who most need \nthe help.\n  Finally, it takes the resources that we are providing them and \nfocuses those resources in the places where they will do the most good.\n  So these five components are things that all will go toward improving \nour public school system: more resources; local control where we want \nthe control to be; accountability, holding school systems responsible \nfor performing; making sure the resources are focused; and making sure \nthey are targeted at those kids who are most in need.\n  We need to show, in this body, that we are committed to the single \nmost important thing we do in this country, which is educating our \nkids.\n\n[[Page S2314]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. \nLincoln, 5 minutes off the resolution; and yield 5 minutes off of the \namendment to the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in strong support of \nthe amendment by my good friend, Senator Bob Graham. There are several \nof us in this body who have come together to build a consensus of a \ncommonsense, result-oriented solution to educating our children in this \nNation. This amendment combines two concepts that are essential to \nimproving our system of public education--greater investment and tough \naccountability standards.\n\n  Now Mr. President, before I get into the details of why this \namendment is so important, I think we have to take a minute to consider \nthe current state of education in this country.\n  I am not sure how the rest of my colleagues feel, but I think it is \ndifficult to deny that the status quo in our education system is simply \nnot acceptable. It is not working, and we are not doing a good enough \njob in educating our children. We are certainly not doing the best job \nwe could be doing.\n  And if we think things are bad now, we should stop and look 10 or 15 \nyears into the future. I continue to be amazed at the pace of high-tech \ndevelopment in this country and the incredible advancements that take \nplace every day. This progress is only going to continue, and our \nchildren are the ones who will be left behind in the global high-tech \nworld.\n  If we do not do something to change the way we approach education, if \nwe do not increase our Federal investment and demand more \naccountability from our system and our educators, then we are only \nfooling ourselves, and we are cheating our children.\n  Our children are our greatest national resource, and their education \nis worthy of a significant investment. Unfortunately, the budget \nresolution before us today once again falls short of our responsibility \nto make quality education a top priority in this Nation.\n  Under the budget resolution before us, Arkansas would receive $6.6 \nmillion less in title I funds than it would under the administration's \nplan. That means more than 10,000 students in my home State would be \ndenied the critical support this program provides.\n  In addition to the annual budget, we in the Senate have the difficult \ntask before us this year of passing legislation that reauthorizes the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  Quite frankly, we need a bold new approach that targets resources to \nthe neediest areas, puts decisions in the hands of local educators, and \nmaintains national priorities like school safety and educational \ntechnology.\n  I have joined with a group of my moderate Democratic colleagues in \nthe Senate to promote a ``Third Way'' on ESEA, one that synthesizes the \nbest ideas of both sides into a whole new approach to federal education \npolicy.\n  Like our ``Three Rs'' bill, the additional funding contained in this \namendment would allow schools to raise student achievement, implement \neffective professional development programs for teachers, improve \nEnglish language instruction and encourage innovation in the classroom.\n  This investment is especially important to rural school districts, \nlike many of those in Arkansas, that cannot afford to meet all of their \nneeds with limited local resources.\n  We must do more than just throw more money at the problem of under-\nachievement in the classroom. We also must demand results.\n  To qualify for additional funding under this amendment, educational \nproposals authorized by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nwould have to contain greater accountability; incentives to set high \nstudent achievement standards; an emphasis on education for \ndisadvantaged students; and funding targeted to our neediest, most \nimpoverished schools.\n  Congress must do all it can to help our schools meet the challenges \nthey face today and will face in the future.\n  Our most important responsibility is to help States and local school \ndistricts raise academic achievement and deliver on the promise of \nequal opportunity for all students.\n  I believe in the children of this country. I believe that through \nthis amendment, we can truly make a difference by making a bigger \ninvestment and setting our children's education as one of our top \nnational priorities. I urge the support of this amendment, and I thank \nmy colleagues for their attention. I yield back any remaining time I \nmay have to the Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we still have time left under our amendment. \nWe have 8 more minutes before the other side can offer an amendment. I \nyield 3 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut to speak on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, with deference to my friend and \ncolleague from Louisiana, I am going to be brief.\n  Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by my \ncolleague, Senator Graham. This amendment would set aside and protect \n$15 billion over the next five years, holding funds in reserve so that \nresources are available once legislation reuathorizing ESEA is enacted. \nThe amendment adds that to qualify for funds, ESEA reauthorization must \ncontain a few fundamental elements: (1) increased accountability; (2) \nthe ability of States and localities to set high student performance \nstandards; (3) the targeting of funds to the most impoverished areas \nand schools most in need of improvement; and (4) the concentration of \nFederal resources on key national goals of compensatory education for \ndisadvantaged children, teacher quality, innovative education \nstrategies, serving limited English proficient students, student \nsafety, and educational technology.\n  During the upcoming debate on ESEA, I will join with several of my \ncolleagues in offering a new approach that meets these qualifications. \nIt is an approach that would refocus our national policy on helping \nStates and local school districts raise academic achievement for all \nchildren, putting the priority for Federal programs on performance \ninstead of process, and on delivering results instead of developing \nrules. Our approach calls on States and local districts to enter into a \nnew compact with the Federal Government to work together to strengthen \nstandards and improve educational opportunities, particularly for \nAmerica's poorest children. It would provide States and local educators \nwith significantly more Federal funding and significantly more \nflexibility in targeting aid to meet the specific needs. In exchange; \nit would demand real accountability, and for the first time impose \nconsequences on schools that continually fail to show progress.\n  In order to implement effective educational policy, we have to first \nrecognize that there are serious problems with the performance of many \npublic schools, and that public confidence in public education will \ncontinue to erode if we do not acknowledge and address those problems \nsoon. While student achievement is up, we must realize the alarming \nachievement gap that separates minorities from whites and low-income \nstudents from their more affluent counterparts. According to the State-\nby-State reading scores of fourth graders on the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress, the achievement gap between African American and \nwhite students grew in 16 States between 1992 and 1998. The gap between \nHispanic and white students grew in nine States over the same period of \ntime. Most alarmingly, student data reveals that the average African-\nAmerican and Latino 17-year-old has about the same reading and math \nskills as the average white 13-year-old.\n  We must also question whether our schools are adequately preparing \nour youth to enter the globally competitive market place when, as one \nreport states, ``Students are being unconsciously eliminated from the \ncandidate pool of Information Technology (IT) workers by the knowledge \nand attitudes in their K-12 years. Many students do not learn the basic \nskills of reasoning, mathematics and communication that provide the \nfoundation for higher education or entry-level jobs in IT work.''\n\n[[Page S2315]]\n\n  We also have to acknowledge that we have done a very good job in \nrecent years in providing every child with a well-qualified teacher, a \ncritical component to higher student achievement. We are failing to \ndeliver teachers to the classroom who truly know their subject matter--\none national survey found that one-fourth of all secondary school \nteachers did not major in their core area of instruction, and that in \nthe school districts with the highest concentration of minorities, \nstudents have less than a 50 percent chance of getting a math or \nscience teacher who has a license or a degree in their field.\n\n  While more money alone will not solve our problems, we cannot \nhonestly expect to reinvent our schools without it either. The reality \nis that there is a tremendous need for additional investment in our \npublic schools, not just in urban areas but in every kind of community. \nNot only are thousands of crumbling and overcrowded schools in need of \nmodernization, but a looming shortage of two million new teachers to \nhire and train lurks on the horizon. Add to this, billions in spiraling \nspecial education costs to meet.\n  We also have to recognize the basic math of trying to raise standards \nat a time of profound social turbulence that we will need to expend new \nsums to reach and teach children who in the past we never asked to \nexcel, and who in the present will have to overcome enormous hurdles to \ndo so. At the same time that schools are trying to cope with new and \ncomplex societal changes, we are demanding that they teach more than \nthey ever have before. Employers and parents alike what better \nteachers, stronger standards, and higher test scores for all students, \nas well as state-of-the-art technology and skills to match.\n  It is a tribute to the many dedicated men and women who are \nresponsible for teaching our children that the bulk of our schools are \nas good as they are, in light of these intensifying pressures. I \nbelieve any child can learn--any child--and that has been proven over \nand over again in the best schools in both my home state of Connecticut \nand in many of America's cities.\n  There are, in fact, plenty of positives to highlight in public \neducation today, which is something else that we have to acknowledge, \nyet too often do not. I have made a concerted effort over the last few \nyears to visit a broad range of schools and programs in Connecticut, \nand I can tell you that there is much happening in our public schools \nthat we can be heartened by, proud of, and learn from.\n  There is the exemplary John Barry Elementary School in Meriden, CT, \nwhich has to contend with a high-poverty, high-mobility student \npopulation, but through intervention programs has had real success \nimproving the reading skills of many of its students. In addition, \nthere is the Side by Side Charter School in Norwalk, one of 17 charter \nschools in Connecticut, which has created an exemplary multiracial \nprogram in response to the challenge of Sheff v. O'Neill to diminish \nracial isolation. Side by Side is experimenting with a different \napproach to classroom assignments, having students stay with teachers \nfor two consecutive years to take advantage of the relationships that \ndevelop, and by all indications it is working quite well for those \nkids.\n  And there is the BEST program, which, building on previous efforts to \nraise teacher skills and salaries, is now targeting additional state \naid, training, and mentoring support to help local districts nurture \nnew teachers and prepare them to excel. The result is that \nConnecticut's blueprint is touted by some, including the National \nCommission on Teaching and America's Future, as a national model for \nothers to follow.\n  A number of other States, led by Texas and North Carolina, are moving \nin this same direction--refocusing their education systems not on \nprocess but on performance, not on prescriptive rules and regulations \nbut on results. More and more of them are in fact adopting what might \nbe called a ``reinvest, reinvent, and responsibility'' strategy, by (1) \ninfusing new resources into their public education systems; (2) giving \nlocal districts more flexibility; and (3) demanding new measures and \nmechanisms of accountability, to increase the chances that \nthese investments will yield the intended return, meaning improved \nacademic achievement for all students.\n\n  To ensure that more States and localities have the ability to build \non these successes and prepare student to succeed in the classroom, we \nmust invest more resources. That is why we would boost ESEA funding by \n$35 billion over the next five years. But we also believe that the \nimpact of this funding will be severely diluted if it is not better \ntargeted to the worst-performing schools and if it is not coupled with \na demand for results. That is why we not only increase Title I funding \nby 50 percent, but use a more targeted formula for distributing these \nnew dollars to schools with the highest concentrations of poverty. And \nthat is why we develop a new accountability system that strips federal \nfunding from states that continually fail to meet their performance \ngoals.\n  We also agree with those concerned with the current system that \nfederal education programs are too numerous and too bureaucratic. That \nis why we eliminate dozens of federally microtargeted, micromanaged \nprograms that are redundant or incidental to our core mission of \nraising academic achievement. But we also believe that we have a great \nnational interest in promoting broad national educational goals, chief \namong them delivering on the promise of equal opportunity. It is not \nonly foolish, however, but irresponsible to hand out federal dollars \nwith no questions asked and no thought of national priorities. That is \nwhy we carve out separate titles in those areas that we think are \ncritical to helping local districts elevate the performance of their \nschools.\n  The first would enhance our longstanding commitment to providing \nextra help to disadvantaged children through the title I program, while \nbetter targeting $12 billion in aid--a 50 percent increase in funding--\nto schools with the highest concentrations of poor students. The second \nwould combine various teacher training and professional development \nprograms into a single teacher quality grant, increase funding by 100 \npercent to $1.6 billion annually, and challenge each state to pursue \nthe kind of bold, performance-based reforms that my own state of \nConnecticut has undertaken with great success.\n  The third would reform the Federal bilingual education program and \nhopefully defuse the ongoing controversy surrounding it by making \nabsolutely clear that our national mission is to help immigrant \nchildren learn and master English, as well as achieve high levels of \nachievement in all subjects. We must be willing to back this commitment \nwith essential resources required to help ensure that all limited \nEnglish proficient students are served.\n  Under our approach, funding for LEP programs would be more than \ndoubled to $1 billion a year, and for the first time be distributed to \nstates and local districts through a reliable formula, based on their \nLEP student population. As a result, school districts serving large LEP \nand high poverty student populations would be guaranteed federal \nfunding, and would not be penalized because of their inability to hire \nsavvy proposal writers for competitive grants.\n  The fourth would respond to the public demands for greater choice \nwithin the public school framework, by providing additional resources \nfor charter school start-ups and new incentives for expanding local, \nintradistrict choice programs. And the fifth would radically \nrestructure the remaining ESEA and ensure that funds are much better \ntargeted while giving local districts greater flexibility in addressing \nspecific needs. We consolidate more than 20 different programs into a \nsingle High Performance Initiatives title, with a focus on supporting \nbold new ideas, expanding access to summer school and after school \nprograms, improving school safety, and building technological literacy. \nWe increase overall funding by more than $200 million, and distribute \nthis aid through a formula that targets more resources to the highest \npoverty areas.\n\n  The boldest change we are proposing is to create a new accountability \ntitle. As of today, we have plenty of rules and requirements on inputs, \non how funding is to be allocated and who must be served, but little if \nany attention to outcomes, on how schools ultimately perform in \neducating children. This bill would reverse that imbalance\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\nby linking Federal funding to the progress States and local districts \nmake in raising academic achievement. It would call on State and local \nleaders to set specific performance standards and adopt rigorous \nassessments for measuring how each district is faring in meeting those \ngoals. In turn, States that exceed those goals would be rewarded with \nadditional funds, and those that fail repeatedly to show progress would \nbe penalized. In other words, for the first time, there would be \nconsequences for poor performance.\n  In discussing how exactly to impose those consequences, we have run \ninto understandable concerns about whether you can penalize failing \nschools without also penalizing children. The truth is that we are \npunishing many children right now, especially the most vulnerable of \nthem, by forcing them to attend chronically troubled schools that are \naccountable to no one, a situation that is just not acceptable anymore. \nThis bill minimizes the potential negative impact of these consequences \non students. It provides the States with three years to set their \nperformance-based goals and put in place a monitoring system for \ngauging how local districts are progressing, and also provides \nadditional resources for States to help school districts identify and \nimprove low-performing schools. If after those three years a State is \nstill failing to meet its goals, the State would be penalized by \ncutting its administrative funding by 50 percent. Only after 4 years of \nunder performance would dollars targeted for the classroom be put in \njeopardy. At that point, protecting kids by continuing to subsidize bad \nschools becomes more like punishing them.\n  I must address another concern that may be raised that this is a \nblock grant in sheep's clothing. There are substantial differences \nbetween a straight block-grant approach and this streamlined structure. \nFirst, in most block-grant proposals the accountability mechanisms are \nvague, weak and often non-existent, which is one reason why I have \nopposed them in the Senate. Our bill would have tangible consequences, \npegged not just to raise test scores in the more affluent suburban \nareas, but to closing the troubling achievement gap between students in \npoor, largely minority districts and their better-off peers.\n  It is a commonsense strategy--reinvest in our public schools, \nreinvent the way we administer them, and restore a sense of \nresponsibility to the children we are supposed to be serving. Hence the \ntitle of our bill: the Public Education Reinvention, Reinvestment, and \nResponsibility Act, or the Three Rs for short. Our approach is humble \nenough to recognize there are no easy answers to turning around low-\nperforming schools, to lifting teaching standards, to closing the \ndebilitating achievement gap, and that most of those answers won't be \nfound here in Washington anyway. But it is ambitious enough to try to \nharness our unique ability to set the national agenda and recast the \nfederal government as an active catalyst for success instead of a \npassive enabler of failure.\n  I am pleased to support the Graham amendment which will ensure we \nhave the necessary resources in reserve to provide for the kind of \neducation reform that I have outlined. Reauthorization of the status \nquo is not the answer. We need real reform that concentrates resources \naround central national goals, targets those resources to the most \nimpoverished areas and schools in greatest need, and holds States and \nlocalities to a new, higher standard of accountability for results in \nraising student academic achievement.\n  I am pleased to support the Graham amendment which will ensure we \nhave the necessary resources in reserve to provide for the kind of \neducation reform that I have outlined. Reauthorization of the status \nquo is not the answer. We need real reform that concentrates resources \naround central national goals, targets those resources to the most \nimpoverished areas and schools in greatest need, and holds States and \nlocalities to a new, higher standard of accountability for results in \nraising student academic achievement.\n  I am very grateful for the strong statements that have been made by \nmy colleagues in support of this amendment by Senator Graham. This \namendment is, in a sense, our first statement of support for a major \nreform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which we intend \nto offer when that act comes before the Senate in May.\n  There are two facts to state about the Federal role in education and \nwhat is happening throughout the country.\n  The first is that we have not achieved what the ESEA was adopted to \nachieve in 1965, and that is to close the academic achievement gap \nbetween advantaged and disadvantaged children. The proposal that I will \noffer, along with Senators Bayh, Landrieu, Lincoln, Kohl, Graham, Robb, \nand Breaux, is aimed at investing more money in the education of \ndisadvantaged children while giving local authorities the flexibility \nto set achievement goals and decide what they think is the best way to \nachieve them, and then to hold them accountable for producing \nmeasurable results. It will reward those who succeed and, for the first \ntime ever, impose real consequences on those who do not.\n  The second reality in American education today is that there are also \ncases of magnificent reform happening at the local and State level, \nwhich we must recognize. These success stories include many of the same \nelements--more accountability, more innovation, more public school \nchoice, higher teaching standards, and superb work by great teachers \nand school administrators.\n  Our proposal will streamline more than 40 current ESEA programs into \nfive performance-based grants that will support and expand these reform \nefforts that are occurring at the grassroots level in America. It is a \ncommon sense proposal built upon the core principles of reinvestment, \nreinvention, and responsibility that will finally provide the full, \ndecent, and equal education we want for all our children, and the \neducational reform that our children need.\n  I thank my friend and colleague from Florida for offering this \namendment. We have a very strong working group in favor of reform. We \nhope this proposal not only represents innovation and change that will \nbe a catalyst for broad-scale national education reform, but that it \nwill constitute a bridge on which Members of both parties can meet in \nthe Senate to accomplish the most sweeping reform of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act in its 35-year history.\n  I thank the Chair and my friend from Nevada, and particularly my \npatient and learned friend from Louisiana. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Graham \namendment. I acknowledge the very helpful comments made by my colleague \nfrom Connecticut and others who have spoken about this amendment.\n  I realize my time is short. I would like to begin by saying that in \n1965, when President Lyndon Johnson first signed the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, it was 32 pages long with 5 program titles. \nToday, the bill is over 1,000 pages and contains over 60 programs. We \nneed to get back to basics, and that is what the Graham amendment is \nabout.\n  If these 1,000 pages of rules, regulations were working. If \nmicromanagement of these 60 programs is the answer, then we should be \nsatisfied with the status quo. A few minutes ago, my colleague from \nArkansas spoke about what the status quo means for our children. I rise \nto urge my colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, to say no to the \nstatus quo.\n  As the Senator from Connecticut, our leader on this issue, has \nacknowledged, there are many wonderful schools and many wonderful \nteachers, and some wonderful superintendents and active parents. The \nproblem is they are becoming the exception rather than the rule. Let me \njust share just a few startling and disturbing statistics.\n  In many school districts, 40-, 50-, or 60-percent failure rates are \nthe rule, not the exception to the rule.\n  Every day in America, 2,806 children drop out of the school system \nbecause it is not working for them.\n  According to the National Education Goals Report, 80 percent of our \nfourth graders scored below proficient in math and 70 percent scored \nbelow proficient in reading.\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\n  For every 100 children who start kindergarten each year, only 27 \npercent eventually graduate from college.\n  If you are happy with these statistics, then do not vote for the \nGraham amendment. I, for one, cannot live with these numbers and am \nhere to insist on change for our kids.\n  Let me say that although we are all talking about change, there is \nright change and there is wrong change. There is change that gets us on \nthe right road, and there is change that takes us further away from \nwhere we want to go.\n  Some Republican leaders offer vouchers as the solution to the dilemma \nI just outlined. Those same Republican leaders also talk about block \ngrants, minimal accountability, and then waiting 5 years for results. I \npersonally do not think that is the solution.\n  On the Democratic side, unfortunately, there are many leaders who \njust want to talk about more programs, more money, more strings, more \npages, and more micromanagement. But more money and more programs are \nnot the answer.\n  The Graham amendment is about a clean break away from the old ways. \nAway from sort of the ``romance,'' if you will, of vouchers, which \nreally are an abandonment of our public schools and the children who \nneed them the most.\n  The Graham amendment says we need to talk about performance and \noutcomes. We need to minimize the paperwork, the redtape, the \nregulations. We need to help our schools set high performance \nstandards, reward them when they meet those performance standards, and \nmake sure there are serious consequences when they fail to do so.\n  We cannot have a system any longer that fails a third of our \nchildren. It is important for us to break with the past. That is what \nthis amendment attempts to do.\n  It does not do it all. There are many other steps we have to take. \nBut it is an important step. A bold step. It talks about real \naccountability. It requires that States and local districts set and \nmeet targets for boosting student performance. It will offer awards to \nthose who meet their goals and withhold funding from those who \nrepeatedly fail to do so.\n  The amendment suggests greater flexibility. It acknowldedges that the \nlocal level has the tools necessary to make these decisions and gives \nthem the power to do so. While it does not call for consolidation \nspecifically, it does call for us to concentrate our resources around \nbroad titles, including teacher quality, professional development, \nsmaller classroom sizes\n  Finally--I know I am getting to the end of my time--it increases \nfunding because it is time that we truly invest in our children's \nfuture. Derek Bok, Former President of Harvard once said, ``If you \nthink Education is expensive . . . try ignorance.''\n  I am proud to stand here and support the Graham amendment because it \nis the only way for our Nation to build the kind of foundation we need \nfor the future.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham, 3 minutes \noff the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to my colleagues \nin the Senate, our new Democrats, for having so eloquently outlined the \ngoals of our amendment and what those goals represent in our vision of \nAmerican public education.\n  We believe American public education is fundamental to our Nation's \nprogress. We are going to be faced with enormous economic challenges \nfrom around the world. The only way America will be able to maintain \nits current standard of living and improve that standard for the next \ngeneration is by an investment in our people, which means an investment \nin public education.\n  We believe passionately in the importance of that. We recognize that \nthe States and local school districts have the primary responsibility, \nbut we think the Federal Government should be a meaningful and \nconstructive partner and that the principles in this amendment and the \nprinciples we will be offering when we debate the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act are critical to achieving that constructive \npartnership.\n  The most obvious thing this amendment will do--since we are talking \nabout an amendment to a budget resolution--is to reserve an additional \n$15 billion, over the next 5 years, for the purposes of the Federal \nElementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  We do that because we believe that additional amount of Federal \ncontribution, particularly with the flexibility, targeted at the most \nin-need students, with an accountability system that relates to student \nperformance in the classroom, that that investment is going to be a \nnecessary part of lifting the performance of our American students, \nespecially those who are most in need.\n  If we fail to do that, if we fail, at the Federal level, to make that \nadditional commitment to their education, I am afraid we are consigning \nthe next decade of American public education to the same critique we \nhear so much of today--that we are not doing an adequate job of \npreparing our children for the future, that we are contributing not \njust to a digital divide but to a socioeconomic divide among our \nchildren, and that those children who do not have the kind of support \nwe have traditionally associated with the family's contribution to \nchild development will continue to fall further and further behind \ntheir fellow students who are more advantaged.\n  We believe this is a pragmatic approach to a passionately held goal \nof improved American education.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Off the resolution, I yield to the Senator from Minnesota \n15 minutes. Also, I say the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, Mr. Johnson, have an outstanding amendment to be offered \nat a subsequent time. I applaud and commend them for their diligence in \nallowing us to hear the debate on this issue.\n  I yield Senator Wellstone 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, I hope Senator Johnson--I have contacted his office--\nwill be down here because I am really joining Senator Johnson who has \ntaken the lead on this amendment and has been very involved, going back \nto his work on the Budget Committee.\n  Let me, first of all, give credit where credit is due. Over the last \nseveral years, we have been fighting what is called the flatline \nbudget.\n  Last year, the administration presented to the Congress a veterans \nbudget that was woefully inadequate. This year, they have really \nsignificantly increased their investment. It is an additional $1.4 \nbillion over where they were. The Budget Committee has stuck with that. \nThat is a huge help.\n  But Senator Johnson and I have had the honor and the opportunity to \nwork with a lot of veterans organizations--the VFW, the Paralyzed \nVeterans of America, the Disabled American Veterans--who have put \ntogether an independent budget. They did this, starting last year, and \ndid a lot of good grassroots organizing around the country.\n  It went way beyond just veterans coming to Washington, DC, and \ntestifying because the message from the Congress to the veterans was: \nWe are not just interested in what you are opposed to or what you say \nyou need more money for. We want to see a careful outline.\n  This independent veterans budget is just such a budget proposal. What \nSenator Johnson has done--and I am pleased to join him--is called for \nan additional $500 million above and beyond the $1.4 billion increase \nfrom the Senate Budget Committee that would be an investment, \nespecially in veterans' health care.\n\n  We have a real challenge in veterans' health care. We talked about \nthis in our millennium bill. What we have authorized is essentially \ndecent care for a veterans population that is an aging population. We \nhave many veterans who are 75, 80 years old. What we have said--and we \nshould be looking at the whole population in this country in the same \nway--is this is a population where there are some huge gaps, some\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\nhuge needs. We need to get serious about it.\n  How can we pass legislation saying, veterans, we are going to make a \ncommitment to long-term care. We are especially going to make a \ncommitment to making sure you are not forced into nursing homes. We \nwill make a commitment to making sure that there is the support for you \nto stay at home and live at home in as near a normal circumstance as is \npossible with dignity.\n  I was in the VA medical center about a month ago. It was very \npoignant. Quite often the men are World War II veterans. They have had \na hip operation, a knee operation. If you spend any time out there in \nthe lounge and talk to their wives, they are scared to death about when \ntheir husbands come home because they can't take care of them any \nlonger without help. They don't know what they are going to do. Whether \nit be respite care, whether it be public health nurses within the VA \nhealth care system, we have to get serious about this.\n  The $500 million doesn't do the job, but it goes in the direction of \nhaving a veterans budget that is an honest-to-God response to the needs \nof veterans in this country.\n  In my State of Minnesota, I think the real heroes and heroines are \nthe county veterans' service officers. They are not a part of the VA, \nbut they are on the front lines of veterans' health care. They are on \nthe front lines of meeting the needs of veterans and their families. I \nhave had several meetings with these county veterans' service \nofficers--lots of people come; a lot of veterans come--who are \nadvocates for the veterans. In our State, the medical center in \nMinneapolis is really a flagship place, but veterans wait for up to 18 \nmonths for some of the specialized care they need. That is too long a \nwait. We have too long a waiting list. We have staff that are \noverworked, sometimes having to work one shift after another.\n  We have an aging veterans population. We have made the commitment in \nthe millennium bill, but we have not backed it up with the investment \nof resources. We have too high a percentage of the veterans population \nthat is a part of the homeless population. Too many of them are Vietnam \nvets, still struggling with posttraumatic stress syndrome.\n  If my colleagues have had any meetings with these vets, they know \nthey are the most poignant meetings. Quite often, veterans will be \nsitting in a room with you. People will get up and leave and come back \nand get up and leave. They are struggling; you can see it. Quite often, \nyou have substance abuse that occurs with this as well. We are not \nproviding the treatment.\n  This amendment is a terribly important amendment. I yield the rest of \nmy time to my colleague from South Dakota, Senator Johnson, who took \nthe lead on the Budget Committee. He is the one who introduced the \namendment. I am proud to be on the floor with him in partnership \npushing for this.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for a parliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have the right to call for regular \norder, but how much more time is left on this amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I think about 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 6 minutes 7 \nseconds.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Wellstone \nof Minnesota, for his extraordinary work on this issue. He has long \nbeen a champion of veterans in our Nation. I have enjoyed the \nopportunity to work with him on this and many other issues.\n  I am appreciative of Chairman Domenici's effort to secure a $1.4 \nbillion increase in outlays in the budget. We have come a considerable \ndistance from a year ago, when I was offering on this floor a $3 \nbillion increase in veterans' health care appropriations which was \nnecessary at that time to catch up after 3 years of frozen VA budgets. \nOf the $3 billion that was passed, ultimately, by the time the \nAppropriations Committee was done, we had about $1.7 billion. Even so, \nit was a significant increase. It has done a lot to breathe additional \nviability into our VA health care system.\n  This year, Senator Domenici has proposed a $1.4 billion increase. \nThat is encouraging. However, the Authoritative Independent Budget \nproduced by 40 different veterans groups and medical societies--\nincluding Amvets and Disabled American Vets, Paralyzed Veterans of \nAmerica, and the VFW--reminds us that even then we still need an \nadditional $500 million in outlays over the Budget Committee's level to \nraise the funding level to the point where it is requested in the \nindependent budget of a $1.9 billion increase for fiscal 2000. This \namendment pays for this. This amendment would get us to that needed \nlevel.\n  We need to make a fundamental decision in this body about where our \npriorities lie. We are talking now about multibillion-dollar surpluses \nin the Federal budget over the coming years. We ought to be cautious \nabout whether they materialize or not, but certainly we can be \noptimistic that we will be in black ink in the coming years.\n  The question then is, Are we going to fully fund the veterans' health \ncare programs at the level the veterans organizations themselves \ncontend--I think rightfully so--is necessary? Are we going to put them \nas a first priority honoring those people who put their lives on the \nline and made our liberties possible or are we going to fall back to \nthe point where, again, we only use the dollars that are left over \nafter other things have been done?\n  To me, this ought to be a first-priority item. We have an opportunity \non the floor this evening to make it very clear to our colleagues in \nthe other body that, in fact, veterans' health care is a first priority \nitem and that we will take care of that. When we are done with dealing \nwith veterans' health care issues, we will then move on to whatever our \nother priorities might be, whether they be tax cuts, education, health \ncare, or other matters facing the country. This ought to be at the top \nor near the top of our agenda as we debate the look of the Federal \nbudget in this coming year.\n  I applaud the constructive steps that have been taken on veterans' \nhealth care. I certainly am appreciative of the work of Senator \nWellstone in helping to raise the visibility of this issue. At this \njuncture, as we shape this budget resolution which creates a roadmap, \nwhich creates the parameters for where the appropriations committees \nwill go next, we need to send them this kind of message that, in fact, \nwe want full funding for veterans' health care.\n  This is our opportunity to make that statement. We should not let \nthis opportunity go by without making it clear that we are committed to \nthis reasonable level of funding, after those many years of frozen VA \nbudgets, that the VA requires.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2931\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Stevens amendment No. \n2931.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is the first of a series of three \namendments that deals with points of order in the budget resolution, as \nit was reported to the Senate.\n  I have the feeling that this is deja vu because every year we face \nthe same kind of concept. In the current budget resolution, for \ninstance, that we are operating on for this fiscal year, there is, in \nfact, a point of order against emergency spending that requires 60 \nvotes for emergency spending of a nondefense character. The resolution \nthat was reported to the floor extends that to cover defense spending \nalso.\n  It also has what we call a firewall that covers both budget authority \nand outlays for defense and nondefense. And it has a series of two \nother points of order that deal with delayed obligations and advance \nappropriations. Those make the management of the 13 bills our \nsubcommittees work on annually and the supplemental and emergency bills \nthat we face extremely difficult.\n  We have had a long series of conversations. I told someone I sort of \nfeel like Houdini. Every year, I get a different set of chains and the \nconfiguration of the box I am put in before I am\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\nput in the water differs, but everybody expects me to get out of it. I \nmust say to the Senate, before this year is over, you might find some \nnew approaches that help me get out of the chains. But these \nmechanisms, primarily for enforcement, ought to apply to the Senate as \na whole, not only to the Appropriations Committee.\n  In fact, if you examine the rules, as I did early this morning when I \ngot up and started thinking about these amendments, I think you will \nfind it very interesting. We have a series of rules that govern the \nSenate, and if we ever really followed them, we would not have the \ntrouble that we have once in a while here on the floor. The interesting \nthing is that those rules do not apply to the appropriations process in \nmost instances because the framers of those rules understood the real \ncomplexities of the appropriations process and the fact that we do deal \nwith emergencies and with various extraordinary circumstances in the \ncourse of each year's consideration of these 13 bills.\n  We were prepared to offer three amendments to delete these three \nsections: 208, 210, and 211. I have had long discussions with my good \nfriend, Senator Domenici, the manager of the bill, chairman of the \nBudget Committee, and he has made an offer to us, which I am reluctant \nto agree to, but I have no alternative because no committee needs the \nbudget resolution more than the Appropriations Committee. The points of \norder that are in the Budget Act apply to the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. They don't even apply to the House bill because the House \ncontrols its access to the floor and amendments through the rules \nprocess.\n  We, therefore, have to negotiate with the Budget Committee to obtain \nthe best possible regime under which to present the appropriations \nbills for the fiscal year 2001. I am going to yield to my friend. It is \nmy understanding that he will offer an amendment and that the amendment \nwill be debated here. It is my intention, if it is what I believe it to \nbe--as I said, I am reluctantly going to agree to support it, primarily \nbecause we need this budget resolution, and also because I have great \ntrust and faith in the chairman of the Budget Committee. He is seeking \nto get his job done, and I am seeking to be able to do the job that has \nbeen assigned to our committee.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my friend to carry on the discussions. He \nwill yield to the Senator from Texas and others. How much time do I \nhave on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 49 minutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If I have 49 minutes, I yield 45 minutes to my friend, \nand I will reserve 4 minutes in case I have to come back into this \ndiscussion at some point. It is my understanding that he has the \nauthority, then, to yield to other Members on this side who might wish \nto discuss the matter, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It is my \nunderstanding that the Senator from Alaska offered an amendment to \nwhich he has 1 hour, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was not enough time for 1 hour, so it is \n54 minutes to each side.\n  Mr. REID. Who is in opposition to the Stevens amendment other than \nthe Democrats?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Nobody here is in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader controls the time.\n  Mr. REID. So we have 54 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will retain 4 minutes of the time and yield the rest \nof the time to the Senator from New Mexico. He will yield time to my \nfriend from Virginia, as well as the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has control of the \n45 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to talk with Senator Stevens for \na moment. First of all, let me say that there are a couple of Senators \nwho want to speak for 2 or 3 minutes on my side. Since I have almost an \nhour, I will yield to them. We haven't been able to have any time \nbecause of the way things are. Senator Gorton wishes to speak. How much \ntime would Senator Gorton take?\n  Mr. GORTON. Two minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes to Senator Gorton.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the current \namendment be set aside and we call up, first, amendment No. 2942, and \nthen 3011, both of which have been agreed to by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2942\n\n      (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the \nestablishment of a national background check system for long-term care \n                                workers)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. Kohl, for \n     himself, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2942.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A \n                   NATIONAL BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM FOR LONG-TERM \n                   CARE WORKERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The impending retirement of the baby boom generation \n     will greatly increase the demand and need for quality long-\n     term care and it is incumbent on Congress and the President \n     to ensure that medicare and medicaid patients are protected \n     from abuse, neglect, and mistreatment.\n       (2) Although the majority of long-term care facilities do \n     an excellent job in caring for elderly and disabled patients, \n     incidents of abuse and neglect and mistreatment do occur at \n     an unacceptable rate and are not limited to nursing homes \n     alone.\n       (3) Current Federal and State safeguards are inadequate \n     because there is little or no information sharing between \n     States about known abusers and no common State procedures for \n     tracking abusers from State to State and facility to \n     facility.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget assume that a national \n     registry of abusive long-term care workers should be \n     established by building upon existing infrastructures at the \n     Federal and State levels that would enable long-term care \n     providers who participate in the medicare and medicaid \n     programs to conduct background checks on prospective \n     employees.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is an amendment by Senator Kohl of \nWisconsin regarding the establishment of a national background check \nsystem for long-term care workers. It has been agreed to, and I think \nwe can take it directly to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2942) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3011\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning the price of \n                          prescription drugs)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for himself and \n     Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 3011.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE PRICE OF \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today, two-thirds of senior citizens in the United \n     States have access to prescription drugs through health \n     insurance coverage.\n       (2) However, it is difficult for many Americans, including \n     senior citizens, to afford the prescription drugs that they \n     need to stay healthy.\n       (3) Many senior citizens in the United States leave the \n     country and go to Canada or Mexico to buy prescription drugs \n     that are developed, manufactured, and approved in the United \n     States in order to buy such drugs at lower prices than such \n     drugs are sold for in the United States.\n       (4) According to the General Accounting Office, a consumer \n     in the United States pays\n\n[[Page S2320]]\n\n     on average \\1/3\\ more for a prescription drug than a consumer \n     pays for the same drug in another country.\n       (5) The United States has made a strong commitment to \n     supporting the research and development of new drugs through \n     taxpayer-supported funding of the National Institutes of \n     Health, through the research and development tax credit, and \n     through other means.\n       (6) The development of new drugs is important because the \n     use of such drugs enables people to live longer and lead \n     healthier, more productive lives.\n       (7) Citizens of other countries should pay a portion of the \n     research and development costs for new drugs, or their fair \n     share of such costs, rather than just reap the benefits of \n     such drugs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that the \n     cost disparity between identical prescription drugs sold in \n     the United States, Canada, and Mexico should be reduced or \n     eliminated.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment relates to the \ndiscrimination in the price for prescription drugs on the part of \nAmerican companies between drugs sold in the U.S. and drugs sold for \nless overseas, and it expresses the concern of the Senate about that \ndiscrimination and the desire that it be reduced or eliminated.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Washington, Senator \nGorton, has this been approved by the majority and minority, signed off \non; is that true?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3011) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, Senator Allard wishes to speak. Can \nhe do what he wanted to do in 3 minutes?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I can.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes on the amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Thank you. Mr. President, frankly, I had no intention to \ncome to the floor today, as I received a generous amount of time \nyesterday to debate my amendment concerning the national debt. I \nappreciate the chairman of the Budget Committee giving me some time to \nspeak momentarily. After listening to the dialog today and reading the \ncontent of the sense-of-the-Senate amendment by the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, I felt a sincere need to come and speak to you all this \nevening.\n  Since last April's tragic events in my home State at Columbine High \nSchool, the town of Littleton, it seems as though the students and \ncommunity of the Columbine High School have been mentioned almost on a \ndaily basis on the floor of the Senate in Washington, DC. This tragic \nevent has become a new flag to be waved by those in this body who seek \nto further politicize the issues of crime, law enforcement, and the \nsecond amendment. I ask you, Mr. President, what has this politicking \ndone to help heal the wounds in my home State? I have staff from \nLittleton. I have staff in Littleton, and I have staff in my State \noffices who will go home this very night in Littleton, CO.\n  This tragic event shocked the people in that community, and to date I \nfail to see any benefit to those in Littleton from the continued \npublicity and polarization coming from this Chamber.\n  I have with me two articles published this week: Denver Rocky \nMountain News editorial documenting the April 12 visit of President \nClinton to Littleton:\n\n       It would be utterly tasteless for any politician--from the \n     President to local state representative--to attempt to make \n     political hay over Columbine on the brink of its anniversary.\n\n  Washington Post Article ``Columbine, Reflections of a Painful Past'':\n\n       Students, parents and school officials here are viewing \n     this anniversary with trepidation. They are apprehensive \n     about the emotions it may rekindle--and about the crush of \n     journalists and curiosity seekers expected to arrive.\n       A Columbine Senior said, ``It is not the kind of thing that \n     really falls away very quickly. We're healing. But it is \n     always in people's emotions. There is always a hint of it in \n     the background.''\n\n  I am ashamed that part of background noise that disturbs the healing \nof these tender wounds in a Colorado community is the increasing effort \nby some to make this event the driving force behind their own policy \ngoals.\n  As the chairman of last year's Juvenile Justice Task Force I worked \nclosely with a number of members of this body to determine causes and \nsolutions for America's juvenile justice problems. The causes are \nintricate and many. We made our recommendations and we contributed to \nthe juvenile justice bill currently in conference committee.\n  We are here today to work on a budget resolution for the coming \nfiscal year. We have had, and will have again, policy debates on the \nmany issues this amendment addresses. We should have those debates in \nthe realm of sensible, comprehensive policy. What we should not do is \ncontinue painful rhetoric that inflames the wounds of the Littleton \ncommunity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Denver Rocky Mountain News article \nand the Washington Post article mentioned in my statement be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 6, 2000]\n\n              At Columbine, Reflections on a Painful Past\n\n                           (By Amy Goldstein)\n\n       Littleton, Colo., April 5.--One of Matt Varney's best \n     friends is Pat Ireland, a Columbine High School student who, \n     last April 20, was captured on television tumbling, shot and \n     bleeding, out a school window. A year later, Varney said that \n     his friend inspires and sobers him still.\n       ``Watching him heal--his everlasting pursuit to get \n     better--has healed me,'' said Varney, a Columbine senior. \n     Yet, he said, ``I have trouble seeing him, knowing these two \n     guys took away so much from him.''\n       Varney had left Columbine for lunch two minutes before a \n     pair of fellow students rampaged through the building, \n     murdering 13 people and wounding two dozen others before \n     killing themselves. Tonight, Varney was one of two dozen \n     Columbine students and staff members who volunteered to sit \n     on a stage for a town meeting to describe how the nation's \n     deadliest school shooting has influenced their school and \n     themselves.\n       For nearly two hours, they talked of friendships that have \n     tightened. The solidarity of teachers willing to fill in for \n     one another on a difficult day. The solace they draw from \n     faith and family and writing poetry.\n       They talked too, of sadness that endures. ``Sometimes, I \n     just want to shout out at night, `I don't know why it was \n     us,' '' said Sergio Gonzales, a senior. ``It isn't the \n     regular life of a teenager.''\n       The strains that linger, mental health and school officials \n     say, are mounting in the days leading to the first \n     anniversary of the massacre. The community is responding with \n     a series of events intended to commemorate the occasion and, \n     at the same time, minimize the disruption to a community \n     still striving for equilibrium.\n       Tonight's town meeting was the opening event and the first \n     time that the Jefferson County school district has convened \n     students and staff to speak publicly about the shooting and \n     its aftermath. ``Columbine'' suddenly became known worldwide \n     as a synonym for school violence on a late Tuesday morning \n     when a pair of juniors, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, \n     crossed a soccer field and entered the building with guns \n     blazing, fatally shooting a dozen students and a science \n     teacher before turning their guns on themselves in the high \n     school library. They had also laced the building with bombs, \n     most of which never went off.\n       Like other commemorative events that will take place this \n     month, tonight's 90-minute forum, ``Conversations With \n     Columbine,'' was tightly controlled, with reporters allowed \n     to request individual interviews with participants afterward \n     only by handing their business cards to school system \n     representatives. Reporters and television crews who want a \n     glimpse inside the school may have one--but only in small, \n     guided tours arranged for them early this Sunday, when the \n     building will otherwise be vacant.\n       Students, parents and school officials here are viewing \n     this anniversary with trepidation. They are apprehensive \n     about the emotions it may rekindle--and about the crush of \n     journalists and curiosity-seekers expected to arrive.\n       Based on the crowd that thronged Oklahoma City one year \n     after the 1995 bombing of a federal office building there, \n     and the proximity of the Littleton anniversary to Easter \n     vacations, school officials have predicted that perhaps \n     100,000 people will arrive here later this month. Community \n     leaders also have heard reports that members of the National \n     Rifle Association may turn out in force to try to counteract \n     welling support here for tighter gun control measures being \n     debated in the Colorado legislature.\n       ``We don't want the masses, but we have to be prepared for \n     the masses,'' Rick Kaufman, a school system spokesman, said \n     this week.\n       Outwardly, Littleton has recovered a sense of normalcy. \n     Adjacent to the Columbine campus, the grass has grown back in \n     Clement Park, which last spring became a muddy encampment for \n     dozens of television satellite trucks and a makeshift shrine \n     for students bringing flowers and placards to memorialize the \n     dead. This week, the park was filled with young boys playing \n     lacrosse after school in the spring sunshine.\n\n[[Page S2321]]\n\n       The police tape was removed long ago from the school, a \n     sprawling beige brick structure near the entrance to a quiet \n     residential neighborhood. But there are reminders and \n     frailties, still. The student who walks into class and tells \n     a teacher he had a flashback and ended up crashing a car. The \n     unfailing shivers from the sound of a helicopter whirring \n     overhead. The sight of a few students still propelling \n     themselves down the school's corridors in wheelchairs.\n       ``It is not the kind of thing that really falls away very \n     quickly,'' said senior Peter Forsberg, who hid last April 20 \n     in the school's Spanish office for hours. ``We're healing. \n     But it is always in people's emotions. There is always a hint \n     of it in the background.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Denver Rocky Mountain News]\n\n                     The Timing of Clinton's Visit\n\n       Would Bill Clinton politicize the anniversary of Columbine? \n     Perish the thought! Why, didn't the president wait three \n     whole days after the Columbine shootings last year before he \n     publicly linked them to a lack of gun control? And didn't he \n     cool his heels a full week before he introduced a package of \n     gun measures that the White House described as ``the most \n     comprehensive gun legislation any administration has put \n     forward in 30 years''? There's sensitivity for you.\n       Yes, this president has been the very model of self-control \n     in resisting the temptation to exploit the Columbine tragedy \n     to advance a long-held political agenda. Most impressive of \n     all, he waited a whole month after Columbine--think of the \n     forbearance!--before he called for a Federal Trade Commission \n     probe into the marketing of violent video games and other \n     products.\n       That's why we are so shocked that anyone would suggest that \n     Clinton might actually try to politicize the anniversary of \n     Columbine when he visits Colorado on April 12 to campaign for \n     a state initiative that would mandate background checks at \n     gun shows. What on Earth in the president's record raises \n     that unworthy suspicion?\n       It would be utterly tasteless for any politician--from the \n     president to a local state representative--to attempt to make \n     political hay over Columbine on the brink of its anniversary. \n     President Clinton, whose tastefulness in all matters is \n     legendary, would be just about the last person we'd expect to \n     resort to such a crude maneuver.\n       So by all means, let the public accept the assurances of \n     SAFE Colorado, the gun-control group pushing the ballot \n     initiative, that the timing of the president's visit so close \n     to the Columbine anniversary of April 20 is a mere \n     coincidence and meant to signify nothing. Of course that's \n     true. There are only 52 weeks in a year, after all, and this \n     paltry number puts a terrific strain on the schedule of such \n     a busy world leader. If you wonder why Clinton would come to \n     Colorado barely a week before the Columbine anniversary to \n     attend a political rally on gun control, blame the burdens of \n     the presidency if you must blame something, but please do not \n     blame this man whose very career is a tribute to discretion \n     and respect for private grief.\n       As impressed as we are with Clinton's sensitivity, we are \n     also pleased to see that his upcoming visit is evoking the \n     usual carefully reasoned rhetoric from gun-rights advocates. \n     ``I just think (Clinton's) just doing what he always does, \n     wading through the blood of the victims to push his agenda,'' \n     said Bill Dietrick, legislative director of the Colorado \n     State Shooting Association. Dietrick's thoughtful analysis is \n     yet another enlightened contribution to the debate over guns, \n     and it follows a series of equally diplomatic comments last \n     month by the executive vice president of the National Rifle \n     Association.\n       Among other things, the NRA's Wayne LaPierre claimed that \n     President Bill Clinton ``needs a certain level of violence in \n     this country. He's willing to accept a certain level of \n     killing to further his political agenda and his vice \n     president's, too.''\n       It is heartening to see, as the Columbine anniversary \n     approaches, so much evidence of maturity and mutual respect \n     on both sides in the gun-control debate. Now you see why \n     we're so confident that the exploitation of Columbine is the \n     furthest thing from the minds of Clinton, those who arranged \n     his visit and those who will protest it.\n       After all, how could anyone possibly complain about their \n     behavior up till now?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager, Senator \nDomenici.\n  Senator Stevens and I have an amendment at the desk calling for a \n$4.1 billion increase in total defense spending.\n  We recognize that the House of Representatives is taking similar \naction. This would be parallel action.\n  At no time in contemporary history have there been more threats and \nmore challenges affecting the security of this country. At the same \ntime, at no time in my memory--I have been associated with the military \nas far back as World War II--has there been really less incentive for \nthe young men and women of the Nation to join and proudly wear the \nuniform and incentives for those in the middle grades of our military \nto stay in after enormous expenses for the taxpayers to train them. \nWhen they finish their obligated period and first-term enlistments--the \nfirst term for officers and oftentimes pilots is 6 to 8 years--they are \nhighly sought after by the private sector in our magnificent expanding \neconomy.\n  We have this coincidence of pressures being put on the military \ntoday.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote favorably on the current version of the \nStevens-Warner amendment of $4 billion for extra defense spending to \nmeet the threats worldwide and to provide the proper benefits and care \nfor the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families; to \nprovide for the increase in procurement for the modernization they need \nwith the additional dollars for training.\n  This Nation has witnessed the deployment of the men and women of the \nArmed Forces beyond our shores in the last 6 or 8 years, more times \nthan any other President has sent them out into harm's way. For too \nmany years, the size of our defense budget has been based on \nconstrained funding, not on the threats facing our country or the \nmilitary strategy necessary to meet those threats. We began to make \nsome progress last year when, for the first time in 14 years, we had a \nreal increase in the authorized level of defense spending. We must \ncontinue the momentum we started last year in an effort to correct the \nmost critical readiness, modernization, and recruiting and retention \nproblems in our military.\n\n  Any analysis of our defense budget should begin with an analysis of \nthe worldwide threat that our military faces--both now and in the \nfuture. The world remains complex and dangerous, and the United States \nis continually called upon to provide the requisite leadership to \nresolve the many conflicts which continue to erupt in this rapidly \nchanging world. The negative impact that the large number of \ncontingency operations in which our military is engaged worldwide is \nhaving on the readiness of our military forces concerns me. We have had \ntroops in the Persian Gulf--engaged in active military operations \nagainst Iraq--for over a decade, in Bosnia for over four years, and now \nin Kosovo--with no end in sight for any of these operations.\n  The Joint Chiefs of Staff have testified that they still have a \nshortfall in funding of $9.0 billion for this fiscal year--fiscal year \n2000; a requirement for an additional $15.5 billion above the budget \nrequest to meet shortfalls in readiness and modernization for fiscal \nyear 2001; and a requirement for an additional $85.0 billion over the \nnext five years. These were requirements identified by the Service \nChiefs as their unfunded, validated requirements--not a set of ``wish \nlists.''\n  As the elected representatives of the American people, we have no \nhigher responsibility than ensuring the safety and security of our \npeople by maintaining a strong and capable military. As chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, I cannot sit idly by--knowing of the many \nshortfalls in defense funding that currently exist--without at least \ntrying to address the many urgent needs of our military.\n  The Administration's budget request for fiscal year 2001 took some \npositive steps forward. The Budget Committee added an additional $500 \nmillion, but more needs to be done.\n  While the fiscal year 2001 defense budget request does reach the $60 \nbillion modernization goal set in fiscal year 1995, this goal has not \nkept pace with requirements and has never been adjusted for inflation. \nEstimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) have more \naccurately placed the funding necessary to meet modernization \nrequirements at $90.0 billion annually, with other organizations \nstating that even larger increases are necessary.\n  We must continue the momentum we started last year when the Congress \nprovided the personnel incentives necessary to reverse the negative \ntrends in recruiting and retention. The Secretary of Defense, the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the Service Chiefs have all said that \nfulfilling our commitment for healthcare to our military retirees will \nbe among the highest priorities this year. I believe, there is \noverwhelming support in the Senate to correct many of the shortfalls in \nthe military healthcare system for our service members, their families, \nand our military retirees. it is critical to\n\n[[Page S2322]]\n\nenact the important initiatives contained in the bipartisan healthcare \nlegislation introduced by the Senate and the Armed Services Committee \nleadership. Adding the funds in this amendment makes it possible to \nfund this important initiative for military retiree healthcare.\n  The increase of $4.0 billion contained in our amendment will allow us \nto bring defense spending to a more appropriate level and address some \nof the urgent unfunded requirements of the military chiefs. By adding \nthe funding in this amendment, we will not be forced to fund needed \nincreases for defense using emergency spending. Adding these funds now, \nallows the Senate to follow the normal procedures of authorization \nfirst, and not to forced to deal with added spending as an emergency.\n  The challenges that this country will face in the new millennium are \ndiverse--new threats, new battlefields, and new weapons. It is \nimportant that we remain vigilant, forward thinking, and prepared to \naddress these challenges.\n  Mr. Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, concluded his \nexcellent opening statement at a very sobering hearing before the Armed \nServices Committee in January by saying:\n\n       The fact that we are arguably the world's most powerful \n     nation does not bestow invulnerability; in fact, it may make \n     us a larger target for those who don't share our interest, \n     values, or beliefs.\n\n  We must ensure that our military forces remain ready to meet present \nand future challenges.\n  I want to express my appreciation again to the distinguished chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for assisting us on this amendment. I want to also thank the \nhighly professional staff members of the Appropriations Committee and \nthe Budget Committee for their assistance for working out this \namendment.\n  I also want to thank Senator Domenici and his staff in assisting me \nlast evening in working out a solution which will provide for the \nimplementation of a Thrift Savings Plan for the active and reserve \ncomponents of our military.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2931, As Modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2931) as modified is as follows:\n\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $4,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 6, increase the amount by $4,000,000,000.\n       On page 9, line 7, increase the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 7, decrease the amount by $4,000,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 8, decrease the amount by $2,000,000,000.\n       Strike page 41, line 5 and all that follows through page \n     45, line 22; and insert the following:\n       (g) Exception for Defense Spending.--Subsection (b) shall \n     not apply against an emergency designation for a provision \n     making discretionary appropriations in the defense category.\n\n     SEC. 209. RESERVE FUND PENDING INCREASE OF FISCAL YEAR 2001 \n                   DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The functional totals with respect to discretionary \n     spending set forth in this concurrent resolution, if \n     implemented, would result in legislation which exceeds the \n     limit on discretionary spending for fiscal year 2001 set out \n     in section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985. Nonetheless, the allocation \n     pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget and \n     Impoundment Control Act of 1974 to the Committee on \n     Appropriations is in compliance with current law spending \n     limits.\n       (2) Consequently unless and until the discretionary \n     spending limit for fiscal year 2001 is increased, aggregate \n     appropriations which exceed the current law limits would \n     still be out of order in the Senate and subject to a \n     supermajority vote.\n       (3) The functional totals contained in this concurrent \n     resolution envision a level of discretionary spending for \n     fiscal year 2001 as follows:\n       (A) For the discretionary category: $600,579,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $592,326,000,000 in outlays.\n       (B) For the highway category: $26,920,000,000 in outlays.\n       (C) For the mass transit category: $4,639,000,000 in \n     outlays.\n       (4) To facilitate the Senate completing its legislative \n     responsibilities for the 106th Congress in a timely fashion, \n     it is imperative that the Senate consider legislation which \n     increases the discretionary spending limit for fiscal year \n     2001 as soon as possible.\n       (b) Adjustment to Allocations.--Whenever a bill or joint \n     resolution becomes law that increases the discretionary \n     spending limit for fiscal year 2001 set out in section 251(c) \n     of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n     1985, the appropriate chairman of the Committee on the Budget \n     shall increase the allocation called for in section 302(a) of \n     the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to the appropriate \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n       (c) Limitation on Adjustment.--An adjustment made pursuant \n     to subsection (b) shall not result in an allocation under \n     section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 that \n     exceeds the total budget authority and outlays set forth in \n     subsection (a)(3).\n\n     SEC. 210. CONGRESSIONAL FIREWALL FOR DEFENSE AND NON-DEFENSE \n                   SPENDING.\n\n       (a) Definition.--In this section, for fiscal year 2001 the \n     term ``discretionary spending limit'' means--\n       (1) for the defense category, $310,819,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $297,050,000,000 in outlays; and\n       (2) for the nondefense category, $289,760,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $327,583,000,000 in outlays.\n       (b) Point of Order in the Senate.--\n       (1) In general.--After the adjustment to the section 302(a) \n     allocation to the Appropriations Committee is made pursuant \n     to section 208 and except as provided in paragraph (2), it \n     shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, \n     joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report \n     that exceeds any discretionary spending limit set forth in \n     this section.\n       (2) Exception.--This subsection shall not apply if a \n     declaration of war by Congress is in effect.\n       (c) Waiver and Appeal.--This section may be waived or \n     suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of three-\n     fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members of the Senate, duly \n     chosen and sworn, shall be required in the Senate to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised under this section.\n\n     SEC. 211. MECHANISMS FOR STRENGTHENING BUDGETARY INTEGRITY.\n\n       (a) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``budget year'' means with respect to a session of Congress, \n     the fiscal year of the Government that starts on October 1 of \n     the calendar year in which that session begins.\n       (b) Point of Order With Respect to Advanced \n     Appropriations.--\n       (1) In general.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any bill, resolution, amendment, motion or \n     conference report that--\n       (A) provides an appropriation of new budget authority for \n     any fiscal year after the budget year that is in excess of \n     the amounts provided in paragraph (2); and\n       (B) provides an appropriation of new budget authority for \n     any fiscal year subsequent to the year after the budget year.\n       (2) Limitation on amounts.--The total amount, provided in \n     appropriations legislation for the budget year, of \n     appropriations for the subsequent fiscal year shall not \n     exceed $23,000,000,000.\n       (c) Point of Order With Respect to Delayed Obligations.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), it \n     shall not be in order in the Senate to consider any bill, \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     contains an appropriation of new budget authority for any \n     fiscal year which does not become available upon enactment of \n     such legislation or on the first day of that fiscal year \n     (whichever is later).\n       (2) Exception.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect \n     to appropriations in the defense category; nor shall it apply \n     to appropriations reoccuring or customary or for the \n     following programs provided that such appropriation is not \n     delayed beyond the specified date and does not exceed the \n     specified amount:\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me suggest that this modification is supported by \nSenator Stevens, Senator Domenici, Senator Gramm, and Senator Warner, \nand I understand on the Democrat side Senator Inouye has told Senator \nStevens he supports it.\n  We are obviously trying tonight to complete our work and get a budget \nresolution that we can take to conference with the House of which we \nare proud.\n  Frankly, we came out of committee with $595.6 billion available in \nprogram authority for defense and domestic accounts.\n  In addition, we said in that budget resolution that we were \nreinstating what we had used for 3 years: The first 3 years of the \nbalanced budget agreement between the President and the\n\n[[Page S2323]]\n\nCongress--to wit, a firewall--so the defense money couldn't be used for \ndomestic spending or vice versa.\n  In this amendment, we retain that, but we have added $4 billion in \nprogram authority to defense.\n  There will be no mingling of that money with domestic and no mingling \nof domestic money with defense.\n  That firewall stays in this modification offered by Senator Stevens \non behalf of himself and other cosponsors.\n  In addition, the budget resolution had a 60-vote point of order for \nemergencies.\n  With this amendment, we have returned to the law as it was before \nthis budget resolution; that is, last year we had in the budget \nresolution that 60-vote point of order which would apply to domestic \nspending. That is retained, not modified, and it is not expanded to \ninclude defense.\n  In addition, the House of Representatives adopted in the budget \nresolution a limitation on advanced appropriations, a technicality \noften used but not always used by Presidents and Congress as they \ncomplete their appropriations work. It is a legitimate tool of \nappropriating. The House, in their resolution, has $23 billion as the \nmaximum amount allowed in program authority to be advanced.\n  Then there is a point of order, if you do more. We are agreeing here \nto do what the House did.\n  Senator Stevens has negotiated with us, and we are going to the House \nlevel on that number. That means for those who are concerned, we are \nkeeping some very rigid discipline, but we are going to the House \nnumber, and the number that was very much discussed in the Budget \nCommittee, we are back to that number.\n  Senator Gramm of Texas has agreed with their compromise, and he was \none who wanted to lower the number.\n  We are beginning to develop a package that looks to have consensus on \nour side. I wasn't sure any Democrats were going to vote for our budget \nresolution. I hope they do with these modifications. We have Senator \nInouye agreeing with these modifications. It doesn't mean he is \ncommitted to the budget resolution.\n  There are no nondefense delayed obligations except for those listed \nin the budget and those that are ordinary and historic.\n  Senator Stevens made two commitments to us. Frankly, I have committed \nto him. We worked together. He is going to make every effort to stay \nwithin the limitations in this budget.\n  That means there is $289 billion in budget authority, and $327.6 \nbillion in outlays for the nondefense part of this budget.\n  Depending on how you figure it, it is anywhere from a 3.35-percent \nincrease--looking at it another way, it may be as much as 6, or 6\\1/2\\, \ndepending upon a couple of things such as a $4.3 billion budget \nauthority that is going to be made available when we pass a certain \nbill that was required by the Budget Act of 1997.\n  The distinguished chairman is committing to do everything in his \npower to live within the budget resolution. That is all anybody ever \nasked. He has agreed not to violate the $23 billion in advanced \nfunding. There would be no reason to put it in the budget resolution if \nwe weren't going to do it.\n  I express my extreme gratitude to the distinguished Appropriations \nCommittee chairman for working with me, working with Senator Gramm, and \nworking with Senator Lott and others on our side, and the distinguished \nSenator Warner who carved out this budget enforcement compromise. I \nthink it is an excellent one.\n  I think we ought to adopt it.\n  From what I can understand, all segments of the Republican Party that \nhad diverse views on this budget resolution ought to be in concurrence \non this. I believe it does precisely what most of us would like.\n  I remind those who are thinking about domestic spending that we have \nincreased the advanced appropriations amounts from $13 billion to $23 \nbillion. That is a pretty good one that will allow flexibility of \nmanagement, which is what the appropriators are looking for. But it is \nnot too high because the House has accepted it also as something they \ncan live with based on this year's levels and the levels of last year.\n  I think overall it is a good compromise. It is now the pending \nbusiness, as Senator Stevens indicated in his submission to the desk as \na modification of his original amendment.\n  We still have some additional time. The distinguished Senator from \nTexas, who is a valued Member of the Senate and of the Budget \nCommittee, with whom I worked very hard to carve the budget resolution, \nis here. I yield 7 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I would hate to have to make a living \nnegotiating with Senator Stevens. In the dull moments when we sit here \nand listen to some droning speech and look at the names written in our \ndesk drawers--many of which we do not even recognize and never heard \nof--my guess is that someday people will see Senator Stevens' name in \none of these drawers and they will know who he was.\n  I believe we have a stronger budget as a result of this agreement. I \nthink we have a stronger enforcement process as a result of this \nagreement because Senator Domenici and I had words written on paper, \nbut we didn't have a consensus in the majority party to enforce those \nwords. We have that consensus today.\n  I take the word of the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska to be \nmore powerful and worth more than points of order. When he says he will \nlead the effort to the best of his ability to live within the \nnondefense discretionary numbers of this budget and to stay with the \nlimit we have agreed to on advanced appropriations, I believe that is \nthe strongest enforcement mechanism we can have.\n  We have preserved our 60-vote point of order for emergencies that are \nnondefense in nature. Senator Stevens raised the point that in an \nemergency for defense, you could require a supermajority, and if you \nhad a partisan issue on defense, you could deny the ability to meet the \ndefense needs of the Nation. A point well made and a point well taken.\n  But we have the enforcement mechanism that prevents the piling of \nitems of a nondefense nature into bills and designating them as \nemergencies when, in fact, they are not emergencies.\n  We kept the firewalls so when we get money for defense, it stays in \ndefense. We have adjusted the advanced appropriation level to the level \nwe had last year, the level that is in the House, with a strong 60-vote \npoint of order to hold it in place. We prohibit nondefense delayed \nobligations, which is an important new power in the budget process. We \nhave a unified Republican commitment to live within a discretionary \nbudget written here and to stay with that number through the process.\n  This has been a long and difficult negotiation. We are dealing with \npeople who have jobs to do. I think as a result of this agreement we \ncan move forward together to do that job. I thank Senator Domenici. I \nthank Senator Stevens. I believe we have a good product. I believe it \nis worthy of support. I believe we have a fighting chance to hold it \nthrough the appropriations process. If we do, the Nation will be the \nbig beneficiary.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the Senate debates the Fiscal Year \n2001 Budget Resolution, I want to again bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues the testimony by General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, before the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nSeptember 29, 1998.\n  ``It is the quality of the men and women who serve that sets the U.S. \nmilitary apart from all potential adversaries. These talented people \nare the ones who won the Cold War and ensured our victory in Operation \nDesert Storm. These dedicated professionals make it possible for the \nUnited States to accomplish the many missions we are called on to \nperform around the world every single day.''\n  It has been glaringly evident to me, and I suspect to some of my \ncolleagues, that there has been little or no mention of national \nsecurity issues during this debate on the budget resolution. Maybe it \nis because defense does not rank very high in the polls which reflect \nthe concerns of the American people. Or maybe it is because everyone \nassumes that the defense budget is adequate and there is no reason to \ndebate it. I am here today, along with the Chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, Senator Warner, and members\n\n[[Page S2324]]\n\nof the Armed Services Committee, to tell you that the level of defense \nspending proposed by the President and this budget resolution is \ninadequate.\n  To highlight the problem let me point out that despite the two \npercent increase in the President's budget over fiscal year 2000 and \nanother $500 million increase in the budget resolution, the Joint \nChiefs of Staff have identified a requirement for an additional $15 \nbillion to meet shortfalls in readiness and modernization for fiscal \nyear 2001.\n  Mr. President, we have the best soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nMarines, however, all their professionalism is for naught if they do \nnot have the equipment, weapons and supplies to carry out their \nmission. Since the end of Operation Desert Storm, which reflected both \nthe professionalism and material quality of our Armed Forces, the \ndefense budget has declined by $80 billion. Yet the pace of the \nmilitary operations has not declined, in fact the pace of operations \nexceeds that of the Cold War era. Not only are the men and women of our \nmilitary stretched to the limits, but also their equipment. The $4 \nbillion increase in the Defense Budget proposed by Chairman Warner's \namendment will not resolve the shortfall identified by the Nation's \nmost senior military commanders, it will however provide the necessary \nfunding to improve recruiting, retention, health care, and most \nimportant readiness.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of Senator Warner's amendment to \nensure we meet the Nation's security needs. We must not leave the false \nimpression that the increase in the President's budget and the \nadditional funding proposed in the budget resolution will result in \nincreased security for our Nation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time remains on the amendment as modified?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 26 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Smith from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague for yielding this \ntime.\n  I have an amendment, No. 3031, called prescription drug amendment, \nalong with my colleague, Senator Allard. Three or four minutes does not \ngive much time to explain a complicated amendment, but I say to my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle it meets the criteria of the \nDemocrat plan with a couple of additions for improvement.\n  It is revenue neutral. It eliminates the need to spend $40 billion in \nthe budget. It takes effect as early as 2001, and there is no premium \nincrease for seniors. It is voluntary. It is accessible to all Medicare \nbeneficiaries. It is designed to provide meaningful protection. It is \naffordable for all beneficiaries. It is administered using the private \nsector. It is consistent with broader Medicare reform. It is revenue \nneutral. It does not increase premiums. It provides full prescription \ndrug benefits as early as 2001.\n  The cost to the trust fund under Smith-Allard is zero; the cost to \nthe trust fund under the Clinton proposal is $203 billion over the next \n20 years.\n  It is supported by Mr. King, the former HCFA Administrator, in a \nletter.\n  Monthly premiums under the Clinton plan, $51; Smith-Allard, zero for \ndrugs; Part B, $45.50, versus $45.50; Medigap, $134 versus $88.\n  The total is $230 versus $133. The Smith-Allard premium savings is \n$96.83 a month. It works simply. The annual deductible under Clinton is \n$876--$776 plus $100. Under Smith-Allard, the combined deductible is \n$675. And prescription drugs are in part going toward the deductible.\n  In conclusion, this is a very good approach. It saves $40 billion out \nof this budget resolution, with which we could do a lot of things. It \nis revenue neutral. It takes effect as early as 2001. There is no \npremium increase for seniors.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support my amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Chafee has been asking for time. I yield 2 \nminutes to Senator Chafee.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am sending amendment No. 2944 to the \ndesk for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding this is not the time \nto offer amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would require unanimous consent to offer \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator from Rhode Island understands the amendment \nis not in order unless agreed upon on the other side, but I yield time \nfor him to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by a \nbipartisan group of cosponsors, including Senators Mikulski, Snowe, and \nGrassley, in offering this amendment.\n  In 1990, Congress passed legislation to authorize the Centers for \nDisease Control to pay for screening tests to detect breast and \ncervical cancer on low-income and uninsured women. Regrettably, this \nlegislation did not authorize the treatment for those screening tests \ntragically indicating cancer. I cannot believe any legislator would not \nwant to correct this omission.\n  Diagnosis without treatment is leaving women with the life-\nthreatening disease nowhere to turn. Screening must be coupled with \ntreatment to reduce mortality. Specifically, the sense of the Senate \nmirrors legislation introduced by Senator John Chafee which would give \nStates the option to provide treatment through the Medicaid program for \nwomen diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer under the CDC screening \nprogram. I truly believe this is a corrective measure.\n  Yes, this program costs $315 million over 5 years. However, the House \nincluded funding for this program in its budget 2 weeks ago, and the \nHouse leadership has committed to a vote on this bill by Mother's Day, \nMay 14. This is not a permanent entitlement. Women would only be \neligible for Medicaid during the duration of treatment. The coverage \nwould continue only until the treatment and followup visits are \ncompleted. Without Medicaid coverage, we are leaving these women to an \nunreliable, fragile, and deteriorating system of charity care where \nthey are often unable to get the treatment they need. Only about 6,200 \nwomen nationwide would be eligible for Medicaid under this legislation. \nThis small investment stands to save lives for low-income and uninsured \nwomen with breast and cervical cancer all over America. Since we have \nalready made the commitment in Congress to diagnose these women, we owe \nit to them to provide followup treatment.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment. We must \nfinish the job we started in 1990 by filling this gap in a vital \nFederal program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am happy to join Senator Chafee in \nintroducing the sense-of-the-Senate amendment to urge the Senate to \npass S. 662, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act.\n  This bill was originally introduced by the late Senator John Chafee, \nwho dedicated much time and energy to this important legislation. It is \nwith great honor that we carry with his efforts for passage of this \ncritical legislation.\n  I would like to submit for the Record a letter I received from an \nIowan. Her story illustrates the urgent need for passage of this bill.\n  Barbara Morrow of Evansdale, Iowa, was diagnosed in January 1995 with \nbreast cancer after being screened by the CDC Early Detection Program. \nBecause she had no insurance and no money, she had little hope of \nfinding medical care to treat her disease.\n  After exhaustive efforts, she was able to secure medical treatment \nfrom doctors willing to perform charity care.\n  Unfortunately, in January 1999, she learned that her breast cancer \nhad spread to her lungs. She returned to the same doctor who treated \nher earlier. For 14 months, she has been receiving chemotherapy and is \nalive today.\n  Ms. Morrow owes more than $70,000 for treatment she has received. She \npays what she can each month to the hospital where she receives her \ncare. The bills cause great worry and she considers stopping treatment \nto stop the bills.\n  She is a mother and a grandmother and she wants to live.\n\n[[Page S2325]]\n\n  It is urgent that Congress pass S. 662 to allow women to receive the \ntreatment they need to beat this disease. We have an opportunity to \nmake a real difference in the lives of thousands of women and mothers \nacross the Nation.\n  I urge your support for this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter sent to me by Barbara Morrow \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Charles Grassley,\n      444 N. Capitol Street, NW, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing to urge you to pass S. \n     662, The Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act. In January \n     1995 I was diagnosed with breast cancer after receiving a \n     mammogram through the Center for Disease Control Breast and \n     Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (CDCBCCEDP). I had no \n     insurance and no money to pay for treatment. I have been \n     struggling ever since.\n       My struggles began when the results of my CDC mammogram \n     suggested breast cancer. Initially two doctors refused to \n     perform a biopsy because I had no insurance. Finally, Dr. \n     Gerrelts in Waterloo agreed to take me as a patient and \n     perform a biopsy for free. The biopsy was malignant and three \n     to four days later Dr. Gerrelts performed a lumpectomy. Dr. \n     Gerrelts made an appointment for me with Dr. Nadipuram, a \n     Waterloo oncologist. Dr. Nadipuram agreed to provide \n     chemotherapy treatment and a radiologist provided 8 weeks of \n     radiation without charge. I needed a surgically implanted \n     cath-a-port for administration of the chemotherapy. Dr. \n     Gerrelts did this surgery for free. I received six months of \n     chemotherapy ending in September 1995.\n       Even though my initial treatment for breast cancer was \n     complete without a lot of bills, the expenses began to mount \n     from then on. I needed a cath-a-port flush every 6 weeks, \n     check ups every six months, and a bone scan every time I had \n     an ache. In January 1999, Dr. Gerrelts sent me for an x-ray \n     of my lungs. It was found the breast cancer had spread to my \n     lungs.\n       Dr. Gerrelts once again sent me to Dr. Nadipuram. Dr. \n     Nadipuram sent me to the University of Iowa Hospitals and \n     Clinics in Iowa City for treatment. At the University of Iowa \n     I had many biopsies, scans, and tests. Recurring breast \n     cancer was found in my brain also. University of Iowa told me \n     I did not fit the criteria for their stem cell transplant \n     program and all they could offer me is chemotherapy that \n     would keep me alive for six months.\n       I returned to my home in the Waterloo area devastated, with \n     no money, no insurance, and no hope. I once again asked Dr. \n     Nadipuram to treat my recurring breast cancer. He has been \n     treating me with chemotherapy ever since and I am still alive \n     14 months later.\n       I applied for Social Security disability benefits after my \n     diagnosis for recurring breast cancer. Over a year later, I \n     will finally begin to receive benefits April 19, 2000. \n     However, my medical bills have accumulated and these bills \n     must still be paid by me. I owe over $70,000. I send what I \n     can each month to Allen Hospital, Covenant Hospital, Covenant \n     Clinic, a radiologist, and Dr. Nadipuram all of Waterloo. I \n     also send money to the University of Iowa Hospitals and \n     Clinics and the doctors at the University of Iowa. In spite \n     of this I continue to be hounded by all of these institutions \n     and doctors asking me to pay more. My bills are so high I \n     often wonder if I should quit treatment so I will not saddle \n     myself and my family with so much debt.\n       But, my grandson was diagnosed with cancer at age 9. He is \n     now 16 and my daughter and I continue to care for him. I must \n     stay alive to help my daughter and grandson.\n       Breast cancer and it's treatment are overwhelming. Being \n     unable to pay for treatment is devastating. Please pass S. \n     662 so that women who are diagnosed with breast cancer \n     through the CDCBCCEDP can receive treatment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Barbara Morrow.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, using my time, I would be honored if the \nSenator would let me be a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Likewise, I ask the Senator if I might be a cosponsor. My \nfather was a medical doctor and devoted much of his career to the very \nsubject the Senator addressed in his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve 2 minutes of our time. How much time do we \nhave left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 18 minutes. \nThe Senator from Alaska has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I say to the Senate, I am not sure I will have a \nchance later tonight to summarize this budget resolution that I hope \nsometime tomorrow we are going to adopt, with an amendment that the \ndistinguished Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, and others put \ntogether, that we have been discussing and of which I was a part.\n  Let me first say this budget resolution has the right priorities. It \nincreases defense at the same time it increases spending for such \nthings as education--at least the equivalent amount of increase the \nPresident has.\n  We leave how the education program is to be structured up to the \nappropriate authorizing committees and the appropriators, but we give \nthem plenty of resources to have an increase. With some reform, we may \nbe able to do better at education than we have done in the past.\n  In addition, we have extra funding for the National Institutes of \nHealth--not as much as some people would want but a very substantial \nincrease--$1.1 billion. I know some would like more than that, but I \nremind everyone, for the last 3 years we have increased the National \nInstitutes of Health more than they have been increased in their entire \nhistory, year over year. That is why they are doing such remarkable \nthings and that is why in a few more years of increases we may find \nbreakthroughs in cancer and many other diseases that beset mankind.\n  In addition, we have reduced the debt of the United States in this \nbudget resolution by $177 billion. It was not too many years ago, \nperhaps Lyndon Johnson's budget, that the whole budget was $177 \nbillion. This year we are reducing the deficit--the debt owed to the \npublic--by $177 billion.\n  For those who think our tax relief in this budget is too much, let me \nremind you: In the first year, if we accomplish them, they are $13 \nbillion. That is $13 billion compared to $177 billion in debt \nreduction. It is pretty good, Americans, pretty good. If we end up in \nthat way for the next 7 or 8 years, we will indeed leave a stronger and \nbetter America with more prosperity than we have today. In addition, if \nyou take the whole 5 years, we have eight times as much debt reduction, \nto wit, $1.1 trillion debt reduction, $8 for every $1 in tax relief.\n  The tax relief we dream of, and we hope the Finance Committee will \nenact--and we can do nothing more than give them our best advice; they \nwill do what they want in the public interest, and it will be right--we \nhave the marriage tax penalty. Married couples, new ones and those who \nhave been married for a long time, will not have an average penalty of \n$1,200 to $1,400 for having been married and working and filing one \nreturn as a husband and a wife. They are now punished. We say reform \nthe Tax Code now--not 10 years from now. We are putting plenty of money \non the debt. We ought to put some money on reforming the Tax Code for \nthe marriage penalty, for small business changes, and a few other \nthings such as that. That is what this budget is going to provide for \nAmericans, so I am proud we have it here.\n\n  For the appropriated accounts, all the rest of Government, when you \ntake the fact that there were $9 billion last year in items that are \nnot recurring, and you take the increase that we have in this budget, \nand $4.1 billion they will get when they pass another bill that we \nought to pass because it is in the balanced budget amendment with \nreference to Social Security and veterans--it merely changes pay dates \nas required by the balanced budget agreement--they will have a rather \nsignificant increase that can be done in this very difficult political \nyear.\n  I wrap my argument up by saying it will be tough, appropriators and \nall of us, because the President has submitted a political budget. Why \nis it political? Because it is a 14-percent increase in domestic \nspending. Really, nobody thinks you can do that big an increase. He put \nit in. It could only be for one reason--to present us with a political \nbudget. Then we are going to have to have to match our wits with \ngetting something done while he tells the Americans he did more.\n  Of course you do more, but if you added 14 percent every year on this \nbudget on only domestic spending, you would consume all of the \nsurpluses that are accumulated and you would dip into the Social \nSecurity trust fund to a huge extent, just by adding the amount the \nPresident offered as an increase this year. So he clearly must not have \nintended it to go on forever. So what was it? It was a submission to \ntry to either embarrass us or make us spend precisely what he wants, \nwhich is way too much.\n\n[[Page S2326]]\n\n  So we will be busy doing that. It will be tough. But if we can get \nout of here tomorrow, leave the Senate and say we did some good work, \nwe have a budget resolution, let's go to conference--we are pretty \nclose with the House--then the appropriators can start their work.\n  My final comments go to Senator Stevens. Senator Stevens and I have \nbecome friends. I have been here a long time. He has been here longer. \nI am chairman of the Budget Committee; he is chairman of \nAppropriations. I think neither of us thought--at least he waited a \nlong time for his chairmanship. Might I say, I believe when we are \nfinished today everybody will be thankful he was willing to sit down \nwith us and work this out.\n  I thank the distinguished majority leader for his help, Senator Lott, \nand I thank the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, and all Members who have \nparticipated in getting us this far.\n  There are many more amendments, there is no doubt about that, in the \nvote-arama and otherwise, but I think we will come out with a budget \nresolution we can confer upon that will be very close.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The assistant minority leader.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nMr. Byrd, 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me preface my remarks by saying I had \njoined with Senator Stevens in two amendments that were at the desk \nearlier, one dealing with section 208, and one dealing with section \n210.\n  I understand both of those have been modified. I still want to speak, \nhowever, to the subject matter here. In doing so, may I say I have no \ncloser friend in this body than Senator Stevens. It has been that way, \nand it is going to continue to be that way. He is chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, and I think I have supported him throughout \nall the time he has been chairman, and he has certainly been a great \nsupporter of mine. He is the chairman; I am not. He carries some \nresponsibilities that I do not carry at this moment. So what I have to \nsay is not to be perceived as any criticism of Ted Stevens. I hope no \none will perceive it as that, and I hope he will not. I merely want to \nspeak to the subject matter of the two sections we were about to strike \nand to say why I am opposed to those two sections. I want to make that \ncase for at least my side of the aisle, and I want to make it for the \npeople out there who are watching. I do not bear any rancor toward \nanyone on the other side of the aisle, but I think these things ought \nto be said.\n\n  I rise, Mr. President, to speak about the two amendments we would \nhave offered. The first of our amendments would have stricken section \n208 of the budget resolution. That section would establish a 60-vote \npoint of order in the Senate against the use of an emergency \ndesignation in any spending or revenue legislation.\n  Senators will recall that last year's Senate budget resolution \ncontained a simple majority point of order against any emergency \ndesignations on all discretionary spending--both defense and \nnondefense. But, when the budget resolution last year came out of the \nconference with the House, the Senate provision had been changed. The \nconference agreement on last year's budget resolution did away with the \nsimple majority point of order and replaced it with a 60-day point of \norder on nondefense discretionary spending only! The conferees chose to \neliminate the point of order for defense emergency spending altogether. \nWhen the conference agreement on last year's budget resolution came \nback to the Senate, there was no way to attack that particular \nprovision. Budget resolution conference reports are limited as to time \nand, therefore, filibuster proof. The Budget Act sets a time limit on \ntheir consideration, after which a final vote will occur. The majority \nhad the votes to adopt that conference agreement, and did so. That is \nwhy, for fiscal year 2000, we have the ridiculous and totally \nunjustifiable requirements on emergency spending.\n  Let me say that again, Mr. President. When the budget resolution last \nyear was acted upon by the Senate, it had a simple majority vote point \nof order, but when it went to conference with the Members of the other \nbody, it came back to us with a 60-vote point of order. The House \nconferees had a voice in changing that point of order by which the \nSenate has had to live in the intervening time.\n  I think our Members ought to be fully aware of that. It did not leave \nthe Senate floor last year with a 60-vote point of order. It went to \nthe conference with the other body, and they helped to change the \nrules, if I may use that term, by which we have to live. They are not \nbound by the 60-vote point of order, but we are. It came back to us in \nthe conference report which we could not change.\n  We ought to be aware of those things when we send these resolutions \nto the other body. I do not blame the other body. I am not criticizing \nthem. They may actually have had nothing to do with it, but it was \nchanged in conference.\n  Here is the perfectly ridiculous aspect of this 60-vote point of \norder requirement under which we have to live here. If your \nconstituents suffer from any of the myriad natural disasters that can \noccur at any time, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, \nearthquakes, or any other catastrophe--maybe an act of God--emergency \nspending for the relief of those constituents is subject to a 60-vote \npoint of order in the Senate. The House has no such supermajority point \nof order.\n  In the Senate for fiscal year 2000, if any Senator wishes to raise a \npoint of order against emergency spending in the nondefense area, it \nwill take 60 votes, or that emergency spending will be deleted from any \nappropriations bill or conference report thereon.\n\n  For example, if the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, has a \ncatastrophe, if there is an act of God that is visited upon his State, \nhe may be perfectly justified in asking for an emergency appropriation \nto deal with that catastrophe. But in the Senate, a 60-vote point of \norder will lie against that funding for the relief of his State, and 41 \nMembers of the Senate can deny him and deny his people relief. God \nforbid that any catastrophe should hit his State, or the State of the \nSenator from Nevada who is sitting before me. If his State is suddenly \nhit by a catastrophe and they need disaster relief, 41 Members, a \nminority in the Senate, can say no, and the people of Nevada would be \ndenied that relief.\n  In other words, we can send our brave men and women in uniform around \nthe world, whether it be to Bosnia or to Kosovo or to Iraq or anywhere \nelse, and provide emergency funding to pay for those operations, \nregardless of the costs, without facing a point of order against such \nspending. But when it comes to helping the people at home, the \nconstituents who send us here, when it comes to helping them in their \ndire extremities that have been brought on by an act of God, no, a \npoint of order can be made against that funding, and it would take 60 \nvotes for those people in that disaster-stricken State to get relief.\n  That is preeminently unfair. One can say what one wants, but that is \nunfair. I cannot understand why anyone would want to insist on a point \nof order that would require 60 votes when it comes to helping the \npeople who send us here, the people who pay the taxes.\n  We should not unduly hamstring spending intended to cover either \ndefense or nondefense emergencies. While we have discretionary spending \ncaps in the law, provisions must be made to deal with the unexpected. \nAnd we should not encumber the flexibility to answer those emergency \nneeds with parliamentary devices which make responding to them \ndifficult.\n\n  I should point out, Mr. President, that, as chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee during the time of the 1990 budget summit and \nas a participant in that summit, I worked very hard to include the \nexemption for emergency spending that is now contained in section \n251(b)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. \nThat 1990 budget summit between the Bush administration and Congress \nwas necessary in order to avoid huge across-the-board sequesters of \nFederal spending that would have otherwise occurred under Gramm-Rudman. \nThose sequesters, or automatic across-the-board cuts, were in the \nmagnitude of 40 percent, and could have\n\n[[Page S2327]]\n\ndevastated the Nation. And so, we had no choice but to reach an \nagreement. In the end, after months of negotiations both here in \nCongress and at Andrews Air Force Base, an agreement was finally \nreached and subsequently enacted by Congress and signed by President \nBush.\n  An important feature of the 1990 budget agreement was that, for the \nfirst time, statutory caps were placed on discretionary spending. As a \nparticipant in those negotiations, I was intimately involved in the \nsetting of those discretionary spending caps and the other budgetary \nenforcement provisions contained in the 1990 budget summit agreement. \nIn order to agree to those caps, I felt that it was critical that the \nAppropriations Committees be held ``harmless'' for economic and \ntechnical miscalculations that occur in each year's budget projections. \nIn other words, if discretionary appropriations were to be held to a \nspecific spending cap each year, that discretionary spending should not \nbe automatically cut because of technical or economic miscalculations \nby either the Office of Management and Budget or the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  Another critical exception was the allowance of emergency spending to \nbe included in annual appropriations acts, without having the cost of \nthose emergencies charged against the discretionary spending caps. No \nhuman being can determine what nature has in store for the Nation in \nterms of natural disasters, such as, hurricanes, tornadoes, drought, \nfloods, fire, or military emergencies around the world. So, we had to \nhave some way to address those needs outside of the very stringent \nbudgetary caps that were being placed on discretionary spending. The \nresult was the enactment of section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget \nand Emergency Deficit Control Act. That Section of the Budget Act has \nby and large worked well since its enactment in 1990. However, in \nrecent years, without going into detail, there have been a number of \ninstances where such emergency designations might not have been fully \njustified. Therefore, I would support the inclusion in the budget \nresolution, criteria such as those set forth in section 208(a)(2). \nThose criteria read as follows:\n\n       (A) In general, the criteria to be considered in \n     determining whether a proposed expenditure or tax change is \n     an emergency requirement are:\n       (i) necessary, essential, or vital (not merely useful or \n     beneficial);\n       (ii) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up \n     over time;\n       (iii) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring \n     immediate action;\n\n  These are real emergencies.\n\n       (iv) subject to subparagraph (B), unforeseen, \n     unpredictable, and unanticipated; and\n       (v) not permanent, temporary in nature.\n       (B) Unforeseen.--An emergency that is part of an aggregate \n     level of anticipated emergencies, particularly when normally \n     estimated in advance, is not unforeseen.\n\n  So, Mr. President, what I object to is not that any emergency \nrequirement should have to meet those criteria. What I object to is the \ncreation of a 60-vote point of order against all--against all--\nemergency designations in any appropriations bill, whether they meet \nthe criteria or not. In other words, Section 208 of the budget \nresolution would allow any Senator to make a point of order against any \nemergency designation, even if it met the criteria set forth in section \n208. That point of order could then be waived or suspended in the \nSenate only by an affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members duly \nchosen and sworn.\n  In other words, a minority of 41 could thwart the efforts of Senators \nor a Senator to deal with a catastrophe that had stricken his State. A \nminority, a minority of 41, could thwart the effort. It takes 60 votes, \na supermajority.\n  Mr. President, this onerous section should be stricken from the \nbudget resolution.\n  Mr. President, Alexander Hamilton had something to say about \nsupermajorities. Let's see what he had to say about supermajorities.\n  In the Federalist No. 75, here is what Hamilton said:\n\n       . . . all provisions which require more than the majority \n     of any body to its resolutions have a direct tendency to \n     embarrass the operations of the government and an indirect \n     one to subject the sense of the majority to that of the \n     minority.\n\n  That is Alexander Hamilton speaking.\n  What did Madison have to say about supermajorities? In the Federalist \nNo. 58, here is what James Madison said about supermajorities:\n\n       It has been said that more than a majority ought to have \n     been required for a quorum; and in particular cases, if not \n     in all, more than a majority of a quorum for a decision.\n\n  That is what we are talking about here. We are talking about the need \nfor more than a majority--60 votes for a decision.\n\n       That some advantages might have resulted from such a \n     precaution cannot be denied. It might have been an additional \n     shield to some particular interests, and another obstacle \n     generally to hasty and partial measures. But these \n     considerations are outweighed by the inconveniences in the \n     opposite scale. In all cases where justice or the general \n     good might require new laws to be passed, or active measures \n     to be pursued, the fundamental principle of free government \n     would be reversed.\n\n  That is what we are talking about here. Let's read that again. \nMadison said:\n\n       In all cases where justice--\n\n  Any Senator whose State has been hit by a catastrophe would feel it \nis only justice--only justice--that his State receive some disaster \nrelief.\n  Madison said:\n\n       In all cases where justice or the general good might \n     require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be \n     pursued--\n\n  We are talking about an active measure here. That is what Madison had \nin mind.\n\n       In all cases where justice or the general good might \n     require new laws to be passed, or active measures to be \n     pursued, the fundamental principle of free government would \n     be reversed.\n\n  He is talking about the requirement of supermajorities now. He is \nsaying that the fundamental principle of free government would be \nreversed. It would be no longer the majority that would rule. The power \nwould be transferred to the minority. In this instance, in this \nlegislation, the power to rule is going to be transferred to a \nminority.\n  This is a democratic republic. A lot of people say it is a democracy. \nIt is not a democracy. It is a republic. All legislative bodies that \nabide by democratic principles, all republics that abide by democratic \nprinciples, have as the basis of those principles the principle that \nthe majority rules. That is not the case here. If Senator Inouye's \nState needs help because of a typhoon, the majority won't necessarily \nrule. It won't in the State of New Mexico. It won't in the State of \nSenator Reid. It won't in my State. A minority can rule. Forty-one \nvotes can come between justice and the people of our States.\n  I am against the 60-vote point of order when it comes to nondefense \nor defense spending. That is what we were trying to do in the \namendments that were originally sent to the desk.\n  Madison again is speaking:\n\n       It would be no longer the majority that would rule: the \n     power would be transferred to the minority. Were the \n     defensive privilege limited to particular cases, an \n     interested minority might take advantage of it to screen \n     themselves from equitable sacrifices to the general weal, or, \n     in particular emergencies, to extort unreasonable \n     indulgences.\n\n  Madison foresaw that in situations where supermajorities were \nrequired, there could be situations in which the minority would extort \nunreasonable indulgences in return for their support.\n  So much for Hamilton and Madison for today. They are certainly not \ngoing to be listened to, I would anticipate.\n  Its adoption would severely curtail the ability of Congress to \nrespond to the unforeseen urgent needs of the people of this country \nwho have suffered devastation caused by floods, severe droughts, \ntornadoes, hurricanes, and earthquakes.\n  Under section 208, a minority of just 41 Senators could prevent the \nenactment of the spending to address all of these needs. What would \nhappen under this provision in the case of regional emergencies which \nmay only affect one State, such as an earthquake in California or a \nhurricane in North Carolina or floods in North Dakota, or drought \nconditions in Texas? Funding for disasters such as these, which affect \nonly one area of the country, could be in danger. If a point of order \nis made by any Senator who may have his nose out of joint for some \nreason--he may just not want to help another Senator to help his \npeople--those emergency funding provisions for particular States or \nregions would need 60 votes or funding for disaster assistance would \nnot be forthcoming.\n\n[[Page S2328]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time that has been yielded to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia has expired.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the minority have on this, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator 9 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished minority whip.\n  This point of order is an unwise and cumbersome device that could \nprevent the committee from responding to the urgent needs of our \nNation. Now, why do we want to do that?\n  The second amendment, which I joined in offering, would have stricken \nsection 210 from the budget resolution. That section would reinstitute \na congressional firewall on defense and nondefense discretionary \nspending for fiscal year 2001. This section of the budget resolution \nwould set defense spending for fiscal year 2001 at $306,819,000,000 in \nnew budget authority and $295,050,000,000 in outlays. For the \nnondefense category, the cap would be set at $289.7 billion in new \nbudget authority and $327.5 billion in outlays.\n  In other words, this budget resolution would cap defense spending at \na level that is $9 billion above what it would take to maintain this \nyear's level of spending adjusted for inflation. But the cap for \nnondefense spending would be set at a level requiring a cut. The cap \nfor nondefense spending--hear me now--the cap for nondefense spending \nwould be set at a level requiring a cut of $19 billion in budget \nauthority below this year's spending level. In other words, section 210 \nof the budget resolution now before the Senate would take away from the \nAppropriations Committee the ability to determine, through their \ncommittee markups, what the appropriate levels of defense spending or \ndomestic spending should be.\n  Imagine that. How silly can we get? The Appropriations Committee is \nbeing prevented from using the judgment of its members, their \nexpertise, to decide even the most basic levels of defense and domestic \nspending for this Nation. Instead, this budget resolution sets that \nfigure. I have been on the Appropriations Committee now going on 42 \nyears. That is longer than anybody has ever served. The budget \nresolution sets that figure for the Appropriations Committee prior to \ntheir even having finished their hearings. The Budget Committee will \nhave usurped all of those decisions with the construction of these \nfirewalls.\n  I believe this is unwarranted and unacceptable micromanagement on the \npart of some Members. I don't blame all of the members of the Budget \nCommittee. I know they have their problems. I have great respect for \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee. He has always been very fair to \nme. He sits on the Appropriations Committee likewise. He knows what \nthis does to the Appropriations Committee. He is trying to do a good \njob and he does a splendid job. But a lot of these things, those who \nare in the driver's seat at a particular given moment have the votes, \nand those who would do otherwise, such as Senator Stevens, in other \ncases, or Senator Domenici, they have to look at the votes.\n  I thought we had all learned our lesson about substituting structural \ndevices for human judgment with the Gramm-Rudman experience. Setting up \nprocedural barricades often creates more problems than are solved when \nit comes to funding real priorities for a vast and complex nation. \nAutopilot politics amounts to an abdication of our responsibility to \ndebate and weigh reasonable alternatives, as we are expected to do and \nas we are elected to do by the people.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, my good \nfriend, Senator Stevens, is one of the most knowledgeable experts in \nthe history of the Senate when it comes to the funding needs of the \nDepartment of Defense. Do we have to squander his experience and the \naccumulated expertise of the members of the Appropriations Committee? \nHere sits one on my left, Senator Inouye. He is on the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee of the Senate.\n  Do we have to squander their experience, their accumulated expertise, \nby constructing these mindless, artificial firewalls which attempt to \ngame the funding process before it is even begun? Well, these sections, \nI assure you, my fellow Senators, will greatly increase the difficulty \nfaced by the Appropriations chairman in marking up and presenting to \nthe Senate the 13 fiscal year 2001 appropriations bills. The speed and \nefficiency sought by all of us to get this essential work done will not \nbe aided by these unwise and irresponsible budget barnacles. Let us \nscrape them off before they do their damage.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left of my 9 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair. I know that my remarks tonight will \nresult in no favorable action that will override the die that has \nalready been cast. I am confident of that. And to that extent, they \nwere remarks made in futility. But for the record they were not futile.\n  I think that we should let the people know what is being done here. \nThe people out there want us to use our best judgment in the \nAppropriations Committee and to have our hands free when it comes to \nappropriating funds for disaster. We can't foresee those. They may \nstrike my State next. They may strike the State of any Senator who sits \nwithin the sound of my voice; they may be the next. In all my years, I \nhave never voted against a dollar for any State that has been hit with \na disaster, and I don't expect to ever do that.\n  I don't think we ought to be handcuffed and gagged and bound foot and \nhand when it comes to dealing with emergencies. Now we are going to \nhave a supermajority thrust upon us. We have been laboring under that \nprocess. I had hoped that we could rid ourselves of those shackles--not \nfor ourselves but for our people. Well, Mr. President, the wheel goes \naround and some day perhaps we will come to our senses and throw off \nthese shackles and get back to where we are free agents and can act in \nthe best interests of our constituents, without having to overcome \nsupermajorities such as are being imposed upon us here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator from Nevada yield so I may make one \ncomment? I will use 1 minute of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want the Senator from West Virginia to \nknow I appreciate the restraint that he has used in coming out on the \nprocedure we followed. In my judgment, there was no alternative. I \nagree with much of what the Senator from West Virginia has said. But \nthe necessity for obtaining a budget resolution soon so we can get on \nwith our business on appropriations motivated me to join with my good \nfriend from New Mexico. I think the Senator understands that problem, \nand I do thank him for his restraint in commenting upon my behavior \nhere today.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may retain a minute. I wasn't \ncommenting on the behavior of my distinguished friend. I understand his \nsituation, and I have no quarrel with him, no complaint; I only have \nadmiration for him. I am sorry for the circumstances with which he has \nto deal. I hope those circumstances will change.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the staff of the minority \nleader, and we are going to be here forever tomorrow if we don't get \ncopies of the amendments. Both sides should make sure that the other \nside has copies of the amendments. We are now up to 153 amendments that \nwill be voted on or disposed of in some manner. We hope they are \ndisposed of. So I hope the majority will do everything they can to make \nsure the minority staff has copies of the amendments so we can move on.\n  At this time, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New York, who has \nbeen so instrumental in all matters before the Senate during his term.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator from New York yield for a unanimous \nconsent request first?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that votes \nrelative to the following amendments be scheduled to occur at the \nexpiration of time on the budget resolution, they occur in the sequence \nlisted, with no second-degree amendments in order, and there be 2 \nminutes prior to each vote for explanation, and all votes after the \nfirst\n\n[[Page S2329]]\n\nvote in the sequence be limited to 10 minutes. The amendments are as \nfollows: the Stevens amendment, No. 2931; the Robb amendment, No. 2965 \nand, if not tabled, then votes in relation to the Reed of Rhode Island \namendment, No. 3013; and the Coverdell amendment, No. 3010.\n  Mr. REID. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Therefore, several votes will occur beginning at \napproximately 8:15, is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This evening, in a stacked sequence, as just agreed \nupon by the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork, hoping that next year he will be with the majority.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Nevada. I would love to call \nhim majority whip, a job he would perform as admirably well as he does \nthe job minority whip. I thank him for his friendship and leadership. I \nalso thank my friend from West Virginia. It is always a pleasure to sit \non the floor and listen to his words and his wisdom.\n  I rise in support of the amendment of Senator Reed, my good friend \nfrom Rhode Island, who has done such a fabulous job with his leadership \non this budget, on closing the gun show loophole, the Lautenberg \namendment, which passed this body a while back. I will address one \npoint. My colleagues laid out very well the many reasons to be for the \nReed amendment. I want to add an additional reason.\n  The only argument that we have heard from the National Rifle \nAssociation, and others, against closing the gun show loophole is that \nallowing for a 3-day waiting period would effectively shut down gun \nshows because they are weekend operations. They argue if somebody \nbought a gun on Saturday morning and it took 72 hours to check, by then \nit would be Tuesday morning and the gun show, which predominates on the \nweekend--something that I stipulate is true--would be closed.\n  Fortunately, one of our colleagues--somebody with whom I disagree, \nSenator Craig Thomas of Wyoming--asked the GAO to do a report on \npurchases at gun shows. This is what the report said, and I urge my \ncolleagues to read it. It didn't get much publicity, but I think it is \ndispositive in this debate. The report debunks the myth that the 3-day \nwaiting period will shut down gun shows. This is what the report \nshowed, colleagues, and I hope people will listen because I think it is \nimportant: ``Seventy-eight percent of all the instant checks are \ncompleted within 3 minutes.'' That means 78 percent of those guns \nchecked at gun shows--because we believe they would be no different \nthan others--would be purchasable within 3 minutes. And 95 percent are \ncompleted within 2 hours. So the person would go to a gun show and be \nable to buy the gun in 2 hours. That is 19 of every 20 purchases. And \nonly 5 percent take more than 1 day to complete.\n  Now, you say, what about those 5 percent? Why should we hold them up? \nWell, let me tell you why, my colleagues. Those 5 percent are far and \naway the most likely Brady checks to turn up a felon. In fact, it is 20 \ntimes more likely that the 5 percent of the checks that take more than \n1 day will show up a felon than in the 95 percent where the check takes \n3 minutes or 2 hours.\n  The background check won't affect gun shows more than a pittance. \nNinety-five percent of all guns will be able to be purchased by people \nwho have the right to purchase those guns having passed the Brady check \nwithin 2 hours.\n  My colleagues, there is no reason why we can't pass the Lautenberg \namendment, as the Reed amendment exhorts us to do, because very simply \nit is not going to close down gun shows.\n  Will it stop a good number of felons from receiving guns? By all \nmeans. That is the purpose. I don't think anybody in this body would \nchallenge the fact that we don't want felons to receive guns.\n  Second, perhaps tomorrow, probably in the vote-arama, the Senator \nfrom Illinois and I will offer an amendment on enforcement. I know he \nwill address that at great length. But that amendment does just what \nmany who disagree with us on gun control have asked us to do. They \nsaid: Why don't we enforce the present law?\n  The fact is, that every time we try to increase enforcement by adding \nATF agents and giving those agents more authority, we have been opposed \nby the very people who are asking us for enforcement.\n  But there is real hope. Something called Project Exile, supported by \nthe NRA and by Chuck Schumer, has now sprung up and has done well in \nthree cities, including Rochester in my State.\n  Last year on this floor, when we debated the budget, we added some \n$50 million to Project Exile. And now four cities in my State of New \nYork--Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany --will get the advantage \nof Project Exile.\n  The NRA and gun control advocates such as myself have agreed on this \nissue. Perhaps we can agree on more. I hope we will get universal \nsupport for the Durbin-Schumer amendment.\n  Getting back to the other Reed amendment, I hope my colleagues will \nlisten to the facts that I gave out. If we would agree to the Reed \namendment, we would ratify the Lautenberg amendment as passed out in \nthe conference, and we would move forward on an issue that is so vital \nfor the safety of Americans and for the future of our country.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his generosity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nVermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Mexico, \nespecially for his leadership on the Budget Committee and for his \nefforts in 1997 which greatly contributed to the fiscal policy that has \nled this country from an era of deficits to an era in which we \nanticipate budget surpluses for the foreseeable future.\n  He has had a challenging job crafting budget resolutions that balance \nthe many real and competing needs of the Nation. He has been a strong \nadvocate for education and an even stronger advocate for funding IDEA. \nIn fact, last year, I joined him in calling for an increase in \neducation funding of $40 billion over five years. Regrettably our \ncolleagues on the House Budget Committee did not share this commitment.\n  This year he has, once again, taken up the challenge of balancing the \ncompeting needs. The budget resolution that he has brought before us is \na product of difficult negotiations between competing viewpoints.\n  Because of my deep respect for him, I do not come to the floor with \nan amendment lightly. I come to the floor with an amendment only \nbecause of my conviction that there is a Federal obligation that must \nnow be met in full.\n  This amendment, which I will offer tomorrow, has been cosponsored by \nSenators Dodd, Stevens, Kennedy, Collins, Feingold, Snowe, Chafee, \nHarkin, Leahy, Kohl, and Mikulski, among others.\n  I will begin my remarks with a question to which I will time and time \nagain return. In 1974 we made a commitment to fully fund IDEA. If 25 \nyears later we cannot meet this commitment in an era of unprecedented \neconomic prosperity and budgetary surpluses, when do we plan to keep \nthis pledge.\n  The American people have a right to ask us--If not now, then when?\n  In the early years, when we were running large budget deficits, it \nwas understandable that we couldn't meet those commitments.\n  During those same years this body, by almost unanimous votes, voted--\n99 Members sometimes--that ``when feasible'' we would fully fund our \ncommitment to our States and our school districts. That time has come. \nWe now have large surpluses with more than enough resources to meet our \ncommitment now and well into the future.\n  I have behind me a chart which compares the funding levels in my \namendment with the funding levels in this budget resolution and with \nthe levels that will be required to fully fund IDEA. This shows where \nfull funding is.\n\n[[Page S2330]]\n\n This shows the bipartisan amendment I will be offering and how it will \ntake us to full funding. And this is where we will be if we do nothing \nbut live within this budget that is before us. Make no mistake. The \nbudget resolution before us does not fully fund IDEA. Despite the \nrepeated pledges we have made to fully fund IDEA, this budget \nresolution sends a clear message that this body has no intention of \nfulfilling this commitment anytime in the next five years.\n  I was one of the few, now in this body, that were present at the time \nthat P.L. 94-142, The Education of all Handicapped Act was passed. As a \nfreshman Member of Congress, I was proud to sponsor that legislation \nand to be named as a member of the House and Senate conference \ncommittee along with then Vermont Senator Bob Stafford.\n  At that time, despite a clear Constitutional obligation to educate \nall children, regardless of disability, thousands of disabled students \nwere denied access to a public education. Passage of the Education of \nAll Handicapped Act offered financial incentives to states to fulfill \nthis existing obligation. Recognizing that the costs associated with \neducating these children was more than many school districts could bear \nalone, we pledged to pay 40% of the costs of educating these students.\n  We pledged to pay 40% of these costs but we never have. We have \ncontinuously claimed that we couldn't afford to. We started in 1976 \nwith 12.5%. Then we slipped to 6%. Those were tough budget deficit \ntimes. Lately we have come up to 13 percent--still less than \\1/3\\ of \nour pledge.\n\n  Today, however, instead of making good on our promise now, those who \nobject to my amendment cry, that would be mandatory spending--that's \nbad. How can it be bad policy to fund this vital program that we have \nguaranteed to fully fund--over and over again? It is now feasible. It \nis now painlessly possible and it must be done.\n  We must pay our share of educating children with disabilities. No \nmore excuses. The time is now.\n  I know that there is some disagreement about whether or not a \ncommitment was made. I want to tell you as someone that was there at \nthe time that we made a pledge to fully fund this program.\n  The time is now.\n  I didn't have to ask my constituents in Vermont whether the Federal \ngovernment made a commitment. I will show you what I got when I was \nhome. This is a petition from every school district in the State of \nVermont that says: Do what you promised to do; fund IDEA; fund special \neducation. The chart behind me shows you what those petitions look \nlike.\n  Vermonters know that we made that commitment. Passing this amendment \nwill do more to help our school districts meet their obligation to \nimprove education in this country than nearly anything else we can do. \nOur amendment will triple what they presently receive. We promised. We \nshould deliver it. The time to make good on this promise is now.\n  Now some of you may think that because you were not here in 1975 that \nyou were not party to a pledge to fully fund IDEA.\n  In 1997 Congress once again took up this landmark legislation. This \nis a complex bill that has profound impact on classrooms across the \nNation. With the strong leadership of Senator Lott, Senator Frist, \nSenator Gregg, Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, Senator Harkin, Senator \nCollins and others on my Committee, we passed the first reauthorization \nof IDEA in 22 years. It is an accomplishment that we are all very proud \nof.\n  At that time, we reaffirmed our commitment to pay 40% of the costs of \neducating these children. We made this pledge to families, to school \nboards, and to the Governors of our States. Over the past three years, \nwith the leadership of my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, \nwe have made some progress.\n  But as he has pointed out several times over the past year, we are \nonly supporting 13 percent of these costs. In 1975, we made a pledge \nwhich we did not keep. In 1997 we made that same pledge once again when \nwe reauthorized IDEA.\n  I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle; If not now, then \nWhen?\n  In the 105th Congress we felt it important to reaffirm our commitment \nto full funding for IDEA. We added language to the FY 1999 Budget that \nstated that IDEA should be fully funded as soon as feasible. This \nlanguage was adopted unanimously by the Senate. At that time, we still \nfaced budget deficits and it was argued that full funding was not \nfeasible. Today, however, in an era of unprecedented economic \nprosperity and with budget surpluses projected far into the future, \nfull funding is within our grasp.\n  If not now, then when?\n  In the 106th Congress we continued to press for full funding for \nIDEA. The FY 2000 budget resolution made room for about a $500,000,000 \nincrease in funding for IDEA. Once again, the Senate adopted language \nthat I advocated with Senator Gregg calling for full funding of IDEA as \nsoon as feasible. The House of Representatives adopted a bipartisan \nfree standing resolution that called for full funding.\n  The budget resolution that is before us assumes that funding for IDEA \nwill increase by $1 billion in FY 2001 and $2.5 billion in FY 2002. If \nthere is time remaining, I will take time later on to discuss my \nconcerns about whether these assumptions require cuts in other programs \nthat we will not have the will to make at the end of the day. What is \nvery clear, however, is that this budget resolution does not claim to \nfulfill our obligation to fully fund IDEA. The budget resolution \nassumes that the Federal government will never fund more than about 20% \nof the costs of educating disabled students. One half of what we have \npromised over and over again.\n\n  If our amendment fails, adoption of this budget resolution will state \nclearly to the Nation that this Congress does not intend to fulfill its \ncommitment any time in the next five years.\n  Our amendment is simple. It provides a path by which we will achieve \nfull funding for IDEA in fiscal year 2005. It sends a clear message to \nthe Nation that we, as a body, make good on the commitments we make.\n  I want to tell you that I am tired of being party to promises that \nthis body hasn't kept. The time is now.\n  I urge you to ask your people back in your state. Ask parents, \nteachers, and education administrators. Ask your governors. ``What \nwould you prefer--the possibility of a future tax cut, or fully funding \nIDEA so you can have more money for education, and pay less property \ntaxes?''\n  Fulfill the pledge that you made to your people. I tell you that if \nyou want a hero's welcome, you will vote in favor of this. If it wins, \nlet me tell you that they will be out on the streets marching to meet \nyou when you come home. If you do not, I wouldn't want to go home.\n  Tomorrow morning I will have a chance to drive this point home once \nagain. Tonight I want to close by thanking my cosponsors for their \nstalwart commitment to fully funding IDEA. Senator Stevens, Chairman of \nthe Appropriations, has been a strong advocate for IDEA. Senator \nFeingold has worked closely with me on this amendment and has been \ninstrumental to getting us to the place we are today. Senator Collins \nhas worked long and hard to persuade members of this body that we \nshould fully fund IDEA. I also want to thank Senators Dodd and Kennedy \nand Harkin with whom I have worked for many many years to improve \neducational opportunities for disabled students. Similarly, I am \ngrateful for the efforts of Senator Snowe and Senator Chafee. I feel \nconfident that with their efforts, our amendment will prevail.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from New Jersey 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid of Nevada for \ngiving me the time earlier in the debate.\n  My colleague from North Carolina, Mr. Edwards, rose to remind our \ncolleagues that while the flooding earlier in the year may be over and \nnot in the headlines of our newspapers, Hurricane Floyd is still a \nreality for many communities around our country.\n  Towns such as Bound Brook, NJ--and, as indeed Mr. Edwards pointed \nout, Princeville, NC--Florida to Maine, Hurricane Floyd left a path of \ndestruction so large that FEMA declared it to\n\n[[Page S2331]]\n\nbe the eighth worst disaster of the decade. In New Jersey by \ncomparison, it was worse:\n  Two-hundred and fifty-three municipalities in New Jersey, the \npopulations of 4.2 million people, were stricken.\n  More than 43,000 structures, including homes, schools, and \nbusinesses, suffered severe damage.\n  Over 20,000 residents of New Jersey alone applied for Federal \nassistance, and municipalities submitted over 2,000 requests for public \nassistance to remove debris or to repair damages.\n  While FEMA has led an effort of providing assistance to homeowners, \nthe greatest problem is how to rebuild their own economic \ninfrastructure.\n  Bound Brook, NJ, alone, a community that was entirely inundated by \nthis flooding, lost 7 percent of its annual revenue and 37 percent of \nits property value. A month after Floyd, the New Jersey government \nappropriated $80 million for disaster relief.\n  The reality is that the magnitude of the loss is so overwhelming \nthat, without Federal aid, these communities will not simply suffer--\nsome will actually cease to exist.\n  Main Streets were inundated, businesses lost, local governments lost \nrevenues.\n  They will close their doors and no longer be the communities where \npeople live and work.\n  The amendment I have offered with Mr. Edwards provides needed \nresources by increasing funding for communities in a regional \ndevelopment by $250 million. It includes $150 million for community \ndevelopment block grants; $50 million for the EDA; $50 million for \ncommunity facilities block grants.\n  This, my colleagues, is not an unusual approach. In 1997 the \nsupplemental disaster bill provided flood aid for the upper Midwest of \n$500 million for communities in desperate need in North and South \nDakota and Minnesota.\n  In 1998, the disaster supplemental bill provided $250 million for \ncommunity development block grants in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, \nMississippi, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands as they recovered from \nHurricane George.\n  Now we return to those States damaged from Florida to Maine, \nparticularly in North Carolina, Delaware, Maryland, New York, and New \nJersey. Hurricane Floyd destroyed many of our communities. We need this \nCongress to respond again.\n  Tomorrow this amendment will be offered. I hope in this budget \nresolution we can make room for this $250 million to respond to the \nneed of these communities.\n  I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I would like to discuss very briefly the \nTorricelli-Edwards amendment on hurricane relief. First of all, let me \nsay what is happening in North Carolina, 7 months after the hurricane \nhit. We still have more than 8,000 people who live in trailers that \nhave been provided by FEMA. We have many other people who are living \nwith families and friends. We have roads and bridges that were washed \nout by the flood that are still not repaired. We have, literally, towns \nthat have been wiped out, places such as Princeville, Tarboro, all \nsmaller towns in eastern North Carolina, that were devastated.\n  The people whose lives have been destroyed in North Carolina as a \nresult of Hurricane Floyd are completely innocent. They are people who \nfor generations have been law-abiding, taxpaying citizens, and for the \nfirst time in their lives, instead of writing tax checks to go to \nWashington, they are asking for something in return. If our Government \ncannot respond to a crisis such as Hurricane Floyd, we serve absolutely \nno purpose.\n  Our people in North Carolina are hurting and they need help. This \namendment provides for $250 million for those programs that would best \naddress the needs of the people in 13 States, not only North Carolina, \nthat were devastated by Hurricane Floyd.\n  These are the components. First, $50 million for economic \ndevelopment. These communities that have been destroyed need long-term \nrelief plans, and they need the resources to develop and implement \nthose plans. Places such as Princeville and Tarboro that were literally \ncompletely wiped out by the hurricane have lost wastewater treatment \nplants, plants that have to be replaced. We have to provide the \nresources for that.\n  There is $150 million in community block grants. North Carolina has \nimminent emergency housing needs. Our State has responded by providing \nmillions and millions and millions of dollars in State money to help \nwith these needs. These are people who were in rental housing who have \nno place to live now. That rental housing will never be replaced if we \ndo not provide the resources to do it. It is going to leave literally \nthousands of North Carolinians with no place to live, without a home--\nfamilies totally wiped out.\n  Finally, there is $50 million for community facilities in a grant \nprogram which is specifically designed to address the needs of \nindividual communities. For example, Princeville lost its fire station; \nthe town of Windsor lost its library. These are things that need to be \nreplaced, and these folks need help.\n  My people in North Carolina do not ask this Senate for a handout. \nThey are doing everything they know how to do. The people of North \nCarolina have responded heroically to this tragedy. The State of North \nCarolina has responded by providing hundreds of millions of dollars--\nunprecedented in the history of this country. All they are saying now \nis that it is time for the Federal Government in Washington to respond \nin a responsible way, and to provide these folks whose lives have been \ndevastated, whose communities have been completely wiped out, with the \nhelp they so desperately need.\n  They are not asking for a handout. They are asking us to do what any \nresponsible Federal Government would do under these circumstances, \nwhich is to provide them with the resources to put themselves back on \ntheir feet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Maine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee. He has \ndone a terrific job. I thank Senator Reid as well for yielding me time \nso I can discuss this very important matter.\n  I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator Jeffords' amendment to \nfinally start on the path toward paying the share of special education \ncosts that the Federal Government promised to pay when the legislation \nwas passed 25 years ago.\n  During the last recess of the Senate, I met with more than 70 \nsuperintendents and principals from northern and eastern Maine to \ndiscuss education issues. Originally, my thought was to discuss the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but the \nNo. 1 issue on their minds was the escalating costs of meeting the \nneeds of children with special needs, the costs of special education.\n  If the U.S. Government kept the promise it made back in 1975, it \nwould mean an additional $60 million to the schools in the State of \nMaine. That is money that would free up other money so that schools \ncould meet their own needs--whether this is hiring more teachers, \nimproving their libraries, upgrading their science labs or providing \nspecial professional development--whatever the need of that particular \nschool and that particular community.\n  If we take this step of starting to meet our obligations under the \nspecial education law, it will make a tremendous difference not only to \nthe schools in Maine but to schools throughout our country. The \nJeffords-Collins amendment would mean an additional $155 million to the \nschools of Maine over the next 5 years.\n  I am very pleased to be an original cosponsor. This has been one of \nmy priorities since my election to the Senate. I know it is the No. 1 \npriority of the school districts in the State of Maine.\n  I thank my colleagues for making the time available to me. If I have \nadditional time, I yield it back to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                Amendments Nos. 2932 and 3009 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I wish to use the remaining time to \nwithdraw amendment 2932 and amendment 3009. I ask unanimous consent \nthey be withdrawn.\n\n[[Page S2332]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 2932 and 3009) were withdrawn.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank those who listened regarding the \nappropriations process and the actions we have taken to try to assure \nwe will have the ability to meet the needs of the Nation. It is a very \ntrying process. I think the compromise we have worked out will be \nenough for us to do our work. I am indebted to the chairman of the \nBudget Committee and all who have worked on this matter.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have two observations.\n  I wish Senator Byrd were on the floor. He spoke about the 60-vote \npoint of order in terms of history, and what great Americans have said \nabout supermajority being applicable in the year we are in, and the 60-\nvote point of order on emergencies. We have passed very large emergency \nappropriations for agriculture. In fact, I think it might have been as \nmuch as $8 billion. Nobody raised a point of order. There was no point \nof order voted upon.\n  We had hurricane assistance; we had Y2K emergency assistance, all of \nwhich fell within the purview of meeting 60 votes. Nobody raised it. \nHad they raised it, it would have gotten 60 votes.\n  I don't believe what is being predicted will happen. I believe when \nthere are real emergencies, they will get adopted on the floor of the \nSenate and nobody will even raise that 60 votes. If they do, they will \nget 60 votes.\n  My last observation is we have lots of 60 vote points of order in the \nBudget Act, some of which the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nhas supported in the past. We entered into a 5-year agreement with the \nPresident, bipartisan, both Houses, with a firewall on defense for the \nfirst 3 of the 5 years. We lived with it in exactly the way that has \nserved the distinguished Senator tonight. But it succeeded. The cap on \ndefense was high enough for defense, and none of the defense was used \nfor domestic for the first 3 years of the agreement to balance the \nbudget.\n  I think it will work again, especially with the modifications we have \nadded tonight.\n  I yield whatever time I had remaining.\n  Mr. REID. I miscalculated the time when I spoke earlier, and I still \nhave 7 minutes. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Durbin on the Reed \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada. April 20, 1999, is a day \nwe will remember for a long time in America. That was the day of the \nColumbine High School shooting. Remember when you first heard about it? \nYou remember the first time you saw the scenes on television, with the \nhigh school kids running away from the school? There was one poor young \nman who had been shot, dragging himself out of a window, trying to \nescape the shooting taking place.\n  America was stunned. Colorado was stunned. This Congress was stunned. \nWe responded by passing legislation, with the help of Vice President \nGore, which did three things to try to reduce gun violence in America.\n  First, a background check at gun shows so that the people who buy \nguns at those shows would be subject to the same questions and \ninquiries as those who go to gun dealers. We don't want to sell guns to \ncriminals. We don't want to sell them to kids. We certainly don't want \nto see gun shows as a loophole for selling guns to those who shouldn't \nown them.\n  Second, trigger locks so if guns are going to be stored they are \nstored safely and securely so a young child can't pick it up and hurt \nhimself or others.\n  Third, the prohibition against those high capacity ammo clips that \nwere being brought in from overseas that turn an ordinary gun into a \ndangerous, murderous weapon. Three very sensible changes for gun safety \nin America. It only passed because Vice President Gore showed up on the \nfloor to break the tie. But we thought the Congress had learned a \nlesson from Columbine, not just for the Members of Congress and \nfamilies across America, but for the students who go to school across \nAmerica and want to be in safe buildings.\n\n  That bill passed the Senate, and it has been sitting over in the \nHouse of Representatives in a conference committee that refuses to call \nit for consideration. My colleague, Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, \nbelieves that on the anniversary of Columbine we owe it, not only to \nthe families in Colorado but across the Nation, to consider this \nimportant legislation. I support him completely. Close the loopholes, \nkeep guns out of the hands of criminals and kids.\n  Second, tomorrow I will be offering an amendment which addresses the \ngun issue from a different perspective. There are some who say: Oh, you \ndon't need to close the loopholes. I disagree with them. I think we \nneed to close them. They say, instead, we need more enforcement. Let's \nhave people who are going to investigate and prosecute gun criminals. \nPut them in jail.\n  Do you know what? I agree with them. But I think we need both. Close \nthe loopholes and make sure we have the resources for enforcement of \ngun laws. The amendment I will offer tomorrow, with Senator Schumer of \nNew York, my seatmate here on the floor of the Senate, provides the \nPresident's initiative: 500 new ATF investigators to look after the gun \ndealers across America, to make certain they are not selling guns to \nthe wrong people.\n  Are they? You bet they are. Out of 80,000 gun dealers across America, \nwe have traced gun crimes and found that the guns for 57 percent of the \ncriminals in America come from 1,000 gun dealers out of 80,000. What it \ntells us is the overwhelming percentage of gun dealers across America \nare obeying the law. But there are bad people out there who are \nlicensed gun dealers who are breaking the law and giving guns to \ncriminals who commit crimes with those guns and harass us in our \nneighborhoods and our schools. My amendment creates more enforcement \nauthority to keep those gun dealers from breaking the law.\n  Next, more prosecutors. It is not enough to arrest somebody. You need \na prosecuting attorney at the State, local, or Federal level, who is \ngoing to put that person behind bars. I say to the National Rifle \nAssociation and all the people who speak for them, if we are going to \nhave enforcement, vote for the Durbin amendment so you have the \nresources at ATF and across the Nation to make sure gun laws are \nenforced.\n  It is a complementary approach: Close the loopholes, increase the \nenforcement, and let us hope in the near term, in the near future, we \ncan say this Congress responded in a way that answers to American \nfamilies that we heard the cries of the parents and the families at \nColumbine and we responded to them. We should not leave ourselves in a \nposition where we back off from our responsibility because of any \nspecial interest group.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 1 minute. The \nSenator from New Mexico has 3 minutes. The Senator from Nevada has 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield my time.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the time of the minority.\n\n\n                Vote On Amendment No. 2931, as modified\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back my time and ask for a vote on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2931, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2931), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2965\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Is it not correct \nthat the Robb amendment, No. 2965, is now pending for a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There are 2 minutes? I waive my minute if the minority \nwill waive its minute.\n  Mr. REID. We waive our minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the Robb amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page S2333]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n2965. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced, yeas 54, nays 45, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 62 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--45\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Sessions\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, that was a 35-minute vote. I apologize for \nletting it go on that long. You can see how hard it is going to be to \nget through a vote-arama if we do that. Our plan now is to have two \nmore votes tonight. If Senators would stay in the Chamber or close to \nthe Chamber, we could do those votes in no more than 15 or 20 minutes. \nMaybe we could cut the second one down to 10. That would certainly \nhelp.\n  We are now ready to go into the period for the votes on the number of \namendments that are pending, the so-called vote-arama.\n  Having said that, any Senator who has timely filed their amendment at \nthe desk can call it up for Senate consideration. However, there is no \nallotted time for debate.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that, as we did last year, in a \nway that I think is the fairest to try to explain what the amendments \nare, in that brief period of time, there be 2 minutes equally divided \nprior to each vote for explanation, and all votes in the vote-arama be \nlimited to 10 minutes each after the first vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I just suggest that we \nalso ensure that either side has at least a block of five amendments \nthat are going to be offered so we can look at them ahead of time. \nNobody knows, on either side, what the amendments are. If we can at \nleast take them five by five, we can analyze them and decide whether we \nwill table them, second degree them, or whatever. I think it is very \nimportant to do that. I suggest that as well.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that is obviously a good suggestion. Let me add to \nthis, if I could, Mr. President, that we are going to go forward with \ntwo more amendments tonight, one on each side--the Bond amendment on \nour side and the Reed amendment on their side. After that, we are going \nto stop for tonight because we still have a large number of amendments \nthat have not been able to be worked through. I am going to ask the \nmanagers on both sides to get all these amendments lined up and to get \nthe first five on each side ready for in the morning so we won't have \nto wait until we come in. Also, we will come in at 9 o'clock so we can \nget an early as possible start. Some would like to be able to go home \nor do commitments as early as possible. But as it now stands, because \nof the number of amendments and the fact that we haven't had an \nopportunity to line up all the amendments in order, the managers \nrequested we do it this way.\n\n  I emphasize that as soon as we finish the votes on amendments that \nare offered, and a vote is required, when we finish those, we will be \nthrough. So you may want to take that into consideration as to whether \nor not you insist on your amendment tomorrow. We can finish at 10 or 11 \no'clock, or 12, but we need to go ahead and complete that.\n  Having said that, I am looking that way, but I could more easily be \nlooking our way. A lot of amendments are still pending on both sides \nthat really could be handled in some other way. I hope Senators will \nconsider doing that. I thank the managers for the time they spent and \nthe cooperation we have been getting from Senator Daschle and Senator \nReid doing his usual good job. But our managers need this time tonight \nand early in the morning to start getting amendments racked up so we \ncan vote on the first five.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wonder if the majority leader might \nentertain having a 10-minute vote on the first vote now. We have all \ncome to vote. It seems we can accelerate that process.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will accept that suggestion.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to ask this. Can't we \nlimit the clock and keep the promise to 10 minutes instead of having 1 \nor 2 persons cause the other 98 to be here?\n  Mr. LOTT. We can do that. It requires that Senators stay here and \nthat we stay attentive and say ``turn it in.'' We are trying to be \nconsiderate of both sides. Obviously, we need to stop. If we get \nunanimous consent for it to be 10 minutes, we will stop it. I amend the \nUC so that we may have 2 minutes equally divided on each amendment and \nthat this vote and the next vote be 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2913\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of Senate against the Federal funding of \n                              smoke shops)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2913.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE AGAINST FEDERAL FUNDING OF SMOKE \n                   SHOPS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Smoking begun by children during their teen years and \n     even earlier turns the lives of far too many Americans into \n     nightmares decades later, plagued by disease and premature \n     death.\n       (2) The Federal Government should leave a legacy of more \n     healthy Americans and fewer victims of tobacco-related \n     illness.\n       (3) Efforts by the Federal Government should seek to \n     protect young people from the dangers of smoking.\n       (4) Discount tobacco stores, sometimes known as smoke \n     shops, operate to sell high volumes of cigarettes and other \n     tobacco products, often at significantly reduced prices, with \n     each tobacco outlet often selling millions of discount \n     cigarettes each year.\n       (5) Studies by the Surgeon General and the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention demonstrate that children are \n     particularly susceptible to price differentials in \n     cigarettes, such as those available through smoke shop \n     discounts.\n       (6) The Department of Housing and Urban Development is \n     using Federal funds for grants to construct not less than 6 \n     smoke shops or facilities that contain a smoke shop.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budget levels in this resolution assume that no \n     Federal funds may be used by the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development to provide any grant or other assistance to \n     construct, operate, or otherwise benefit a smoke shop or \n     other tobacco outlet.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment simply says the Department of \nHUD should stop using community development block grant funds to build \ndiscount cigarette stores known as smoke shops.\n\n[[Page S2334]]\n\n  A year ago, a doctor called up and said there was a new discount \nsmoke shop in his neighborhood and it was funded by Federal dollars. I \ndidn't know what the sign said, so I sent staff out. Here it is: Smoke \nShop, Discount Tobacco. Our policy is supposed to discourage cigarette \nsmoking. Inside, we found wall-to-wall cigarettes, 25 percent or more \noff. These are your tax dollars at work.\n  Instead of funding what we could have funded, $4.2 million went to \nsix of these in the last 3 years--instead of building a water tower or \nelders' wellness centers.\n  I wrote to HUD and said stop funding them. The letter I got back from \nthe assistant said: You haven't proven that discount cigarettes \nencourage smoking. Well, it is about time we taught HUD some common \nsense. The Secretary of Housing now says: If you tell me to stop \nfunding it, if you stop me from funding them, I will stop.\n  I urge colleagues to vote aye.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am against smoking, but this amendment \npicks on Indians. Why don't we include all discount tobacco stores? Why \ndon't we include Wal-Mart, Kmart, and all these places that sell \ndiscount tobacco? Why just pick on Indians?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the amendment says we should not fund any \ndiscount smoke shops. It doesn't say Indians.\n  Mr. INOUYE. The Senator's sense of the Senate mentions Indians, \nIndian smoke shops.\n  Mr. BOND. It does not.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am against this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, and I hope we will vote it down.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, in 1997 this body considered wide-\nsweeping tobacco legislation and the Indian Affairs Committee held \nseveral hearings on the issue and in fact reported a bill to reduce \nsmoking in Native communities.\n  The rate of smoking in Native communities is the highest in the \ncountry and Natives suffer emphysema, lung cancer, and related problems \nas a result of that smoking.\n  The resolution we are now considering would as a practical matter \napply to smoke-shops that offer ``discount tobacco'' products without \ndefining that term.\n  There are ``discount cigarette'' stores right across the river in \nVirginia, there are ``discount tobacco'' outlets in airports around the \ncountry, and there are ``discount stores'' on Indian lands.\n  Now, if this resolution were to apply to all tobacco outlets, I would \nsupport it. I am dismayed that Secretary Cuomo would support the \namendment given that it would not affect Community Development Block \nGrant funds for non-Indian tobacco outlets.\n  As a practical matter only Indian outlets are affected and there are \nno potential non-Indian tobacco sellers that would be affected. Though \nit may not be the preferred economic activity of some in this chamber, \nmany Indian tribes rely on selling tobacco, which is a legal commodity, \nto generate revenues.\n  The targeted nature of this resolution as well as the economic \nhardships created by it led me to support the Vice Chairman of the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, Senator Inouye, and his Motion to Table \nthe Bond Amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2913.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2913.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask that we proceed to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 2913. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nclerk will call the roll on the motion to table.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2964.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Chafee, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2964.\n\n  Mr. REED. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE NEED TO REDUCE GUN \n                   VIOLENCE IN AMERICA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) On average, 12 children die from gun fire everyday in \n     America.\n       (2) On May 20, 1999, the Senate passed the Violent and \n     Repeat Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act, by a \n     vote of 73 to 25, in part, to stem gun-related violence in \n     the United States.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in function 750 of this resolution assume \n     that Congress should--\n       (1) pass the conference report to accompany H.R. 1501, the \n     Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and \n     Rehabilitation Act, including Senate-passed provisions, with \n     the purpose of limiting access to firearms by juveniles, \n     convicted felons, and other persons prohibited by law from \n     purchasing or possessing firearms; and\n       (2) consider H.R. 1501 not later than April 20, 2000.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, several weeks ago, the Treasury \nDepartment and HUD made a significant announcement on Smith and \nWesson's willingness to make guns safer and keep them out of the hands \nof criminals.\n  Momentum is building for Congress to break the stranglehold of the \nNational Rifle Association. It is appalling that this Republican \nCongress refuses to respond to the urgent need for responsible gun \ncontrol. Our Republican colleagues should stop listening to the \nNational Rifle Association and start listening to the American people. \nThe American people and America's children are calling on Congress to \nmove\n\n[[Page S2335]]\n\nforward on commonsense gun provisions.\n  The National Rifle Association continues to talk about Second \nAmendment rights. But we say what about the right to live of the 12 \nchildren a day, every day, who die because of firearms in this country? \nWhat about the right of citizens to be free from crime, when criminals \ncan go to gun shows and purchase weapons without a background check? \nWhat about the right of law-abiding citizens to live peaceably in their \nneighborhoods? It is time for Congress to stop kowtowing to the NRA. It \nis long past time for Congress to act responsibly, and adopt sensible \nmeasures to close the loopholes in our current gun laws.\n  That means--closing the gun show loophole--requiring the sale of \nchild safety locks with firearms--prohibiting juveniles from possessing \nsemiautomatic assault weapons--banning imports of large capacity \nammunition clips--expanding the number of cities that participate in \ngun tracing--giving ATF and other federal law enforcement agencies the \nresources they need for more effective enforcement of our gun laws.\n  Nothing we do will interfere with the rights of responsible gun \nowners. But, it has everything to do with the rights of men, women, and \nchildren to live peacefully in their communities.\n  Ninety percent of the American people support background checks at \ngun shows; 88% favor child-proofing guns. But every attempt we make to \nact is met by a stonewall of resistance from our Republican colleagues. \nAnd every day, we learn of more tragedies of families who lose loved \nones to senseless gun violence because we fail to act.\n  Congress must end its obstruction and enact critical reforms that \nhave been pending for too long. If this Congress won't act, the \nAmerican people will elect a Congress in November that will act.\n  It has been almost a year since the tragic shooting at Columbine High \nSchool. In literally dozens of cases since then, children have brought \nguns to schools, and there have been at least seven school shootings \nsince Columbine.\n  According to the Department of Education, over 6,000 students were \nexpelled in the 1996-1997 school year for bringing guns to public \nschools. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control, 8% of \nall students reported bringing a gun to school in a 30-day period.\n  It is time for Congress to finish the job we began last year and pass \nthe gun control provisions in the juvenile justice legislation. \nStudents, parents and teachers across America are waiting for our \nanswer.\n  We need to help teachers and school officials recognize the early \nwarning signals and act before violence occurs.\n  We need to assist law enforcement officers in keeping guns away from \ncriminals and children.\n  We need to close the gun show loophole.\n  Above all, we need to require child safety locks on firearms, so that \nwe can do all we can to prevent senseless shocking shootings like the \nfirst grade gun killing that occurred a few weeks ago in an elementary \nschool in Michigan.\n  The Senate passed this needed legislation last year. It is time for \nHouse and Senate conferees to write the final bill and send it to the \nPresident, so that effective legislation is in place as soon as \npossible.\n  The lack of action is appalling and inexcusable. Each new tragedy is \na fresh indictment of our failure to act responsibly.\n  We have a national crisis, and commonsense approaches are urgently \nneeded. If we are serious about dealing with youth violence, the time \nto act is now. There is no reason why this Congress cannot enact this \nneeded legislation now. The citizens of this country deserve better \nthan what this kow-tow-to-the-NRA Congress has given them so far.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, on April 20 of last year, America and the \nworld was shocked by the gun violence and carnage at Columbine High \nSchool. Shortly thereafter, on May 20, this Senate passed legislation \nwithin the juvenile justice bill that provided for sensible gun control \nmeasures, including safety locks for handguns, background checks on all \nguns at gun shows and the ban on the importation of large clips for \nautomatic weapons. Since our vote on May 20, the measure has languished \nin the conference committee that has met only once--last August.\n  My amendment is very straightforward and simple. It asks that the \nconferees send to the House this measure so we can vote so we can do \nwhat the American people want. Over 90 percent of the American people \nwant gun locks on weapons. A large number of them want to close all the \nloopholes in the gun shows. We must do that to respond to America, not \njust with respect to Columbine, but for the 12 young children each day \nthat die in America because of gunfires.\n  I urge passage of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. The juvenile justice bill provides $450 million in \naccountability in block grants for all kinds of problems; $547.5 \nmillion in prevention grants for juveniles, $75 million in grants to \nupdate felony records, et cetera, none of which basically will pass as \nlong as we stay in the gunfight.\n  A majority of Republicans and Democrats in the House will not support \nthe Lautenberg amendment. A majority of the Republicans and Democrats \nin the Senate will not support the Dingell amendment. So we are stuck \nwith one of the most important anticrime juvenile justice bills in \nhistory because we can't resolve the gun process.\n  The best thing we can do is strip it out, fight that another day, and \ndo it this way. We cannot get a conference report and call a conference \nwhen all we will do is polarize the situation and divide people even \nmore. I think we have to come to a conclusion and pass the juvenile \njustice bill, regardless of what happens. I hope we can vote down this \namendment. It is not helping.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2964. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 53, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                       [Rollcall Vote No. 64 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--53\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith, (OR)\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n  The amendment (No. 2964) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REED.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n              mineral receipt sharing administrative costs\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the \nChairman of the Budget Committee regarding the reserve fund for \nstabilization of payments to counties in support of education contained \nin section 203.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to speak with my colleague regarding \nthis issue. This reserve fund will accommodate legislation recently \nreported by the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that will \ncorrect a very large problem for counties across the\n\n[[Page S2336]]\n\ncountry which have historically shared receipts taken in by the Forest \nService and BLM. The decline in those receipts over the last ten years \nhas had devastating effects on many rural school districts, especially \nin the rural West, and the Budget Committee has provided $1.1 billion \nover the next five years to stabilize the flow of resources to these \ncounties.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I know that Senator Domenici is aware of another \nsituation that has had a negative impact on States' share of Federal \nmineral receipts. Subtitle C of Title X of the Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993 put in place a system for allocating mineral \nrevenues between the States and the United States that is complicated \nand difficult to administer. It has resulted in confusion and conflict \nbetween States and the Federal Government, and the Inspector General of \nthe Department of the Interior has noted that the agencies' budgeting \nprocesses and accounting systems were not designed to accumulating \ncosts in the detail required for administering the system. The system \nis criticized by both the States and the Federal agencies charged with \nadministering it, and it is time for it to be changed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Bingaman is correct, and I understand he has \nintroduced legislation to correct that provision. We now have a CBO \npreliminary estimate of the budgetary impact of that bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In that regard, I ask the Chairman of the Budget \nCommittee if the amount available in the section 203 reserve fund would \naccommodate this legislation, and if it could be included within the \nintent of this reserve fund.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As we are considering this resolution, I cannot say for \nsure that the reserve fund would accommodate Senator Bingaman's bill, \nsince the estimate of the budgetary impact of the recently reported \nlegislation is not yet complete. It is my hope, however, that when we \nconvene the conference on this resolution, we will have estimates on \nthe impacts of both bills. It is my intention to move in that \nconference that the House recede to the Senate position with an \namendment to accommodate both the Forest Service receipt stabilization \nlegislation, and the mineral receipt sharing legislation.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chairman for taking the time to clarify \nthis point for us. I can assure you that this issue is very important \nto our States, and we look forward to working with you and the rest of \nour colleagues to address this situation in the near future.\n\n\n                        thrift savings accounts\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2000, the Congress authorized active and reserve \nmembers of the uniformed services to participate in the Thrift Savings \nPlan now available for federal civil service employees. This was an \nimportant part of the recruiting and retention package which the Senate \npassed, and which was enacted into law last year.\n  Under that authority, provided in last year's Defense Authorization \nAct, service members would be eligible to deposit up to five percent of \ntheir basic pay, before tax, each month. The government is not required \nto match the service member's contributions. In addition, service \nmembers would be permitted to directly deposit special pays for \nenlistment, reenlistment and the lump-sum for electing to remain in the \n``Redux'' retirement program--pre-tax--up to the extent allowable under \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, into their Thrift Savings account.\n  Last year's legislation required the President to identify sufficient \noffsets in order to implement this important program. Unfortunately and \ninexplicably, the President failed to identify the offsets in the \nbudget he submitted to the Congress in February. Mr. President, we must \nadjust the outlays and revenues in the Budget Resolution to permit the \nThrift Savings Plan to be extended to members of the uniformed \nservices. This Thrift Savings Plan does not cause the loss of revenues, \nbut defers the tax due until the service member retires. This is an \nimportant point--there are no lost revenues, and the cost of this \ninitiative is cheaper than losing our most qualified military \npersonnel.\n  Making the Thrift Savings Plan available to military personnel would \ncome at a critical time for the military services. Participating in a \nThrift Savings account would encourage personal savings and enhance the \nretirement income for service members, who currently do not have access \nto a 401k savings plan. Under current Thrift Savings Plan regulations, \nparticipants may borrow from Thrift Savings accounts for such worthy \npurposes as college tuition and purchasing a home. When implemented, \nmilitary personnel would be able to join federal workers in a savings \nprogram that would enhance the value of their retirement system and \npermit them to improve their quality of life.\n  The Armed Services Committee continues to receive testimony strongly \nsupporting a Thrift Savings Plan for military personnel as a strong \nincentive for both recruiting and retention. Testimony from the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, Service Secretaries and the military personnel chiefs \nconfirm that the Thrift Savings Plan would be an important incentive \nfor recruiting military personnel and retaining highly trained military \npersonnel on active duty or in the Ready Reserve. The Service Chiefs \nhave indicated that this plan, combined with the pay raise, the repeal \nof the Redux retirement system, and the increased bonuses in the FY \n2000 bill, would alleviate the hemorrhage of trained and experienced \nmilitary personnel we are now experiencing.\n  This critical initiative was not included in the President's budget \nrequest, but it is necessary to assist in retaining our military \nservice personnel. We must correct this shortcoming in the President's \nbudget.\n  The Senate has supported extending the Thrift Savings Plan to \nmilitary personnel on three previous occasions. It is time that we \ncomplete the process and provide the necessary funding that would \npermit military personnel to join the federal workforce in the Thrift \nSavings Plan.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Chairman of the Armed Services Committee has \ncrafted an important provision that can improve retention in our Armed \nServices. The cost effectiveness of the provision is particularly \nnotable. It is regrettable that the Administration's lack of compliance \nhas caused the delay of an entire year in the effective date of this \nprovision of last year's Department of Defense Authorization bill. \nServicemen and women have lost out because of the Administration's \nfailure to act.\n\n  I understand that you also have a problem with moving forward on \nlegislation that permits military personnel to participate in the \nThrift Savings Plan because deferred revenue or a ``revenue loss'' is \nattributable to such legislation and this makes the legislation \npotentially vulnerable to a Budget Act point of order.\n  As my friend from Virginia knows, our budget resolution, S. Con. Res. \n101, as well as the budget resolution passed by our colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives, H. Con. Res. 290, last week, provides for up \nto $150 billion in revenue reductions over the next five years. It is \nmy understanding that the revenue loss in the form of deferred revenue \nassociated with your TSP provision is $10 million in 2001 and $321 \nmillion over the next five years.\n  Let me assure my colleague, the Chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, that the revenue assumptions in the budget resolution can \naccommodate the revenue loss associated with your TSP statute. \nMoreover, let me say that I will happily make it clear in the statement \nof managers on the conference report on this year's budget resolution \nthat the revenue assumptions will permit your TSP provision to move \nforward and to be implemented without the threat of a Budget Act point \nof order.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend for his commitment to correct this \nshortcoming in the President's budget and his help in reducing the \nhemorrhage of trained and experienced military personnel. I also want \nto express my appreciation to the highly professional staff of the \nBudget Committee for their assistance in working out a solution to this \nvital issue.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I voted against the amendment offered \nby Senator Robb, which would use the tax code to provide assistance to \nschool districts to build and renovate school facilities. There is no \ndoubt that many states and local school districts need help to address \nthe dilapidated conditions of their schools. However, I do\n\n[[Page S2337]]\n\nnot believe that the approach presented by Senator Robb, which has been \nrepeatedly defeated by the Senate, is the best solution.\n  Earlier this year, I was pleased to cosponsor legislation known as \nBRICKS--the Building, Renovating, and Constructing Schools Act--which \nSenator Snowe introduced. Senator Snowe's bill authorizes the use of \n$20 billion for school construction and repairs. She pays for her \nproposal by borrowing from the Exchange Stabilization Fund (ESF).\n  According to the Snowe proposal, states would receive funds only at \nthe request of the Governor. They would be distributed in accordance \nwith the formula prescribed under Title I, which provides federal \nassistance to the lowest achieving, low income students. I believe this \nis a far better approach with potential for bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, it will be regrettable if the outcome of the vote on \nthe Robb amendment prevents a vote on an amendment by the senior \nSenator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed. I am an original cosponsor of \nthe Reed amendment which simply expresses the sense of the Senate that \ngun safety provisions approved by the Senate last year should be \nbrought before the Senate for final action. As a cosponsor of the Reed \namendment and a strong supporter of gun safety laws, particularly those \nwhich are intended to keep guns out of the hands of children, my vote \nagainst the Robb amendment should in no way be considered a vote \nagainst the Reed amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to address a serious problem \nwith one of the obscure assumptions both of this budget resolution and \nthe President's budget. Both the Administration's submission and this \nbudget resolution contain an assumption that $350 million of \nanticipated Medical Care Cost Recovery Fund (MCCF) receipts will be \nremitted to the Treasury from the VA. I strongly oppose this \nassumption. It flies in the face of current policy--and all logic--\nsince it would result in a $350 million decrease in VA health care \nfunding at the same time that Congress proposes an increase. The budget \nresolution is essentially assuming the VA is being given a ``loan'' \nfrom Treasury which it must pay back.\n  The VA has historically had difficulty in meeting their projected \nthird party collection goals as it is, using the projected collections \nas a means to pad the budget on paper. By substantially reducing the \nincentive for aggressive collections by the VA, the MCCF receipts are \neven less likely to reach projected levels--meaning fewer funds for \nveterans health care.\n  This proposal is nothing more than an obscure, cynical maneuver to \ngive extra scoring room on the appropriations bills later in this year \nat the expense of veterans. However, this provision will require \nlegislation to be put into effect, and I want my colleagues to know \nthat I will strongly oppose any efforts to pass such legislation as \nthat process moves forward this year.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as we debate the priorities for \nspending in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, I am pleased \nto have voted yesterday for the Bingaman education amendment. \nUnfortunately, the Senate tabled this amendment yesterday by a 54 to 46 \nvote. This amendment begins to address some of the critical needs of \nour schools. But more importantly, it says, ``We think education is \nimportant. We think education is a priority. We think education should \nbe nourished, not starved.''\n  This amendment adds important resources in several ways:\n  It supports the $4.5 billion or 12.6 percent increase for education \nthat the President proposed for FY 2001 over the previous year.\n  It adds $1 billion for Title I, the program that helps school \ndistricts educate disadvantaged students. If Congress follows through \nwith FY 2001 appropriations, this would bring total Title I funding \nnext year to $9.9 billion, up from $8.5 billion in FY 2000.\n  It adds $2 billion to train new teachers and current teachers.\n  It provides $1.75 billion to continue to reduce class sizes in the \nearly grades.\n  It increases funds for afterschool programs to give students extra \nhelp.\n  It provides $1.3 billion to repair schools in high-need areas.\n  It adds $1 billion for special education, programs to help disabled \nstudents.\n  It raises the maximum Pell Grant, aid for needy college students, \nfrom $3,500 to $3,700.\n  This amendment is timely because the federal share of elementary and \nsecondary education has declined from 14 percent in 1980 to 6 percent \nin 1999-2000. Hopefully, this amendment will begin to reverse that \ndecline.\n  The schools in my state face huge challenges--low test scores, \ncrowded classrooms, teacher shortages, growing enrollments, decrepit \nbuildings. In short, they are overwhelmed.\n  California has 5.8 million students, more students in school than 36 \nstates have in total population and one of the highest projected \nenrollments in the country.\n  California will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010. Eleven percent or \n30,000 of our 285,000 teachers are on emergency credentials.\n  California has 40 percent of the nation's immigrants; we have 50 \nlanguages in some schools. Children from these families need special \nattention, not just in English language learning but in dealing with \nhuge adjustments of learning to live in a new country.\n  California's students lag behind students from other states. Only \nabout 40 to 45 percent of the state's students score at or above the \nnational median, on the Stanford 9 reading and math tests.\n  For school construction, modernization and deferred maintenance, \nCalifornia needs $21 billion by 2003 or 7 new classrooms per day. Two \nmillion California children go to school today in 86,000 portable \nclassrooms.\n  California's Head Start programs serve only 13 percent of eligible \nchildren.\n  For higher education, the University of California has the most \ndiverse student body in the US. Federal programs provide nearly 55 \npercent of all student financial aid funding that UC students received. \nOur colleges and universities are facing ``Tidal Wave II,'' the \ndemographic bulge created by children of the baby boomers who will \ninundate California's colleges and universities between 2000 and 2010 \nbecause the number of high school graduates will jump 30 percent.\n  California's schools are in crisis. The needs of my state are huge.\n  While these needs cry out for resources, the federal government is \ncontributing only 6 percent of total education funding. Funds are so \nshort in my state that California teachers are spending around $1,000 a \nyear out of their own pockets to pay for books, magic markers, scissors \nand other school supplies, according to the San Diego Tribune, August \n16, 1999.\n  Why should we be increasing funds for education? Let me answer that \nquestion by giving you an example of the state of our schools, as \nexpressed by a young student. I would like to read a letter from Hannah \nWair, a 14-year-old from Santa Rosa, California, who graphically \ndescribes her school:\n\n                                               Santa Rosa, CA,\n\n                                                December 13, 1999.\n     Diane Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Feinstein: My name is Hannah Wair, and I am 14 \n     years old and I attend Rincon Valley Middle School in \n     California. I am writing you this letter because I am \n     concerned about the amount of money that is given to the \n     Santa Rosa City Schools. It seems as though far too many kids \n     attend these schools without enough supplies, computers, \n     books, and sports equipment. On top of that, most of the \n     schools (with an exception of a few new ones) are in need of \n     extreme repairs. Many schools have trashy, dirty, bathrooms \n     and locker rooms that have not been repaired or updated in \n     about 20 years. The fields and tracks are invaded with weeds \n     and rocks, and there have been many injuries because of this. \n     Many of the classes are over-populated, with an average of 30 \n     or 35 students per class. This gives the students less \n     attention, which makes it harder to learn.\n       Although there are many aspects that need to be improved \n     about our schools, they are all still great schools, and I'm \n     sure that you could change all of this in only a matter of \n     time. Thank you so very much for your time. I hope to hear \n     from you soon!\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Hannah Wair.\n\n  The Clinton-Gore Administration has proposed to increase education \nfunding in FY 2001 by 12.6 percent, to $40.1 billion. Yet the budget \nbefore us does not add, it cuts the President's education request by \n$4.7 billion. I submit, Mr. Chairman, that this is no time to be \ncutting education:\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\n  American students lag behind their international counterparts in many \nways. American twelfth grade math students were outperformed by \nstudents from 21 other countries, scoring higher than students from \nonly two countries, Cyprus and South Africa.\n  Three-quarters of our school children cannot compose a well-\norganized, coherent essay, says the National Assessment Governing Board \nin September.\n  U.S. eighth graders score below the international average of 41 other \ncountries in math. U.S. twelfth graders score among the lowest of 21 \ncountries in both math and science general knowledge.\n  Three-quarters of employers say that recent high school graduates do \nnot have the skills they need to succeed on the job. Forty-six percent \nof college professors say entering students do not have the skills to \nsucceed in college, according to a February Public Agenda poll.\n  These statistics speak for themselves. Our schools are failing many \nof our youngsters. It is not the students' fault. It is our fault. We \nneed to be nourishing education, not starving it, especially at a time \nof budget surpluses when the needs of our children are so stark.\n  I am especially pleased that this amendment increases funds for Title \nI, adding $1 billion to the program.\n  Title I provides grants to help disadvantaged children, grants \ndesigned by Congress in 1965 to provide supplementary services to low-\nachieving children in areas with high concentrations of poverty. Title \nI reaches virtually every school district and is very important in my \nstate. Schools serving disadvantaged populations of students receive \nfewer resources than other schools, according to the Public Policy \nInstitute of California in a new report.\n  With 18 percent of the country's Title I students, California only \nreceives 11.4 percent of Title I funds. At least, 775,000 eligible \nTitle I students are not getting services in my state.\n  It is my hope that when Congress takes up the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act reauthorization and the FY 2001 appropriations \nbill, we will rectify the long-standing inequities in the funding \nformula to give fast-growing states like mine their fair share of Title \nI and other funds.\n  In 1994, Congress included in the Title I law a requirement to \nannually update the number of poor children so that the allocation of \nfunds would truly reflect the most up-to-date number of poor children. \nThis is a very important provision to growing states like mine. \nHowever, despite my opposition, a ``hold harmless'' provision has been \nincluded in annual appropriations bills, effectively overriding the \ncensus update requirement and locking in historic funding amounts for \nstates despite the change in the number of poor children.\n  As Secretary of Education Riley said last year, ``a basic principle \nin targeting should be to drive funds to where the poor children are, \nnot to where they were a decade ago.'' While today's amendment includes \nan assumption that Title I would go up $1 billion and does not address \nthe ``hold harmless'' one way or another, I want to make it clear that \na ``hold harmless'' should not be part of our final funding bill.\n  I am also pleased that the amendment adds $2 billion for teacher \ntraining. What are the needs? For starters, my state has 30,000 \nteachers on emergency credentials. That is 11 percent of our 285,000 \nteachers. We have high teacher turnover. We face a severe teacher \nshortage. California will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010.\n  Not only do we face a serious teacher shortage, we need to beef up \ntraining of current teachers in order to improve student learning. \nThere is no substitute for a good teacher. A good teacher can make a \nlifetime of difference in a student, especially a struggling or low-\nperforming student. Teacher quality has more impact on student \nachievement than any other single factor, including family income and \nparent education, according to a Texas study by Ronald Ferguson of \nHarvard University. Studies show that the teacher's qualifications \naccount for more than 90 percent of the variation in student \nachievement in reading and math.\n  Another disturbing statistic in my state is this: In California, the \nlowest-scoring students are five times more likely than high-scoring \nchildren to be placed in a classroom with under qualified teachers, \nconcluded a study by the Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning \nlast December. ``More than a million children in California go to \nschool where they have particularly high concentrations of teachers who \nare under prepared to teach them,'' the study said. Similarly, the \nNational Commission on Teaching and America's Future noted,\n\n       In the nation's poorest schools, where hiring is most lax \n     and teacher turnover is constant, the results are disastrous. \n     Thousands of children are taught throughout their school \n     careers by a parade of teachers without preparation in the \n     fields they teach, inexperienced beginners with little \n     preparation and no mentoring, and short-term substitutes \n     trying to cope with constant staff disruptions. It is more \n     surprising that some of these children manage to learn than \n     that so many fail to do so.\n\n  Without strong teachers, our children suffer. We must enhance teacher \ntraining.\n  The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future found that \nteacher training has suffered for years saying it has been \n``historically thin, uneven and poorly financed.'' That commission has \ncalled for strengthening teacher training requirements and better \nrewarding teaching knowledge and skill.\n  I welcome the additional funds in this amendment to train more \nteachers and to strengthen teacher training.\n  This debate today is not just about raw numbers, this increase or \nthat decrease. This debate is about the future of our nation. We must \nask some fundamental questions about our spending priorities. Why it is \nimportant to increase spending on education? Here are some reasons:\n  The economy of my state is transitioning from manufacturing toward a \nmore higher-skilled, service and technology jobs. Since 1980, jobs in \nthe ``new economy'' (services and trade) have jumped nearly 60 percent.\n  Over the next 10 years, nationally, computer systems analyst jobs \nwill grow by 94 percent; computer support specialists, by 102 percent; \ncomputer engineers, 108 percent. Jobs for the non-college educated are \nstagnating.\n  High tech employers say they cannot find qualified people. They plead \nfor Congress to expand visas to bring in employees from abroad.\n  Low literacy levels are powerful predictors of welfare dependency and \nincarceration. More than half the adult prison population has literacy \nlevels below those required by the labor market.\n  Near 40 percent of adjudicated juvenile delinquents have treatable \nlearning disabilities that went untreated in school.\n  Seventeen years ago, the nation's attention was jolted by a report \ntitled A Nation at Risk. In April 1983, the Reagan Administration's \nEducation Secretary, Terrell Bell, told the nation that we faced a \nfundamental crisis in the quality of American elementary and secondary \neducation. The report said:\n\n       Our nation is at risk. If an unfriendly foreign power had \n     attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational \n     performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it \n     as an act of war.\n\n  The report cited declines in student achievement and called for \nstrengthening graduation requirements, teacher preparation and \nestablishing standards and accountability.\n  Today, we still face mediocrity in our schools. While there are \nalways exceptions and clearly there are many excellent teachers and \nmany outstanding schools, we can do better. To those who say we cannot \nafford to spend more money on education, I say we cannot afford to fail \nour children. Our children do not choose to be illiterate or \nuneducated. It is our responsibility and we must face up to it.\n  I urge adoption of the education amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Senate yesterday approved my \namendment to the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution that establishes a \nreserve fund which creates room in the Senate budget resolution for \nmilitary retiree health care improvements. I thank Budget Committee \nChairman Domenici for working with me and supporters of my amendment. I \nalso want to recognize the driving force behind this issue: the \nthousands of military retirees and\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\ntheir dependents across this country who have established an impressive \ngrassroots effort. Their work, in conjunction with the efforts of the \nRetired Enlisted Association, the National Association of Uniformed \nServices, the National Military and Veterans Association, and the \nRetired Officers Association, have brought military health care to the \nforefront.\n  My amendment would allow the Senate Armed Services Committee to \nincrease spending on military retiree health care while considering the \nfiscal year 2001 Department of Defense Authorization bill. It is \nimportant to note that my amendment must also be approved by the House \nand Senate conference committee on the budget resolution in order for \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee to use the reserve fund.\n  A promise of lifetime health care has been broken. Testimony from \nmilitary recruiters themselves, along with copies of recruitment \nliterature dating back to World War II, show that health care was \npromised to active duty personnel and their families upon the \npersonnel's retirement.\n  However, the creation on June 7, 1956, of space-available care for \nmilitary retirees at military hospitals has led to a broken promise of \nhealth care coverage for these men and women and their families. Post-\ncold-war downsizing of military bases and their medical services have \nleft many retirees out in the cold. A final insult is the fact that \nmilitary retirees and their dependents are kicked off of the military's \nhealth care system, Tricare, upon turning age 65.\n  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, testified \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee and said: ``Sir, I think the \nfirst thing we need to do is make sure that we acknowledge our \ncommitment to the retirees for their years of service and for what we \nbasically committed to at the time that they were recruited into the \narmed forces.''\n  Defense Secretary William Cohen testified before the Senate Armed \nServices Committee and said: ``We have made a pledge, whether it's \nlegal or not, it's a moral obligation that we will take care of all \nthose who served, retired veterans and their families, and we have not \ndone so.''\n  My oldest son, Brooks, served as a peacekeeper with the United States \nArmy in Bosnia, and he was recently deployed to Kosovo. I know how \nimportant ``quality of life'' issues are to military personnel and \ntheir families. Our country asks young men and women to willingly work \nin combat zones and receive minimal pay compared to the private sector. \nAs compensation, military personnel have been promised that their \nhealth care needs and those of their families will be taken care of now \nand upon retirement. Despite the best efforts of many talented health \ncare providers in the military, this promise has been broken, and it is \nimpacting a young man or woman's decision to make a career of the \nmilitary.\n  The question is whether Members of Congress want to make military \nretiree health care a priority instead of an afterthought. I am hopeful \nthat, working on a bipartisan approach similar to that seen with my \nreserve fund amendment, we in Congress can choose military retiree \nhealth care as a priority this session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, in order to make some logic out of this \nvote-arama process, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the first 10 amendments to be voted on tomorrow be the following \nand that as stated earlier all votes after the first vote be limited to \n10 minutes, with 2 minutes for explanation prior to each vote.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the vital work \nperformed by a group of tireless and dedicated professionals: The \nmembers of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (SMFM). I \ncongratulate the Society for its outstanding achievements, and note \nthis year they celebrated their 20th annual meeting.\n  It is often said that the United States is home to the finest pool of \nhealth care professionals in the world. I could not agree more. Each \nand every day, these professionals provide cutting edge care for \nmillions across the country. Treatments that did not exist just ten \nyears ago are now saving lives on a routine basis. I am hopeful that we \nnever take this high level of care for granted.\n  The Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine is one group that \ndemonstrates the tremendous talent we have in our country. For many of \nus, ``maternal-fetal medicine'' may not be an everyday term. However, \nwe all acknowledge that mothers experiencing complicated pregnancies \nrequire and deserve the best care possible. Maternal-fetal specialists \nprovide care or consultation during complicated pregnancies. In \naddition, they provide education and research concerning the most \nrecent approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of obstetrical \nproblems. As a result, these specialists promote awareness of the \ndiagnostic and therapeutic techniques for optimal management of these \ncomplicated pregnancies. In addition, it should be noted that maternal-\nfetal medicine specialists are complementary to obstetricians in \nproviding consultations, co-management or direct care before and during \npregnancy.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating the \nmembers of the Society of Maternal-Fetal Medicine for their outstanding \nwork. I also want to acknowledge the fine work of Dr. Peter Van \nDorsten, President of the SMFM, who resides in my home state of South \nCarolina. There is no doubt that Americans across the country join me \nin thanking these unique individuals.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, seven months have elapsed since the House \nof Representatives passed the bi-partisan Norwood-Dingell bill to end \ninsurance company and HMO abuses, and more than six months have passed \nsince House and Senate conferees were appointed to prepare the final \nversion of this important measure.\n  Today, I am releasing a new study by the Minority Staff of the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that documents how \ndevastating this long delay has been for millions of Americans and \ntheir families, and how urgent it is for the House-Senate conference to \ncomplete its work as soon as possible.\n  Drawing on data gathered by the University of California School of \nPublic Health and the Harvard School of Public Health, the report \ndocuments unacceptably high numbers of patients who are denied needed \ncare, who suffer increased pain, or whose health has seriously declined \nbecause too many HMOs and insurance companies put profits ahead of \npatients.\n  According to the study, 59,000 patients each day--22 million patients \na year--report added pain and suffering as the result of the actions of \ntheir health plans. Large numbers of patients have specialty referrals \ndelayed or denied. Others are forced to change doctors. Still others \nare forced to take prescription drugs that are different from the drugs \ntheir doctor prescribed.\n  In addition to patients' reports of significant problems as the \nresult of actions of their health plans, thousands of physicians report \nseeing patients every day whose health has seriously declined as the \nresult of abuses\n\n[[Page S2340]]\n\nsuch as the failure to cover recommended prescription drugs, denial of \nneeded diagnostic tests and procedures, and unwillingness to allow \nreferrals for specialty care.\n  This study provides powerful new evidence of the need for Congress to \nmove promptly to pass a strong Patient's Bill of Rights. Millions of \nfamilies are suffering because of the failure of Congress to act. \nFamilies across America deserve protection, and it is time for Congress \nto fulfill its responsibility and see that they get it.\n  I ask unanimous consent the study be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nThe Impact on Patients of Delays in Passing a Patients' Bill of Rights: \nA Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee Minority Staff \n                                 Study\n\n       Delays in passing legislation to curb insurance company \n     abuse result in injury to thousands of patients daily and \n     millions of patients annually. Drawing on two prior studies \n     on the incidence of abusive health plan practices, this \n     report looks at the number of patients affected daily, \n     weekly, monthly and yearly.\n       The estimates are based on patient self-reports of \n     experiences with health plans and on physicians' reports of \n     the frequency of various abuses and the seriousness of \n     injuries sustained by the patients they see in their own \n     practices.\n     Highlights\n       According to patient reports, every day, as the result of \n     actions of their health plan: 59,000 patients experience \n     added pain and suffering; 41,000 patients experience a \n     worsening of their condition; 35,000 patients have needed \n     care delayed; 35,000 patients have a specialty referral \n     delayed or denied; 31,000 patients are forced to change \n     doctors; and 18,000 patients are forced to change \n     medications.\n       According to physician reports, every day: 14,000 \n     physicians see patients whose health has seriously declined \n     because an insurance plan refused to provide coverage for a \n     prescription drug; 10,000 physicians see patients whose \n     health has seriously declined because an insurance plan did \n     not approve a diagnostic test or procedure; 7,000 physicians \n     see patients whose health has seriously declined because \n     an insurance plan did not approve referral to a medical \n     specialist; 6,000 physicians see patients whose health has \n     seriously declined because an insurance plan did not \n     approve an overnight hospital stay; and 6,000 physicians \n     see patients whose health has seriously declined because \n     an insurance plan did not approve a referral for mental \n     health or substance abuse treatment.\n       Table 1 shows the incidence of plan restrictions on care \n     and patient injuries resulting from plan actions by day, \n     week, month, and annually, as reported in the survey of \n     patients.

Patients' self-reports on difficulties with their \n     health plans and illness and injury caused by actions of \n     their health plans was drawn from a random sample survey of \n     individuals in California with private health insurance \n     conducted by the Center for Health and Public Policy Studies, \n     School of Public Health, University of California at \n     Berkeley. Helen Schauffler, Ph.D., was the principal \n     investigator. The survey was conducted during September, 1997 \n     for the Managed Care Improvement Task Force of the State of \n     California, and reported in Improving Managed Health Care in \n     California, Findings and Recommendations, Volume Two, \n     January, 1998, Tables 4 and 19.\n       The survey asked whether the respondent experienced \n     specific difficulties with a health plan. Those who \n     experienced difficulties were asked about the impact of the \n     difficulty on their health. The figures presented in this \n     report assume that the incidence of such events is the same \n     among the total U.S. population of privately insured \n     individuals as it is among the privately insured population \n     in California. Daily, weekly, and monthly figures were \n     derived by dividing annual rates by 365, 52, and 12, \n     respectively. All figures in the tables are rounded to the \n     nearest 1,000 patients.\n       Data on physicians' reports of health plan practices and \n     serious declines in health experienced by patients as the \n     result of health plan actions were drawn from the 1999 Survey \n     of Physicians and Nurses by the Kaiser Family Foundation and \n     the Harvard School of Public Health. The survey was conducted \n     between February 11 and June 5, 1999. Physicians were asked \n     how frequently a set of plan practices occurred (weekly, \n     monthly, every six months, yearly, never, or not applicable \n     to my practice). Physicians who reported that the practice \n     occurred were asked for the impact on the health of their \n     patients.\n       The figures reported in the survey were converted into \n     daily, weekly, monthly, and annual totals by adding the \n     proportions seeing the specified event during the specified \n     time period. For example, to derive a weekly total, the \n     numbers of doctors reporting seeing such patients weekly was \n     added to one-fourth of the doctors reporting seeing such \n     patients monthly plus one-fifty-second of the doctors \n     reporting seeing such patients annually. The proportion was \n     then multiplied by the size of the sampling universe of \n     470,364 physicians. All figures reported in the table are \n     rounded to the nearest 1,000 patients.\n       Note that the tables are not comparable, since one reports \n     on numbers of patients affected, while the other reports on \n     numbers of doctors seeing affected patients. Many doctors saw \n     numerous affected patients. Moreover, judgments of doctors \n     who attribute health declines to specific plan practices may \n     not coincide with patients' own conclusions. Also, the doctor \n     survey reports on patient injuries due to specific plan \n     practices which are not identical with the problems \n     identified in the patient survey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2340-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2340-S2341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SMITH AND WESSON AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the first time in the United States, a \ngun manufacturer has agreed to make major changes to the design, \ndistribution and marketing of its products. In a historic settlement \nreached by Smith & Wesson, the Administration, and cities and states \naround the country, Smith & Wesson will make sweeping changes to its \nbusiness practices.\n  Under the terms of the agreement, several cities and counties will \ndrop lawsuits filed against Smith & Wesson in exchange for reforms \ndesigned to make guns safer and limit access to them by unauthorized \nusers. Specifically, Smith & Wesson agreed to increased safety \nstandards, such as the\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\ninclusion of external locking devices on all of its guns immediately, \nand internal safety locks on its pistols within two years; more \nstringent performance standards for its handguns, including rigorous \ndrop tests; and a commitment to include ``smart gun'' technology in its \nnewly designed handguns within three years.\n  In addition, Smith & Wesson agreed to revamp the way it distributes \nand sells firearms. Smith & Wesson will conduct business transactions \nonly with authorized distributors and dealers who abide by a code of \nconduct. The distributor or dealer must agree in writing to perform and \ncomplete a background check for all sales, including those at gun \nshows; impose limits on the bulk purchase of guns; implement a security \nplan to prevent firearm and ammunition theft; require juveniles to be \naccompanied by a parent or guardian where guns and ammo are stored or \nsold. Other parts of the voluntary agreement include a trust fund for a \npublic service campaign about the risk of firearms in the home and \nlessons for proper home storage. Also, Smith & Wesson made assurances \nthat their guns will not be marketed to appeal to children or criminals \nand will not be advertised in the vicinity of schools, high crime \nzones, or public housing.\n  Finally, with this agreement, a firearm manufacturer has agreed to \nthe basic demands of the American people: to keep guns out of the hands \nof children and criminals. I hope other gun manufacturers will follow \ntheir lead and work to reduce the level of gun violence in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2341-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of National \nStudent Employment Week. I would like to show appreciation for the good \nwork that the past and present interns in my office have done, and say \na few words about the mutual benefits of a congressional student \ninternship program.\n  These days, as people turn to government more frequently for answers, \nit is especially important for young people to learn about government. \nIf is crucial that they know how it affects their lives and the lives \nof others and what they can do to improve it. There is no better way \nfor a student to discover how government works than by participating in \nthe legislative process. Real-world experience helps a student develop \noptimistic, practical expectations of government.\n  An internship is often a student's first brush with the professional \nworld. The congressional office gives them an opportunity to develop \ntheir professional skills. Each year, after working on Capitol Hill or \nin a state or district office, thousands of former student interns \ncommit themselves to public service or choose a career path in the \nprivate sector. These young people bring the high standards with which \nthey were trained to their first job.\n  Internships also allow students to gain experience specific to jobs \nin a congressional office. They allow students to try out different \ntasks, which gives them the chance to discover jobs they are well \nsuited for and would not know about without hands-on office experience.\n  Many of us who hold office today credit a student internship as the \ninspiration for our commitment to public service. In fact, I believe \nthat right now there are many young people who are planning to devote \npart of their careers to public service because of their student \ninternships. Although not all former interns pursue a public service \ncareer, these young people are usually left with an ongoing interest in \npolitics. The result of a student intership, is at the very least, an \ninformed and thoughtful citizen.\n  I have the great fortune to work with some of the sharpest and most \neager minds to come out of our colleges and universities. Among them \nthis spring are Melissa Simpson of Blackfoot and Boise State \nUniversity, Richard Andrus of Rexburg and Utah State University, Sarah \nBonzer of Boise and Boise State University, Laura Atchely of Ashton and \nthe University of Idaho, Melynda Topelian of Herndon High, Herndon, \nVirginia, and Holly Sonneland of Hailey and The Community School in Sun \nValley, in my personal office in Washington, DC. The interns in my \nRepublican Policy Committee office include Elisha Tiplett from \nWoodbridge, Virginia, and James Madison University, Nathan Johnson of \nLewiston, Maine, and Brigham Young University, Carolyn Laird of \nEdmonton, Alberta Canada and the University of Alberta. The interns in \nmy state offices are: Jose Melendez, a student from Northwest Nazarene \nUniversity in the Boise office; Angela Nyland of Idaho State University \nand Mark H. Liedtke of Century High School in the Pocatello office; \nKjersta Baum of Ricks College and Kristina Pack of Skyline High School \nin the Idaho Falls office. Past interns in the Idaho Falls office whom \nI would like to recognize include Pricilla Giddings of Salmon River, \nJr./Sr. High School and Jared Lords of Idaho State University.\n  These interns are a welcome addition to my Idaho and Washington, DC, \noffices. They have brought their energy and scholastic ability with \nthem and helped make my office more responsive to constituents at home.\n  In return for their effort, these students gain the satisfaction of \nhelping their fellow citizens, the reward of being a well-trained \nworker, and the opportunity to make lifelong political contacts. Some \nhave incorporated their study into their curriculum and will receive \nacademic credit for their endeavors.\n  For these reasons, I will continue to provide internship \nopportunities to Idaho students. Student internship programs are an \nexcellent example that student employment is pivotal in the \ncontinuation of a well-trained work force.\n  I commend my colleagues who have done their part by opening their \noffices to interns. I hope that they have seen, as I have, that student \ninternships offer numerous benefits to both the congressional office \nand the student.\n  I thank the students who have participated in an internship. Their \ntime as interns has made them knowledgeable citizens on the subject of \ngovernment, and their participation has enriched our nation's \nlegislative process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2341-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2341-S2342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      16TH ANNUAL TUFTONIA'S WEEK CELEBRATION AT TUFTS UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this month marks the 16th annual \nobservance of Tuftonia's Week by Tufts University in Medford, \nMassachusetts. As part of this impressive celebration, large numbers of \nthe 80,000-plus Tufts alumni from around the world return to honor \ntheir outstanding university. We are fortunate to have many \ndistinguished Tufts alumni working on Capitol Hill, so many of us are \nwell aware of the high quality of these graduates.\n  This celebration always has special meaning for me. My daughter, \nKara, is a graduate of Tufts, and I've also worked closely with many \nTufts scholars on a wide range of public policy\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\nissues. I am proud to count myself as a member of the Tufts family, and \nto add my congratulations to the official proclamations by Governors \nand Mayors across the country.\n  For the past 148 years, Tufts has trained many of our nation's \noutstanding scholars and distinguished political leaders. Tufts has \nprovided outstanding leadership in medicine, engineering, nutrition and \neducation. In addition to Tufts' strong academic tradition, it is a \nnational leader in emphasizing service learning and providing \nopportunities for students to combine community service with their \nacademic life. This program called ``TuftServe'' was highlighted when \nPresident Clifton held his Summit for America' Future in 1997, and it \ncontinues to be a model for the country. Campus Compact, housed at \nTufts, has assisted Massachusetts colleges in participating in America \nReads and America Counts, two initiatives that continue to improve the \nlives and futures of children in public schools.\n  I commend Tufts for the wide range of opportunities that it continues \nto offer to its students and alumni, and I also commend Tufts' \nPresident, John DiBiaggio, and all the members of the Tufts community \nfor their impressive accomplishments in enhancing education and \ncontributing so effectively to Massachusetts, the nation, and the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2342-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              232ND ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, April 5th marked the 232nd \nanniversary of the founding of the first Chamber of Commerce in the \nUnited States. A full eight years before the colonies declared their \n``independence'' from English rule, New York City business owners \nbanded together to create a unified voice. Today, there are thousands \nof local Chambers from Anchorage, Alaska to Zumbrota, Minnesota.\n  Over the past eight years, I have had to honor to work with these \ngrassroots organizations on a wide variety of issues. Whether its been \nestate tax relief or permanent normalized trade with China, Minnesota's \nchambers have been there, working for Minnesota's job providers, every \nstep of the way. That is why I was so proud to receive the Chamber's \nSpirit of Enterprise award earlier this year.\n  When Washington talks about our strong economy, debating what to do \nwith the billions in federal surplus dollars, it sometimes appears as \nthough Congress wants to take all the credit. Policy makers focus on \nthe innovations, the increased productivity, the ``globalization'' of \ntoday's marketplace as proof of their good work. I don't need to remind \nmy colleagues that the only thing Government can do is to remove the \nbarriers to competition and provide a level playing field. The rest is \na direct result of the entrepreneurial spirit of the men and women \nwho've sacrificed to build businesses around Minnesota and around the \ncountry. Employers and employees, working hand in hand and with their \nchamber of commerce, have helped to turn this nation around.\n  So Mr. President, while our chamber members are taking care of \nbusiness back home, we must recognize they are looking to the Congress \nfor leadership to stem the tide of burdensome regulations and \noppressive taxes. I believe working together, we can create an \nenvironment where all can thrive. And as we mark the anniversary of the \nfirst chamber of commerce, let us celebrate the contributions of all \nour chambers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2342-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN RECOGNITION OF CHARLES STEWARD MOTT COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND MR. PETER \n                              LEVINE, MPH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate Mott \nCommunity College and Mr. Peter Levine, MPH on being selected as the \n1999 Corporate and Individual Health Advocates of the Year by the \nAmerican Lung Association of the Michigan-Genesee Valley Region. Mott \nCommunity College and Mr. Levine are being honored by the Lung \nAssociation for their efforts to encourage, promote and raise awareness \nabout improving the health of the Genesee Valley Region.\n  Mott Community College (MCC) is a dynamic community institution \nserving the needs of all the residents of Genesee County. This \ncommitment to community service is manifested in the school's efforts \nto promote public health on campus and in the community. MCC has \nimplemented a pro-active lung health program that not only eliminates \nsmoking in all campus buildings, but also assists smokers in their \nefforts to ``kick the habit''. MCC provides counseling for employees \nwho desire to quit smoking, and its health insurance providers offer \neducational programs to support employees who desire to quit smoking.\n  In addition, MCC has become a leader in community service. The \ncollege encourages faculty and staff to serve on local boards for \ncommunity-based, non-profit organizations, and the school allows \nemployees to fulfill these commitments on company time, if necessary. \nThe school also serves as a gathering place for community health \nspecial events. The annual MCC Health Fair brings community and health \nofficials together, and Tipper Gore chaired a recent mental health town \nmeeting on campus. MCC students and faculty in the health sciences \nshare their expertise by assisting school groups, churches and the \nGenesee County Public Health Department with a variety of community \nhealth initiatives.\n  Peter Levine has served his community, state, and country in \ncountless ways. He serves as the Executive Director of the Genesee \nCounty Medical Society. The Society is a progressive organization which \nseeks to be pro-patient and pro-physician. During Mr. Levine's tenure, \nthe Medical Society has grown from a small association employing a few \npeople into a set of four corporations serving the medical and general \ncommunity with approximately 80 employees. The Society focuses on \nmedical, social, bioethics, environmental health and resource \nallocation issues.\n  Mr. Levine has been on the faculty of Michigan State University since \n1985, where he is currently an Associate Adjunct Professor in the \nCollege of Human Medicine. He has published extensively about health \nissues in scholarly and popular journals. In 1992, Health Care Weekly \nReview cited him as one of the eight most influential health care \npolicy individuals or organizations in the State of Michigan. Peter \nLevine was a founding Board Member and volunteer for the Genesee County \nFree Medical Clinic. He also serves on the board of numerous civic and \nprofessional organizations. Currently he is the Chair of the Michigan \nCouncil of County Medical Society Executives.\n  Mr. President, I have mentioned only a small sampling of the many \nways in which Charles Steward Mott Community College and Mr. Peter \nLevine have used their creativity, hard work and unflagging commitment \nto public service to make this community and our nation a better place \nto live.

In April 1960, \nCharlie was badly beaten in a NCAA championship bout against San Jose \nState's Stuart Bartell. Minutes later he began convulsing in the locker \nroom and lost consciousness. A week afterward, Charlie died without \nregaining consciousness.\n  Charlie grew up in Merrick, NY, and learned to box in nearby Long \nBeach. At age 18, he reached the semifinals of the prestigious New York \nCity Golden Gloves amateur boxing tournament. In 1955, Charlie wrote a \nletter to Wisconsin's boxing Coach John Walsh asking about the \npossibility of receiving a scholarship. Coach Walsh eagerly obliged.\n  At the university, he excelled in all aspects of campus life. He was \na good student who helped other's study for their exams. Charlie was \nvery involved with the local parish St. Paul's Church and even thought \nabout becoming a priest.\n  However, it was in the ring where he gained his notoriety. In his \nfreshman\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\nyear, he won two university tournaments despite not being able to \ncompete on the varsity team. The next year he won seven of his nine \nfights. As a junior, he captured the NCAA's 165-pound championship \nafter defeating Jesse Klinkenberg.\n  The cause of Charlie's death is still in question. Doctors dispute \nwhether the brain hemorrhaging that led to his untimely passing was \ncaused by a blow at the hands of Bartell or an aneurysm. No one can \ndispute the profound impact his death had on the University and the \nintercollegiate sport. A couple of weeks after Charlie's death the \nfaculty decided to disband the school's boxing program. Soon after, the \nNCAA followed suit, abolishing boxing as a sanctioned sport.\n  On January 19, 1999, I proposed S. 143, the Professional Boxing \nSafety Act Amendments of 1999 in order to try to protect fighters from \nlasting and debilitating head injuries in the ring. The bill passed, as \nan amendment to S. 305, the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act, on July 27 \nof last year. The bill will require fighters to undergo a computer \naxial tomography (CAT) scan before a fighter can renew their \nprofessional license. Hopefully, the lesson taught to us by Charlie \nMohr will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2343-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF BETH DANIEL\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is a pleasure for me to \nrecognize one of South Carolina's most outstanding athletes, Beth \nDaniel, who was recently inducted into the Ladies Professional Golf \nAssociation (LPGA) Tour Hall of Fame--only the 16th woman to claim this \nprestigious honor.\n  A native of Charleston, SC, Daniel moved to Greenville to attend \nFurman University and play collegiate golf. While a student at Furman, \nshe captured the U.S. Women's Amateur title twice, in 1975 and 1977. \nShe was a member of the 1976 and 1978 U.S. Curtis Cup teams and the \n1978 World Cup team. Since joining the LPGA Tour in 1979, she has \ncollected an impressive 32 career victories and seven LPGA awards, \nincluding the 1979 LPGA Rookie of the Year award.\n  Beth had a phenomenal year in 1990, winning seven tournaments, \nincluding a major--the Mazda LPGA Championship--and setting a record \nfor consecutive rounds in the 60s with nine. Also in 1990, she was \nnamed the Rolex Player of the Year and the United Press International \nFemale Athlete of the Year. In 1995, she entered the South Carolina \nGolf Hall of Fame and, in 1996, became the third player in LPGA history \nto cross the $5 million mark in career earnings. She was also a member \nof the victorious 1996 U.S. Solheim Cup team.\n  Beth Daniel's accomplishments on the LPGA Tour and her many \ncontributions to women's golf make her an excellent addition to the \nLPGA Hall of Fame. She is a credit to her sport, to Charleston, and to \nthe State of South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2343-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MICHAEL DOBMEIER\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMichael Dobmeier and to recognize him as a member of a distinguished \ngroup of North Dakotans who have demonstrated extraordinary leadership \nin their military careers and civilian life.\n  Michael was recently elected National Commander of the million-member \nDisabled American Veterans, a group with a historic tradition of \nadvocating responsible legislation to assist disabled veterans, their \nfamilies and survivors. Speaking of the DAV recently Michael said, ``I \nsoon discovered the critical role the DAV serves in the lives of \ndisabled veterans and their families in my community and communities \nnationwide.'' I wholeheartedly agree with this statement and attest to \nthe fact that Michael has exemplified through his many significant \nachievements the great importance of the Disabled American Veterans.\n  Michael Dobmeier is a native of Grand Forks, North Dakota. After \ngraduating from high-school, he enlisted in the navy in 1969. Following \nboot camp in San Diego, he trained as an engine man in Great Lakes, IL, \nattended Submarine School in New London, CT, and, later, Diver's School \nin San Diego.\n  While serving off the coast of Washington in April 1972 aboard the \nUSS Trigger, Michael was severely burned when an engine crankcase oil \nheater exploded. It sprayed him with flaming oil and caused him 2nd and \n3rd degree burns over more than 30 percent of his body.\n  Following this accident, Michael received a military discharge and \njoined the Grand Forks' Disabled American Veterans Chapter 2. Since \nthen, he has held almost every local, state, and national leadership \nposition in the organization and has held all chapter and department \nleadership positions. At the 1994 DAV National Convention, Michael was \nchosen to serve on the National Executive and Finance Committee, was \nelected 4th and 3rd Junior Vice Commander consecutively at the 1995 and \n1996 DAV National Conventions, and at the 1997 National Convention was \nelected 1st Junior Vice Commander. In 1998, Michael was elected Senior \nVice Commander at the National Convention in Las Vegas, NV. He was also \nthe president of the North Dakota Veterans Home Foundation and was \nchosen the 1985 DAV Outstanding Member of the Department of North \nDakota.\n  Michael Dobmeier resides in Grand Forks with his wife Sandra Jo and \ntheir two children. As owner and President of Dobmeier, Inc., an \nindependent insurance company, Michael has also found success in the \nbusiness world.\n  I am proud to honor Michael Dobmeier as a person who has served his \ncountry with distinction and accepted the challenges and risks \nassociated with this service. As Michael recently stated, ``Taking \nrisks means moving forward while others are waiting for better times, \nwhile others are waiting for proven results, and while others are \nwaiting for applause for their past performance. The greatest risk of \nall, however, is to take no risks * * * make no changes.'' We thank Mr. \nDobmeier today for taking those risks. The world is truly a better \nplace because of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2343-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2343-S2344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN RECOGNITION OF BURTON H.

Boyum was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1919 and moved \nto the Upper Peninsula in 1941. He quickly learned to love the beauty \nof the U.P. and the outstanding character of its people. He worked as a \nmining engineer for one of the U.P.'s largest employers at the time, \nCleveland Cliffs International, from his arrival in the U.P. until his \nretirement in 1984. Mr. Boyum's experience with Cleveland Cliffs \ninspired him to teach the public about the geology, mineralogy and \nmining heritage of his adopted home.\n  Mr. Boyum has contributed greatly to the preservation of the U.P.'s \nmining heritage throughout the years. In 1961, he was a founding Board \nMember of the Quincy Mine Hoist Association and was named its first \nSecretary. He served as President of the Board of the Association from \n1973 until 1998, when he was named the first Chairman of the Board. Mr. \nBoyum has also served on the Advisory Commission of the Keweenaw \nNational Historical Park, served as President of the Historical Society \nof Michigan, helped gain State approval for the Michigan Iron Industry \nMuseum, and helped to create the Marquette Range Iron Mining Heritage \nTheme Park. He has written two books about the mining experience in the \nU.P., Saga of Iron Mining in Michigan's Upper Peninsula and The Mather \nMine, and has also produced two videos about the history of U.P. \nmining.\n  As important as the mining experience has been to the U.P., Mr. Boyum \nalso embraced the U.P.'s love for the outdoors and outdoor sports. He \nsuccessfully campaigned for the creation of the National Ski Hall of \nFame in Ishpeming, Michigan, and served as its first President and \nCurator. He also helped to organize the Great Lakes Olympic Training \nCenter Association and served as its President for 10 years.\n  Mr. President, the history of Michigan's Upper Peninsula is deeply \nintertwined with the iron and copper mining industries.

Mr. President, last month a former Charleston, \nSC resident and longtime friend, Mary Bodne, passed away at the age of \n93. She and her husband, Ben, a Charleston native, owned and operated \nthe Algonquin Hotel in New York City for over 41 years. In honor of \ntheir dedication to historic preservation and their service to all of \nthose who had the pleasure of staying at the Algonquin, I ask that the \nattached article from the New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 4, 2000]\n\n          Mary Bodne, Ex-Owner of Algonquin Hotel, Dies at 93\n\n                          (By Douglas Martin)\n\n       Mary Bodne, who with her husband, Ben, fell in love with \n     the Algonquin Hotel on their honeymoon and later owned it for \n     41 years, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. \n     She was 93.\n       She lived at the elegant Midtown hotel, the literary \n     hangout of the Jazz Age, from 1946 until her death, spending \n     most afternoons in her lobby armchair greeting regulars.\n       It all began when the Bodnes, newly married, lunched at the \n     Algonquin in the early 1920's and sighted Will Rogers, whom \n     they had seen the night before at the Ziegfeld Follies; \n     Douglas Fairbanks Sr., Sinclair Lewis, Eddie Cantor, Gertrude \n     Lawrence and Beatrice Lillie. The bride joked to her husband, \n     an oil distributor in Charleston, S.C., that after he bought \n     the baseball team he dreamed about, he should get her the \n     hotel.\n       Although Mr. Bodne toyed with buying the Pittsburgh \n     Pirates, he never bought a ball club. But in 1946 he paid \n     around $1 million for the 200-room hotel at 59 West 44th \n     Street, between Fifth Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas. \n     The couple promptly moved in.\n       For the former Mary Mazo, the Algonquin was the final \n     address in an odyssey that began in Odessa, Ukraine, where \n     she was the second child in a large Jewish family that fled \n     the pogroms when she was an infant. A family story has it \n     that the baby Mary began to cry in an attic while Cossacks \n     rampaged below, but that she miraculously hushed up before it \n     was too late. It is said that Mrs. Bodne's later \n     loquaciousness was compensation for that momentary silence.\n       The Mazo family immigrated to Charleston, where the father, \n     Elihu, opened the city's first Jewish delicatessen. When \n     George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward were working on ``Porgy \n     and Bess,'' they were frequent customers. They would also \n     discuss the creation of the show at dinners in the Mazo \n     family home.\n       Decades later, the Mazo tradition of hospitality would \n     continue at the Algonquin. Mrs. Bodne cooked chicken soup for \n     an ailing Laurence Olivier. She baby-sat for Simone Signoret, \n     who called her ``one of my three truest friends.''\n       Mrs. Bodne had a gift for acquiring house seats for sold-\n     out Broadway shows for desperate friends. Ella Fitzgerald was \n     so grateful that she regularly sang to Mrs. Bodne whenever \n     she stayed at the hotel.\n       The Irish writer Brendan Behan was so touched by a courtesy \n     that he declared, ``Mary, your son will live to be pope,'' \n     even though Mrs. Bodne was Jewish and had two daughters.\n       The daughters, Renee Colby Chubet and Barbara Anspach, both \n     live in Manhattan. Mrs. Bodne is also survived by four \n     sisters: Annie Rabin and Celie Weissman, both of Manhattan, \n     and Minnie Meislin and Norma Mazo, both of Charleston.\n       The Bodnes bought the Algonquin, built in 1902 in the \n     French Renaissance style, from Frank Case, who had catered to \n     writers and editors from The New Yorker and other nearby \n     publications. Among them were Dorothy Parker, Robert \n     Benchley, Franklin P. Adams, Edna Ferber and Alexander \n     Woollcott. They gathered around several tables before \n     settling on the round one that became famous, not least \n     because of Mr. Case's knack for publicity.\n       When he bought the hotel, Mr. Bodne, who enjoyed promoting \n     boxing matches, said he would not attempt to recreate Mr. \n     Case's role as boniface of the literati. But he said he \n     regarded the Algonquin as an investment and, as such, had no \n     intention of changing its essential character. So he kept the \n     mahogany panels and deep-pile carpeting, while adding such \n     amenities as color television and air-conditioning.\n       The Bodnes ended up playing host to a new generation of \n     literary and show business celebrities, like the writer John \n     Henry Faulk when he was blacklisted and exiled from \n     Hollywood. Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe made so much \n     noise working on a musical that the other guests complained; \n     the show was the hugely successful ``My Fair Lady.''\n       Mr. Bodne, who died in 1992, had vowed that he would sell \n     the charmingly dowager hotel the day it needed self-service \n     elevators. He sold it in 1987 to the Aoki Corporation, the \n     Brazilian subsidiary of a Japanese corporation, which in a \n     1991 renovation installed self-service elevators.\n       In 1997, Aoki sold the hotel to the Camberley Hotel \n     Company, which promptly did its own $4 million renovation, \n     promising no major changes. In an article in The New York \n     Times, Julie V. Iovine noted that the newsstand had been \n     sacrificed for space to sell coffee mugs, and that door \n     numbers had been replaced by plaques featuring remarks by the \n     famed Algonquin wits. The impression, she wrote, was ``self-\n     consciousness verging on kitsch.''\n       At a party celebrating the makeover, Mrs. Bodne sat on the \n     new velvet chair that had replaced her beloved old sagging \n     one. ``What I've seen looks very nice, but it will never look \n     like my old Algonquin now,'' she said. ``No, darling, I know \n     it will never be the same.''\n       Except for the cat. Each owner of the Algonquin, including \n     the Bodnes, has kept a lobby cat. The current one is named \n     Matilda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2344-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SARAH DAHLIN\n\n   Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly commend \nand honor Sarah Dahlin of Vermillion, South Dakota. Sarah has been a \nhighly-valued member of my legislative staff for approximately eight \nyears, and I wanted to take this opportunity to publicly thank her for \nyears of hard work and dedication to the people of South Dakota. Sarah \nwill no longer be working on my staff after this week, and I, along \nwith my entire staff, will miss her greatly. I have had the pleasure of \nknowing Sarah and her family for years, as we are both residents of \nVermillion.\n  Fortunately for us and for Congress, Ms. Dahlin will not be leaving \nCapitol Hill, as she will be joining the office of Representative Karen \nMcCarthy. Sarah is truly a public servant, as demonstrated by her \nefforts in my office since 1992, when she joined my staff in the House \nof Representatives as a legislative correspondent. Sarah quickly earned \nmy trust and confidence, as well as that of my senior staff, and she \nsoon became a legislative assistant covering my Natural Resources \nCommittee assignment, as well as a whole range of issues, from energy \nand environment, to defense and education, issues that are critically \nimportant to South Dakota. Issues and projects that Sarah has worked on \nfor me and the people of South Dakota are too numerous to list, but \nSarah has left a lasting contribution in many ways, from helping rural \ntransit-providers receive a fair share of federal transit funds to \nhelping South Dakota recover from devastating blizzards and flooding. \nSarah's efforts over a number of years have helped make the Springfield \nbridge over the Missouri River a reality, with the Vermillion bridge \nnot far behind. Sarah is the staff person who worked with me to pass an \namendment to secure federal funds for the ongoing rehabilitation of the \nJames River in South Dakota, an effort that will have a longstanding \npositive impact on the James River valley. She has helped create a new \nNational Park Service facility to preserve a missile silo site, as well \nas help preserve important historical sites known as Spirit Mound and \nBlood Run.\n  After working on my House staff for more than four years, Sarah moved \nover to my Senate staff where she became a Senior Legislative \nAssistant. As well as staffing my Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee assignment during the last three plus years I have served in \nthe Senate, most recently Sarah has also been responsible for staffing \nmy Senate Budget Committee assignment. During consideration of the \nfiscal year 2000 and 2001 budget resolutions, Sarah has been \ninstrumental in the passage of my amendments to increase funding for \nveterans health care, as well as the passage of an amendment to create \na reserve fund for military retirees health care.\n  I know Sarah's parents, family, friends and colleagues are all very \nproud of her. She has a wonderful career and life in front of her, and \nI know she will continue to succeed at whatever she chooses to do. \nHopefully she will have an opportunity to one day again serve the \npeople of South Dakota. Mr. President, on behalf of my wife Barbara and \nI, and my entire staff, I want to thank Sarah Dahlin for her dedication \nand years of hard work for the people of South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2344-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2344-S2345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REGISTRATION OF MASS MAILINGS\n\n  The filing date for 2000 first quarter mass mailings is April 25, \n2000.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to waive \nfederal preemption State law providing for the awarding of punitive \ndamages against motor carriers for engaging in unfair or deceptive \ntrade practices in the processing of claims relating to loss, damage, \ninjury, or delay in connection with transportation of property in \ninterstate commerce; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                   MOVING COMPANY RESPONSIBILITY ACT\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Moving \nCompany Responsibility Act of 1999 to improve the protections afforded \nto consumers who hire moving companies to carry their possessions from \none state to another. Under current law, consumers whose goods are lost \nor stolen during transit have no redress against moving companies that \ndeceive or mistreat them during the claims process.\n  This problem was first brought to my attention by my constituents, \nJane Rini and John Pucci. In 1990, Ms. Rini hired a moving company to \ntransport her household goods from South Carolina to Massachusetts to \nattend Smith College's Ada Comstock Program. Among Ms. Rini's \npossessions were valuable original paintings and art objects that had \nbeen passed down through her family. When her belongings were delivered \nby the driver employed by the moving company, Ms. Rini noticed that the \nboxes containing the works of art were missing. Although the company's \ndriver was not able to locate the boxes, he demanded that Ms. Rini sign \ninventory sheets indicating that her goods had been properly delivered \nand refused to leave her house until she signed for the delivery. Under \npressure, Ms. Rini signed the inventory sheets, noting on them that \nboxes containing the works of art were missing. She was not informed by \nthe company that she should note missing boxes on the bill of lading, \nnor was she given the pamphlet containing this information, as required \nby federal law. The next day, Ms. Rini and her family unpacked the \nboxes that had been delivered and determined conclusively that eleven \nworks of art were missing. They have never been recovered.\n  From that point on, Ms. Rini did everything to obtain redress that \nreasonably could be expected of a consumer. She filed her claim with \nthe moving company in a timely manner, and she went to great lengths to \nsupply the moving company's claims adjusters with all the information \nthey needed to process her claim. However, her efforts to recover \ndamages for the lost artwork were met with abusive and deceptive \ntactics seemingly designed to discourage her claim.\n  At the beginning of the claims process, the company demanded that Ms. \nRini provide it with documentation such as canceled checks, recent \nappraisal information, insurance riders, or cash receipts. Ms. Rini had \nno recent information on the works because they had been handed down \nthrough her family for generations, but she was able to supply the \ncompany with photographs of most of the missing pieces, and she even \npaid for professional appraisals of the works based on the photos. She \nalso provided the company with a letter from 1929 which reflected the \nauthenticity of some of the pieces.\n  Mr. President, this should have been more than enough to satisfy the \ncompany as to the validity of Ms. Rini's claim, but the company refused \nto accept appraisals unless they were based upon actual examination of \nthe objects. Meanwhile, Ms. Rini was told by a company representative \nthat a thorough investigation of her claim would be conducted, but the \nrepresentative negligently failed to interview or take written \nstatements in a timely manner from any of the employees involved in the \nmove who might have been able to substantiate the claim.\n  Almost nine months later, the company denied Ms. Rini's claim on the \ngrounds that all items were delivered and signed for on the bill of \nlading without a notation indicating missing items; that the company \nhad not received adequate documentation to substantiate Rini's claims; \nand that the company had not uncovered any evidence that the works had \nnot been delivered to Northampton.\n\n[[Page S2348]]\n\n  Ms. Rini finally took her case to a District Court in Massachusetts. \nDuring the trial, the moving company's own expert witnesses testified \nthat reliable and fair estimates of the value of works of art are \ncommonly obtained through examination of photographs, but the company \nmaintained that Ms. Rini's documentary proof was insubstantial and \ndenied that it had a duty to settle the claim. Upon hearing the \ntestimony, the court found Ms. Rini's documentation provided sufficient \nevidence upon which the moving company should have settled her claim. \nIt further characterized the company's tactics as ``unfair,'' \n``unethical,'' and ``deceptive,'' and found that Ms. Rini was entitled \nto recover damages for injury she suffered as a result of the company's \nnegligence and misrepresentation throughout the claims process. \nHowever, the District Court's decision, which was based on \nMassachusetts law, was overturned by the First Circuit Court of \nAppeals, which found that state law providing relief to Ms. Rini is \npreempted by the federal law establishing uniform liability for motor \ncarriers.\n\n  Mr. President, Ms. Rini's story is just an illustration of the larger \nproblem. Under current law, irresponsible, unethical moving companies \nare allowed to mistreat those who depend on them for service, and there \nis no recourse for consumers who are the victims of negligence or \ndeception. Consumers who place their trust in moving companies should \nhave a reasonable expectation that they will be treated with \nconsideration and respect at all times; and when a company fails to \ndeliver on its promise to transport household goods in good condition, \nconsumers' efforts to recover damages should not be met with the kind \nof abuse and deception that Ms. Rini experienced. No consumer should \nhave to suffer that sort of treatment.\n  Unfortunately, current law provides little or no incentive for moving \ncompanies to make sure that customer claims are handled fairly. In \nfact, under current law, moving companies can act irresponsibly and \nunfairly with impunity. According to the Department of Transportation, \nwell over 2,500 complaints were filed against moving companies in 1998, \nthe most recent year for which this information is available. That's \nmore than 2,500 consumers who believe they were treated unfairly--and \nthose are just the consumers who actually took the time to file \ncomplaints. The time for Congress to act to protect consumers is now, \nand passage of the Moving Company Responsibility Act is the first step.\n  The Moving Company Responsibility Act would provide customers with a \nmeans of redress against unethical companies by allowing them to pursue \nclaims under state law. The penalties and fines available under state \nlaws would serve as an incentive to companies to treat customers fairly \nthroughout the business relationship. This is a simple bill, but it is \nneeded to ensure that consumers are adequately protected when they \ncontract with moving companies.\n  I would like to thank my constituents, Ms. Rini and Mr. Pucci, for \nbringing this important consumer protection matter to my attention.\n  This bill will provide important protections to consumers, and I hope \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting it \nso that we can pass it quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the Federal Building located at 500 \nPearl Street in New York City, New York, as the ``Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan United States Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n\n\nlegislation s. 2370 to name the federal courthouse at 500 pearl street \n          in new york city for senator daniel patrick moynihan\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today with 61 of my colleagues to \nintroduce a bill to name the beautiful Federal Courthouse located at \n500 Pearl Street in Manhattan, after my esteemed colleague and champion \nof this project, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  When I think about the many accomplishments of the distinguished \nSenator or the numerous accolades that he has received, I am left with \nvery big shoes to fill and very few words that have yet to be used to \ndescribe the man and his legacy. His roles throughout his 47-year \ncareer in public service include legislator, scholar, reformer, teacher \nand last, but definitely not least, builder. In New York, Pat Moynihan \nhas taught us the value of beautiful public works.\n  It is especially for his role as builder that we honor Pat Moynihan \ntoday. The Federal Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street embodies the same \nspirit as his previous architectural endeavors--an extraordinary work \nof art, inside and out. Completed in 1994, the Courthouse was designed \nby the distinguished architectural firm of Kohn Pederson Fox with a \ndignity worthy of the weighty judicial matters considered within its \nwalls. It is a magnificent structure of solid granite, marble, and \nsturdy oak, built to last 200 years, adorned with public art from \nnotable contemporary artists Ray Kaskey and Maya Lin.\n  Not coincidentally, the Courthouse's presence and elegance befit the \nman who was most responsible for its creation--Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, who has been an enduring champion of excellence in public \narchitecture, both here in Washington and at home in New York. Senator \nMoynihan toiled for nearly a decade prodding the Congress, General \nServices Administration, three New York City mayors, and anyone else he \nneeded, to see this spectacular Courthouse built.\n\n  Senator Moynihan has always been an important force for architecture \nin New York. He was responsible for the restoration of the spectacular \nBeaux-Arts Custom House at Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan and beloved \nin Buffalo for reawakening that city's appreciation for its \narchitectural heritage, which includes Frank Lloyd Wright houses and \nthe Prudential Building, one of the best-known early American \nskyscrapers by the architect Louis H. Sullivan--a building which \nMoynihan helped restore and then chose as his Buffalo office. Moynihan \nhas also spurred a powerful popular movement in Buffalo to build a new \nsignature Peace Bridge over the Niagara River.\n  But the project for which he is best known is his beloved \nPennsylvania Station. In 1963, Pat Moynihan was one of\n\n[[Page S2349]]\n\na group of prescient New Yorkers who protested the tragic razing of our \nCity's spectacular Penn Station--a glorious public building designed by \nMcKim, Mead & White, the Nation's premier architectural firm of the \ntime.\n  It was Pat Moynihan who recognized years ago that across the street \nfrom what is now a sad basement terminal that functions--barely--as New \nYork City's train station, sits the James A. Farley Post Office \nBuilding, built by the same architects, in much the same grand design, \nas the old Penn Station. Pat Moynihan recognized that we could use the \nFarley Building to once again create a train station worthy of our \ngreat City. I, along with many of my colleagues, offered a bill last \nyear to name that new train station after him, but Senator Moynihan, \nwith characteristic modesty, asked that the station keep the Farley \nname.\n  Fortunately, the Courthouse at 500 Pearl Street will serve as an \nequally fitting tribute and provide an enduring monument in the heart \nof the City that Pat Moynihan and I both love so dearly, a monument for \nthe millions of New Yorkers and their fellow Americans who love and \nadmire Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2370\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN UNITED \n                   STATES COURTHOUSE.\n\n       The Federal building located at 500 Pearl Street in New \n     York City, New York, shall be known and designated as the \n     ``Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the Federal building \n     referred to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to \n     the Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I commend Senator Schumer for \nsubmitting this resolution. I, too, have had the privilege of working \nwith Senator Pat Moynihan on the Environment and Public Works Committee \nfor almost 18 years. There are few people who have a better knowledge \nof history, design, and concept than does our friend, Pat Moynihan.\n  I join Senator Schumer in his comments about Senator Pat Moynihan. I \nam very familiar with the railroad station. Many people from New \nJersey, and people from all over the country, will get to see this \nstation and the contributions Senator Moynihan has made to our national \nwell-being.\n  I urge passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as has the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey, I have had the privilege of serving with our friend, Senator \nMoynihan, for many years on the Environment and Public Works Committee. \nIf I may say with some little immodesty, I have been sort of a silent \npartner with Senator Moynihan, not so much on this project--this was \nentirely his, I say to the junior Senator--but the Ronald Reagan \nAirport, for example, and the completion of the Federal Triangle are \nmajor, significant landmarks which will go forward for future \ngenerations. But for this quiet, modest, knowledgeable man--I doubt if \nhe would ever be a cosponsor of this resolution--it is most befitting \nthat this be done to recognize a man who stands for the rule of law.\n  I thank the Senator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. \n        Bryan):\n  S. 2378. A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to improve the safety of the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n  stop all frequent errors (safe) in medicare and medicaid act of 2000\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this \nimportant legislation today with my colleagues, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Kerrey, and Senator Bryan. This bill represents an important \nstep toward ensuring patients receive safe, quality health care in our \nnation's hospitals and healthcare facilities.\n  The Institute of Medicine (IOM) Report released last fall indicates \nthat nearly 44,000 to 98,000 people die or are seriously hurt in \nhospitals every year. That is equivalent to having three jumbo jets \nfilled with passengers crash every two days. Should we be safer flying \nin an airplane than going to a hospital for routine surgery?\n  Take the case of Gary Masiello, who lost his daughter when her \nbreathing tube was accidentally disconnected. Nine months later he lost \nhis wife in another hospital when she choked on her medication. He no \nlonger has the confidence that he or his family are safe when entering \nthe hospital.\n  The case of Betsy Lehman, a Boston Globe health reporter, is yet \nanother example of how medical mistakes can lead to death. She received \na drug overdose in 1994 during her chemotherapy treatment.\n  Ironically, even one of the contributors to the IOM report was \ntouched by a medical error. Mary Wakefield, while she was preparing the \nreport, discovered that her 83 year old mother was operated on the \nwrong hand.\n  Today, Senator Lieberman, Senator Kerrey, Senator Bryan, and I are \nintroducing a bipartisan bill to make patient safety a national \nhealthcare priority. We recognize that mistakes happen, and that in our \ncomplex healthcare system, problems will occur. But in a country that \nis the leader in healthcare research, technology, and advancement, we \nshould be able to do much, much better when it comes to patient safety.\n  We are not here today to point the finger or to blame. We are here to \nprovide a solution to this disturbing problem--a problem we think is \npreventable.\n  Our legislation establishes a reporting and patient safety program \nfor hospitals and other healthcare providers that participate in the \nMedicare and Medicaid programs, which would include virtually every \nhealthcare facility in the United States. Billions of federal tax \ndollars go to these programs. The taxpayers deserve to know that the \nhealthcare system they invest in provides safe, high-quality care.\n  This bill extends confidentiality protections to ensure that \nproviders will report without risk of retaliation by trial lawyers. By \ncreating a safe environment, this bill will foster reporting and \ncorrective action plans in hospitals and healthcare facilities across \nthe country.\n  Our legislation will improve patient safety and give providers the \ntools they need to address medical mistakes before patients are harmed. \nThese errors are not intentional by any means, but they are \npreventable. So, I ask that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this bill to ensure that medical errors become a thing of the \npast.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Section-By-Section of the Stop All Frequent Errors (SAFE) in Medicare \n                        and Medicaid Act of 2000\n\n       Section I. Title and Table of Contents.\n       Section II. Purpose--This section describes the intent of \n     the legislation which is to create a non-punitive medical \n     error reduction program under the Medicare and Medicaid \n     programs through identification of medical errors, extension \n     of confidentiality with limited disclosure, and \n     implementation of systems and processes to reduce the number \n     of adverse events that occur.\n       Section III. Improvement of Patient Safety under the \n     Medicare Program--This section establishes the guidelines for \n     the medical error reduction program in the Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs as a condition of participation.\n       Facilities that choose to participate in the Medicare and \n     Medicaid programs including hospitals, critical access \n     hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, comprehensive \n     outpatient rehabilitation facilities, home health agencies, \n     hospice, renal dialysis facilities, and ambulatory surgery \n     centers would have to meet the requirements of this Act.\n       Hospitals would be required to participate one year after \n     the date of enactment of this Act. The other institutions \n     would be phased-in on a timetable to be determined by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n       Providers would have to implement a patient safety program \n     to reduce medical errors. The program will target both \n     sentinel events and additional events associated with injury \n     as targeted by the Secretary, or local providers. The program \n     shall utilize active investigation to discover health care \n     errors and achieve measurable improvement in the rates of \n     health care errors.\n\n[[Page S2350]]\n\n       In addition, providers would be required to report sentinel \n     events and additional designated errors to the following: (1) \n     their state health department; (2) a national accrediting \n     organization when applicable, i.e. the Joint Commission on \n     the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO); and \n     (3) the Medicare peer review organizations. The facility \n     would be responsible for performing a root-cause analysis and \n     implementing a corrective action plan that reduces the risk \n     of such event happening in the future. Providers can \n     designate which agency or entity described above to approve \n     their compliance with the reporting and correction program. \n     Aggregated reports without identifiers would be submitted to \n     the Secretary by the agency or entity.\n       Confidentiality and privacy protections based on current \n     peer review protections would be extended to ensure that \n     institutions would be encouraged to report and to implement \n     effective patient safety programs. Information would also be \n     protected for the purposes of conducting peer review \n     activities and root cause analysis.\n       A definition of poor performance is complying with the \n     reporting and correction program will be specified by the \n     Secretary, JCAHO, the Agency for Healthcare Research and \n     Quality (AHRQ), the peer review organizations, providers and \n     consumer organizations. When a facility has a pattern of \n     poor performance, this information is reported to the \n     Secretary and the Secretary shall then release this \n     information to the public. This would occur if the pattern \n     of poor performance continues for more than two years, and \n     a provider fails to report sentinel events and implement \n     corrective actions to address safety problems.\n       Section IV. Improvement of Patient Safety Under the \n     Medicaid Program--This section extends the Medicare \n     provisions above to congregate care providers in the Medicaid \n     program. Congregate care provider is defined as facilities in \n     the Medicaid program that provide hospital services, nursing \n     facility services, services of intermediate care facilities \n     for the mentally retarded, hospice care, residential \n     treatment centers for children, services in an institution \n     for mental diseases, and inpatient psychiatric hospital \n     services for individuals under age of 21.\n       Section V. Establishment of the Center for Patient Safety--\n     This section establishes a Center for Patient Safety (Center) \n     within HHS. The mission of the Center is to improve patient \n     safety and reduce the incidence of medical errors. The Center \n     would establish national goals for patient safety and \n     mechanisms to track such goals. In addition, the Center would \n     prepare and submit an annual report to the President and \n     Congress with recommendations concerning patient safety. \n     Among some of its duties, the Center would develop a national \n     health care patient safety research agenda, disseminate \n     information and evaluate mechanisms to improve patient \n     safety, and conduct pilot projects to conduct new or \n     innovative patient safety reporting systems.\n       Section VI. Grants to Establish Patient Safety Programs--\n     This section authorizes the Center to award grants to \n     providers and health professionals affiliated with such \n     providers for the establishment and operation of patient \n     safety programs.\n       Section VII. Authorization of Appropriations--This section \n     authorizes the following amounts:\n       (1) For fiscal year 2001, $30,000,000.\n       (2) For fiscal year 2002, $35,000,000.\n       (3) For fiscal year 2003, $40,000,000.\n       (4) For each fiscal year thereafter, such sums as may be \n     necessary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. L. Chafee, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 2379. A bill to provide for the protection of children from \ntobacco; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n             kids deserve freedom from tobacco act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined by \nSenators Chafee and Graham to introduce the ``KIDS Deserve Freedom from \nTobacco Act of 2000.''\n  Just over 2 years ago, on March 31, 1998, Senators Harkin, Chafee and \nGraham teamed up to introduce the first comprehensive bipartisan \nlegislation to reduce teen smoking. Today, I am pleased to announce \nthat Senators Harkin, Chafee and Graham are teaming up again with the \nsame goal. This bill is the first bipartisan Senate effort to restore \nthe Food and Drug Administration's authority to protect our kids from \ntobacco.\n  We feel it is absolutely critical to show bipartisan support for \npicking up the ball the Supreme Court dropped in our lap just two weeks \nago. We hope that our announcement today will be the beginning of a \nbipartisan push to get this type of common sense legislation passed.\n  The need is clear. As the Supreme Court recognized, tobacco use among \nchildren and adolescents is probably the single most significant threat \nto public health in the United States. A new study released just \nyesterday shows how the tobacco industry continues to successfully \ntarget our children. Seventy-three percent of teens reported seeing \ntobacco advertising in the previous two weeks, compared to only 33% of \nadults. And 77% of teens say it is easy for kids to buy cigarettes.\n  That is why 3,000 kids start smoking every day and fully 1,000 of \nthem will die prematurely because of it. That's the equivalent of 3 \njumbo jets packed with kids crashing every day. And that is why \ncigarette smoking among high school seniors is at a 19-year high. There \nis no question we face a public health crisis of unmatched proportions \nand we have the opportunity this year to stop it.\n  Passing comprehensive legislation that would dramatically reduce the \nnumber of American children hooked on this deadly habit is a once and a \nlifetime opportunity. Unfortunately, though, the tobacco debate in \nWashington has so far been largely partisan. That's why we've joined \narms across party lines behind the KIDS Deserve Freedom From Tobacco \nAct, the KIDS Act. We hope and believe that the introduction of our \nbipartisan bill will change the debate and significantly increase the \nodds that reforms will be made this year.\n  Let me be clear. Nicotine is an addictive product and cigarettes \nkill. Even the tobacco companies are starting to admit it. In fact, Big \nTobacco has known this for so long, they deliberately manipulate the \nnicotine in cigarettes to get more people addicted.\n  The FDA regulations, struck down by the Supreme Court two weeks ago, \nwere about stopping kids from smoking. These regulations were an \ninvestment in the future of our kids.\n  Our legislation will re-affirm the FDA's authority over tobacco \nproducts. It will classify nicotine as a drug and tobacco products as \ndrug delivery devices. It will allow FDA to implement a ``public \nhealth'' standard in its review and regulation of tobacco products. By \ncodifying FDA's regulation of 1996, our legislation will also allow for \ncontinuation of the critically important youth ID checks. It will \nprovide needed youth access restrictions such as requiring tobacco \nproducts to be kept behind store counters and ban vending machines. It \nwill also include sensible advertising limits as well as other \nimportant provisions of the original FDA rule designed to reduce teen \naccess to tobacco.\n  For the sake of our kids and the public health, we have a \nresponsibility to act quickly on this. Today, we begin that important \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to examine our legislation and \ngive us their comments. We should not leave this year without taking \nthis type of common sense step to protect our kids.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Harkin \nand Bob Graham in introducing the Kids Deserve Freedom From Tobacco Act \nof 2000, which would give the Food and Drug Administration the \nauthority to regulate the manufacture and sale of tobacco. This \nlegislation is a common-sense and bipartisan approach to ensure that \ntobacco products do not get into the hands of minors, especially in \nlight of the Supreme Court's recent decision that the FDA does not have \nthe authority to regulate tobacco products.\n  The Supreme Court's recent decision is disappointing. This judgment, \nwhile following the letter of the law, will cause unnecessary harm to \nmillions of people unless Congress acts quickly to stem its affects. We \nmust ensure that the FDA regulations are enacted into law.\n  Not only does tobacco pose a significant risk to the individual \nsmoker, but it reaps a high cost from the American public. The \nwidespread use of tobacco is eating away at our society's physical and \nfinancial health. Tobacco's physical toll in deaths and diseases is \nwell-documented. However, the financial weight that tobacco places on \nAmerica's overburdened health care system is often overlooked. As the \nsingle most preventable cause of premature death, disease and \ndisability facing our nation, tobacco use is also the single biggest \npreventable expense to our nation's health care system.\n  America's publicly financed health care system has also suffered. \nNearly half the costs of treating tobacco related illnesses--\napproximately $25 billion in 1993, according to the Centers for Disease \nControl--fall to state and federal governments through such programs as \nMedicare and Medicaid. This\n\n[[Page S2351]]\n\nunnecessary fiscal burden has hit the health care industry hard, \nincreasing the cost of health care, while driving millions into the \nranks of the uninsured. As Congress struggles to pull the Medicare \nprogram back from the brink of insolvency, it is clear that the huge \ncosts of the preventable illnesses caused by tobacco need to be \naddressed. We have a clear choice: attack the problem of preventable \ndisease, or place a greater burden on our already financially strapped \nhealth care system.\n  The Supreme Court did not argue the scientific evidence: nicotine is \na drug and cigarettes are drug delivery devices. Nicotine is addictive, \nit lures children, kills adults, and drives up our nation's health care \ncosts. In fact, the Court's majority opinion admitted that tobacco use \nwas ``perhaps the single most significant threat to public health in \nthe United States.''\n  The only thing the FDA lacks, they said, was explicit authority to \nregulate tobacco products. Fine! Today, we propose to give them that \nauthority. This bipartisan measure will abide by the intent of the \nCourt's ruling by granting the FDA explicit authority to regulate these \ndeadly and addictive products as it does for all other drugs.\n  Congress cannot afford to wait. The three thousand children who get \nhooked on tobacco each day cannot afford to wait. Our overburdened \nhealth care system cannot afford to wait. I hope my colleagues in both \nHouses of Congress will come together in a bipartisan spirit to grant \nthe FDA authority to stop the spread of the tobacco contagion.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for far too long, the health and welfare \nof America's children have been jeopardized by a relatively unregulated \ntobacco industry.\n  ``The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has amply demonstrated that \ntobacco use, particularly among children and adolescents, poses perhaps \nthe single most serious threat to public health in the United States.''\n  These words aren't mine. They are Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's, the \nauthor of the majority opinion in Food and Drug Administration v. Brown \nand Williamson--the recent case which prevents the FDA from effectively \nregulating tobacco.\n  We have worked hard to protect our children from the perils of \ntobacco, but we clearly have not done enough.\n  A study recently released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration (SAMHSA) shows that over 18 percent of youth \nbetween the ages of 12 and 17 are smokers.\n  That translates into 4.1 million kids. And, every day, another 3,000 \nchildren join the ranks of their smoking peers.\n  Not only are these children exposing themselves to the long-term \nhealth risks that we know tobacco to pose, they are increasing the \nlikeliness that they will develop other harmful addictions.\n  SAMHSA's study has revealed that children who smoke are over 11 times \nmore likely to use illicit drugs and 16 times more likely to drink \nheavily than are their nonsmoking peers. Specifically, children who \nsmoke are 100 times more likely to also smoke marijuana and 32 times \nmore likely to use cocaine than nonsmoking children.\n  Today, of the 4.1 million children who currently smoke, \napproximately: 35% smoke marijuana; 8% take hallucinogenic drugs; 5% \nuse cocaine; and 4% sniff inhalants.\n  The Supreme Court has placed the burden of protecting not only these \nchildren, but all children from tobacco squarely on the shoulders of \nthe Congress. This is indeed a heavy weight to bear, but it is one from \nwhich we cannot afford to shy away.\n  We are here today to announce that we have accepted this charge, and \nare introducing legislation that will provide America's children with \nreal protections from tobacco.\n  Currently, the FDA has the authority to regulate virtually all \nproducts which we consume or apply to our skin--food, drugs, cosmetics \nand medical devices--protecting Americans by ensuring that these \nproducts meet certain health standards.\n  Yet, today, FDA authority--and thus, FDA protection--does not apply \nto tobacco.\n  Congress can extend these protections by giving the FDA the authority \nto truly regulate tobacco products.\n  Our legislation would do just that. It would give the FDA authority \nto: (1) reduce harmful components--such as nicotine--in tobacco \nproducts; (2) impose appropriate advertising and marketing restrictions \nto reduce teenage tobacco use; (3) require manufacturers to submit \ninformation about the health effects of their product to the FDA; (4) \nrequire strong warning labels; and (5) regulate health claims and \n``Reduced Risk'' products.\n  Mr. President, we are all in agreement that it is our responsibility \nto promote a healthier America. This legislation will help us achieve \nthat collective goal, by giving the FDA the authority to regulate the \ntobacco industry. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nmeasure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 2380. A bill to provide for international family planning funding \nfor the fiscal year 2001, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n saving women's lives through international family planning act of 2000\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nSaving Women's Lives through International Family Planning Act of 2000. \nI would like to thank Senator Snowe, Senator Boxer, and Senator Murray \nfor joining me as cosponsors and I invite others to join us. \nCongresswoman Maloney introduced this legislation in the House in \nFebruary, and it has gained the support of 94 cosponsors on both sides \nof the aisle in that body.\n  Mr. President, while global population growth has slowed, the world's \npopulation reached 6 billion in 1999 and is expected to rise to 8.9 \nbillion by 2050. Nearly all of this growth is occurring in developing \nnations. High population density puts tremendous strain on water and \nother resources and takes an increasing toll on the quality and length \nof human life.\n  Each year, more than 585,000 women die from complications related to \npregnancy and childbirth. And millions of women suffer serious health \nproblems following childbirth.\n  International family planning programs are our best hope to slow \npopulation growth and decrease mortality rates, and that's why the \nlegislation I'm introducing today is so important.\n  Tomorrow is World Health Day, an appropriate occasion to remember \nthat international family planning programs save the lives of millions \nof women all over the world. Providing reproductive health care and \nhealth education results in safer pregnancies and safer motherhood.\n  Yet this country is paying hundreds of millions of dollars less on \ninternational family planning programs today than it did five years \nago. We need to restore this country's commitment to helping those in \ndeveloping countries raise their standards of living, and family \nplanning must be an important part of that assistance. Without this \nrenewed commitment, high fertility rates and rapid population growth \nwill prevent people in the poorest countries from rising out of \npoverty.\n  The Saving Women's Lives through International Family Planning Act of \n2000 authorizes $541.6 million--the funding level requested by \nPresident Clinton--for bilateral family planning programs and related \nassistance abroad. It also provides $35 million for the United Nations \nPopulation Fund, known as UNFPA. This would return our level of \ninternational family planning assistance to where it was in fiscal \n1995. This is a sound investment that will bring returns for decades to \ncome.\n  This bill would also reverse the so-called ``gag rule'' that \nrestricts USAID grants to non-governmental organizations abroad that \nuse their own funds to advocate a woman's right to choose or to perform \nlegal medical procedures. Under this bill, the requirements we apply to \nNGOs would not be more restrictive that the requirements on foreign \ngovernments that receive similar assistance.\n  I have fought for years, as a member of the Foreign Operations \nAppropriations subcommittee, for adequate funding for international \nfamily planning programs without restrictions which would limit the \nreach or effectiveness of our aid.\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\n  Last year, we were forced to accept the gag rule in exchange for \ncongressional agreement to pay U.S. arrears to the United Nations. It \nwas a bitter pill to swallow and we must eliminate this provision now. \nIt's unfair and undemocratic. By restricting the freedom of \norganizations to engage in public policy debates, the gag rule \nundermines a central goal of U.S. foreign policy, the promotion of \ndemocracy--which has at its core the principles of free and open debate \nand citizen involvement in government decisions. And this restriction \nis a serious impediment to our efforts to bring global population \nlevels under control and to protect the lives of millions of women by \nletting them choose to have only as many children as they can care for \nresponsibly.\n  Mr. President, family planning is even more critical to the health of \npeople in developing countries than it is here in America. Many \ndeveloping countries lack the hospitals and clinics and doctors and \nother health-care professionals to provide women with the advice and \ncare they need to have a safe pregnancy. Many lack the facilities and \nexpertise to provide obstetrical and prenatal care women need to \ndeliver healthy babies.\n  Sometimes, a pregnancy can be dangerous, especially if the woman is \ntoo young or too old to bear a child. In many poor societies, families \nhave many children because so many die before they reach adulthood and \nchildren provide the only support in their parents' later years. As a \nresult, families too often have more children than they can \nrealistically support and face malnutrition or even starvation. \nFinally, there are those who do not properly consider the potential \ntransmission of deadly diseases such as AIDS or who do not have access \nto contraceptive devices.\n  For many poor women abroad, family planning clinics offer the only \ngeneral health care available. Without the critical funding provided in \nthis bill, many of these women will unnecessarily suffer and even die. \nWith this assistance, women and children will have a better chance of \nliving longer, healthier lives.\n  We need this legislation to reduce mortality rates, to combat the \nspread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and to give the poorest nations \nan opportunity to meet their social, environmental, and economic needs \nby making family planning available worldwide.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join in support of the Saving \nWomen's Lives through International Family Planning Act of 2000. We all \nhave a stake in helping people in the worlds poorer nations plan their \nfamilies and helping control the impact of population growth on the \nplanet we share.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Akaka, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Ashcroft, Mr. Biden, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Levin, Mr. Graham, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Lieberman, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Robb, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Sessions, \n        and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S.J. Res. 44. A joint resolution supporting the Day of Honor 2000 to \nhonor and recognize the service of minority veterans in the United \nStates Armed Forces during World War II; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                     May 25--``DAY OF HONOR 2000''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senator Daniel Akaka, Senator \nDaniel Inouye, Senator Ted Stevens, and I, along with 24 other \nSenators, are introducing a Senate Joint Resolution to designate May \n25, 2000, as a national Day of Honor for minority veterans of World War \nII. Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee of Texas is introducing an \nidentical resolution in the House of Representatives.\n  Forty-five years ago, the bloodiest war in our history came to an end \nand millions of American service men and women returned to the United \nStates to rebuild their lives after fighting so courageously and \nsuccessfully to defend our country.\n  These brave veterans included large numbers of minorities. More than \n1.2 million African Americans, more than 300,000 Hispanic Americans, \nmore than 50,000 Asian Americans, more than 20,000 Native Americans, \nmore than 6,000 Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, and more than 3,000 \nNative Alaskans risked their lives to preserve our democracy.\n  On land, sea and air, far from their homes, they fought brilliantly \nto defeat fascism and protect our freedom. And large numbers of them \ndid so in spite of the racism and injustice they had suffered in our \nsociety, and even in their military service.\n  Too often, when they returned to America and raised the question of \nfreedom and equal justice here at home, the answer came back, ``no.'' \nToo often, when fundamental issues of equality and respect of their \nservice in the war arose, Jim Crow and racial discrimination replied \nwith a resounding ``no.''\n  Even during the war itself, these brave men and women in uniform had \nfaced racial discrimination and violent and cruel treatment from their \nfellow citizens--and often from their fellow American service men and \nwomen. Even here on American soil during the war, German prisoners of \nwar were allowed to go to places in the United States where black \nAmericans were not allowed to go.\n  Last December, President Clinton dealt at long last with one example \nof these injustices when he pardoned Freddie Meeks, one of 50 African-\nAmerican sailors who were convicted of mutiny and sentenced to prison \nand hard labor in 1944 for refusing to continue loading ammunition \nafter a deadly explosion at the Port Chicago naval facility new San \nFrancisco. That explosion of 10,000 tons of ammunition at the loading \ndock resulted in the deaths of 320 persons, two-thirds of whom were \nblack.\n  As President Clinton noted, Meeks had participated in the \n``extraordinarily difficult job of picking up human remains'' following \nthe blast. White sailors were given 30-day leaves after the blast, but \nblack sailors were ordered back to work. Meeks and 257 others were \ncourt-martialed after they refused to continue loading the ammunitions, \nbecause the order was so blatantly racist and the danger was so great. \nThe pardon, granted by the President, was eminently justified. The Navy \nhad agreed in a 1994 review of the case that the sailors had been \nvictims of racial discrimination, but it had not overturned their \nconvictions.\n  Historians feel that the Port Chicago case was a major factor in \nconvincing President Harry Truman to issue his famous Executive order \nin 1948, banning segregation in the armed forces.\n  Japanese Americans were also subjected to shameful discrimination \nduring the war. The Supreme Court upheld the internment of tens of \nthousands of U.S. citizens of Japanese ancestry during the war, because \nthe government was fearful that their allegiance might to be to Japan. \nIn recent years, reparations have been paid as amends for these \nshameful deeds against Japanese Americans, but no reparations can ever \nfully compensate for such gross violations of human liberties.\n  As a nation, we have long since recognized the unfair treatment of \nminorities as a travesty of justice. The landmark decisions of the \nSupreme Court and the enactment of fundamental civil rights laws by \nCongress over the past half century have remedied the worst of these \ninjustices and made our nation a freer and fairer land. But we have yet \nto give adequate recognition to the service, struggles and sacrifices \nof these brave Americans who fought so valiantly in World War II for \nour future.\n  Veterans of that war are now dying at a rate of more than 1,000 a \nday. It is especially important, therefore, for Congress and the \nAdministration to do their part now to pay tribute to these men and \nwomen who served so valiantly in that conflict. This Day of Honor \nResolution is part of The Day of Honor Celebration being planned for \ncommunities across the country, which is being organized by the \nMassachusetts-based Day of Honor 2000 Project. Our goal is that the \nnation will have an opportunity to pause on that day to express our \ngratitude to the veterans of all minority groups who served the nation \nso well.\n  Included in that group of honored veterans are two of our outstanding \ncolleagues in the Senate, Senator Akaka of Hawaii and Senator Inouye of \nHawaii, and my former colleague from\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\nMassachusetts, Senator Edward W. Brooke. Senator Inouye and Senator \nBrooke both speak eloquently and passionately of their World War II \nexperiences in the film, ``The Invisible Soldiers: Unheard Voices,'' \nwhich is a part of the Day of Honor events in local communities.\n  By recognizing May 25th as a national Day of Honor in tribute to \nthese extraordinary men and women, we can help to remedy the many \nwrongs inflicted on them in years gone by, and we can take another step \ntoward true justice in this country. These men and women are part of \nwhat has been called America's greatest generation. In a very real \nsense, we owe them our liberty today and we shall never ever forget \nthem.\n  I urge all members of the Senate to join in sponsoring this \nresolution.\n\n

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) local educational agencies are obligated to provide a \n     free public education to all children even though Federal \n     activity may deprive the local educational agencies of the \n     ability to collect sufficient property or sales taxes to \n     support the education of the children;\n       (2) the Impact Aid program is designed to compensate local \n     educational agencies for the substantial and continuing \n     financial burden resulting from tax revenue lost as a result \n     of Federal activities;\n       (3) the Impact Aid program has not been fully funded since \n     1980 and this shortfall has caused local educational agencies \n     to forego needed infrastructure repairs, delay the purchase \n     of educational materials, delay the purchase of properly \n     equipped buses for disabled children, and delay other \n     pressing needs; and\n       (4) both Congress and the Administration have committed to \n     making education a top priority.\n       (b) Sense of the Sense.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that the Impact Aid \n     Program strive to reach the goal that Section 8003(b) of the \n     program is funded at 64% in fiscal year 2001 appropriation \n     cycle; 76% in fiscal year 2002 appropriation cycle; 88% in \n     fiscal year 2003 appropriation cycle; and 100% in fiscal year \n     2004 appropriation cycle.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DORGAN AMENDMENT NO. 2969\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DORGAN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe concurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. 101, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PAYMENTS TO RURAL \n                   PROVIDERS UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nearly 1 in 4 medicare beneficiaries live in rural \n     areas.\n       (2) Rural medicare beneficiaries pay into the medicare \n     program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act at the \n     same rate as their urban counterparts, but they receive fewer \n     benefits.\n       (3) Currently, 50 percent (2,525 hospitals) of the Nation's \n     5,070 hospitals have fewer than 100 beds, and 56 percent of \n     the Nation's hospitals are located in rural areas.\n       (4) For some rural hospitals, medicare payments account for \n     as much as 87 percent of the total revenues of the hospital.\n       (5) A 1999 study of the impact of Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 (in this section referred to as the ``BBA'') on hospital \n     profit margins found that hospitals with less than 100 beds, \n     which are predominately rural hospitals, are financially \n     hardest hit by the BBA.\n       (6) Left unchecked, the BBA would cause the profit margins \n     of these predominantly rural hospitals to decrease from \n     positive 4.2 percent in fiscal year 1998 to negative 5.6 \n     percent in fiscal year 2002, a drop of 233 percent.\n       (7) On average, reimbursement for items and services under \n     the medicare program provided in rural areas is substantially \n     lower than in urban areas, and this inequity cannot be \n     explained by current differences in the costs associated with \n     providing items and services in rural and urban areas.\n       (8) Currently, increasing numbers of rural communities face \n     critical losses of local health professionals through \n     retirement or the emigration of these professionals to larger \n     communities offering opportunities for better income.\n       (9) Similarly, a lack of opportunity occurs for each \n     Medicare+Choice organization that offers a Medicare+Choice \n     plan in a rural county because the annual Medicare+Choice \n     capitation rate for a beneficiary enrolled in such a plan is \n     less than \\1/2\\ of the rate paid to such an organization \n     under the medicare program on behalf of a beneficiary \n     enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan in an urban county.\n       (10) Congress took a step forward in confronting and \n     addressing the funding crisis for medicare beneficiaries \n     requiring hospital care, home health care, skilled nursing \n     care, and other basic care in rural communities through the \n     Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act \n     of 1999.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget assume that, during \n     deliberations on structural reforms to the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act--\n       (1) Congress should ensure the viability of all health \n     services to medicare beneficiaries residing in rural \n     communities, including inpatient hospital care, outpatient \n     care, skilled nursing facility and therapy services, home \n     health care, and services provided under a Medicare+Choice \n     plan; and\n       (2) the President and Congress should address the \n     continuing inequities between payments under the medicare \n     program to providers for items and services furnished to \n     medicare beneficiaries residing in urban communities versus \n     payments for such items and services furnished to medicare \n     beneficiaries residing in rural communities, as such \n     inequities result in a chronic shortage of providers of care \n     for rural beneficiaries, who pay into the medicare program at \n     the same rate as beneficiaries in urban areas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  DORGAN (AND ROBB) AMENDMENT NO. 2970\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Robb) submitted an amendment intended \nto be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. 101, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL \n                   FEDERAL FUNDING AND TAX INCENTIVES FOR \n                   EMPOWERMENT ZONES AND ENTERPRISE COMMUNITIES \n                   AUTHORIZED AND DESIGNATED PURSUANT TO 1997 AND \n                   1998 LAWS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) providing Federal tax incentives and other incentives \n     to distressed communities across the Nation to help them \n     rebuild and grow was one of the important goals of the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and the Omnibus Consolidated and \n     Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999;\n       (2) to help reach that goal, the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n     1997 authorized 20 additional empowerment zones, 15 urban and \n     5 rural, followed by 20 new rural enterprise communities \n     authorized in 1998;\n       (3) the 1997 law authorizing this second round of \n     empowerment zones (EZs) was also significant and important \n     because it broadened empowerment zone eligibility, for the \n     first time, to Indian tribes and rural regions suffering from \n     massive out-migration;\n       (4) many of our urban and rural communities are not sharing \n     in the benefits of the prolonged economic expansion now \n     enjoyed by many other parts of our country;\n       (5) a total of more than 250 economically distressed urban \n     and rural communities competed for the 20 new empowerment \n     zones and 20 new rural enterprise communities, and those \n     areas designated as zones and communities should be provided \n     with the Federal incentives and encouragement they need to \n     attract new businesses, and the jobs they provide, in order \n     to stimulate economic growth and improvement;\n       (6) unfortunately, those areas that are designated EZs or \n     ECs under the 1997 and 1998 laws or rural economic area \n     partnerships (REAPs) by the Department of Agriculture, are \n     not given the full advantage of Social Services Block Grant \n     funds, tax credits, and some other Federal incentives that \n     Congress provided to the first round of empowerment zones and \n     enterprise communities authorized pursuant to 1993 budget \n     legislation;\n       (7) Congress should act swiftly to provide such designated \n     areas an equal share of tax incentives, grant benefits, and \n     other Federal support at aggregate levels of at least that \n     provided by Congress to distressed urban and rural \n     empowerment zones and enterprise communities pursuant to the \n     1993 omnibus budget reconciliation bill; and\n       (8) a fully funded second round of EZs and ECs is estimated \n     to create and retain about 90,000 jobs and stimulate \n     $10,000,000,000 in private and public investments over the \n     next decade.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) if Congress and the President agree to a substantial \n     tax relief measure, such measure should include full funding \n     for the second round of empowerment zones and enterprise \n     communities authorized in 1997 and 1998 as well as those \n     areas currently designated rural economic area partnerships \n     (REAPs) by the Department of Agriculture; and\n       (2) all such designated distressed areas, rural and urban, \n     should equally share at least the same aggregate level of \n     funding, tax incentives, and other Federal support that \n     Congress provided to urban and rural empowerment zones and \n     enterprise communities authorized by the 1993 omnibus budget \n     reconciliation bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DORGAN AMENDMENT NO. 2971\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DORGAN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\nto the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE ENFORCEMENT OF \n                   TRADE AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Trade Representative's 2000 National \n     Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers documents \n     numerous foreign barriers to United States exports that are \n     not consistent with international trade rules and which are \n     actionable under United States trade law and the World Trade \n     Organization.\n       (2) Foreign barriers that impede United States exports \n     contribute substantially to the United States merchandise \n     trade deficit which has been expanding at an alarming rate, \n     and which soared to $347,000,000,000 in 1999.\n       (3) Huge chronic trade imbalances are not in the national \n     interest of the United States, and cannot be sustained \n     indefinitely without harming the economic prosperity of the \n     United States.\n       (4) United States lives and communities are being injured \n     by a flood of foreign goods coming across United States \n     borders. Many goods are being dumped unfairly below their \n     true value.\n       (5) It is important to United States workers, farmers, \n     ranchers, and businesses that the United States have \n     sufficient tools and resources to enforce the commitments \n     made by its trading partners. \n       (6) The United States merchandise trade deficit with the \n     People's Republic of China surged to nearly $70,000,000,000 \n     in 1999, and the burden on those who enforce our trade \n     agreements will increase enormously under the proposed United \n     States-China World Trade Organization accession agreement.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress should fully fund the trade enforcement \n     initiative contained in the budget submitted by the President \n     for fiscal year 2001 pursuant to section 1105 of title 31, \n     United States Code, so the United States can begin to \n     dedicate sufficient manpower and resources to matters and \n     transactions dealing with trade monitoring and enforcement, \n     and negotiation of trade agreements that benefit United \n     States producers, businesses, and communities;\n       (2) the President and the executive branch of the \n     Government should aggressively enforce United States trade \n     agreements with the full range of United States trade laws, \n     including sections 310, 201, and 301 of the Trade Act of \n     1974, and United States antidumping laws; and\n       (3) the President and executive branch of the Government \n     should give high priority to reducing the United States trade \n     deficit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               DORGAN (AND WELLSTONE) AMENDMENT NO. 2972\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Wellstone) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

Con. Res. 101, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE COPS PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) State and local law enforcement officers provide \n     essential services that preserve and protect our freedom and \n     safety and, with the support of the Community Oriented \n     Policing Service program (referred to in this section as the \n     ``COPS program''), State and local law enforcement officers \n     have succeeded in reducing the national scourge of violent \n     crime.\n       (2) As a result of the assistance provided under the COPS \n     program, our Nation's crime rate has reached its lowest level \n     in more than a generation.\n       (3) As a result of the COPS program, State and local law \n     enforcement agencies have received funds for more than \n     103,000 officers and more than 60,000 of those officers are \n     on the beat, fighting crime, and improving the quality of \n     life in our neighborhoods and schools.\n       (4) The COPS program has assisted in advancing community \n     policing nationwide. Today, 87 percent of the Nation is \n     served by a law enforcement agency that conducts community \n     policing.\n       (5) All major national law enforcement and government \n     organizations including the International Association of \n     Chiefs of Police, the International Brotherhood of Police \n     Officers, the Fraternal Order of Police, the National \n     Sheriffs' Association, the National Troopers Coalition, the \n     International Union of Police Associations, the Federal Law \n     Enforcement Officers Association, the National Association of \n     Police Organizations, the National Organization of Black Law \n     Enforcement Executives, the Police Executive Research Forum, \n     the Police Foundation, the Major Cities Chiefs, the United \n     States Conference of Mayors, and the County Executives of \n     America support the continuation and full funding of the COPS \n     program through fiscal year 2005.\n       (6) The implementation of community policing as a law \n     enforcement strategy is an important factor in the recent \n     reduction of crime in our streets and communities. The \n     national crime rate has fallen for an unprecedented 7\\1/2\\ \n     years. The COPS program and the crime fighting strategies \n     developed by the initiative have demonstrated the Nation's \n     commitment to help reduce the crime rate to levels unseen for \n     the past 25 years.\n       (7) Despite recent gains, crime is still too high in the \n     United States. A violent crime is committed every 21 seconds, \n     a woman raped every 6 minutes, and a person murdered every 31 \n     minutes in the United States. We must continue to fight this \n     battle against crime and violence and reinvest in the gains \n     made by the COPS program.\n       (8) The COPS program has been at the forefront of \n     addressing violence in our schools. During the past year, the \n     COPS program has funded over 2,200 school resource officers \n     and estimates that an additional 1,500 officers will be \n     funded by the end of fiscal year 2000.\n       (9) More than $31,000,000 has been awarded to law \n     enforcement agencies and school districts through the School \n     Based Partnership and School Based Partnership 1999 grant \n     programs. These funds have assisted agencies in fostering \n     problem-solving partnerships with local communities and \n     schools to address the catastrophic youth violence and \n     delinquency crisis that has plagued our Nation.\n       (10) Communities throughout the United States desperately \n     need the expertise and assistance that the COPS program \n     provides through grants as well as training and technical \n     assistance.\n       (11) The COPS program has experienced much success during \n     the past 6 years, but our Nation still has a struggle ahead. \n     The crime rate is down, but it is still too high. We must \n     strengthen our commitment to public safety and continue the \n     support that the COPS program provides to the law enforcement \n     community.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume the commitment of \n     the Federal Government to continue funding the COPS program, \n     and that funding for the COPS program should continue at \n     least through fiscal year 2005.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  BAYH (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2976\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BAYH (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \nEdwards, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Abraham) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, \nS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE PROMOTION OF \n                   RESPONSIBLE FATHERHOOD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) 40 percent of children who live in households without a \n     father have not seen their father in at least 1 year and 50 \n     percent of such children have never visited their father's \n     home;\n       (2) approximately 50 percent of all children born in the \n     United States spend at least \\1/2\\ of their childhood in a \n     family without a father figure;\n       (3) nearly 20 percent of children in grades 6 through 12 \n     report that they have not had a meaningful conversation with \n     even 1 parent in over a month;\n       (4) 3 out of 4 adolescents report that ``they do not have \n     adults in their lives that model positive behaviors'';\n       (5) many of the United States' leading experts on family \n     and child development agree that it is in the best interest \n     of both children and the United States to encourage more two-\n     parent, father-involved families to form and endure;\n       (6) it is important to promote responsible fatherhood and \n     encourage loving and healthy relationships between parents \n     and their children in order to increase the chance that \n     children will have two caring parents to help them grow up \n     healthy and secure and not to--\n\n[[Page S2359]]\n\n       (A) denigrate the standing or parenting efforts of single \n     mothers, whose efforts are heroic;\n       (B) lessen the protection of children from abusive parents;\n       (C) cause women to remain in or enter into abusive \n     relationships; or\n       (D) compromise the health or safety of a custodial parent;\n       (7) children who live apart from their biological father \n     are, in comparison to other children--\n       (A) 5 times more likely to live in poverty;\n       (B) more likely to bring weapons and drugs into the \n     classroom;\n       (C) twice as likely to commit crime;\n       (D) twice as likely to drop out of school;\n       (E) twice as likely to be abused;\n       (F) more likely to commit suicide;\n       (G) more than twice as likely to abuse alcohol or drugs; \n     and\n       (H) more likely to become pregnant as teenagers;\n       (8) the Federal Government spends billions of dollars to \n     address these social ills and very little to address the \n     causes of such social ills;\n       (9) violent criminals are overwhelmingly males who grew up \n     without fathers and the best predictor of crime in a \n     community is the percentage of absent father households;\n       (10) compared with Great Britain, Canada, Australia, \n     Germany, and Italy, the United States has the highest \n     percentage of single parent households with dependent \n     children;\n       (11) the number of children living with only a mother \n     increased from just over 5,000,000 in 1960, to 17,000,000 in \n     1999, and between 1981 and 1991 the percentage of children \n     living with only 1 parent increased from 19 percent to 25 \n     percent;\n       (12) between 20 percent and 30 percent of families in \n     poverty are headed by women who have suffered domestic \n     violence during the past year and between 40 percent and 60 \n     percent of women with children who receive welfare were \n     abused at some time in their life;\n       (13) responsible fatherhood should always recognize and \n     promote values of nonviolence;\n       (14) child support is an important means by which a parent \n     can take financial responsibility for a child and emotional \n     support is an important means by which a parent can take \n     social responsibility for a child; and\n       (15) because children learn by example, community programs \n     that help mold young men into positive role models for their \n     children need to be encouraged.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the \n     legislation implementing this concurrent resolution on the \n     budget should include provisions that--\n       (1) encourage the Senate to take action to address the \n     issue of fatherlessness by holding hearings and considering \n     legislation on the Senate floor before June 18, 2000, \n     Father's Day;\n       (2) encourage States in, not restrict them from, the \n     implementation of programs that provide support for \n     responsible fatherhood, strengthen fragile families, and \n     promote married two-parent families; and\n       (3) implement programs that encourage media campaigns by \n     States and community organizations that are targeted to \n     promote responsible fatherhood, strengthen fragile families, \n     and promote the maintenance of married two-parent families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   LANDRIEU AMENDMENTS NOS. 2977-2979\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Ms. LANDRIEU submitted three amendments intended to be proposed by \nher to the concurrent resolution, S.

Con. Res. 191, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MARGINAL WELL TAX \n                   CREDITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The United States now imports over 55 percent of its \n     daily oil consumption from overseas.\n       (2) This level of foreign dependence represents a \n     significant economic and strategic threat to the United \n     States and contributes to the power of the Organization of \n     Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and to the volatility of \n     world oil prices and supply.\n       (3) The production of oil from marginal wells in the United \n     States, those that produce less than 15 barrels of oil per \n     day and an average of less than 3 barrels of oil per day, \n     accounts for about 20 percent of the Nation's domestic, on-\n     shore production, or about the same amount of oil the United \n     States imports from Saudi Arabia.\n       (4) During the 1997 to 1999 oil price crash, when the price \n     of oil fell below $10 a barrel, an estimated 150,000 marginal \n     oil and gas wells were capped or permanently plugged because \n     the largely small, independent producers who own these wells \n     lost money on their operation and could no longer afford to \n     keep the wells open.\n       (5) This loss of marginal well production caused a loss of \n     between 300,000 and 400,000 barrels of daily United States \n     oil production and significant natural gas production, caused \n     an estimated 65,000 American jobs to be lost, and severely \n     impacted numerous American communities in oil producing \n     regions of the country.\n       (6) Despite the relatively high price of oil today, \n     independent producers are still unable to re-activate these \n     marginal wells because of the high cost of doing so and the \n     lack of assurance that they will not again lose money if the \n     price of oil again falls below the break-even range of $14 to \n     $17 per barrel.\n       (7) Repeated ``boom-and-bust'' cycles like this have \n     contributed to the continued decline of the ability of the \n     United States to supply its own energy needs and to the \n     resulting growing dependence on foreign oil.\n       (8) Supporting marginal well production during periods of \n     low oil prices through counter-cyclical tax code policies \n     makes sound economic sense and is a part of the long-term \n     solution to the Nation's growing reliance on foreign oil and \n     rapidly growing need for natural gas.\n       (9) Support for marginal well production does not raise \n     significant environmental or public land use concerns since \n     such support targets oil and gas production primarily where \n     it already takes place.\n       (10) Supporting a marginal well tax credit like that \n     proposed in S. 2265, the Marginal Well Preservation Act, \n     represents a relatively low-cost way to support this key \n     component of the Nation's domestic energy production and will \n     help to preserve American jobs, schools, and communities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that Congress \n     provide for tax incentives to support the production of oil \n     and natural gas from ``marginal'' wells that produce less \n     than 15 barrels of oil per day (and a corresponding level of \n     natural gas) by enacting a tax credit for a maximum of $3 per \n     barrel for the first 3 barrels of daily production from an \n     existing marginal oil well, to be fully effective when the \n     price of oil reaches $14 per barrel (with a corresponding \n     level and trigger for any existing marginal natural gas \n     well).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                JEFFORDS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2984\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. \nCollins, Mr. Feingold, Mr. L.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PAYMENTS TO HOME \n                   HEALTH AGENCIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) America's home health agencies provide invaluable \n     services that have enabled a growing number of our most frail \n     and vulnerable beneficiaries under the medicare program under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act to avoid hospitals and \n     nursing homes and to remain in the comfort and security of \n     their own homes.\n       (2) A sharp rise in home health spending under the medicare \n     program from 1989 to 1996 prompted Congress and the \n     President, as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (in \n     this section referred to as the ``BBA''), to initiate changes \n     intended to slow this growth.\n       (3) The cuts in home health spending under the medicare \n     program made by the BBA have been deeper and have affected \n     more home health agencies than Congress intended.\n       (4) From fiscal year 1997 to fiscal year 1999, medicare \n     home health spending dropped by almost 50 percent, from \n     $17,800,000,000 to $9,700,000,000, surpassing the savings \n     goals set by Congress for home health services under the BBA \n     by a large margin.\n       (5) The dramatic payment cuts made by the BBA, coupled with \n     overly burdensome new regulatory requirements, have--\n       (A) placed home health agencies in financial peril; and\n       (B) restricted the ability of these agencies to deliver \n     much-needed care to medicare beneficiaries, particularly to \n     those beneficiaries that are chronically ill and have complex \n     care needs.\n       (6) Over 2,500 agencies (about \\1/4\\ of all home health \n     agencies nationwide) have either closed or stopped serving \n     medicare beneficiaries.\n       (7) According to a study by the Lewin Group conducted for \n     the American Hospital Association, the spending cutbacks \n     resulting from the enactment of the BBA have resulted in a \n     30.5 percent reduction in hospital-based home health \n     services.\n       (8) An additional 15 percent reduction in payments to home \n     health agencies under the medicare program is scheduled to go \n     into effect on October 1, 2001.\n       (9) Implementation of an additional 15 percent reduction--\n       (A) would ring the death knell for low-cost, efficient home \n     health agencies currently struggling to remain in business, \n     thus reducing the access of medicare beneficiaries to \n     critical home health services; and\n       (B) is unnecessary because we have already surpassed the \n     savings targets set forth under the BBA.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget assume that--\n       (1) the 15 percent reduction in payments to home health \n     agencies under the medicare program under title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act should not go into effect, as scheduled, \n     on October 1, 2001; and\n       (2) Congress and the President should work to provide \n     sustainable payments to home health agencies under such \n     program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                COLLINS (AND SCHUMER) AMENDMENT NO. 2992\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Schumer) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

USE OF THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) as Congress found in section 151(a) of the Energy \n     Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6231(a)), the storage \n     of substantial quantities of petroleum products will diminish \n     the vulnerability of the United States to the effects of a \n     severe energy supply interruption and provide limited \n     protection from the short-term consequences of interruptions \n     in supplies of petroleum products;\n       (2) the Secretary of Energy has authority under existing \n     law to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through time \n     exchanges (``swaps'') by releasing oil from the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve in times of supply shortage in exchange for \n     the infusion of more oil\n\n[[Page S2363]]\n\n     into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at a later date;\n       (3) the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     (``OPEC'') has created a worldwide supply shortage by choking \n     off petroleum production by anticompetitive means; and\n       (4) at its meetings beginning on March 27, 2000, OPEC \n     failed to increase petroleum production to a level sufficient \n     to rebuild depleted inventories.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate Concerning Use of the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve.--It is the sense of the Senate that the \n     levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) if the President determines that the supply of crude \n     oil has been significantly diminished due to anticompetitive \n     manipulation by foreign countries and a release of oil from \n     the Strategic Petroleum Reserve under swapping arrangements \n     would not jeopardize national security, the Secretary of \n     Energy should, as soon as is practicable, use the authority \n     under existing law to release oil from the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve in an economically feasible way by means of \n     swapping arrangements providing for future increases in \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve reserves;\n       (2) the Secretary of Energy should implement swapping \n     arrangements at times when prices of fuel increase because of \n     significant reductions in the production of crude oil and \n     market conditions are favorable for swaps; and\n       (3) the President should immediately commission an \n     interagency panel--\n       (A) to develop market data to increase the transparency of \n     petroleum markets; and\n       (B) to determine--\n       (i) what quantities should be held in the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve;\n       (ii) the appropriate uses of the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve; and\n       (iii) whether the authority to release oil from the \n     Strategic Petroleum Reserve should be modified to better \n     address oil crisis like the one the U.S. faced during the \n     winter of 1999 and 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   SPECTER AMENDMENTS NOS. 2993-2994\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SPECTER submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE ENFORCEMENT OF \n                   TRADE AGREEMENTS MADE BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC \n                   OF CHINA\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the budget resolution assumes enforcement of United \n     States trade and tariff laws, and the successful negotiation \n     of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements between the \n     United States and other governments;\n       (2) Congress may soon consider legislation that grants \n     permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status for China in \n     light of the fact that China is seeking accession to the \n     World Trade Organization (WTO);\n       (3) individual Senators may have differing views on the \n     specific concessions made in the bilateral U.S.-China \n     agreement, but it is agreed that the United States must have \n     adequate means to enforce the agreement;\n       (4) farmers, ranchers, workers, and businesses in the \n     United States should receive the benefits promised to them in \n     U.S. trade agreements;\n       (5) there is substantial dissatisfaction across America's \n     heartland with the United States' inability to enforce some \n     trade commitments on agriculture--specifically, the European \n     Union has a long history of trying to block bananas, U.S. \n     beef, and other farm products;\n       (6) China has a history of not readily complying with past \n     trade agreements; and,\n       (7) the U.S. Congress (which must make the ultimate \n     decision about U.S.-China trade relations) needs to \n     demonstrate to the American people that trade agreements are \n     enforceable, not only in agriculture, but also in \n     manufactured goods, services, intellectual property, wood \n     products, textiles and other sectors.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress will take into account the concerns of those \n     in the agricultural community and other industry sectors as \n     it proceeds with consideration of permanent normal trade \n     relations (PNTR) status for China;\n       (2) the President will demonstrate that the United States \n     retains sufficient leverage to enforce the WTO commitments \n     made by China in November 1999; and,\n       (3) the President will devote adequate resources to \n     monitoring and enforcing Chinese compliance with the \n     agreements made in connection with China's accession to the \n     WTO.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      BINGAMAN AMENDMENT NO. 2996\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE REPEAL OF THE \n                   MODIFICATION OF INSTALLMENT METHOD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on December 17, 1999, President Clinton signed into law \n     the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of \n     1999, which contained a provision that prohibits accrual \n     method taxpayers from using the installment method when they \n     sell an asset;\n       (2) the new law is having, and will continue to have, a \n     dramatic negative impact on small business owners; and\n       (3) According to the National Federation of Independent \n     Businesses, roughly 260,000 businesses a year are likely to \n     be affected.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution and legislation enacted \n     pursuant to this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Senate should consider modifying or repealing \n     section 536(a) of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives \n     Improvement Act of 1999 (relating to the repeal of the \n     installment method for accrual method taxpayers) to ensure \n     that the provision does not deny the ability of small \n     businesses to use the installment method with respect to \n     sales and other dispositions occurring on or after the date \n     of enactment of such Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              TORRICELLI (AND ASHCROFT) AMENDMENT NO. 3000\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Ashcroft) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON AID FOR INDEPENDENT TRUCK \n                   DRIVERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The price of diesel fuel in the United States is \n     exorbitantly high, topping $2 per gallon in February, 2000;\n       (2) there are more than 250,000 independent truck drivers \n     operating in the United States;\n       (3) independent truck drivers averaged less than $250 to \n     fill their fuel tanks a year ago, but are paying an average \n     of over $500 now;\n       (4) high diesel fuel prices are extremely harmful to \n     independent truck drivers, who pay for their own fuel;\n       (5) many independent truck drivers are forced to dip into \n     family savings to pay for fuel, and some are being forced out \n     of business, because they can't fill their tanks;\n       (6) the United States is reliant upon these independent \n     truck drivers to deliver goods to the marketplace.\n       (7) independent truckers who are forced to park their rigs \n     are unable to deliver goods to marketplace;\n       (8) high prices are forcing independent truck drivers off \n     the road, and have the potential to harm our economy, not to \n     mention, cripple the trucking industry, which is responsible \n     for the transportation of commodities across the country;\n       (9) despite OPEC's recent announcement that it would raise \n     oil production by 1.7 million barrels per day, which may \n     stabilize prices by the end of the year, independent truck \n     drivers have felt the effects of high diesel fuel prices for \n     months, and stabilizing prices will not allow them to recover \n     lost income;\n       (10) providing direct cash grants to independent truck \n     drivers will prevent further damage to the trucking industry, \n     and ensure the continued transportation of goods to the \n     marketplace.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that significant \n     funds will be made available to the Small Business \n     Administration (SBA) in order to enable the SBA to meet the \n     needs of independent truck drivers through emergency loans \n     and grant programs.\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $52,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $63,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $74,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $35,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $52,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $63,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $74,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $35,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $250,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $52,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $63,000,000.\n\n[[Page S2365]]\n\n       On page 5, line 9, increase the amount by $74,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $35,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11 increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 6, increase the amount by $250,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 7, increase the amount by $52,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 11, increase the amount by $63,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 15, increase the amount by $74,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 19, increase the amount by $35,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 23, increase the amount by $18,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 3, decrease the amount by $52,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 4, decrease the amount by $242,000,000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 MURRAY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3002\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nConrad, Mr. Burns, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Schumer) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, \nS. Con. Res. 101, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       The Senate finds that the number of trucks and planes \n     bringing commercial goods across the Northern Border has \n     increased by 25% between 1998 and 1999. No new Custom \n     Inspector positions have been authorized for the Northern \n     Border since 1996 and only 26 percent of Immigration \n     Inspectors are on the Northern Border;\n       The Senate finds that our Northern Border (excluding \n     Alaska) extends almost 4,000 miles. But last year, this \n     border only had about 300 agents--about one agent for every \n     thirteen miles of border. In comparison, the Southwest Border \n     is 2,000 miles and had 8,000 agents--four agents for every \n     mile;\n       The Senate finds that many ports on the Northern Border can \n     barely cover core operations and regular shifts without \n     resorting to significant amounts of overtime for all \n     inspectors. Many additional enforcement efforts aimed at \n     specific anti-drug initiatives and outbound programs have \n     been abandoned;\n       The Senate finds that border agents in Washington state \n     apprehended a potentially dangerous terrorist entering the \n     country from Canada this past December with bomb making \n     equipment and explosive materials that could have caused \n     enormous devastation;\n       The Senate finds that this incident led to a heightened \n     state of alert on the Northern Border throughout the 1999/\n     2000 holiday season requiring the redeployment of over 700 \n     inspectors from other areas of the country; and\n       The Senate finds that the lack of adequate frontline \n     Customs Inspectors and Immigration and Naturalization \n     personnel at our ports of entry greatly increases the risk of \n     terrorist products, illicit drugs and other dangerous \n     contraband coming into our country and hinders legitimate \n     trade.\n       1. It is the sense of the Senate that the functional totals \n     in this resolution assume that the Senate should provide \n     additional funding to increase U.S. Customs Service and U.S. \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service personnel at the \n     Northern Border.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                STEVENS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3003\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Lautenberg, \nMr. Bond, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Dodd, Mr. L.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FREEDOM OF HEALTH CARE \n                   CHOICE FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Beneficiaries under the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act do not have the same right \n     to obtain health care from the provider of their choice as do \n     Members of Congress and virtually all other Americans.\n       (2) As a result of the 2-year opt-out provision of the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997, medicare beneficiaries must \n     decide between the right to choose their own doctor and the \n     right to protect their medical records.\n       (3) Legislation protecting health care choice is timely for \n     the following 2 reasons:\n       (A) In the Health Care Financing Administration's January \n     1998 ``Carriers Program Memorandum'', the agency carves out a \n     circumstance under which a physician or practitioner who has \n     not opted-out of medicare for 2 years may not file a claim \n     where ``the beneficiary, for reasons of his or her own, \n     declines to authorize the physician or practitioner to submit \n     a claim or to furnish confidential medical information to the \n     medicare program that is needed to submit a proper claim.''.\n       (B) In the July 20, 1999, testimony on its current medicare \n     report to Congress, the Comptroller General of the United \n     States, David Walker, concluded that the Health Care \n     Financing Administration lacks the ability to properly guard \n     medicare beneficiaries' medical records, ``continues to have \n     vulnerabilities in its information management systems'', and \n     ``lacks the ability to readily provide beneficiaries with an \n     accounting of disclosures or misuse in violation of the \n     Privacy Act of 1974.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget assume that Congress and \n     the President should enact legislation that--\n       (1) codifies the Health Care Financing Administration's \n     directive to provide beneficiaries under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act permanent and \n     unambiguous choice of their treatments, doctors, and \n     reimbursement arrangements;\n       (2) goes beyond the Health Care Financing Administration's \n     directive by specifying that, in order to prevent abuses, \n     such an arrangement can only be entered into ``if the \n     beneficiary and the physician or practitioner enter into a \n     written contract that includes a statement of the \n     beneficiary's desire to withhold such authorization.'';\n       (3) provides this protection for medicare beneficiaries \n     now, whether or not the Health Care Financing Administration \n     is able to implement the recommendations of the General \n     Accounting Office, and also whether or not Congress enacts \n     comprehensive medical records reform legislation;\n       (4) provides that medicare beneficiaries have the right to \n     see the physician or health care provider of their choice, \n     and not be limited in such right by the imposition of \n     unreasonable conditions on providers who are willing to \n     provide medicare beneficiaries with this choice; and\n       (5) ensures medicare beneficiaries the right of health care \n     choice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  KYL (AND KERREY) AMENDMENT NO. 3008\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. KYL (for himself and Mr. Kerrey) submitted an amendment intended \nto be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ESTATE TAXES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Internal Revenue Code allows a taxpayer to defer \n     the recognition of capital gains earned from the involuntary \n     conversion of property relating to theft, destruction, \n     seizure, requisition, or condemnation, so that no tax is \n     imposed until the property is sold;\n       (2) gains earned on property that is transferred by virtue \n     of the owner's death are not eligible for such deferral as \n     allowed for property that is involuntarily converted, and the \n     entire value of the property is subject instead to an estate \n     tax rate as high as 55 percent; and\n       (3) in order to prepare for and pay the estate tax, \n     numerous small businesses must liquidate all or part of their \n     assets, while others are drained of the capital they need to \n     invest in the research and development, new equipment, and \n     new workers that would otherwise keep them competitive in the \n     marketplace.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress should pass legislation providing estate tax \n     relief, and should consider replacing the Federal estate tax \n     with a tax on the gain attributable to inherited assets due \n     when those assets are sold;\n       (2) that the tax basis in such property used to determine \n     tax liability should be the decedent's basis; and\n       (3) that a limited step-up in basis should be preserved for \n     small estates so that they are not subject to a new tax \n     burden as a result of these changes.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                STEVENS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3009\n\n  Mr. STEVENS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Cochran) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

(a) The Senate finds that on March 2, 2000, the \n     Senate passed S. 1134, by a vote of 61-37, the Affordable \n     Education Act of 2000, which--\n       (a) authorizes up to 2.5 billion dollars a year in new bond \n     authority to allow public-private partnerships to build new \n     schools;\n\n[[Page S2367]]\n\n       (2) allows small school districts to build more schools by \n     providing them greater flexibility in dealing with complex \n     IRS regulations;\n       (3) allows 14,000,000 families or 20,000,000 children to \n     benefit from Education Savings Accounts, which would generate \n     $12,000,000,000 in new resources for kindergarten through \n     college education;\n       (4) allows 1,000,000 college students in State pre-paid \n     tuition plans to receive tax relief to make college more \n     affordable;\n       (5) allows 1,000,000 workers studying part-time to receive \n     education assistance through their employers;\n       (6) guarantees that every college student and recent \n     college graduate in America will receive a tax break on the \n     interest on their student loans;\n       (7) gives all of our Nation's elementary and secondary \n     school teachers needed tax relief for their professional \n     development expenses;\n       (8) gives America's teachers needed tax relief by providing \n     them a deduction for their out-of-pocket classroom expenses;\n       (9) allows America's classrooms to benefit from new \n     technology by encouraging the charitable donation of \n     computers to the classroom;\n       (b) Therefore, it is the Sense of the Senate that this \n     budget resolution assumes that Congress should pass, and the \n     President should sign significant education tax relief \n     legislation for America's teachers and students.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                GORTON (AND JEFFORDS) AMENDMENT NO. 3011\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GORTON (for himself and Mr. Jeffords) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE PRICE OF \n                   PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today, two-thirds of senior citizens in the United \n     States have access to prescription drugs through health \n     insurance coverage.\n       (2) However, it is difficult for many Americans, including \n     senior citizens, to afford the prescription drugs that they \n     need to stay healthy.\n       (3) Many senior citizens in the United States leave the \n     country and go to Canada or Mexico to buy prescription drugs \n     that are developed, manufactured, and approved in the United \n     States in order to buy such drugs at lower prices than such \n     drugs are sold for in the United States.\n       (4) According to the General Accounting Office, a consumer \n     in the United States pays on average \\1/3\\ more for a \n     prescription drug than a consumer pays for the same drug in \n     another country.\n       (5) The United States has made a strong commitment to \n     supporting the research and development of new drugs through \n     taxpayer-supported funding of the National Institutes of \n     Health, through the research and development tax credit, and \n     through other means.\n       (6) The development of new drugs is important because the \n     use of such drugs enables people to live longer and lead \n     healthier, more productive lives.\n       (7) Citizens of other countries should pay a portion of the \n     research and development costs for new drugs, or their fair \n     share of such costs, rather than just reap the benefits of \n     such drugs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that the \n     cost disparity between identical prescription drugs sold in \n     the United States, Canada, and Mexico should be reduced or \n     eliminated.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                SANTORUM (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3012\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Allard, and Mr. Craig) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, \nS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR THE \n                   INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1975, the Federal Government made a commitment in \n     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. \n     1411 et seq.) (referred to in this resolution as the ``Act'') \n     to pay 40 percent of the programs described in part B of such \n     Act.\n       (2) The Act guarantees that all children with disabilities \n     receive a free and appropriate public education.\n       (3) In 1997, 1998, and 1999, Congress increased funding for \n     such programs by 113 percent, but was unable to affect such \n     increases without the help or support of the Administration.\n       (4) Despite such increases in funding, Federal funding for \n     such programs is still far short of the nearly \n     $15,000,000,000 required to receive the originally promised \n     funding.\n       (5) The Federal Government currently pays only 12.6 percent \n     of such funding for the programs, which represents a great \n     disparity from the 40 percent that was originally promised \n     under the Act.\n       (6) Honoring the obligation to fund such programs at the \n     originally promised level will allow State and local \n     governments, some of which spend up to 19 percent of the \n     State or local budget on special education costs, to have \n     more flexibility to spend the local resources to meet the \n     unique educational needs of all students in the locality.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in\n\n[[Page S2368]]\n\n     this resolution assume that Congress; first priority should \n     be to fully fund the programs described under part B of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 \n     et seq.) at the originally promised level of 40% before \n     Federal funds are appropriated for new education programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       CONRAD AMENDMENT NO. 3016\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. CONRAD submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING UNINSURED AND LOW-\n                   INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED \n                   COMMUNITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the uninsured population in the United States continues \n     to grow at over 100,000 individuals per month, and is \n     estimated to reach over 53,000,000 people by 2007;\n       (2) the growth in the uninsured population continues \n     despite public and private efforts to increase health \n     insurance coverage;\n       (3) nearly 80 percent of the uninsured population are \n     members of working families who cannot afford health \n     insurance or cannot access employer-provided health insurance \n     plans;\n       (4) minority populations, rural residents, and single-\n     parent families represent a disproportionate number of the \n     uninsured population;\n       (5) the problem of health care access for the uninsured \n     population is compounded in many urban and rural communities \n     by a lack of providers who are available to serve both \n     insured and uninsured populations;\n       (6) community, migrant, homeless, and public housing health \n     centers have proven uniquely qualified to address the lack of \n     adequate health care services for uninsured populations, \n     serving over 4,500,000 uninsured patients in 1999, including \n     over 1,000,000 new uninsured patients who have sought care \n     from such centers in the last 3 years;\n       (7) health centers care for nearly 7,000,000 minorities, \n     nearly 600,000 farmworkers, and more than 500,000 homeless \n     individuals each year;\n       (8) health centers provide cost-effective comprehensive \n     primary and preventive care to uninsured individuals for less \n     than $1.00 per day, or $350 annually, and help to reduce the \n     inappropriate use of costly emergency rooms and inpatient \n     hospital care;\n       (9) current resources only allow health centers to serve 10 \n     percent of the Nation's 44,000,000 uninsured individuals;\n       (10) past investments to increase health center access have \n     resulted in better health, an improved quality of life for \n     all Americans, and a reduction in national health care \n     expenditures; and\n       (11) Congress can act now to increase access to health care \n     services for uninsured and low-income people together with or \n     in advance of health care coverage proposals by expanding the \n     availability of services at community, migrant, homeless, and \n     public housing health centers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution on the \n     budget assume that--\n       (1) appropriations for consolidated health centers under \n     section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b) \n     should be increased by 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal \n     years in order to double the number of individuals who \n     receive health care services at community, migrant, homeless, \n     and public housing health centers; and\n       (2) appropriations for consolidated health centers should \n     be increased by $150,000,000 in fiscal year 2001 over the \n     amount appropriated for such centers in fiscal year 2000.\n\n[[Page S2369]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 GREGG (AND KERREY) AMENDMENT NO. 3019\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GREGG (for himself and Mr. Kerrey) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S. Con. \nRes. 101, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PUBLIC EDUCATION ON THE \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Today and in the future, Social Security is the \n     foundation of retirement income for most Americans. \n     Preserving and protecting Social Security for the long-term \n     is a vital national priority and essential for the retirement \n     security of today's working Americans, current and future \n     retirees, and their families.\n       (2) Under current assumptions, Social Security would enter \n     into cash-flow deficits in 2015. Under those same \n     assumptions, the Social Security Trust Funds have sufficient \n     financing to pay full current-law benefits through 2037. \n     According to separate analyses by the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), \n     the existence of positive balances in the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund in periods of program cash deficits \n     would in and of itself have no direct effect upon the Federal \n     Government's ability to pay benefits, with the result that \n     levels of either benefits, tax revenues, or Federal borrowing \n     would need to be changed in order to finance benefit \n     payments, carrying important consequences for beneficiaries \n     and wage-earners alike.\n       (3) There appears to be a lack of confidence about the \n     future of Social Security among the general public. Congress \n     and the Social Security Administration should work together \n     to restore confidence in the Social Security system. For \n     example, although Americans of all ages indicate in polls \n     that they strongly support Social Security, many younger \n     Americans believe that they will receive either no benefits \n     or sharply reduced benefits at retirement, although Social \n     Security would have sufficient annual revenues to pay on \n     average (under current assumptions) 72 percent of benefits \n     even after reserves of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund are exhausted in 2037.\n       (4) Proper understanding both of how Social Security is \n     financed and the challenges facing the Social Security \n     program, as well as the impact of Social Security on the \n     Federal Budget and on the economy, is essential to proper \n     evaluation by the American people and Congress of the options \n     to achieve long-term program sustainability.\n       (5) Many statistics currently used to explain Social \n     Security finances are highly technical and not accessible to \n     the average American, such as actuarial balance as a percent \n     of payroll. Simpler measures could provide a clearer picture \n     of Social Security's future finances and of the options for \n     improving those finances.\n       (6) As the Nation enters the 21st Century, the United \n     States is experiencing unprecedented changes in business, \n     employment, and the economy; in demographics and in science. \n     Such changes should be considered in understanding the issues \n     facing Social Security.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution on the budget assume the \n     following:\n       (1) Public education.--Education of the general public \n     regarding Social Security needs to be improved. Toward that \n     end, the Social Security Administration should examine all \n     material that is distributed in print or online for public \n     review, including the Summary of the Annual Report of the \n     Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund and social security account statements, to ensure \n     that Americans can clearly understand how Social Security \n     works and the challenges facing Social Security.\n       (2) Economic and budget estimates.--Public and \n     congressional understanding of the relationship between \n     Social Security, the economic well-being of seniors, the \n     Federal Budget, and the economy is essential to protecting \n     and preserving Social Security for the long term. Toward that \n     end, the Senate commends the Congressional Budget Office \n     (CBO) for its investment in providing long-term estimates, \n     and expresses the desire for periodic reports from the CBO \n     regarding Social Security payments and revenues, including \n     implicit general revenue commitments, the economic well-being \n     of seniors, national savings, and other important economic \n     outcomes.\n       (3) Improvements to the reports of the board of trustees.--\n     The Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance \n     Trust Fund should carefully continue to consider recent \n     recommendations by the 1999 Technical Panel on Assumptions \n     and Methods of the Social Security Advisory Board and \n     recommendations of other such groups regarding additional \n     information that should be presented to the public.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                DOMENICI (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3020\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Cleland, and Mr. Dodd) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, \nS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the tragic acts of school violence in Arkansas, \n     Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Michigan, and other areas across \n     the Nation have prompted a national dialogue on how best to \n     ensure the safety and security of our Nation's children;\n       (2) an increasing number of parents, teachers, and \n     community and business leaders across the Nation believe that \n     schools must reinforce efforts to foster good character in \n     children;\n       (3) 23 States have enacted character education legislation \n     and others are considering such legislation;\n       (4) strengthening students' sense of community in school \n     has lasting effects on students' overall development, \n     including improving conduct in school and reducing violent \n     behavior outside of school;\n       (5) the more character education is inculcated in the \n     teaching of academics, the more teachers and other adults in \n     a school apply core values like caring, citizenship, \n     fairness, respect, responsibility, and trustworthiness to \n     their relationships among themselves and with their students; \n     and\n       (6) providing children the opportunity to reflect and act \n     on core values increases their awareness of the impact of \n     their actions, with positive results reported in many schools \n     that offer character education, such as antisocial behavior \n     being reduced, attendance improving, attentiveness in class \n     going up, substance abuse declining, schools becoming safer \n     places, and even academics improving.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that Congress \n     should--\n       (1) allocate sufficient resources for character educations \n     programs in schools; and\n       (2) take all other appropriate steps to encourage and \n     support character education, including continued support of \n     National Character Counts Week.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                GRASSLEY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3021\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Abraham, Mr. DeWine, and \nMr. Coverdell) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them \nto the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COUNTER-NARCOTICS FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The drug crisis facing the United States is a top \n     national security threat.\n       (2) The spread of illicit drugs through United States \n     borders cannot be halted without an effective drug \n     interdiction strategy.\n       (3) Effective drug interdiction efforts have been shown to \n     limit the availability of illicit narcotics, drive up the \n     street price, support demand reduction efforts, and decrease \n     overall drug trafficking and use.\n       (4) The armed conflict and resulting lawlessness in \n     Colombia present a clear and present danger to the security \n     of the front line states, to law enforcement efforts intended \n     to impede the flow of cocaine and heroin, and, therefore, to \n     the well-being of the people of the United States.\n       (5) The conflict in Colombia is creating instability along \n     its borders with neighboring countries, Ecuador, Panama, \n     Peru, and Venezuela, several of which have deployed forces to \n     their border with Colombia.\n       (6) Coca production has increased 28 percent in Colombia \n     since 1998, and already 75 percent of the world's cocaine and \n     75 percent of the heroin seized in the northeast United \n     States is of Colombian origin.\n       (7) The percentage change in drug use since 1992, among \n     graduating high school students who used drugs in the past 12 \n     months, has substantially increased--marijuana use is up 80 \n     percent, cocaine use is up 80 percent, and heroin use is up \n     100 percent.\n       (8) The U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. coast Guard are \n     critical front line agencies in stopping the flow of illegal \n     drugs into the United States.\n       (9) The Department of Defense is a lead agency for the \n     detection and monitoring of aerial and maritime transit of \n     illegal drug into the United States.\n       (10) The Department of State, through INL, is a lead agency \n     in protecting the United States from the foreign drug and \n     crime threat.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate, \n     the functional totals included in this resolution assume the \n     following:\n       (1) All counter-narcotics agencies will be given the \n     highest priority for fully funding their counter-narcotics \n     mission.\n       (2) That front line drug fighting agencies are dedicating \n     more resources for international efforts to continue \n     restoring a balanced drug control strategy.\n       (3) Congress should re-authorize the modernization of the \n     U.S. Customs service and ensure it has adequate resources and \n     authority not only to facilitate the movement of\n\n[[Page S2370]]\n\n     internationally traded goods but to ensure it can \n     aggressively pursue its law enforcement activities to stop \n     the flow of drugs into the United States.\n       (4) Congress should adequately fund U.S. Coast Guard and \n     ensure that it has adequate resources to aggressively pursue \n     its maritime law enforcement activities.\n       (5) By pursuing a balanced effort which requires investment \n     in three key areas: demand reduction (such as education and \n     treatment); domestic law enforcement; and international \n     supply reduction. Congress believes we can reduce the number \n     of children who are exposed to and addicted to illegal drugs.\n       (6) Congress should adequately fund the Department of \n     Defense to ensure it has sufficient personnel, equipment, and \n     facilities to support drug interdiction efforts and other \n     counter-drug activities.\n       (7) Congress should adequately fund the Department of State \n     to ensure that INL has the resources necessary to \n     aggressively and effectively pursue protection of U.S. \n     borders.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 HATCH (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3022\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Helms) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, \nS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING COMBATING DRUG \n                   TRAFFICKING OVER THE INTERNET.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Millions of Americans use the Internet daily for \n     educational and informational purposes. It contains a vast \n     universe of products and services and offers legitimate \n     business owners and consumers a private venue to conduct \n     transactions.\n       (2) The Internet is also being utilized by criminals and \n     drug dealers to conduct illegal sales in violation of federal \n     drug laws.\n       (3) 21 U.S.C. 863 makes it a crime to sell or offer for \n     sale drug paraphernalia. Yet, on the Internet, anyone can \n     purchase illegal drug paraphernalia from one of the numerous \n     pro-drug sites. Web sites also advertise for sale marijuana \n     and poppy seeds in violation of federal law.\n       (4) The Drug Enforcement Administration is the lead federal \n     agency charged with investigating domestic drug trafficking. \n     In order to combat and prevent drug dealers from using the \n     Internet to conduct their illegal operations, it is \n     imperative that Congress provide sufficient funding to the \n     Drug Enforcement Administration for investigating these \n     illegal activities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in the resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Drug Enforcement Administration requires a program \n     enhancement of $5 million in FY 2001 to combat, prevent, and \n     deter the illegal use of electronic communications, including \n     the Internet, to violate federal drug laws; and\n       (2) the Drug Enforcement Administration will study the \n     extent to which these violations are occurring and report the \n     findings of such study to the Committees on the Judiciary of \n     the Senate and House of Representatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 HATCH (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3023\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Helms, Mr. \nInhofe, Mr. Frist, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Thomas) \nsubmitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to the \nconcurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. 101, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PROVIDING ADEQUATE \n                   FUNDING FOR METHAMPHETAMINE LABORATORY CLEANUP.\n\n       (a) Findings:--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The number of methamphetamine laboratory seizures the \n     Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) participates in \n     annually has increased drastically since 1994. In 1994, the \n     DEA participated in the seizures of only 306 clandestine \n     laboratories, 86% of which were methamphetamine laboratories. \n     Last year, a total of 6,325 methamphetamine and amphetamine \n     laboratories were seized in the United States, and the DEA \n     participated in 1,948 of those seizures. The DEA and State \n     and local law enforcement agencies spend millions of dollars \n     every year cleaning up the pollutants and toxins created and \n     left behind by operators of these laboratories.\n       Methamphetamine manufacturing poses serious dangers to \n     human life and the environment. The chemicals and substances \n     used in the methamphetamine manufacturing process are \n     unstable, volatile, and highly combustible. The smallest \n     amounts of these chemicals, when mixed improperly, can cause \n     explosions and fires, and the fact that most of these \n     laboratories are situated in residences, motels, trailers, \n     and vans makes the problem even more dangerous. Additionally, \n     for every one pound of methamphetamine that is produced, over \n     five pounds of toxic waste is produced and left behind.\n       (3) The DEA has been assisting State and local law \n     enforcement agencies in cleaning up methamphetamine \n     laboratory sites. State and local agencies lack the financial \n     ability, equipment, and training to cleanup these toxic \n     sites, and thus, they rely predominantly, if not entirely, on \n     the DEA to cleanup methamphetamine laboratories.\n       (4) By March 2000, the DEA has exhausted the funds set \n     aside in its FY 2000 budget for State and local \n     methamphetamine laboratory cleanup. The DEA projects that \n     methamphetamine laboratory seizures will continue to rise in \n     FY 2001.\n       (5) It is imperative that Congress provide sufficient \n     funding to the DEA for methamphetamine laboratory cleanup.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in the resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Drug Enforcement Administration requires a program \n     enhancement of $21 million in FY 2001 to assist State and \n     local law enforcement agencies in cleaning up toxic waste \n     sites created by illegal operators of methamphetamine \n     laboratories; and\n       (2) the funding for methamphetamine laboratories cleanup \n     should supplement and not supplant funding for other law \n     enforcement activities of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               COVERDELL (AND LINCOLN) AMENDMENT NO. 3024\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. COVERDELL (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING AGING FLOOD CONTROL \n                   STRUCTURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) since 1948, communities and the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Service of the Department of Agriculture have \n     constructed over 10,400 flood control structures in 47 \n     States, at an estimated infrastructure investment of \n     $14,000,000,000;\n       (2) many of those structures are now reaching the end of \n     their design life; and\n       (3) unless those aging structures are rehabilitated, the \n     structures may--\n       (A) pose significant threats to human health, public \n     safety, property, and the environment; and\n       (B) pose risks of potential hardship to the communities in \n     the vicinities of the structures, including through potential \n     loss of flood control, community water supplies, ability to \n     conserve natural resources, and economic benefits, that were \n     brought about as a result of those flood control structures.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution, assume that the Federal \n     Government will offer technical assistance and cost-shared \n     financial assistance to communities to ensure that the flood \n     control structures constructed by the communities and the \n     Natural Resources Conservation Service of the Department of \n     Agriculture are rehabilitated and continue to serve the \n     protective purposes for which they were constructed.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 SMITH (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3025\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \nCraig, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Bingaman) submitted an amendment intended to \nbe proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL \n                   FIREARMS LAWS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Clinton Administration has failed to adequately \n     enforce Federal firearms laws. Between 1992 and 1998, \n     Triggerlock gun prosecutions--prosecutions of defendants who \n     use a firearm in the commission of a felony--dropped nearly \n     50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800.\n       (2) The decline in Federal firearms prosecutions was not \n     due to a lack of adequate resources. During the period when \n     Federal firearms prosecutions decreased nearly 50 percent, \n     the overall budget of the Department of Justice increased 54 \n     percent.\n       (3) It is a Federal crime to possess a firearm on school \n     grounds under section 922(q) of title 18, United States Code. \n     The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 8 cases \n     under this provision of law during 1998, even though more \n     than 6,000 students brought firearms to school that year. The \n     Clinton Administration prosecuted only 5 such cases during \n     1997.\n       (4) It is a Federal crime to transfer a firearm to a \n     juvenile under section 922(x) of title 18, United States \n     Code. The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 6 \n     cases under this provision of law during 1998 and only 5 \n     during 1997.\n       (5) It is a Federal crime to transfer or possess a \n     semiautomatic assault weapon under section 922(v) of title \n     18, United States Code. The Clinton Department of Justice \n     prosecuted only 4 cases under this provision of law during \n     1998 and only 4 during 1997.\n       (6) It is a Federal crime for any person ``who has been \n     adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed \n     to a mental institution'' to possess or purchase a firearm \n     under section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code. Despite \n     this Federal law, mental health adjudications are not placed \n     on the national instant criminal background system \n     established under section 103(b) of the Brady Handgun \n     Violence Prevention Act (18 U.S.C. 922 note).\n       (7) It is a Federal crime for any person knowingly to make \n     any false statement in the attempted purchase of a firearm \n     under section 922(a)(6) of title 18, United States Code. It \n     is also a Federal crime for convicted felons to possess or \n     purchase a firearm under section 922(g) of title 18, United \n     States Code.\n       (8) More than 500,000 convicted felons and other prohibited \n     purchasers have been prevented from buying firearms from \n     licensed dealers since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention \n     Act was enacted. When these felons attempted to purchase a \n     firearm, they violated section 922(a)(6) of title 18, United \n     States Code, by making a false statement under oath that they \n     were not disqualified from purchasing a firearm.

PROTECTION OF MEDICARE SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the fiscal year 2001 budget submitted by the President, \n     instead of protecting Medicare, reduces payments to Medicare \n     providers by $53 billion over 10 years;\n       (2) the fiscal year 2001 budget submitted by the President \n     calls for an increase in spending for fiscal year 2001 of $58 \n     billion and would increase taxes collected next year by $12 \n     billion;\n       (3) the fiscal year 2001 budget submitted by the President \n     continues to use the Medicare, Part A surplus to mask the \n     President's proposed increases in spending; and\n       (4) in contrast to the President's budget, this budget \n     resolution protects Medicare, rejects the President's \n     Medicare cuts and provides $40 billion for prescription drug \n     coverage for needy seniors.\n       (b) Medicare Surpluses Off-budget.--The net surplus of any \n     trust fund for part A of Medicare shall not be counted as a \n     net surplus for purposes of the congressional budget.\n       (c) Points of Order to Protect Medicare Surpluses.--\n       (1) Concurrent resolutions on the budget.--It shall not be \n     in order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to \n     consider any concurrent resolution on the budget, or \n     conference report thereon or amendment thereto, that would \n     set forth an on-budget deficit for any fiscal year.\n       (2) Subsequent legislation.--It shall not be in order in \n     the House of Representatives\n\n[[Page S2372]]\n\n     or the Senate to consider any bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report if--\n       (A) the enactment of that bill or resolution as reported;\n       (B) the adoption and enactment of that amendment; or\n       (C) the enactment of that bill or resolution in the form \n     recommended in that conference report; would cause or \n     increase an on-budget deficit for any fiscal year.\n       (3) Defintiion.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``on-budget deficit'', when applied to a fiscal year, means \n     the deficit in the budget as set forth in the most recently \n     agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget pursuant to \n     section 301(a)(3) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for \n     that fiscal year.\n       (d) Medicare Look-back Sequester.--If in any fiscal year, \n     the Medicare, Part A surplus has been used to finance general \n     operations of the Federal government, an amount equal to the \n     amount used shall be sequestered for available discretionary \n     spending for the following fiscal year for purposes of any \n     concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (e) Super Majority Requirement.--This section may be waived \n     or suspended in the Senate only by the affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LONG-TERM CARE TAX \n                   RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In 2020, one of six Americans will be age 65 or older, \n     for a total of 20,000,000 more senior citizens than there are \n     now.\n       (2) By 2040, the number of Americans aged 85 and older, the \n     group most likely to require long-term care, will more than \n     triple to over 12,000,000.\n       (3) The Nation's current arrangements for providing and \n     paying for long-term care to the Nation's senior citizens are \n     inadequate in the face of the looming burdens that will be \n     placed upon such arrangements by the inevitable growth in the \n     population of senior citizens.\n       (4) Millions of older Americans who need long-term care are \n     able to maintain a degree of independence and avoid \n     institutionalization by relying on family caregivers, \n     typically wives and daughters, for assistance. Caregivers \n     often sacrifice their own wages, benefits, or even jobs in \n     order to provide care to loved ones.\n       (5) Even modest financial assistance would help offset \n     long-term care costs and augment access to additional long-\n     term care services.\n       (6) If an older individual requires long-term care in a \n     nursing facility, the cost of that care, an average of more \n     than $46,000 a year and rising, is out of the reach of most \n     households. Such expenses can wipe out a lifetime of savings \n     before a spouse, parent, or grandparent becomes eligible for \n     long-term care assistance through medicaid.\n       (7) Stronger tax incentives for the purchase of private \n     long-term care insurance coverage, coupled with strong \n     consumer protection standards, would help individuals and \n     families protect themselves against the financial risk of \n     long-term care and give consumers much better long-term care \n     choices.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that Congress \n     should enact Federal tax relief for those with current long-\n     term care needs and for those seeking to protect themselves \n     with comprehensive private long-term care insurance coverage, \n     including--\n       (1) a $3,000 long-term care Federal income tax credit for \n     individuals with current long-term care needs or for their \n     caregivers; and\n       (2) the allowance of full Federal income tax deductibility \n     for long-term care insurance premiums and the allowance of \n     long-term care coverage under employee benefits ``cafeteria \n     plans'' and flexible spending arrangements in order to \n     encourage the purchase of private long-term care insurance \n     issued under strong consumer protection standards.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                GRASSLEY (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3035\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. \nRockfeller) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to \nthe concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ACCOUNTABILITY WITHIN \n                   OUR NATION'S CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, more than 547,000 children currently reside in \n     foster care, up from 270,000 in 1985.\n       (2) Approximately 20,000 adolescents leave the Nation's \n     foster care system each year because they are no longer \n     eligible to receive assistance as a ward of the State and are \n     expected to support themselves.\n       (3) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, there were 117,000 children waiting for adoption as \n     of March 31, 1999.\n       (4) Of those waiting children, the median time each child \n     had been in continuous foster care was 38 months.\n       (5) Of those waiting children, the median age at time of \n     the child's removal from home was 3.2 years and the median \n     age of those children on March 31, 1999, was 7.7 years. Based \n     upon those statistics, the median child waited 4.5 years for \n     permanency.\n       (6) According to the House Ways and Means Committee Green \n     Book for 1998, the incidence of all children in the United \n     States who are in foster care has increased from 3.9 per \n     1,000 in 1962 to an estimated 6.9 per 1,000 in 1996.\n       (7) According to the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, the Federal Government will make $4,400,000,000 in \n     foster care payments in fiscal year 2000 to cover the Federal \n     share of providing for children in foster care. \n     Conservatively estimated, the State share of providing foster \n     care services for fiscal year 2000 will cost over \n     $8,800,000,000. In fiscal year 1990, the Federal Government \n     share equaled only $1,500,000,000.\n       (8) In addition to financial savings to the United States \n     Treasury and State treasuries, finding permanent and loving \n     homes for children and youth contributes to the emotional, \n     mental, and physical well-being of the child and therefore \n     benefits the child, the family, and society.\n       (9) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 establishes \n     that safety, permanency, and well-being are paramount when \n     planning for children in foster care.\n       (10) Under the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, \n     States are required to make reasonable efforts to locate \n     permanent families for all children, including older children \n     and teens, for whom reunification with their biological \n     families is not in the best interests of the children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution on the \n     budget assume that--\n       (1) the Senate should reaffirm its commitment, as stated in \n     the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, to improving \n     outcomes and seeking permanency for our Nation's most \n     vulnerable children and youth;\n       (2) the Senate, when considering legislation impacting the \n     child welfare system, should maintain vigilance in seeking \n     accountability measures that benefit children and youth in \n     foster care; and\n       (3) the Secretary of Health and Human Services should use \n     all the resources at the Secretary's disposal to ensure the \n     shortest possible stay in foster care for each child.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 BOXER (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3036\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Lautenberg, \nand Mr. Torricelli) submitted an\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\namendment intended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, \nS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING USE OF THE ABANDONED \n                   MINE RECLAMATION FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) in 1977, Congress passed the Surface Mine and \n     Reclamation Act of 1977 (30 U.S.C. 1201 et seq.), and set \n     Federal standards for environmental protection at surface \n     coal mining operations, while establishing an Abandoned Mine \n     Reclamation Fund to pay for reclamation of abandoned coal \n     mines;\n       (2) the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund is funded by levies \n     on coal production and currently has an unappropriated \n     balance of approximately $1,200,000,000;\n       (3) spending from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund is \n     limited by the curbs on annual discretionary funding;\n       (4) the Environmental Protection Agency has stated that the \n     most pressing environmental problem in Appalachia is the acid \n     drainage in water runoff caused by abandoned and unreclaimed \n     mine sites;\n       (5) abandoned mines constitute an environmental and safety \n     hazard for residents of Appalachia and other mining areas;\n       (6) Congress has estimated the cost of abandoned mine \n     reclamation to be as high as $33,000,000,000;\n       (7) Congress has also seen fit to dedicate interest from \n     money invested in the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to help \n     ensure the availability of health care benefits to retired \n     miners and their families; and\n       (8) because of upheaval and difficulties in the coal mining \n     industry, many retired miners and their families would not, \n     without the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund, receive the \n     benefits that the miners have been contractually promised \n     from their employers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budget levels in this resolution assume that \n     Congress will enact legislation to spend the money in the \n     Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to--\n       (1) reclaim abandoned coal mine sites as soon as possible; \n     and\n       (2) take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the \n     health care needs of retired coal miners and their families \n     are met.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 SMITH (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3039\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Mack, and Mr. Graham) \nsubmitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF SENATE ON REDUCING AMERICAN DEPENDENCE ON \n                   IMPORTED OIL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) The United States' imports of crude oil have risen from \n     43 percent of domestic consumption in 1992 to 56 percent in \n     2000.\n       (2) Since 1992, United States crude oil production has \n     declined by 17 percent, while U.S. crude oil consumption has \n     increased 14 percent.\n       (3) The President has determined, pursuant to Section 232 \n     of the Trade Expansion Act, that reliance on imports of crude \n     oil threaten to impair the national security;\n       (4) The Department of Energy predicts that U.S. dependence \n     on foreign sources of oil will rise to 65 percent of domestic \n     consumption by 2015;\n       (5) The United Nations maintains extensive economic \n     sanctions on Iraq for that nation's refusal to comply with \n     inspection programs to ensure that Iraq is not producing \n     weapons of mass destruction;\n       (6) The United States has spent more than $10 billion since \n     the end of the Gulf War to ensure that the government of Iraq \n     does not engage in aggregate actions within and outside of \n     its borders;\n       (7) The United States currently has 8,500 sailors, 5,700 \n     airmen and 2,300 soldiers in the Middle East with the sole \n     purpose of preventing aggressive actions by the government of \n     Iraq;\n       (8) The fastest growing single source of crude oil imports \n     into the United States is Iraq--imports having risen from \n     300,000 barrels a day in 1998 to 700,000 barrels a day today;\n       (9) Continued reliance on Iraq for imported crude oil is in \n     direct conflict with the national interests of the United \n     States and poses a threat to the national security;\n       (10) Continued reliance on Iraq for imported crude oil has \n     undermined U.S. foreign policy objectives and forced the \n     United States to sponsor a resolution in the United Nations \n     allowing Iraq to purchase equipment and spare parts for its \n     oil industry.\n       (11) The only sure means to reduce such threats to national \n     security is to limit the dependence of the United States on \n     foreign sources of crude oil.\n       It is the Sense of the Senate that the level in this budget \n     resolution assumes that:\n       (1) The United States should develop a national energy \n     strategy whose primary goal is to reduce the dependence of \n     the United States on imports of crude oil, especially crude \n     oil imported from Iraq;\n       (2) To reduce dependence on imports of crude oil, the \n     United States government should:\n       (A) encourage exploration and development of all domestic \n     sources of energy;\n       (B) encourage the development of alternative energy \n     technologies;\n       (C) encourage energy conservation measures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 DeWINE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3048\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \nGrams, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Hatch) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, \nS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING RESOURCES TO REDUCE \n                   YOUTH DRUG USE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) from 1985 to 1992, the Federal Government's drug \n     control budget was balanced among education, treatment, law \n     enforcement, and international supply reduction activities \n     and this resulted in a 13 percent reduction in overall drug \n     use from 1988 to 1991;\n       (2) between 1993 and 1998, the Federal investment in \n     reducing the flow of drugs outside the borders of the United \n     States declined both in real dollars and as a proportion of \n     the Federal drug control budget, even though the Federal \n     Government is the only United States entity that can seize \n     and destroy drugs outside the borders of the United States;\n       (3) since 1992, overall drug use among teens aged 12 to 17 \n     rose by 70 percent;\n       (4) cocaine production from Colombia rose from 230 metric \n     tons in 1995 to 520 metric tons in 1999;\n       (5) cocaine use among 10th graders increased 133 percent \n     from 1992 to 1999;\n       (6) crack use among 10th graders increased 167 percent from \n     1992 to 1999;\n       (7) heroin use among 12th graders increased 67 percent from \n     1992 to 1999;\n       (8) despite the increase in youth drug use, the Department \n     of Education cut more than $5,700,000 of the Federal \n     investment in school-based antidrug prevention and education \n     programs, placing our investment in these programs in fiscal \n     year 2000 below the amounts provided for fiscal year 1999; \n     and\n       (9) effectively reducing youth drug use requires a balanced \n     and comprehensive Federal investment in eradication, \n     interdiction, education, treatment, and law enforcement \n     programs.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget assume that--\n       (1) funding for Federal drug control activities should be \n     at a higher priority than that proposed in the President's \n     budget request for fiscal year 2001; and\n       (2) investments in Federal drug control activities should \n     include--\n       (A) the programs and activities authorized in the Western \n     Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act;\n       (B) programs and activities to secure the United States \n     borders from illegal drug smuggling;\n       (C) the programs and activities authorized in the proposed \n     Drug-Free Century Act (S. 5 as introduced in the Senate on \n     January 19, 1999);\n       (D) programs and activities to eliminate methamphetamine \n     laboratories in the United States;\n       (E) the programs and activities authorized in the proposed \n     reauthorization of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and \n     Communities Program; and\n       (F) the programs and activities authorized in the proposed \n     Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act (S. 976 as passed \n     in the Senate on November 4, 1999).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 DeWINE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3049\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. \nFeingold, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. \nMurkowski) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to \nthe concurrent resolution, S.

FISCAL YEAR 2001 FUNDING FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST \n                   GUARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 saved \n     approximately 3,800 lives in providing the essential service \n     of maritime safety.\n       (2) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 prevented 111,689 \n     pounds of cocaine and 28,872 pounds of marijuana from \n     entering the United States in providing the essential service \n     of maritime security.\n       (3) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 boarded more than \n     14,000 fishing vessels to check for compliance with safety \n     and environmental laws in providing the essential service of \n     the protection of natural resources.\n       (4) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 ensured the safe \n     passage of nearly 1,000,000 commercial vessel transits \n     through congested harbors with vessel traffic services in \n     providing the essential service of maritime mobility.\n       (5) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 sent \n     international training teams to help more than 50 countries \n     develop their maritime services in providing the essential \n     service national defense.\n       (6) Each year, the United States Coast Guard ensures the \n     safe passage of more than 200,000,000 tons of cargo cross the \n     Great Lakes including iron ore, coal, and limestone. Shipping \n     on the Great Lakes faces a unique challenge because the \n     shipping season begins and ends in ice anywhere from 3 to 15 \n     feet thick. The ice-breaking vessel MACKINAW has allowed \n     commerce to continue under these conditions. However, the \n     productive life of the MACKINAW is nearing an end. The Coast \n     Guard has committed to keeping the vessel in service until \n     2006 when a replacement vessel is projected to be in service, \n     but to meet that deadline, funds must be provided for the \n     Coast Guard in fiscal year 2001 to provide for the \n     procurement of a multipurpose-design heavy icebreaker.\n       (7) Without adequate funding, the United States Coast Guard \n     would have to radically reduce the level of service it \n     provides to the American public.\n       (b) Adjustment in Budget Levels.--\n       (1) Increase in funding for transportation.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, the \n     amounts specified in section 103(8) of this resolution for \n     budget authority and outlays for Transportation (budget \n     function 400) for fiscal year 2001 shall be increased as \n     follows:\n       (A) The amount of budget authority for that fiscal year, by \n     $700,000,000.\n       (B) The amount of outlays for that fiscal year, by \n     $700,000,000.\n       (2) Offsetting decrease in funding for general \n     government.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     resolution, the amounts specified in section 103(17) of this \n     resolution for budget authority and outlays for Allowances \n     (budget function 920) for fiscal year 2001 shall be decreased \n     as follows:\n       (A) The amount of budget authority for that fiscal year, by \n     $700,000,000.\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\n       (B) The amount of outlays for that fiscal year, by \n     $700,000,000.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the provisions of this resolution, as modified by \n     subsection (b), should provide additional budget authority \n     and outlay authority for the United States Coast Guard for \n     fiscal year 2001 such that the amount of such authority in \n     fiscal year 2001 exceeds the amount of such authority for \n     fiscal year 2000 by $700,000,000; and\n       (2) any level of such authority in fiscal year 2001 below \n     the level described in paragraph (1) would require the Coast \n     Guard to--\n       (A) close numerous stations and utilize remaining assets \n     only for emergency situations;\n       (B) reduce the number of personnel of an already \n     streamlined workforce;\n       (C) curtail its capacity to carry out emergency search and \n     rescue; and\n       (D) reduce operations in a manner that would have a \n     detrimental impact on the sustainability of valuable fish \n     stocks in the North Atlantic and Pacific Northwest and its \n     capacity to stem the flow of illicit drugs and illegal \n     immigration into the United States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 DeWINE (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3050\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Allard, Mr. Cleland, Mrs. \nHutchison, and Mr. Kennedy) submitted an amendment intended to be \nproposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

TROOPS TO TEACHERS PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Troops-to-Teachers program was created in 1994 to \n     assist former military personnel who served in programs that \n     were being downsized, to enable the personnel to enter public \n     education as teachers;\n       (2) since 1994, 3,670 service members have made the \n     transition from the military to classrooms;\n       (3) the program has been successful in bringing dedicated, \n     mature, and experienced individuals into the classroom;\n       (4) when school administrators were asked to rate Troops-\n     to-Teachers program participants who were teaching in their \n     schools, the administrators said that 26 percent were among \n     the best teachers in their schools, 28 percent were well \n     above average, and 17 percent were above average;\n       (5) a 1999 study, ``Alternative Teacher Certification'' by \n     C. Emily Feistritzer reported that--\n       (A) Troops-to-Teachers program participants have qualities \n     needed in today's teachers; and\n       (B) for example--\n       (i) 30 percent of the participants are minorities, compared \n     to 10 percent of all teachers;\n       (ii) 30 percent of the participants are teaching \n     mathematics, compared to 13 percent of all teachers;\n       (iii) 25 percent of the participants teach in urban \n     schools; and\n       (iv) 90 percent of the participants are male, compared to \n     26 percent of all teachers;\n       (6) the Troops-to-Teachers program is clearly a teacher \n     recruitment program that should be funded through the \n     Department of Education but is most effectively administered \n     by the Department of Defense;\n       (7) title XVII of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for fiscal year 2000 authorizes appropriations for the \n     Troops-to-Teachers program only through September 30,2000, \n     and transfers the Troops-to-Teachers program to the \n     Department of Education;\n       (8) without clear indication that the program will be \n     continued, Troops-to-Teachers program employees may begin to \n     pursue other employment before the September 30, 2000 date \n     and the loss of critical employees could be detrimental to \n     the program; and\n       (9) without authorization to continue funding beyond \n     September 30, 2000, the Troops-to-Teachers program will \n     discontinue operations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the Troops to Teachers program has been highly \n     successful in recruiting qualified teachers for the Nation's \n     classrooms;\n       (2) before October 1, 2000 Congress will pass legislation \n     that--\n       (A) extends the authorization of appropriations for the \n     program;\n       (B) provides funding for the program through the Department \n     of Education; and\n       (C) notwithstanding the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2000, provides for the administration of the \n     program by the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education \n     Support of the Department of Defense, through a transfer of \n     funds to the Defense Activity; and\n       (3) Congress will authorize and appropriate $30,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 2001 to continue and expand that successful \n     program through the Department of Education.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        ENZI AMENDMENT NO. 3051\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ENZI submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING FUNDING FOR THE \n                   OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The President has requested an increase of $44.4 \n     million for the budget of the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration (OSHA).\n       (2) This requested increase is over half the amount of the \n     increases received by OSHA over the last four years combined.\n       (3) OSHA's budget materials demonstrate that OSHA intends \n     to dedicate by far the largest portion of its fiscal year \n     2001 budget to enforcement activities. Statistics indicate \n     that there is no connection between these enforcement \n     activities and a decrease in workplace injuries and \n     illnesses.\n       (4) Helping employers comply with the Occupational Safety \n     and Health Act by providing assistance to prevent accidents \n     and illnesses before they occur is more likely to decrease \n     injuries and illnesses than after-the-fact punishment.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that before any \n     budget increase for OSHA is granted, OSHA must demonstrate \n     how these increases will result in a reduction in workplace \n     injuries and illnesses and why such a large portion of its \n     budget should be directed at enforcement activities rather \n     than compliance assistance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       EDWARDS AMENDMENT NO. 3052\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. EDWARDS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MAKING EDUCATION A NATIONAL \n                   PRIORITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Investment in education will establish that the \n     Congress is dedicated to preparing our schools and our \n     students for the 21st Century.\n       (2) Investment in education will be a significant down \n     payment on the future of our children and the future of our \n     Nation.\n       (3) The need for investment in education has never been \n     greater.\n       (4) Overcrowded and crumbling schools are damaging \n     students' safety and ability to learn. Student enrollment is \n     higher than ever and is expected to continue increasing. Many \n     students are crammed into buildings and trailers with leaking \n     roofs and crumbling walls.\n       (5) Nearly \\3/4\\ of the Nation's schools are more than 30 \n     years old and are ill-equipped to handle modern enrollment \n     and technological needs.\n       (6) School construction and modernization are necessary to \n     improve learning conditions, end overcrowding, and make \n     smaller classes possible.\n       (7) The lack of qualified teachers limits student \n     achievement by bloating student/teacher ratios and keeping \n     students from receiving the closer attention that makes \n     learning more efficient and the classroom more orderly.\n       (8) Rising costs of a college education are prohibiting \n     deserving students from seeking degrees that will enable them \n     to advance in a rapidly changing world. These rising costs \n     impact not only the students, but the growing economy that \n     requires well-educated and well-trained individuals.\n       (9) The purchasing power of Federal Pell Grants under \n     subpart 1 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act \n     of 1965 is declining rapidly, further eroding the ability of \n     young adults to seek the education that will benefit them, \n     their families, and the Nation.\n       (10) Underfunding of Federal TRIO programs under chapter 1 \n     of subpart 2 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education \n     Act of 1965 that provide outreach and support services to \n     high school, college, and university students is causing a \n     severe crisis in the ability of these programs to meet the \n     needs of thousands of students.\n       (11) Dedicating 10 percent of the non-Social Security \n     budget surplus to investment in education still leaves 90 \n     percent of that surplus for use to pay down the debt, shore \n     up the social security and medicare programs, or pay for tax \n     cuts.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this concurrent resolution assume that \n     Function 500 (education) spending shall, at a minimum, be \n     held constant for inflation, and that 10 percent of any non-\n     Social Security budget surplus shall be dedicated to \n     education initiatives and school construction in addition to \n     that spending level.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 ENZI (AND JEFFORDS) AMENDMENT NO. 3053\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ENZI (for himself and Mr. Jeffords) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, S.

Con. Res. 101, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in P.L. 105-134 the Congress declared that ``intercity \n     rail passenger service is an essential component of a \n     national intermodal passenger transportation system'';\n       (2) the Congress and the President, through enactment of \n     this legislation, have effectively agreed that Congress will \n     provide adequate funding to permit Amtrak to achieve the goal \n     of operating self-sufficiency.\n       (3) Capital investment is critical to reducing operating \n     costs and increasing the quality of Amtrak service;\n       (4) Investment in passenger rail creates jobs directly in \n     the construction, engineering, manufacturing, and service \n     industries, and indirectly in the local economies where \n     increased commerce takes place because of the existence of \n     improved transportation options;\n       (5) Underutilized rail infrastructure and high tech \n     advances in train equipment and communications systems offer \n     us the opportunity to revitalize our communities through \n     investment in passenger rail and its resulting downtown \n     redevelopment, job creation, mobility improvements, and air \n     quality improvements.\n       (6) Existing rail corridors can provide the critical \n     transportation right-of-way through clogged areas. In fact, \n     investing in the capacity of our rail system could free up \n     our highways and airports to better fulfill their potential \n     roles.\n       (7) As congestion increases and air quality worsens, the \n     quality of life in both urban and suburban communities \n     suffers. Rail provides a solution for transporting people AND \n     improving air quality.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     budget resolution assume capital funding for the development \n     of high-speed rail corridors must be funded either through \n     the appropriations process or through the leveraging of \n     private investment through tax incentives. As stated by the \n     DOT Inspector General, and unanimously by the Nation's \n     Governors, the development of high-speed rail corridors is an \n     essential component of a balanced transportation system and \n     an economically smart and environmentally friendly way to \n     help ease the increasing levels of traffic congestion on our \n     roads and aviation delays at our airports.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 GREGG (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3056\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Jeffords) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, \nS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING FUNDING FOR THE \n                   INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1975, the Federal Government made a commitment in \n     the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. \n     1411 et seq.) (referred to in this resolution as the ``Act'') \n     to pay 40 percent of the programs described in part B of such \n     Act.\n       (2) The Act guarantees that all children with disabilities \n     receive a free and appropriate public education.\n       (3) In 1997, 1998, and 1999, Congress increased funding for \n     such programs by 113 percent, but was unable to affect such \n     increases without the help or support of the Administration.\n       (4) Despite such increases in funding, Federal funding for \n     such programs is still far short of the nearly \n     $15,000,000,000 required to receive the originally promised \n     funding.\n       (5) The Federal Government currently pays only 12.6 percent \n     of such funding for the programs, which represents a great \n     disparity from the 40 percent that was originally promised \n     under the Act.\n       (6) Honoring the obligation to fund such programs at the \n     originally promised level will allow State and local \n     governments, some of which spend up to 19 percent of the \n     State or local budget on special education costs, to have \n     more flexibility to spend the local resources to meet the \n     unique educational needs of all students in the locality.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that \n     Congress' first priority should be to fully fund the programs \n     described under part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) at the originally \n     promised level of 40% before Federal funds are appropriated \n     for new education programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   SANTORUM AMENDMENTS NOS. 3057-3061\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM submitted five amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING INCREASING ACCESS TO \n                   HEALTH INSURANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) 44,400,000 Americans are currently without health \n     insurance--an increase of more than 5,000,000 since 1993--and \n     this number is expected to increase to nearly 60,000,000 \n     people in the next 10 years;\n       (2) the cost of health insurance continues to rise, a key \n     factor in the increasing number of uninsured;\n       (3) more than half of these uninsured Americans are the \n     working poor or near poor;\n       (4) the uninsured are much more likely not to receive \n     needed medical care and much more likely to need \n     hospitalization for avoidable conditions and to rely on \n     emergency room care, trends which significantly contribute to \n     the rising costs of uncompensated care by health care \n     providers and the costs of health care delivery in general; \n     and\n       (5) there is a consensus that working Americans and their \n     families will suffer from reduced access to health insurance.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that increasing \n     access to affordable health care coverage for all Americans, \n     in a manner which maximizes individual choice and control of \n     health care dollars, should be a legislative priority of \n     Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                SANTORUM (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3062\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. DeWine) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by them to the concurrent resolution, \nS.

TAXATION OF PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the President's fiscal year 2001 Federal budget \n     proposal to impose a tax on the interest, dividends, capital \n     gains, rents, and royalties in excess of $10,000 of trade \n     associations and professional societies exempt under section \n     501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986;\n       (2) such taxation represents an unjust and unnecessary \n     penalty on legitimate association activities;\n       (3) while this budget resolution projects on-budget \n     surpluses of $42,500,000,000 over the next five years, the \n     President proposes to increase the tax burden on trade and \n     professional associations by $1,550,000,000 over that same \n     period;\n       (4) the President's association tax increase proposal will \n     impose a tremendous burden on thousands of small and mid-\n     sized trade associations and professional societies;\n       (5) with the President's associations tax increase \n     proposal, most associations with annual operating budgets of \n     as low as $200,000 will be taxed on investment income and as \n     many as 70,000 associations nationwide could be affected by \n     this proposal;\n       (6) associations rely on this targeted investment income to \n     carry out exempt-status-related activities, such as training \n     individuals to adapt to the changing workplace, improving \n     industry safety, providing statistical data and community \n     services;\n       (7) keeping investment income free from tax encourages \n     associations to maintain modest surplus funds that cushion \n     against economic and fiscal downturns; and\n       (8) although corporations can increase prices to cover \n     increased costs, small and medium-sized local, regional, and \n     State-based associations do not have such an option, and thus \n     the increased costs imposed by the President's associations \n     tax increase would reduce resources available for the \n     importation standard-setting, educational training, and \n     professionalism training performed by associations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this concurrent resolution on \n     the budget assume that Congress shall reject the President's \n     proposed tax increase on investment income of associations as \n     defined under section 501(c)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   ABRAHAM AMENDMENTS NOS. 3065-3066\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM submitted two amendments intended to be proposed by them \nto the concurrent resolution, S.

Con. Res. 101, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE UNITED STATES PATENT \n                   AND TRADEMARK OFFICE'S RETENTION OF USER FEE \n                   FUNDED RESOURCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Technology and innovation are key to American \n     competitiveness and the present and future growth of the \n     American economy in the 21st Century;\n       (2) As recognized by the Founding Fathers, intellectual \n     property, and patents in particular, are fundamental to \n     promoting American innovation and the progress of science and \n     useful arts;\n       (3) As American inventors and companies have discovered \n     that patents and trademarks can be used to improve financial \n     performance and enhance their overall competitiveness, the \n     importance of and demand for intellectual property protection \n     has increased exponentially;\n       (4) The United States Patent and Trademark Office was \n     established by Congress to promote innovation through the \n     granting and issuing of patents and the registration of \n     trademarks;\n       (5) Fees collected by the Patent and Trademark Office \n     represent payments by American inventors and businesses for \n     services to be performed by the Patent and Trademark Office, \n     including the examination, granting, and issuing of patents, \n     and the registration of trademarks, as well as related \n     products and services;\n       (6) In 1981, Congress increased patent and trademark fees \n     by nearly 400 percent in order to reduce patent pendency and \n     place the Office on a course of achieving self-sufficiency;\n       (7) Congress later enacted the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1990, which totally eliminated general \n     taxpayer support for the Patent and Trademark Office \n     beginning in fiscal year 1991 in favor of the current fee-\n     funded agency model under which the entire costs of services \n     are recouped by fees paid for those services;\n       (8) Since fiscal year 1991, Congress has diverted or \n     withheld authorization for the Patent and Trademark Office to \n     spend more than $564 million in user fee revenues paid by \n     inventors and trademark owners, directing this money instead \n     to other government programs totally unrelated to supporting \n     America's inventors and high technology industries.\n       (9) As a result of the diversion and withholding of fees, \n     patent pendency has risen from 20.8 months to 26.2 months, \n     costing American inventors on average six months of return on \n     their investments in technology and innovation, and delaying \n     the availability of innovative products to the American \n     people for the same period;\n       (10) Continued withholding of patent and trademark fees is \n     projected to lead to an increase in average patent pendency \n     of an additional six months, totaling nearly three years, by \n     fiscal year 2005;\n       (11) Moreover, the Patent and Trademark Office faces a host \n     of new and significant challenges, including those related to \n     dramatic increases in workloads and new and more complex \n     fields of innovation;\n       (12) In order to meet these challenges, the Patent and \n     Trademark Office must be able to hire, train, and retain \n     adequate numbers of technologically qualified examiners and \n     make available for their use adequate tools and search files, \n     including a comprehensive prior art database for the \n     examination of Internet-related business method patent \n     applications.\n       (13) The Patent and Trademark Office's ability to provide \n     these services in a manner that assures the highest quality \n     and efficiency, and that meets these new challenges, is \n     compromised by the withholding and diversion of patent and \n     trademark fees to other Federal functions.\n       (14) The dedication of Patent and Trademark Office \n     resources to serving American innovators is an investment in \n     the nation's economy which will help to preserve the United \n     States' status as the world's leader in technology and \n     innovation and is necessary to keep faith with the American \n     innovators who pay these fees and build the American economy.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--For all of the foregoing, it is \n     the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) As a fully fee-funded agency charged with promoting \n     innovation and fostering the\n\n[[Page S2380]]\n\n     growth of technology that drives the American economy, the \n     Patent and Trademark Office must be allowed to retain the \n     fees it collects from American inventors and trademark owners \n     in order to provide the technology-related services for which \n     they were paid in a manner that meets the highest standards \n     of quality and timeliness, rather than having these fees \n     diverted to other government uses;\n       (2) The levels in the resolution assume that the offsetting \n     fee collections assessed and collected pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \n     1113 and 35 U.S.C. 41 and 376 shall be made fully available \n     in the fiscal year in which they are collected for necessary \n     expenses of the Patent and Trademark Office provided for by \n     law, including defense of suits instituted against the \n     Director of Patents and Trademarks, and shall remain \n     available until expended;\n       (3) The assumptions of the resolution should be maintained \n     and implemented through the budget and appropriations \n     processes to safeguard the integrity of the Patent and \n     Trademark Office's fee-funded agency model and continued \n     American innovation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       SHELBY AMENDMENT NO. 3068\n\n  (Ordered to

SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING CASH BALANCE PENSION PLAN \n                   CONVERSIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Defined benefit pension plans are guaranteed by the \n     Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and provide a lifetime \n     benefit for a beneficiary and spouse.\n       (2) Defined benefit pension plans provide meaningful \n     retirement benefits to rank and file workers, since such \n     plans are generally funded by employer contributions.\n       (3) Employers should be encouraged to establish and \n     maintain defined benefit pension plans.\n       (4) An increasing number of major employers have been \n     converting their traditional defined benefit plans to ``cash \n     balance'' or other hybrid defined benefit plans.\n       (5) Under current law, employers are not required to \n     provide plan participants with meaningful disclosure of the \n     impact of converting a traditional defined benefit plan to a \n     ``cash balance'' or other hybrid formula.\n       (6) For a number of years after a conversion, the cash \n     balance or other hybrid benefit formula may result in a \n     period of ``wear away'' during which older and longer service \n     participants earn no additional benefits.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that pension plan \n     participants whose plans are changed to cause older or longer \n     service workers to earn less retirement income, including \n     conversions to ``cash balance plans,'' should receive \n     additional protection than what is currently provided, and \n     Congress should act this year to address this important \n     issue. In particular, at a minimum--\n\n[[Page S2381]]\n\n       (1) all pension plan participants should receive adequate, \n     accurate, and timely notice of any change to a plan that will \n     cause participants to earn less retirement income in the \n     future;\n       (2) pension plans that are changed to a cash balance or \n     other hybrid formula should not be permitted to ``wear away'' \n     participants' benefits in such a manner that older and longer \n     service participants earn no additional pension benefits for \n     a period of time after the change; and\n       (3) Federal law should continue to prohibit pension plan \n     participants from being discriminated against on the basis of \n     age in the provision of pension benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/06/senate-section/article/S2381-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n          committee on health, education, labor, and pensions\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.
