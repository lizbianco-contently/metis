It is the \nleadership's intention to complete all business by the end of this \nweek. I hope that that can be achieved, and I thank my colleagues for \ntheir attention.\n  Let me emphasize again, at this time, as I had indicated to Senator \nReid last week, we will notify the Members as to whether or not there \nwill be votes on Tuesday or what time they will occur. As it now \nstands, while there will be, I believe, reports filed on Tuesday to \naccompany appropriations bills and perhaps even a tax bill, we do not \nanticipate any votes to occur on Tuesday, but we do expect perhaps even \nseveral votes to occur on Wednesday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, let me reclaim the floor.

Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to the conference report to accompany S. 835, the \nestuary bill; further, that the conference report be adopted, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The conference report will be printed in a future edition of the \nRecord in the House proceedings.)\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nconference report to S. 835, the Estuaries and Clean Waters Act of \n2000.\n  During my year in the Senate, one of my top legislative priorities \nhas been the enactment of my father's estuary habitat restoration \npartnership legislation, S. 835. This bill will promote the restoration \nof one million acres of estuary habitat by directing $275 million in \nfunding and other incentives to local estuarine restoration projects.\n  I congratulate the Members of the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittees, and in particular Chairman Bob Smith, for their expertise, \npersistence and enthusiastic support for this important environmental \nbill. And, I am delighted that the Senate is approving this compromise \nversion, and moving the Estuaries and Clean Waters Act one step closer \nto enactment this session.\n  Mr. President, my father was a champion of efforts to protect \nwetlands and estuarine areas, and he felt strongly that the federal \ngovernment should do more to restore and safeguard these valuable \nhabitats. He had a special devotion and appreciation for the salt \nmarshes, coves and coastline of Narragansett Bay. Thus, in the fall of \n1997, at Edgewood Yacht Club in Cranston, surrounded by supporters from \nRhode Island's Save The Bay, Senator John H. Chafee announced \nintroduction of his comprehensive legislation to protect and restore \nour nation's estuaries. That bill evolved into S. 835, the Estuary \nHabitat Restoration Partnership Act that he introduced in the Spring of \nlast year. And, when we approve this legislation, we are carrying out \nthe work that my father considered to be of utmost importance to the \nhealth of our fisheries, the quality of our waters, and the beauty of \nour great land.\n  Estuaries are where the river's current meets the sea's tide. These \nwaterbodies are unique areas where life thrives. They are where the \nfood chain begins, and many estuaries produce more harvestable human \nfood per acre than the best mid-western farmland. An astonishing \nvariety of life, including animals as diverse as lobsters, Whooping \nCranes, manatees, salmon, otters, Bald Eagles, and sea turtles, all \ndepend on estuaries for their survival. Estuaries provide the nursing \ngrounds for our fisheries, support many of our endangered and \nthreatened species and host nearly half of the neotropical migratory \nbirds in the United States.\n  However, these productive areas are fragile, and vulnerable to human \nand environmental pressures. Today, burgeoning human populations in \ncoastal areas are disrupting the balance and threatening the health of \nfragile estuary habitats. Activities such as dredging, draining, the \nconstruction of dams, uncontrolled sewage discharges, and other forms \nof pollution have all led to the degradation and destruction of estuary \nhabitat. The bottom line is that we are not doing enough for these \nvaluable resources. Estuaries are national treasures, and they deserve \na national effort to protect and restore them.\n  Like the many supporters of S. 835, I believe estuary legislation is \nneeded to turn the tide and start restoring the valuable estuarine \nhabitats that are literally disappearing along our nation's coasts. \nSenator John H. Chafee used to say: ``Given half a chance, nature will \nrebound and overcome tremendous setbacks, but we must--at the very \nleast--give it that half a chance.'' The good news is that in many \ndegraded coastal areas, nature will rebound if we simply reduce \npollution, or return salt water, or replant eelgrass in the proper \nconditions.\n  This legislation will fuel efforts to restore one million acres of \nestuary habitat by emphasizing several aspects of successful habitat \nrestoration projects: effective coordination among different levels of \ngovernment; continued investment by public and private sector partners; \nand, most importantly, active participation by local communities.\n  S. 835 encourages voluntary activities nationwide by authorizing $275 \nmillion over five years for estuary habitat restoration projects. Other \nprovisions include the creation of a council to help develop a national \nstrategy for habitat restoration; and a cost-sharing requirement to \nhelp leverage federal dollars. S. 835 also promotes ongoing restoration \nefforts by reauthorizing the Chesapeake Bay and the Long Island Sound \nEstuary Programs and authorizing a program in the Lake Pontchartrain \nBasin to restore estuaries at the base of the Mississippi River.\n  And, the bill makes a significant and necessary change in the EPA's \nNational Estuary Program. Up until now, the 28 nationally-designated \nestuaries--including Narragansett Bay--could only use federal funds to \ndevelop conservation and management plans. This bill amends the program \nto allow NEP grants to be used to implement the conservation measures \nincluded in those plans, and it nearly triples the authorization for \nthe National Estuary Program from $12 million to $35 million per year \nfor the next five years. Indeed, a central theme of this legislation is \nthe need to carry out projects within existing plans and get moving \nwith on-the-ground restoration activities.\n  Responding effectively to the growing threats to our bays, sounds and \nother coastal waters presents a tremendous challenge: federal resources \nare scarce, the need is great, and the pressure on these areas is \nintensifying. Yet, I am encouraged by the enormous support--at the \nlocal, state and federal levels--for taking action to arrest the \ndeterioration of our estuaries, and to reverse the trend through \nrestoration projects. And, I have seen first-hand that restoration \nprojects really work. In recent years, the Rhode Island Department of \nEnvironmental Management's Narragansett Bay Estuary Program; federal \npartners such as the Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; Save the \nBay and other conservation organizations; and local communities have \njoined forces to restore estuaries in and around Narragansett Bay.\n  By leveraging funding, equipment, volunteers and other resources, \nfederal and non-federal partners have forged cooperative relationships \nto restore some of the Bay's most important estuarine environments. The \nGalilee Salt\n\n[[Page S10882]]\n\nMarsh and Bird Sanctuary Restoration Project is one such success. This \n128-acre marsh was largely cut off from tidal flows as a result of road \nconstruction beginning in the 1950's. When fully completed, the \nrestoration project will return 84 acres of salt marsh habitat and 14 \nacres of open water in new tidal channels to the Galilee Bird \nSanctuary. With the reopening of the marsh to tides, salt marsh grasses \nnative to Rhode Island are returning to the area, along with many small \nfish and crabs and wetland birds such as geese, ducks, egrets, herons \nand shorebirds. The area is also expected to, once again, serve as an \nimportant nursery area for commercially-important fish species.\n  Other successful Rhode Island projects include the anadromous fish \nand salt marsh restoration in the Massachuck Creek Fishway in \nBarrington; restoration of Boyd's Marsh in Portsmouth; and a NOAA \nCommunity-Based Restoration Program that partnered Save The Bay with \nlocal students and teachers to train them in seagrass and eelgrass \nrestoration techniques. These activities demonstrate that by \nintegrating state and federal resources with local, hands-on community \ninvolvement, we can give estuary habitats that half a chance they need \nto revive and flourish.\n  A lot of progress has been made toward restoring the health of the \nRhode Island's estuaries, but considerable work remains to be done. In \nmy view, Narragansett Bay is not only Rhode Island's greatest natural \nasset, but is also the most beautiful of our nation's estuaries. \nDesignated by Congress as an ``estuary of national significance,'' \nNarragansett Bay covers 147 square miles and is home to 60 species of \nfish and shellfish and more than 200 species of birds. Tourism, fishing \nand other Bay-related businesses fuel the regional economy. As a Rhode \nIslander, it seems clear that our welfare depends on our ability to \nsustain a clean, healthy, and productive Bay. The challenge of estuary \nrestoration is even greater at the national level. With the aid of the \nEstuaries and Clean Water Act of 2000, the federal government will help \nmeet that challenge, working with state and local partners to revive \nour most precious and productive estuary resources.\n  I thank my Senate colleagues for approving this important \nlegislation. And, again I offer appreciation for the efforts of the \nChairman and the Ranking Member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, the other Senate conferees and the Committee staff for their \nperseverance and dedication to passing estuary legislation this \nCongress. I also thank Rhode Island's Save The Bay, under the \nleadership of Curt Spalding, and the other conservation organizations \nwho have worked hard to garner support for this legislation across the \ncountry.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nthe Estuaries and Clean Waters Act of 2000, S. 835. This is an \nimportant piece of legislation that will enhance our ability to protect \nthe nation's valuable shoreline habitats, extend the cooperative \npartnership to preserve the Chesapeake Bay and Long Island Sound, and \nexpand the effort to improve water quality in our nation's lakes.\n  I am proud to have been a cosponsor of this legislation and to have \nhad the opportunity to work with our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives to ensure its passage this year. This legislation was \nof particular importance to our former colleague, and my friend, \nSenator John Chafee. He was the principal sponsor of this bill and a \nlong time champion of estuaries. A year ago, under his chairmanship, \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works reported out S. 835 by \nvoice vote. Since then, his son, Senator Lincoln Chafee has continued \nthe effort to get an estuaries bill signed into law. I am grateful for \nhis leadership and am pleased to join him in that effort. With the \nSenate's passage of the Conference Report on S. 835 today, and similar \naction in the House, we will achieve that goal. I believe that is a \nfitting tribute to Senator John Chafee.\n  S. 835 exemplifies environmental policy based on partnership and \ncooperation, and not on top-down mandates and over-burdensome Federal \nregulations. The bill encourages States, local governments and \nnongovernmental organizations to work together to identify estuary \nhabitat restoration projects. With the federal government, acting \nthrough the Army Corps of Engineers, as a partner, communities across \nthe country will be able to restore and enhance one million acres of \nestuaries. Because these projects will be implemented in partnership \nwith local sponsors, there will be little cost to the taxpayer. This is \nexactly the kind of environmental success that we should all be proud \nof supporting.\n  To understand how important this Act is for protecting the \nenvironment, one has to understand what estuaries are and how valuable \nthey are to our society. Estuaries are the bays, gulfs, sounds, and \ninlets where fresh water from rivers and streams meets and mixes with \nsalt water from the ocean. More simply, estuaries are where the rivers \nmeet the sea. You can find examples of estuaries in costal marshes, \ncoastal wetlands, maritime forests, sea grass meadows and river deltas. \nEstuaries represent some of the most environmentally and economically \nproductive habitats in the world.\n  Estuaries are critical for wildlife. Approximately 50 percent of the \nnation's migratory songbirds are linked to coastal estuary habitats, \nwhile nearly 30 percent of North American waterfowl rely upon coastal \nestuary habitat for wintering grounds. Many threatened and endangered \nspecies depend upon estuaries for their survival.\n  Estuaries also play a major role in commercial and recreational \nfishing. Approximately seventy-five percent of the commercial fish \ncatch, and eighty to ninety percent of the recreational fish catch, \ndepend in some way on estuaries.\n  Estuaries also contribute significantly to the quality of life for \nmany Americans. Over half of the population of the United States lives \nnear a coastal area; a great majority of Americans visit estuaries \nevery year to swim, fish, hunt, dive, bike, view wildlife, and learn. \nFor many states, tourism associated with estuaries provides enormous \neconomic benefit. In fact, the coastal recreation and tourism industry \nis the second largest employer in the nation, serving 180 million \nAmericans each year.\n  These many attributes of estuaries are especially important to me \nbecause of the rich coast line of New Hampshire. New Hampshire \nestuaries contribute to the dynamic habitat and beauty of the State, as \nwell as the economy. Recreational shell fishing alone contributes an \nestimated $3 million annually to the State and local economies.\n  New Hampshire has been in the forefront of the national effort to \nidentify and protect sensitive estuary habitats. The New Hampshire \nGreat Bay/Little Bay and Hampton Harbor, and their tributary rivers \njoined the National Estuary Program in July of 1995 as part of the New \nHampshire Estuaries Project. I am particularly pleased that the \nConference Report on S. 835 specifically mentions the Great Bay Estuary \nand directs the Secretary of the Army to give priority consideration to \nthe Great Bay Estuary in selecting estuary habitat restoration \nprojects.\n  The Great Bay Estuary has a rich cultural history. It's beauty and \nresources attracted the Paleo-Indians to the area nearly 6,000 years \nago. It was also the site of a popular summer resort during the 1800s, \nas well as a shipyard. As a Senator from New Hampshire, I am proud to \nhelp preserve this historical and ecological resource for future \ngenerations.\n  Unfortunately, many of the estuaries around the United States \nincluding those in New Hampshire, have been harmed by urbanization of \nthe surrounding areas. According to the EPA's National Water Quality \nInventory, 38 percent of the surveyed estuary habitat is impaired.\n  The Estuaries and Clean Waters Act is a tremendous step forward in \nestablishing a much-needed restoration program that does not duplicate \nexisting efforts, but instead builds upon them.\n  The legislation establishes a new, collaborative, interagency, inter-\ngovernmental process for the selection and implementation of estuary \nhabitat restoration projects. It is based on the premise that we should \nprovide incentives to States, local communities, and the private sector \nto play a role in the restoration of estuary habitat. It also reflects \nthe fundamental belief that the decisions of how to restore these \nestuaries should be made by those who know best--the local communities.\n\n[[Page S10883]]\n\n  The Secretary of the Army is authorized to use $275 million over the \nnext five years to implement, with local partners, estuary habitat \nrestoration projects that are selected from a list put together by a \nmulti-agency Estuary Habitat Restoration Council. The Council gets the \nideas for specific projects from the local communities and \nnongovernmental organizations that want to want to serve as partners in \nthe projects. This is truly a collaborative process, from start to \nfinish.\n  In selecting specific projects, the Secretary is directed to take \ninto consideration a number of factors. These factors include: \ntechnical feasibility and scientific merit; cost-effectiveness; whether \nthe project will encourage increased coordination and cooperation among \nfederal, State, and local governments; whether the project fosters \npublic-private partnerships; and whether the project is part of an \napproved estuary management or habitat restoration plan.\n  I am particularly pleased that special priority will be given to \nprojects that test innovative technologies that have the potential for \nimproving cost-effectiveness in estuary habitat restoration. These \ntechnologies are eligible to receive an increased federal cost share. \nSome of these technologies are now being identified and tested in the \nNational Estuarine Research Reserve System. The University of New \nHampshire plays an important role in the NERRS program.\n  This bill also ensures accountability through ongoing monitoring and \nevaluation. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) \nwill maintain a data base of restoration projects so that information \nand lessons learned from one project can be incorporated into other \nrestoration projects. In addition, the Secretary is directed to submit \nto Congress two reports, after the third and fifth years of the \nprogram, a detailing the progress made under the Act. This report will \nallow us in the Congress, as well as the public, to assess the \nsuccesses and failures of the projects and strategies developed under \nthis Act.\n  S. 835 also includes important provisions dealing with the National \nEstuaries Program, the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Long Island \nSound. I know that the Chesapeake Bay Program has been of particular \nimportance to Senator Warner. I am pleased that the final bill extended \nthe authorizations for these three programs.\n  I do want to acknowledge the important role that the National \nEstuaries Program (NEP) has played in raising national awareness of the \nvalue of estuary habitats. The NEP was established in 1988 and \ndemonstrates what we can accomplish when Federal, State and local \ngovernments work in partnership. Participation in the program is \nvoluntary and emphasizes watershed planning and community involvement. \nTo date, 28 conservation plans under this program have been prepared \nfor designated estuaries. I am pleased that New Hampshire is in the \nprocess of developing its own conservation plan.\n  Unfortunately, the National Estuaries Program has not had sufficient \nresources to adequately address habitat restoration. Until now, in \nfact, only the development of the plans could be funded, not their \nimplementation. S. 835 will change that. This bill will increase the \nauthorization for the NEP from $12 million to $35 million annually \nthrough 2005.\n  I believe that this overwhelmingly bipartisan bill represents an \napproach to environmental policy that should be the basis for solving \nall environmental problems. I strongly believe that we should seek to \nsolve environmental problems together, on a bipartisan basis, through \ncooperation and partnership, and not through confrontation. We should \ntrust the States and local governments as our partners, and allow \ndecisions that affect local communities to made by at the local level. \nWe must use our taxpayer dollars wisely and effectively; and we should \ninsist on results and accountability. If we do these things, I believe \nwe will do a better job of preserving our natural resources, cleaning \nup our waters, and improving our air quality.\n  Mr. President, the Estuaries and Clean Waters Act of 2000 takes an \nimportant step in the right direction. It's a bill that we should all \nbe proud of. I thank my colleagues for supporting its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/23/senate-section/article/S10883-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ACKNOWLEDGING AND SALUTING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF COIN COLLECTORS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to withhold the final request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I merely want to ask the majority leader a \nbit more about the schedule. I understand there are no votes tomorrow, \non Tuesday, and the potential of votes on Wednesday. I missed part of \nthe presentation of the majority leader for which I apologize.\n  Is it the intention of the majority leader to try to complete \nbusiness this week?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am happy to repeat it because I know we \nwant to make sure all Senators have heard this. We have four \nappropriations bills that are in some degree of completion. I think two \nof them have been wrapped up and two are still being discussed between \nthe House, the Senate, and the White House. It is possible the House \nwill act on one of those appropriations bills on Tuesday, but it \nappears it wouldn't be until late in the afternoon or even early \nevening, so we wouldn't get it until late Tuesday or perhaps Wednesday \nmorning.\n  We also have a discussion underway involving a tax bill which would \nprovide for FSC and the pension and IRAs that have been approved by the \nSenate Finance Committee, so that could be completed and be available \nlate tomorrow afternoon. But both of those would also probably be done \non Wednesday.\n  Hopefully, with three or four votes, we would be able to complete the \nsession for the year. That could be done Wednesday; hopefully it will \nbe done not later than Thursday. Of course, that all is dependent upon \nfinal agreement between the two bodies and final comments we might get \nfrom the White House.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the majority leader for his response.\n  Might I inquire on one further issue, the issue of the tax matters \nthat the Senator described? Can the Senator tell me how those tax \nissues will come to the floor of the Senate and the House? In what \nform? Attached to what legislation?\n  Mr. LOTT. I don't mean for that to be all inclusive. I assume we will \nbe clearing bills right along as we did last week and this week. We \nalso have a number of Executive Calendar nominations that we anticipate \nclearing. I started the process last week to get to a vote on \nbankruptcy. We hope that will also come up, probably Thursday, before \nwe go out.\n  With regard to the tax provisions, there is a bill to which they \nwould be attached. I don't recall the number right offhand. It does \nrelate to small businesses, small business tax relief, but I can't give \nan exact name.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might ask our \ndistinguished leader, he mentioned the Executive Calendar. The Finance \nCommittee has held hearings on six nominees, two tax court judges of \nsome considerable salience, two public trustees of the Social Security \ntrust funds. We have not been able to find a committee presence, a \nmajority in which to report out the measure.\n  We had hoped that possibly the committee might be discharged. These \nare persons of distinction who we all want to be in place. Will that be \npossible?\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could respond, I understand there are two tax court \njudges, two trustees with the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, \ntwo Social Security advisory board nominees, and Assistant Secretary of \nCommerce. It is our intent to get clearance to discharge committee and \nconfirm those before we go out--hopefully, maybe even tomorrow; \ncertainly, Wednesday or Thursday. But we have the list and we are going \nto be working on that.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That is most reassuring. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Mr. President, we are now 23 days from the end of the \nlast fiscal year, and 15 days before the election. So far, this \nCongress can be defined more by what it has failed to do than what it \nhas done. The majority has so far succeeded in killing a number of \ncritical initiatives needed by working families and senior citizens. \nThe list of legislative corpses could fill several obituary pages.\n  Here is the report card on this Congress: Patients' Bill of Rights, \nnot done; prescription drug benefit for Medicare, not done; school \nmodernization and renovation, not done; class-size reduction, not done; \nminimum wage increase, not done; pay equity, not done; farm bill \nreforms, not done; gun safety measures, not done; campaign finance \nreform, not done; hate crimes legislation, not done; Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act, not done; college tuition tax deductibility, \nnot done; long-term care tax credit, not done; child care tax credit, \nnot done.\n  That list could go on and on but I think that summarizes it pretty \nwell.\n  One might ask, what have we been doing around here this year? Quite \nfrankly, not a heck of a lot when it comes to the people's business. \nAnd not only regarding the agenda, there are important authorizations \nand reauthorizations that have not been authorized.\n  Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the first time since 1965 \nthat Congress fails to reauthorize. The Violent Crime Control and Law \nEnforcement Act, Older Americans Act, the Superfund, Clean Water Act, \nEnergy Policy Act and Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act--none \nof these reauthorizations have taken place this year.\n  On top of that, we failed to pass our critical appropriations bills.\n  Right now, we are meeting--I'm the Senate leading Democrat on the \nLabor-HHS and education bill--on our education appropriations bill. We \nare in negotiations now. We have been in negotiations since last July \nand we can't seem to get it done. We are talking about class-size \nreduction. We have had it for 2 years. It is working well. Go around to \nyour States and talk to the schools. Teachers love it. They are getting \nmore teachers in the classroom. They are getting aides, assistant to \ncome in, especially for kids with disabilities. And right now the \nRepublicans want to turn the clocks back. They don't want to do that \nanymore. They want to turn the clock back.\n  On school modernization and construction, they don't want to do that \none, either. Mr. President, 14 million American children attend classes \nin buildings that are unsafe or inadequate. How do we expect our kid to \nlearn for the 21st century when they are in schools not equipped for \nthe 20th century? Yet this Congress says no; no to the educational \nthings that will make our kids better students, make our schools better \nschools, make the future a better one for all of our people. They say \nno.\n  We have had for 3 years, a demonstration projects in Iowa on school\n\n[[Page S10885]]\n\nrepair, $17.6 million in Federal funds to make needed repairs. It is \nleveraged an additional $141 million, a ratio of $8 to every $1.\n  It has been a great success. This is what we could expect around the \nnation if the Republicans would just get serious and fund this \nmodernization and classroom construction program. We need to continue \nthe class size reduction.\n  I read this morning in the Congress Daily that the majority leader \nmay make public a tax plan that he intends to pass before we leave: \n$260 billion over 10 years, more than the prescription drug plan that \nwe do not even have time to consider. I am very disappointed that we \nhave not considered a prescription drug plan. Now, we may have a $260 \nbillion tax plan dropped in front of us with a request to pass it \nbefore we have an opportunity to find out what is in it. I have not \nseen it. No one seems to have seen this tax bill. Unfortunately, I hear \nis it is full of tax breaks for the wealthy and breaks for the middle \nclass and those with modest incomes are being taken out. If we do get a \ntax bill, we are going to have to look through this with a fine tooth \ncomb before we vote on it. The American people deserve to know who \nbenefits from this bill. I will be having more to say about that later, \nif and when we do see this so-called tax bill.\n\n\n                       Unanimous Consent Request\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I have almost every day we have been in session, now, \nfor the last few weeks--I brought up the issue of Bonnie Campbell, who \nhas bipartisan support, who has had her hearing in the Judiciary \nCommittee, yet has not been reported out for a vote. This is it. We had \n7 nominations for circuit court judges, 2 had their hearings, one was \nreferred, and one was confirmed--one out of 7 this year. Yet in 1992, \nwhen there was a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, we had \n14 nominations for circuit court judges in the election year, 9 had a \nhearing, 9 were referred, and 9 were confirmed. Everyone who had a \nhearing got confirmed, and that was during the election year. Yet this \nyear we only got 1 out of 7.\n  One of those stuck in there who has had the hearing is Bonnie \nCampbell, who headed the Office of Violence Against Women ever since it \nstarted. She has done an outstanding job at that. We passed the \nViolence Against Women Act. We reauthorized it by an overwhelming vote \nin the House and Senate. I think that is a testimony to the fact that \nBonnie Campbell has done such an outstanding job of running that Office \nof Violence Against Women.\n  She was nominated in March, had her hearing in May, yet she has been \nsitting there ever since. It is unfair to her. It is unfair to make her \nsit bottled up in that committee. So, as I do when I get on the floor:\n  I ask unanimous consent to discharge the Judiciary Committee on \nfurther consideration of the nomination of Bonnie Campbell, that her \nnomination be considered by the Senate immediately following the \nconclusion of action on the pending matter and that debate on the \nnomination be limited to 2 hours, equally divided, and that a vote on \nher nomination occur immediately following the use or yielding back of \nthat time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We always hear that objection, but we don't know why. She \nhas had her hearing. Let's bring her out for a vote; do the decent \nthing. Bring her out and vote it up or down. That's the decent thing.\n  Until we finish here, I will ask that unanimous consent to point out \nwe are not the ones holding it up. All we want is a vote for Bonnie \nCampbell for the eighth circuit. I believe she deserves no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/23/senate-section/article/S10885-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10885-S10886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE UNFINISHED AGENDA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nHarkin, a few moments ago, as he spoke about the unfinished agenda. I \nsuppose every Congress finishes with a speech by 1 or 2 or 10 or 20 \nMembers of Congress talking about the unfinished agenda. But that \nunfinished agenda in this Congress is mighty long and also mighty \nimportant.\n  The Senator from Iowa talks about the Patients' Bill of Rights, \neducation issues such as the crumbling schools, smaller class sizes--a \nwhole series of initiatives that we really should get to. The Senator \njust asked unanimous consent--I guess it was a nomination he was \nattempting to get to the floor of the Senate.\n  I made this point last week to the consternation of a couple of my \nfriends here in the Senate, but I think it is important to make it \nagain. On September 22, a motion was brought to the floor of the \nSenate, a motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 2557. That is an \nenergy bill. That motion to proceed has now been pending here in the \nSenate for a month and a day. On September 22 it was put on the floor, \nand it has been here for 1 month and 1 day. My feeling is that the \nmotion to proceed is here--and we are not voting on it and we are not \nproceeding--it is here because it is a motion to block any other effort \nto bring up any other issues. We have a wide range of issues; I suppose \nsome of them are being negotiated these days, but most of them will \nremain unfinished at the end of this session.\n  The Senator from Iowa, who has a real passion to want to get certain \nthings done, is unable on a Monday or Tuesday to come to the floor to \nsay I want to offer a motion to proceed on his issue. Let's assume it \nis the minimum wage. He wants to test whether time has changed some \nminds on the minimum wage. He is unable to offer that. The Patients' \nBill of Rights? He has been unable to offer that. Campaign finance \nreform? Unable to offer that. Why? Because there is a motion pending, \nand the motion pending is the motion to proceed to the consideration of \nS. 2557, a bill that I do not believe was ever intended to come to the \nfloor. But the motion pending is a motion to block the efforts of \nothers who might want to offer a motion here on the floor of the \nSenate. That is what I think is thwarting the interests of the Senator \nfrom Iowa.\n  When he described the unfinished business, one might say: If it is \nunfinished, why don't you come down here and make a motion? The Senator \ncannot make a motion because that particular motion to proceed has been \nblocking anyone else from offering anything for a month and a day.\n  The Senator did ask unanimous consent. Of course, unanimous consent \nnever clears here. There is always an objection to unanimous consent to \nmove to something. Then the question would be, Why couldn't he just \nmake a motion? The answer is: You can not move to it because we have a \nblocking motion that has been here for a month and a day.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I thank the Senator for \npointing that out. I am as guilty as anyone--we get wrapped up in the \nlanguage of the Senate, the language of legislation. I did not realize \nuntil now the Senator is making the point that the average person out \nthere, maybe listening to what I said about the fact that we have not \nbrought up or voted on a Patients' Bill of Rights or prescription drugs \nor Medicare or an increase in the minimum wage--we haven't brought any \nof those up--might say: Why don't you bring them up? The Senator has \npointed it out--we cannot because we are blocked.\n\n  Again I ask the Senator, to again clarify this one more time. This \nmotion to proceed that has been here for a month and a day--is it the \nobservation of the Senator that nothing has been done to move to that? \nWe have not gone to that bill. It has just been sitting there. Does the \nSenator see any move on that side to go to S. 2557, whatever it is?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would say after a month now it is quite clear this \nmotion to proceed is simply an effort to block the opportunity of \nothers to offer amendments. People have a right to do\n\n[[Page S10886]]\n\nthat in the Senate. But they should understand, as I said last week to \nsome colleagues who were on the floor, one can chaff quite a bit at \nthat kind of treatment because it means the passions that brought a \nnumber of them to the Senate to do certain things, come here and use \nall the energy you have to advance good public policy--those passions \ncannot exist in a circumstance where you are not able to offer motions \neven to pursue the kinds of things you think this country needs to be \ndoing.\n  We just saw the chart of the Senator. Some of them said we should \nprobably increase the minimum wage a bit at the bottom. We have 3 \nmillion workers working a full 40-hour week trying to raise the family \non the minimum wage. They are at the bottom of the economic ladder. \nThis Congress was real quick to say the folks at the top of the ladder, \nwe need to give them a huge tax cut but not quite so quick to say let's \nhelp those at the bottom of the ladder.\n  Some might say we had a vote on that. Yes, we had a vote on that a \nlong time ago. Maybe we ought to have another vote and see whether \nthere is now the will to proceed for some modest increase in the \nminimum wage. Can we have that vote? No, you cannot offer that nor can \nI. I offer that as an example.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield, I was at a town meeting last \nweek and had an interesting question posed to me by a man in the \naudience. He said, why don't you people there work more closely \ntogether? Why don't you get along a little bit better? Why is there all \nthis bickering? Why can't you just work these things out?\n  I thought about that. I responded to him and said, we would love to \ndo that but in the legislative process, the way you work things out is, \nI have my position; you have your position. What we do is we send the \nbills to the committee; we bring them on the floor; we debate them--\nfull, open, public debate. We may offer amendments. Maybe I want to \nchange it a little bit, maybe you want to change it a little bit. Then \nwhen that is all done, you vote and you let the chips fall where they \nwill.\n  That is the legislative process. That is what the people of this \ncountry deserve. I said to him: The way the rules are set up now in the \nSenate, I do not get to debate or vote or offer amendments that I think \nmight improve a bill as I might want to improve it. I might lose, but \nthat is all right. At least I have made my case. At least we have had a \nvote. At least my constituents will know where I stand and what I want \nto do. I may not succeed, but at least I made my case.\n  The way the situation is on the Senate floor today, I cannot make \nthat case. I cannot tell my constituents I have fought the fight for \nthem because I have been blocked by the rules of the Senate. I say to \nmy friend from North Dakota, it is grossly unfair. It is unfair to the \npeople of this country to have this kind of blockage where we cannot \noffer amendments, debate, vote up or down, and move on with the \nbusiness of this country.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will make one additional comment. A \nPatients' Bill of Rights is an awfully good example of where we are at \nthe moment. A bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights passed the House of \nRepresentatives which does what ought to be done: It gives patients \nprotections against some of the practices of HMOs that allow \naccountants to practice medicine rather than have the doctor and \npatient decide what is best. The fact is, there has been a change in \nthe Senate. The House passed a bipartisan bill, a good bill, and the \nSenate passed a watered down bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator seeks 3 additional minutes. Is \nthere objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. A bipartisan bill passed the House. The Senate did not \npass a bipartisan bill. It was a shell of a bill. Things have changed \nin the Senate, so if we had another vote on it, we would prevail. One \nSenator is gone; a new one is here. We would have a 50-50 tie. The Vice \nPresident would break the tie, and the Senate would pass the Patients' \nBill of Rights. We are unable to get to the vote despite the fact, in \nmy judgment, a majority of the Senate would now support a real \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We would then be in conference with the House \nhaving passed one. We would pass one, and the American people would \nhave a real Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is right.\n  Mr. DORGAN. One other issue. I asked the majority leader a question \nabout how the tax issues will come to the floor. It looks to me as if a \nmenu of tax issues will come to this floor in the last hours put in a \nsmall business authorization bill. I believe the House has actually \nadded other conferees to that conference who are not part of the Small \nBusiness Committee.\n  A small business authorization bill will now be the carrier for all \nkinds of tax provisions in a conference report, and no Member of the \nSenate who cares about taxes and wants to have a role in that, perhaps \noffer an amendment, or have some discussion about what ought to be in \nor out, no Member of the Senate is going to have that opportunity. It \nis done in a conference by a few people in a bill that is totally \nunrelated.\n  It will come in a conference report, and the result is none of us \nwill have the opportunity to do much about it. The majority leader is a \nfriend. I talked with him one day and said running this place is \nsimilar to that commercial on television where those leather-faced \ncowboys wearing chaps and buckskin vests, riding those big old horses, \nare herding cats, trying to run cats through the sagebrush, talking \nabout what a tough job that is. I understand that. Running the House \nand the Senate probably is not much different.\n  I do believe at some point we have to be in a situation in the Senate \nwhere we use the rules to allow everyone to have their day and everyone \nto have their say, and at the end of the day we vote. If you lose, you \nlose, but you need the opportunity to have the votes so the Senate can \nexpress its will on a series of important issues.\n  Frankly, this blocking motion that has existed now for a month and a \nday that prevents the Senator from Iowa, me, or anyone else from \noffering, for example, the Patients' Bill of Rights on which we would \nnow prevail, is what stands between the American people and a good \nPatients' Bill of Rights. The result is that men, women, and children \nwill discover when they go to a doctor's office they will be told: Yes, \nyou now have to fight your cancer, but you also have to fight your HMO \nto get payment for the treatment that you need from your oncologist.\n  That is happening all too often. The legislation we aspire to pass \nevens up the score a bit. It says patients have rights and those rights \ncannot be abridged or abused. We can pass that in the Senate if someone \nwill take that blocking motion off, and we will get one more vote on a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. This vote will be 51 for, with the Vice \nPresident voting for, and 50 against.\n  I say to those who have this blocking motion, give us the opportunity \nthis afternoon or tomorrow or Wednesday, and we will pass it and go to \nconference. It will take an hour in conference to resolve the House and \nSenate bills, and the American people will have a Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/23/senate-section/article/S10886-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10886-S10887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WORK OF THE 106TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, time has been reserved for two or three \nother Senators. We are checking to see if they are going to make it \nthis afternoon.\n  While we are waiting on that, I do want to put in the Record a report \nof some of the things that have happened in the Senate.\n  There are those who are complaining that the Senate has not been \ndoing its business. In fact, I have about four pages of legislation \nthat has been passed over the past 2 years, but I want to read the list \nof things that have passed since Labor Day alone. I am not going to \nread them all. When the assertion is made the Senate has not been doing \nserious work, this belies that and\n\n[[Page S10887]]\n\nmakes it clear we have been doing very important and serious work.\n  For instance, we have already repealed the telephone excise tax, a \ntax that was put on temporarily to help pay for the Spanish-American \nWar. That was a part of one of the bills we passed a week or so ago. \nThat has been repealed.\n  We passed the Safe Drug Reimportation Act as part of one of the bills \nthat passed last week.\n  We passed permanent normal trade relations with China, legislation I \nam sure most people would describe as important trade legislation, \nwhether they disagreed or agreed with it.\n  We passed the H-1B visa bill which certainly has a very important \neffect on small businesses and high-tech industries in the United \nStates, as well as other bills related to children's health, breast and \ncervical cancer prevention, rural schools and community self-\ndetermination, and Aimee's law wherein a State can require or use law \nenforcement funds in relation to the release of a convict who commits a \ncrime in another State. That information can be provided to the other \nState.\n  The Violence Against Women Act was passed; victims of terrorism \nlegislation; the Water Resources Development Act, including the very \nimportant Everglades provisions. We passed portions of the conservation \nbill called CARA, and perhaps even more of it will pass before we \nleave. We passed the intelligence authorization bill; the NASA \nauthorization bill; and the Department of Defense authorization bill \njust last week, very important legislation for the future of our \nmilitary men and women, not only in terms of their readiness and \nmodernization of their equipment, but also a pay raise of 4.8 percent \nfor our military men and women, and the strongest health care package \nfor our military men and women, their families, and our retirees in the \nhistory of the country.\n  In addition, we have passed seven appropriations conference bills. \nThere have been questions about the tax bill. I do not think there is \nany big secret about it. All you have to do is look at bills that have \npassed the House or the Senate or the Finance Committee, and you will \nsee that there is the community renewal legislation, which has the \nsupport of the President, the Speaker of the House, and a number of \nSenators. There has been an expectation that it would be done in some \nform before we leave; the very important improvements in pensions and \nIRAs, as well as 401(k)s, so that a greater amount can be put into \nthese IRAs and 401(k)s.\n  Then, since we have not been able to overcome objections from some of \nthe Senators--I think Senator Wellstone, Senator Kennedy, and maybe \nothers--the small business tax relief package, which is attached to the \nminimum wage, would be something that we want to get done before we \nleave here.\n  Finally--certainly not least--I have tried to move, several times, \nthe Foreign Sales Corporation legislation reported overwhelmingly by \nthe Finance Committee--very important for our ability to do business in \nthe trade area with Europe. We have not been able to clear it from an \nobjection.\n  So the expectation is that several of these bills that have broad \nbipartisan support would be joined together and passed before we leave \nat the end of the session. So I want the Record to reflect a portion of \nwhat has been done since Labor Day--not exactly an inactive period of \ntime.\n  Mr. President, so that this will be made a part of the Record, I ask \nunanimous consent that my entire list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Legislation Cleared by Congress, Signed Into Law or Enroute to \n               President's Signature Just Since Labor Day\n\n       Telephone Excise Tax Repeal (to fund Spanish-American War).\n       Safe Drug Re-Importation Act.\n       Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China.\n       H1-B Visas.\n       Children's Health Act.\n       Breast & Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act.\n       Internet Alcohol.\n       TREAD bill.\n       Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act.\n       Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act.\n       Intercountry Adoption Act.\n       Aimee's Law (state can lose law enforcement funds if \n     release convict early who commits crime in another state).\n       Violence Against Women Act.\n       Sex Trafficking.\n       Victims of Terrorism.\n       Water Resources Development Act (including the Everglades).\n       CARA provisions of Interior.\n       Wildland Fire Management (part of Interior).\n       Intelligence Authorization.\n       NASA Authorization.\n       DOD Authorization (including help for workers at nuclear \n     plants like Paducah, KY).\n       Appropriations: Interior Conference Report; Transportation \n     Conference Report; Energy & Water Conference Report Post-Veto \n     Bill; Treasury/Postal Conference Report; Legislative Branch \n     Conference Report; VA/HUD Senate Bill (may face conference \n     with House).\n       3 Continuing resolutions.\n\n\n                        Final Week Expectations\n\n       Restoration of payments to medicare providers so seniors--\n     especially in rural areas--will continue to have a choice of \n     medicare plans.\n       Appropriations remaining: Agriculture Conference Report; DC \n     Conference Report; Labor/HHS; Foreign Operations; Commerce/\n     State/Justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/23/senate-section/article/S10887-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10887-S10888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WRECK OF THE EDMUND FITZGERALD\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on the morning of November 11, \n1975, the Mariners' Church of Detroit sat empty save for its Reverend, \nRichard Ingalls, who prayed alone in the sanctuary, ringing the church \nbell 29 times as he did so. Rev. Ingalls rang the bell in tribute to \nthe crew of the Edmund Fitzgerald, who had lost their lives the \nprevious evening when the legendary ship sank during one of the \nfiercest storms Lake Superior has ever produced. November 10, 2000, \nmarks the 25th Anniversary of this tragic event, and I rise today not \nonly in recognition of this anniversary, but also in memory and in \nhonor of those 29 brave men, as well as the thousands of other mariners \nwho have lost their lives on the Great Lakes.\n  Mr. President, few states have as rich or as successful a maritime \ntradition as does the State of Michigan. Michiganians initiated the \niron ore trade 150 years ago, and men and women of the State continue \nto be leaders in Great Lakes trade. Virtually every region in the \nNation benefits from this shipping. More than 70 percent of the \nNation's steelmaking capacity is located in the Great Lakes basin. Coal \nfrom as far away as Montana and Wyoming moves across the Lakes on a \ndaily basis. This year alone, ships bearing the United States flag will \nhaul more than 125 million tons of cargo across the Great Lakes.\n  Amidst this success, it is unfortunately all too easy to overlook the \ntragic losses that have occurred throughout the maritime history of the \nGreat Lakes. Over 6,000 shipwrecks have occurred on the Great Lakes, \nand over 30,000 lives have been lost. Many of these shipwrecks have \noccurred in November, the Month of Storms on the Great Lakes. In \nNovember of 1913, 12 ships were lost and 254 people killed during the \nGreat Storm. In November of 1958, 33 men died when the Carl D. Bradley \nsank on Lake Michigan. And in November of 1966, the Daniel J. Morrell \nsank in Lake Huron, killing 28 members of her crew.\n  The wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, though, remains the most \nremembered tragedy in Great Lakes maritime lore. Built in River Rouge, \nMichigan in 1957 and 1958, the Edmund Fitzgerald, at 729 feet long, was \nthe largest ship on the Great Lakes until 1971. She was nicknamed ``The \nPride of the American Side,'' and was the first ship to carry one \nmillion tons of ore through the Soo Locks in one year. The Edmund \nFitzgerald also set the record for a single trip tonnage, carrying over \n27 tons of ore on one excursion. Unfortunately, the ship is best \nremembered for what happened to her on the night of November 10, 1975.\n  This is in part because it remains unclear precisely what forces \ncaused the Edmund Fitzgerald to sink that evening. The boat departed \nfrom Superior, Wisconsin, headed for Detroit, on the afternoon of \nNovember 9th, and was joined shortly thereafter by the Arthur M. \nAnderson. The two boats quickly ran into wicked seas, and Captain \nMcSorley of the Edmund Fitzgerald and Captain Cooper of the Arthur M. \nAnderson agreed to take the northerly\n\n[[Page S10888]]\n\ncourse, where they would be protected by the highlands of the Canadian \nshore, across Lake Superior.\n  By the morning of November 10th, gale warnings had been increased to \nstorm warnings, and by early evening the two boats were facing 25-30 \nfoot waves, brought about by nearly 100 mile per hour winds. The Edmund \nFitzgerald experienced difficulties throughout the day, and in a \ncommunication with Cpt. Cooper, Cpt. McSorley reported that he had ``a \nfence rail down, two vents lost or damaged, and a list.'' The two \ncaptains agreed to seek protection and safety in Whitefish Bay, located \njust off the coast of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. At 7:10 p.m., as the \nships neared Whitefish Point, Cpt. McSorley, in a conversation with \nCpt. Cooper, said this of he and his crew: ``We are holding our own.'' \nApproximately five minutes later, for reasons still unknown, the Edmund \nFitzgerald, without so much as a cry for help, sank to the floor of \nLake Superior. She remains there today, 535 feet below the surface of \nthe great lake, and only 17 miles from the relative safety of Whitefish \nPoint.\n  Mr. President, proper closure does not exist in a situation like that \nof the wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. The event lingers on not only in \nthe memories of the families of crew members but in the memories of all \nMichiganians. In recognition of the 25th Anniversary of the sinking, \nthe Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum at Whitefish Point will hold a \nceremony during which the ship's original bell, recovered on July 4, \n1995, will be rung 29 times for each member of her crew, and a 30th \ntime for the many other men and women who have lost their lives on the \nGreat Lakes. And, on November 12, 2000, for the 25th time, the Rev. \nIngalls will ring the bell of the Mariners' Church of Detroit in \ntribute to the men of the Edmund Fitzgerald.\n  What this clearly illustrates, Mr. President, is that the spirit of \nthese men still lives on in Michiganians, and particularly in those \ninvolved in the maritime industry. Perhaps, then, in a situation where \nclosure is so difficult to find, recognition, at least to some degree, \ncan be an adequate substitute. To know that the lives of these men have \nnot been forgotten but are still cherished, lives unfortunately cut \nshort but with spirits that remain, spirits that continue to live on in \nall of our lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/23/senate-section/article/S10888-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE MIDGARDEN FAMILY\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I pay tribute today to a North \nDakota family whose heritage not only spans the history of our state--\nand then some--but which also exemplifies the spirit of rural life and \nall that it contributes to our Nation.\n  Nils and Inger Midgarden started their family as homesteaders in \nNorth Dakota in 1874. That was 15 years before North Dakota become a \nstate. They raised seven children, built a successful family farm, and \njust like thousands of other North Dakotans at that time, did the hard \nwork that carved hardy communities and, eventually, a state from the \nprairie.\n  I have a letter I would like to share with my colleagues, written by \none of Nils and Inger's great-grandchildren. It tells us a great deal \nabout the founders of this family. It says:\n\n       Nils was a successful farmer and his sons greatly expanded \n     the farming operation. When his children married, they built \n     farms within sight of the homestead. Each one of those farms \n     are today owned and occupied by the grandchildren and great-\n     grandchildren of Nils and Inger Midgarden.\n\n  Let me tell you, that's quite an accomplishment. As anyone who knows \nmuch about it will tell you, farming is hard work. When you consider \nthat this family managed to survive everything from the Great \nDepression to droughts, floods and grasshoppers over the span of more \nthan a hundred years--while raising a family that has remained across \nthe generations a close knit one--you understand why their's is such a \nremarkable accomplishment.\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       The farm, while a potent symbol of the pioneer spirit my \n     great-grandparents embodied, is not the greatest legacy they \n     left behind, ``Nils' and Inger's great grandchild writes. \n     ``Nearly everyone who know me and my family remarks on our \n     closeness and old-fashioned values, characteristics fewer and \n     fewer families seem to share these days. What Nils and Inger \n     gave to their children--to us--was the gift of family. \n     Through bountiful harvests and times of drought, through \n     births, deaths, and marriages, joy and sorrow, the Midgardens \n     have always stood together. Older cousins taught younger ones \n     to swim, uncles pulled wayward nieces and nephews out of \n     snowy ditches, and Sundays brought the family together in \n     worship, meal, and play. Once during a tornado sighting, all \n     the Midgardens in Walsh County drove out to the homestead to \n     stand on the road, as if sheer will power and their bodies \n     alone would protect the place Nils and Inger made home.\n\n  Today, Midgardens still live on those family farms, and while not all \nfamily members remain on the farm, those who moved away to pursue other \nlivelihoods continue to draw on the basic strength that came from the \nfarm: they remain a close knit family, wherever they are, wherever they \ngo.\n  Those who moved away contribute to our state, regional and national \nlife in a variety of ways. They became veterinarians, lawyers, \nadvertising executives, architects, doctors, teachers, nurses, and even \ncongressional staffers.\n  Families like the Midgardens demonstrate the importance of preserving \nfamily farmers and the rural communities they make strong. through the \ngenerations, the Midgarden family makes clear what those of us who grew \nup and live in rural areas know so well: family farms produce much more \nthan the food that feeds this nation and much of the world. They also \nproduce strong, solid families.\n  In closing, I ask that a tribute to the Midgarden family, written by \nanother descendent of Nils and Inger for a family reunion earlier this \nyear, be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                               Our Legacy\n\n       The Laurel Wreath of Wheat is the symbol of two souls \n     entwined a symbol of victory and triumph; a symbol of Inger & \n     Nels. The Seedling in the center has seven leaves for seven \n     living children--now gone, but very much alive in us all.\n       Amund, with his quiet contemplation, peace and vision; \n     Alfred, with his forbearance and stoicism; Dewey, for his \n     sparkle skillfully hidden behind the stolid Midgarden work \n     ethic; Marion, for her elegance and grace; Gunder, for his \n     mercurial spirit and sense of humor; Joann, for her boundless \n     energy and endless creativity; and Chris--coming around the \n     corners of life on two wheels; radiating a zest for living, \n     affecting us all.\n       Inger & Nels and their seven children, eventually fourteen, \n     as each found his or her irreplaceable mate: Bessie, Beulah, \n     Clara, Olaf, Florence, Oscar and Evelyn, whose love and \n     courage and enduring presence we are still blessed with on \n     this day.\n       Fourteen children, seven couples, seven families forming \n     the foundation of this Midgarden Millennium Celebration, \n     counting over 200 family members gathered here today.\n       We remember the love, the closeness, the pioneer spirit, \n     the dedication of these parents, and their embracing of not \n     only their own--but us all.\n       Our memories are many and golden . . . oceans of flax \n     fields in spring; the scent of alfalfa in early summer the \n     heading of wheat in July; the way the grain felt on our skin \n     when we rode in the hopper at harvest; haying time and the \n     Tarzan ropes in Gunder's barn; burning fields in August; \n     oiled wood floors of the Fedje store tracing aisles of \n     supplies and stacks of wonder; the excitement of the first \n     day of school in a one room country school house or a little \n     brick school in Hoople.\n       Rows of potato sacks stretching endlessly on the autumn \n     horizon; anticipation and humor in the air; Lena Olinger \n     holding court in the cookcar; harvest tables and blue tin \n     mugs; excitement when it was our Mom's turn to take lunch to \n     the fields and we could tag along.\n       Then mercury dipping to unbelievable lows--but our spirits \n     high as the massive snowdrifts; Julebukken and Grandma's \n     Christmas Eve; Uncle Oscar dancing in with potato sacks full \n     of dime store treasures; then months of winter white only to \n     turn once again to Spring.\n       Seasons of our family--seasons of our lives. Those who \n     stayed here close to this earth, preserving the legacy of \n     this land; and those of us who spread our wings to the four \n     corners now span this wonderful family from coast to coast. \n     Seeking and finding our way; sharing memories with our \n     children and grandchildren; always knowing our roots are here \n     in this blessed place where it all began.\n       Inger and Nels, their incredible children and the indelible \n     people they found to marry . . . our parents, your \n     grandparents and great grandparents . . . and each and every \n     one of you share in this legacy of love and excellence.\n       And that is why there is a Laurel Wreath of Wheat with a \n     Seedling in the center. It is our beginnings, our present, \n     our future.\n       It is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/23/senate-section/article/S10889-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10889]]\n       HONORING KATIE KOCH-LAVEEN, MINNESOTA TEACHER OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the following speech was given \nrecently to honor the Minnesota Teacher of the Year. I believe it is \nimportant that my colleagues become aware of Ms. Koch-Laveen's \naccomplishment, and ask to print in the Record my comments to her as \nshe was honored for the information of my fellow Senators.\n  The speech follows:\n\n  October 18, 2000 Statement of Senator Rod Grams Honoring Minnesota \n Teacher of the Year, Katie Koch-Laveen, at Apple Valley High School, \n                        Apple Valley, Minnesota\n\n       I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to honor Ms. \n     Katherine Koch-Laveen as Minnesota's Teacher of the Year for \n     the year 2000. This is certainly a high honor, as I note that \n     98 Minnesota educators were nominated for this award, and \n     their accomplishments were reviewed by 18 judges. It is all \n     the more impressive considering Minnesota's public schools \n     reputation for academic excellence. I also commend the 98 \n     nominees for this honor, 28 of whom were chosen as ``teachers \n     of excellence,'' and 10 of whom were further chosen for an \n     ``honor roll'' of teachers. School teachers that excel at \n     their craft are critically important to the intellectual \n     development of their students, and help shape the student's \n     vision for what they can accomplish in their lives.\n       I still can vividly remember the excellent educators that \n     taught me at Zion Lutheran Christian Day School in Crown. \n     Excellent teachers motivate, show enthusiasm for inquiry, and \n     instill in their students a passion for learning that often \n     continues for a lifetime. A great educator gives the student \n     a core foundation of knowledge about a subject, and a \n     curiosity about the topic that drives a student to study and \n     research more extensively long after they have left that \n     particular class.\n       Great teachers also make sacrifices for their students. \n     It's no secret that in today's high-tech, knowledge-based \n     economy, Ms. Koch-Laveen could probably find a more \n     financially rewarding profession, especially with her science \n     background. And our great teachers need to be rewarded \n     financially, so that we do not lose too many to industry. But \n     ultimately, I have to believe that what keeps them in the \n     classroom is the intangible reward of seeing their students \n     excel, and having a group of students come in to a class with \n     little knowledge about a topic and have them leave with a \n     firm grasp of core concepts, a desire to learn much more, and \n     an excitement to apply what they have learned in ``real \n     world'' situations. And I hesitate to use the term ``real \n     world,'' because these days there is probably nothing more \n     real world than a high school classroom.\n       So congratulations and thank you, Ms. Koch-Laveen, for your \n     commitment to excellence and dedicated service to your \n     students, your community, and to Minnesota. Thanks also to \n     the other hardworking Apple Valley teachers here today that \n     strive for excellence in the classroom and shoulder so much \n     responsibility for Minnesota's future. It has been a pleasure \n     to be here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/23/senate-section/article/S10889-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10889-S10890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 1999, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 18, 2000, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker has signed the following enrolled bills and \njoint resolution:\n\n       S. 1455.

A bill to authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to provide for \nthe installation of pumps and removal of the Savage Rapids Dam on the \nRogue River in the State of Oregon, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   THE SAVAGE RAPIDS DAM ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Savage \nRapids Dam Act of 2000, which is cosponsored by my colleague Mr. Wyden. \nThis bill would authorize the Bureau of Reclamation to provide for the \ninstallation of pumps and removal of the Savage Rapids Dam on the Rogue \nRiver in the State of Oregon, and for other purposes.\n  Introduction of this bill follows months of negotiations between the \nGrants Pass Irrigation District, which owns the dam and has received \nwater from it since 1921, federal and state agencies, and other \nstakeholders in the Basin. Removal of the dam, following the \ninstallation of modern electric irrigation pumps, will resolve the \nongoing issues related to fish passage at the facility.\n  Early on, I made a commitment to help the District resolve the \ncontroversies surrounding the dam in a manner acceptable to the \nDistrict and its patrons, and in a way that left the District \neconomically viable. This bill achieves both those goals.\n  In December 1999, the board of directors of the Grants Pass \nIrrigation District adopted a resolution outlining the proposed \nsettlement of disputes relating to the dam. The patrons of the district \nsubsequently voted to adopt the settlement at the beginning of the \nyear. The settlement supports dam removal, but only following the \ninstallation of irrigation pumps. The proposed settlement had several \nother components that have been addressed in the crafting of this \nlegislation.\n  I realize that it is late in the 106th Congress to be introducing \nlegislation. However, I felt that this was the most effective way to \nfocus attention on this proposal. Despite our best efforts to \ncommunicate with all interested and affected parties, I believe \nintroduction of the bill at this time will enable us to gain valuable \nfeedback before the start of the next Congress. This will enable us to \nreintroduce the bill early next year.\n  I recognize that dam removal proposals can be controversial. This \nfacility, however, is not a large multi-purpose dam. It does not \ngenerate electricity, and provides no flood control. It does not affect \ncommercial navigation. There will be an impact on flat-water \nrecreational opportunities, so the bill directs the Secretary of the \nInterior to work with the State of Oregon and the counties of Josephine \nand Jackson to identify and implement recreation opportunities. The \nbill includes an authorization of 2.5 million dollars for the federal \nshare of these recreation facilities.\n  I look forward to working with the Grants Pass Irrigation District \nand the other stakeholders to bring resolution to the disputes that \nhave gone on for several years now. This is an opportunity to restore \nsalmon and maintain an agricultural way of life for the patrons of the \nDistrict.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/23/senate-section/article/S10892-4", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10892-S10893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1044\n\n  At the request of Mr. Helms, the name of the Senator from Kansas (Mr. \nBrownback) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1044, a bill to require \ncoverage for colorectal cancer screenings.\n\n\n                                S. 1563\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from Minnesota \n(Mr. Grams) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1563, a bill to establish \nthe Immigration Affairs Agency within the Department of Justice, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n[[Page S10893]]\n\n                                S. 2009\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wyden, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n(Ms. Landrieu) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2009, a bill to provide \nfor a rural education development initiative, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 3085\n\n  At the request of Mr. Jeffords, the name of the Senator from \nLouisiana (Ms. Landrieu) was added as a cosponsor of S. 3085, a bill to \nprovide assistance to mobilize and support United States communities in \ncarrying out youth development programs that assure that all youth have \naccess to programs and services that build the competencies and \ncharacter development needed to fully prepare the youth to become \nadults and effective citizens.\n\n\n                                S. 3089\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hagel, the names of the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Smith) and the Senator from Michigan (Mr. Levin) were \nadded as cosponsors of S. 3089, a bill to authorize the design and \nconstruction of a temporary education center at the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial\n\n\n                                S. 3181\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hagel, the names of the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Cleland), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the \nSenator from Michigan (Mr. Levin), and the Senator from Missouri (Mr. \nAshcroft) were added as cosponsors of S. 3181, a bill to establish the \nWhite House Commission on the National Moment of Remembrance, and for \nother purposes.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4301\n\n  At the request of Mr. Jeffords, the name of the Senator from Alabama \n(Mr. Sessions) was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 4301 intended \nto be proposed to H.R. 1102, a bill to provide for pension reform, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/23/senate-section/article/S10893-1", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 154--TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND SALUTE THE \n                    CONTRIBUTIONS OF COIN COLLECTORS\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Gorton, and Mrs. Feinstein) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                            S.

The legislation would establish \n     objectives for ICCVAM, including increasing the efficiency of \n     reviewing methods of animal testing across federal agencies, \n     and reducing reliance on animal testing. In addition, the \n     bill would direct the NIEHS to establish a Scientific \n     Advisory Committee to assist the ICCVAM in making \n     recommendations.\n       The bill also would require federal agencies to identify \n     and forward to ICCVAM their guidelines or regulations \n     requiring or recommending animal testing. The ICCVAM would \n     examine alternatives to traditional animal testing and \n     promote the use of those alternatives whenever possible. \n     Agencies would be required to adopt ICCVAM recommendations \n     unless such recommendations are inadequate or unsatisfactory.\n       Assuming the appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO \n     estimates that implementing S. 1495 would cost $1 million in \n     2001 and $9 million over the 2001-2005 period, assuming \n     annual adjustments for inflation for those activities without \n     specified authorization levels. The five-year total would be \n     $8 million if such inflation adjustments are not made. The \n     legislation would not affect direct spending or receipts; \n     therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply.\n       S. 1495 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector \n     mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA) and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of S. 1495 is shown in the following table. \n     The costs of this legislation fall within budget function 550 \n     (health).\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--\n                               -----------------------------------------\n                                 2000   2001   2002   2003   2004   2005\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\n \nSpending Under Current Law:\n  Estimated Authorization         445    445    464    473    483    493\n   Level \\1\\..................\n  Estimated Outlays...........    384    426    443    456    466    475\nProposed Changes \\2\\:\n  Estimated Authorization           0      2      2      2      2      2\n   Level......................\n  Estimated Outlays...........      0      1      2      2      2      2\nSpending Under S. 1495:\n  Estimated Authorization         445    457    466    475    485    495\n   Level......................\n  Estimated Outlays...........    384    427    445    458    468    477\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 2000 level is the amount appropriated for that year for the\n  agencies that would be affected by S. 1495. The 2001-2005 levels are\n  CBO baseline projections, including adjustments for anticipated\n  inflation.\n\\2\\ The amounts shown reflect adjustments for anticipated inflation.\n  Without such inflation adjustments, the five-year changes in\n  authorization levels would total $10 million (instead of $11 million)\n  and the changes in outlays would total $8 million (Instead of $9\n  million).\n\n       Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes that the \n     bill will be enacted early in fiscal year 2001 and that the \n     estimated amounts will be appropriated for each year. We also \n     assume that outlays will follow historical spending rates for \n     the NIEHS for the authorized activities. CBO based its \n     estimates on amounts spent in the past for similar types of \n     activities.\n       In addition to making the ICCVAM a standing committee, the \n     bill would require federal agencies to identify and forward \n     to ICCVAM their guidelines or regulations requiring or \n     recommending animal testing. Agencies would be required to \n     adopt ICCVAM recommendations unless such recommendations are \n     inadequate or unsatisfactory. The agencies that would most \n     likely be affected by this provision include the Agency for \n     Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, the Department of \n     Agriculture, the Department of Defense, the Department of \n     Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and \n     Drug Administration, various institutes within the National \n     Institutes of Health, and any other agency that develops or \n     employs tests or test data using animals or regulates the use \n     of animals in toxicity testing. Based on information from the \n     NIH, it appears that most agencies currently comply with the \n     findings of the ICCVAM on evaluations of research methods. \n     Thus, CBO estimates that the provision would not have a \n     significant impact on federal spending.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: None.\n       Intergovernmental and private-sector impact: S. 1495 \n     contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\n     UMRA and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or \n     tribal governments.\n       Previous CBO estimate: On October 13, 2000, CBO transmitted \n     a cost estimate for H.R. 4281, an identical bill that was \n     ordered reported by the House Committee on Commerce on \n     October 5, 2000.

Mr. President, one of the more glaring disappointments of \nthe 106th Congress has been the recent rejection by the House of \nRepresentatives of comprehensive pipeline safety legislation. This \nlegislation, S. 2438, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000, \npassed the Senate unanimously on September 7, 2000. It is the result of \nmonths of an extraordinary bipartisan effort by Senators John McCain, \nPatty Murray, Slade Gorton, Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici. \nSignificant contributions to the legislation were also made by Senators \nJohn Breaux, Fritz Hollings, Sam Brownback, Ron Wyden, John Kerry, Kay \nBailey Hutchison and Byron Dorgan.\n  I also feel some ownership of this effort. I serve on the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, which prepared the \nbill for the Senate's consideration, and my home state of Mississippi \nhosts many, many miles of pipelines. These issues are important to me.\n  Mr. President, S. 2438 is an excellent bill. It is probably the most \nsignificant rewrite of our pipeline safety laws in more than a decade. \nIt is a tough bill. It comes on the heels of horrific accidents in \nBellingham, Washington, Carlsbad, New Mexico, and in locations in \nTexas, that resulted in the deaths of a total of 17 people. The authors \nof this bill were determined to put the necessary specific requirements \ninto the pipeline safety statutes that would prevent these kinds of \naccidents from happening in the future. They were successful. The bill \nrepresents a watershed change in the types of requirements on pipeline \noperators for inspection, pipeline facility monitoring and testing, \nemployee training, disclosure of information, enforcement, research and \ndevelopment, management and accountability. It is as comprehensive, \ntough, and complete as to be expected of a bill that emerged from a \nthorough process of hearings, both here and in the field, data \ngathering, and working with the Administration, states and local \ngroups. It is the kind of legislative work product to be expected from \nthe experience, independence and determination of the Senators who \nworked on S. 2438. The pipeline industry had no choice but to submit to \nthis legislation. Ultimately it received the affirmative vote of more \nthan three-fourths of the Congress--all of the Senate and just under \ntwo-thirds of the House. It received the written praise of the \nSecretary of Transportation and the Vice President of the United \nStates.\n  However, this comprehensive bill was opposed bitterly by a minority \nof the House, a minority who was still of sufficient number to prevent \nthe bill's passage by the House under suspension of the rules. The \nAdministration did not lift a finger to help pass the bill in the \nHouse. The motivation of this opposition may have been to prevent \nenactment of good legislation so the 106th can be called a ``do \nnothing'' Congress. It may have been aimed at keeping an issue \nunresolved so it can be exploited in the future. There may have been \nother motivations. Whatever the motivations were, admirable or not so \nadmirable, the result is another form of tragedy--there will be more \naccidents resulting in more deaths because thus far the 106th Congress \nhas been prevented from implementing this improvement of public safety.\n  Mr. President, there is no question that this bill would make much \nneeded improvements in pipeline safety. The Administration and the \npipeline industry could have begun work on these improvements--and \ncould still if the bill were yet to pass in the waning days of the \n106th Congress. But if, on the other hand and as is likely, this \nminority in the House gets its wish, and the bill does not pass, these \nsafety improvements will not be made. They will not be made until that \ntime in the future when we have returned to this issue and overcome \nthis minority's opposition.\n  In the meantime there will be pipeline accidents. I would not want to \nbe the one to have to explain to the victims of such an accident that I \nsacrificed the protections of this good bill so that a future Congress \ncould enact protections too late. I say shame on those in the House and \nin the Administration who are letting these protections die.\n  Mr. President, the protections of S. 2438 should be put in place now. \nIf additional protections are shown to be needed, they should be added \nby the next Congress. Senator McCain and his coalition in the Senate \nhave pledged to continue their good work on pipeline safety in the \nfuture. However, Congress should not adjourn empty-handed. To do so \nwith such an excellent bill in our hands now makes no sense.\n  The most powerful source of cynicism about government is the \nsuspicion by our citizen's that politicians put political advantage \nabove doing the work of the public. In looking at the House minority's \nactions on pipeline safety, I find much justification for that \ncynicism.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/10/23/senate-section/article/S10894-2", "month": "10", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RECESS UNTIL 3 P.M.
