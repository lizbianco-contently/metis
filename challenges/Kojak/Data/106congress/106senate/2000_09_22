Mr. President, one thing behind the growth of the \nAmerican economy is our educational system. There is good news and bad \nnews about our educational system today.\n  In a climate that currently seems filled with more dissent than \naccord, I think we can at least agree that elected officials on both \nsides of the aisle are in lockstep with the American people on the \nimportance of education: It is a priority so critical that it should be \nat the top of our national agenda. This is a view very similar to the \nopinion held by President Lincoln almost 150 years ago. ``Upon the \nsubject of education,'' Lincoln said, ``not presuming to dictate any \nplan or system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most \nimportant subject which we, as a people, can be engaged in.''\n  Education's priority having been espoused by both sides during this \nCongress, it is profoundly disappointing that S. 2, the critically \nimportant legislation to reauthorize the landmark Elementary and \nEducation Act, appears to be dead for this year. What a shame. It is \napparent from the earlier floor debate on S. 2 that agreement breaks \ndown on the condition of America's educational system today and on the \ncourse we should pursue to improve our schools.\n  Seventeen years ago our country was rocked by the publication of ``A \nNation at Risk.'' The findings were devastating: Our educational system \nwas\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\nbeing ``eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our future \nas a nation and a people.''\n  That landmark report went on to say that if ``an unfriendly foreign \npower'' had tried to impose on America our ``mediocre educational \nperformance,'' we might well have viewed it ``as an act of war.''\n  I have listened to some of my colleagues maintain that nothing has \nchanged in the last 17 years--that American education continues on a \ndownward spiral. They claim that the federal government's role in \neducation is a source of national shame. Barring a radical change in \ncourse, they say, America's report card will continue to be a document \nof failure.\n  Mr. President, I agree that there is compelling need for improvement. \nIn fact, if you ask the companies in the high-tech world in my State \nand around America, they know that some 300,000 to 400,000 high-tech \njobs out there in this economy today are going begging for want of \neducated and talented people.\n  Every day in America almost 2,800 high school students drop out. This \nis not acceptable. Each school year, more than 45,000 under-prepared \nteachers, teachers who have not even been trained in the subjects they \nare teaching, enter the classroom. Who here among us believes this to \nbe acceptable? Here in America fourteen million children attend schools \nin need of extensive repair or replacement. Who in this body would \nargue that we have to do better? As a nation we have witnessed school \nshootings--classroom tragedies which were unheard of 20 years ago. Who \nhere would not do everything in their power to restore safety and \nsanity to America's schools?\n  But, Mr. President, I would argue that this is only part of the \npicture. ``A Nation at Risk'' was a wake-up call. Educators, parents, \nbusinesses, community leaders, and officials at all levels of \ngovernment responded. Yes, serious problems still exist, but so do \nsuccess stories. America's dropout rate is down--from 14 percent in \n1982 to single digits today, including in many of our toughest \nneighborhoods. In my own State of Georgia, over 70 percent of high \nschool students now graduate, a marked improvement over the 52 percent \ngraduation rate in 1980. In 1950, only 5 percent of Georgians held \ncollege degrees. Now over one in five--22 percent--do.\n\n  And there's more good news. Nationally SAT and Advanced Placement \ntest scores are up. Performance on the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress, NAEP, has increased, particularly in the key \nsubjects of reading, mathematics, and science--with African American \nand Hispanic students making significant gains in both math and \nscience.\n  Just consider: From 1994 to 1998, average reading scores increased at \nall three grades tested (4, 8, and 12). The average math score is at \nits highest level in 26 years. And let us not forget that this progress \nis happening during a time when many states and school districts are \nraising standards and putting in place tough graduation requirements. \nThis progress is happening during a time when U.S. students are taking \nmore rigorous courses than ever. By 1994, 52 percent of high school \ngraduates had taken the core subjects recommended by ``A Nation at \nRisk,'' almost quadruple the 1982 number.\n  To those who over the last 20 years have uttered doomsday predictions \nabout our failing schools, let me say that parents in this country, in \noverwhelming numbers, continue to send their children to public \nschools. In fact, ninety percent of children in the K-12 age group \nattend public schools. That's nine out of every ten children in this \ncountry. When America's school bell rang this September, over 53 \nmillion students returned to class, a record school enrollment. What's \nmore, surveys show that most parents think their own child's public \nschool is doing a pretty good job. It's other people's schools they \nfear are failing.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``Get your facts first, and then you can \ndistort them as much as you please.'' The facts, I believe, bear out \nthat we have made progress since the publication of ``A Nation at \nRisk.'' The facts also bear out that many of our education challenges \ncontinue to go unmet. In a survey on education issues conducted this \npast March, Americans were asked to list the major problems facing our \npublic schools today. ``Lack of parental involvement'' topped the list, \nfollowed closely by ``undisciplined students.'' The majority of \nrespondents also cited ``lack of retention of good teachers,'' \n``overcrowded classrooms,'' ``lack of academic standards for promotion/\ngraduation,'' ``lack of teachers qualified to teach in their subject \narea,'' and ``outdated schools'' as issues meriting our nation's \nattention.\n  It all boils down to this central issue: Do we stay the course or do \nwe reshape, dramatically, the federal government's role in education? I \nbelieve strongly that we should increase our federal investment in \npublic schools, for surely the education of America's children is a \nvital national interest. I also believe that we should continue to work \nwith the states and local school districts--who are now and who should \nand will remain the major education decision-makers in this country--to \nensure that those federal dollars are spent on initiatives that aim to \nfix the specific problems in our schools which are causing the American \npeople so much concern.\n  We need to be willing to invest the nation's dollars into improving \nthe recruitment, retention, and professional development of our \nnation's teachers. What teachers know and can do is the single most \nimportant influence on what students learn, according to the National \nCommission for Teaching and America's Future Teachers.\n  In the American educational system, it falls to our States and local \ncommunities to set high educational standards and provide quality \neducation so that all children can achieve to standards of excellence. \nWhile the federal government's precise role in education is open to \ndebate, I believe it is unquestionably in our national interest for \nfederal officials to work in cooperation with States and localities to \npromote educational excellence and to encourage standards-based reform.\n  We should work to ensure that parents have information on teacher \nqualifications and achievement levels at their child's school. One \nimportant way to improve our schools is to enable parents to hold \nschools accountable for progress and to give them choices they can \nexercise if progress does not occur.\n  Research has shown that class size directly relates to the quality of \neducation. Students in smaller classes consistently outperform students \nin larger classes on tests, are more likely to graduate on time, stay \nin school, enroll in honors classes, and graduate in the top ten \npercent of their class. We need to help local school districts recruit, \nhire and train 100,000 qualified teachers to reduce class sizes in the \nearly grades. It is an investment in reducing teacher turnover and in \nimproving student performance.\n  Research also links student achievement and conduct to the condition \nof their schools. Yet fourteen million children in the U.S. attend \nschools in need of extensive repair or replacement. In my own State of \nGeorgia, nearly two-thirds of our schools--62 percent--report a need to \nupgrade or repair their buildings. We need to help local communities \nfrom Savannah to San Antonio to Seattle rebuild, modernize and reduce \novercrowding in more than 6,000 of America's public schools.\n  There is consensus in every borough, town and city throughout this \ncountry that bloodshed in our schools cannot and will not be tolerated. \nYet every day five million children are left to care for themselves in \nthe hours before and after school. We know that these are the very \nhours that children are most likely to participate in risky behavior. \nIn fact, almost half of all violent juvenile crime takes place between \nthe hours of 3 and 8 p.m. We need to help our communities reduce \njuvenile crime by investing more dollars in after-school care. We need \nto expand the popular 21st Century Learning Centers Program to ensure \nthat 1 million children each year--up from the current 190,000--will \nhave access to safe and constructive after-school tutoring, recreation, \nand academic enrichment.\n  Mr. President, I maintain that there is no more powerful--and \nempowering--force in the universe than education. ``On education all \nour lives depend,'' said Benjamin Franklin. And Christa McAuliffe, \nselected to be the first schoolteacher to travel in space, described \nsimply but poetically the\n\n[[Page S9019]]\n\nawesome potential of her vocation: ``I touch the future,'' she said. \n``I teach.'' While we may bring to the debate on education differing \nviews, it is my hope that we ultimately remember this is a profoundly \nimportant issue which should be above politics and ideology. It is all \nabout the future of this country--and the future, after all, is in very \nsmall hands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor to speak about \nthe importance of reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act before \nSeptember 30. Since enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in \n1994, the number of forcible rapes of women have declined, and the \nnumber of sexual assaults nationwide have gone down as well.\n  Despite the success of the Violence Against Women, Act, domestic \nabuse and violence against women continue to plague our communities. \nConsider the fact that a woman is raped every five minutes in this \ncountry, and that nearly one in every three adult women experiences at \nleast one physical assault by a partner during adulthood. In fact, more \nwomen are injured by domestic violence each year than by automobile \naccidents and cancer deaths combined.\n  In South Dakota alone, approximately 15,000 victims of domestic \nviolence were provided assistance last year. Shelters, victims' service \nproviders, and counseling centers in my state rely heavily on VAWA \nfunds to provide assistance to these women and children. VAWA \nreauthorization assures that states and communities will continue to \nhave access to critical funds for domestic violence services. We must \nnot allow this opportunity to pass us by.\n  As you know, legislation to reauthorize VAWA has received broad, \nbipartisan support in both the House and Senate. I am pleased to join \n68 of my Senate colleagues in cosponsoring VAWA legislation that \nunanimously passed the Senate Judiciary Committee in June. Similar \nlegislation in the House has 233 bipartisan cosponsors and was also \napproved in June by the House Judiciary Committee.\n  Since the Violence Against Women Act became law, South Dakota \norganizations have received over $6.7 million in federal funding for \ndomestic abuse programs. In addition, the Violence Against Women Act \ndoubled prison time for repeat sex offenders; established mandatory \nrestitution to victims of violence against women; codified much of our \nexisting laws on rape; and strengthened interstate enforcement of \nviolent crimes against women.\n  The law also created a national toll-free hotline to provide women \nwith crisis intervention help, information about violence against \nwomen, and free referrals to local services. Last year, the hotline \ntook its 300,000th call. The number for women to call for help is: 1-\n800-799-SAFE.\n  In addition to reauthorizing the provisions of the original Violence \nAgainst Women Act, the legislation that I am supporting would improve \nour overall efforts to reduce violence against women by strengthening \nlaw enforcement's role in reducing violence against women. The \nlegislation also expands legal services and assistance to victims of \nviolence, while also addressing the effects of domestic violence on \nchildren. Finally, programs are funded to strengthen education and \ntraining to combat violence against women.\n  A woman from South Dakota recently wrote me about this issue, and I'd \nlike to share her story with you because I believe it makes the most \ncompelling case for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  The letter begins:\n\n       My story is that I was abused as a child, raped as a \n     teenager, and emotionally abused as a wife. I survived that, \n     but I almost didn't emotionally survive the last two and a \n     half years knowing that my grandchildren were being abused \n     and having my hands tied to be patient while our laws worked. \n     My son has been fighting for custody of his triplets.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       Their story is horrible. While in the custody of their \n     mother and her live-in boyfriend, they were battered, \n     bruised, emotionally and sexually assaulted.\n\n  She writes that one of her grandchildren got her ear cut off, another \nhad his head split open, and the third child's throat was slit.\n  Thankfully, the woman writes that her son finally got custody of her \ngrandchildren and removed them from the abusive environment.\n  The letter concludes:\n\n       This is my story, and at least it has a happy ending, but \n     there are hundreds of women and children out there still \n     living in danger. Please reauthorize the Violence Against \n     Women Act. Don't let another woman go through what I went \n     through, and please don't let another child go through what \n     my grandchildren have gone through. You can make a \n     difference.\n\n  Simply stated, reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act will \nprovide much needed resources to prevent domestic violence in our \ncountry. I appreciate that we have many worthwhile legislative \npriorities remaining to be decided, including a majority of \nappropriations bills that must be passed this year. However, I can \nthink of no better accomplishment for Congress than to reauthorize VAWA \nand help keep wives, daughters, sisters, and friends from becoming \nvictims of domestic violence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Am I recognized in morning business under a previous \norder?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9019-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9019-S9020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE REMAINING BUSINESS OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are nearing the end of the session of \nthe 106th Congress. I believe we have 13 appropriations bills that we \nare required to enact and required to be signed into law to provide \nfunding for all of the various things that are done in public policy \nand by our agencies of Government.\n  Out of the 13 appropriations bills, 2 of them have been signed into \nlaw by President Clinton. Now this process is broken. It is quite \nclear. We have come to the end stage of this session. Most of the \nappropriations bills are not yet completed. Most of the very difficult \nand complex issues are as of yet unresolved. I say to my colleagues \nthat all we have to do to resolve all of this is to vote--only vote.\n  I will give you an example of why this process is broken. I serve on \nthe agriculture appropriations subcommittee. We passed a bill in July \nthat appropriates money for agricultural functions. Now, the Senate \npassed its bill in mid to late July. The House passed its bill on July \n11. I am a conferee in a conference between the House and Senate. There \nhas never been a conference. We have never met. There have been no \ndiscussions, and no Senator or Congressman has been involved in any way \nto try to move this legislation forward. Why? I am not sure exactly the \nreason why. I suspect the reason why is that this issue--this \nAgriculture appropriations bill--has some very complicated and \ncontroversial matters involved in it and some don't want to vote on \nthem. So if you don't want to vote, don't call them up, don't have a \nconference. Just dig in your heels and stall. That is what happened.\n  One of the controversial issues on that bill--and it is appropriate \nthat it should be on that bill--is the question of whether this country \nshould allow the sale of food to certain countries with whom we have \neconomic sanctions. Our country has had a policy, believe it or not, of \nsaying we will use food as a weapon.\n  We don't like Saddam Hussein, so we impose economic sanctions against \nhim and his country. We impose economic sanctions against the country \nof Iraq. We impose sanctions against Iran. We impose sanctions against \nLibya, North Korea, and Cuba. Included in those economic sanctions are \nprovisions that say we will not allow the shipment of food or medicine \nto your country. That doesn't make any sense to me. We ought never use \nfood as a weapon. We ought never under any condition say that we will \nprevent the shipment of food to anywhere in the world. This is a policy \nthat takes aim at dictators whom we don't like, and it ends up hitting \nsick, hungry, and poor people. That makes no sense.\n  So the Senate passed my amendment that is now in conference. The \namendment says let us stop using food as a weapon; no more sanctions on \nfood\n\n[[Page S9020]]\n\nshipments anywhere in the world. That passed the Senate. It is in \nconference. We are not meeting in conference. Do you know why? Because \nsome in this Congress do not like that provision. They want to retain \nsanctions on food. They want to continue to use food as a weapon. They \nwant to prevent us shipping food, for example, to Cuba and other \ncountries. Because they don't have the votes to prevent it if we had a \nvote on it, they say let's not have a conference. So there is no \nconference.\n  We are now just days from the end of the session, and the Agriculture \nappropriations bill is not passed. It is in conference. There is no \nconference meeting and no House conferees appointed. So there are some \nwho think they will do what they did last year. The Senate passed that \nsame provision last year by 70 votes, and the conference got hijacked \nby House leaders. When we met, the Senate conferees said we insist on \nour provisions to stop using food as a weapon. At that moment, there \nwas an adjournment by the House conferees, and it never again met. Why? \nBecause the House conferees would have supported us, and the House \nleaders wouldn't let them do it. In order to prevent a vote, they \nadjourned the conference, and it never again met.\n  We come to the end of this session in total chaos in all of these \nbills because some want to prevent a vote. This is the center for \ndemocracy. The process of democracy is to vote, even if it is \ncontroversial--vote, and then count them, and the winning side wins.\n  That is what ought to happen here. This isn't rocket science.\n  I say to those putting this schedule together to remember the old \ndays. Did you get a tinker toy set or an erector set when you were a \nkid? You put it together piece by piece. That is the way this should \nwork.\n  There are 13 bills. There is a sequence by which you pass the bills, \nput them in conference, have votes, resolve the controversial issues, \nget them done, get them to the President, and meet the deadline.\n  But I fear what is going to happen in the next week or two is that \nthe same people who tried to hijack this process last year could do it \nagain this year. The losers will be the American public--the American \npeople and family farmers who rely on us to repeal this provision that \nsays let's continue to use food as a weapon.\n  It is immoral. It is wrong for our family farmers. It is immoral for \nour country, and a terrible thing for our family farmers. It hurts \nhungry, sick, and poor people around the world. We ought to stop it.\n  I will have more to say about that next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9020-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9020-S9023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we look ahead, aside from the wrench in \nthe crankcase here in Congress that prevents any kind of movement to \nget things done, one of the significant challenges for us both now and \nin the months ahead is this issue of energy. What is happening to \nenergy prices? What is happening to the supply of energy? I want to \ntalk for a minute about where we are.\n  Go back a year, or maybe a year and a half, and the price of oil was \n$10 a barrel. In fact, in North Dakota it was $6 to $7 a barrel. The \nprice of gasoline at the gas pumps was about 90 cents a gallon. The \nprice of natural gas was about $2 per million cubic feet.\n  Now, fast forward: What has happened is the OPEC countries have cut \ntheir production of oil. We have seen a circumstance in this country \nwhere the price of oil has spiked up on the spot market to $36 and $37 \na barrel. Gasoline is anywhere from $1.50 to $2 a gallon. Natural gas \nprices have more than doubled from $2 per mcf, and in some cases $5 to \n$5.50.\n  We have people frightened to death with the reports that home heating \nfuel costs are spiking way up. Those in my State and others--\nparticularly in the Northeast as they enter what could be a cold \nwinter--are trying to figure out how they, on limited incomes, will pay \nfor home heating fuel that is going to double, and in some cases triple \nin price. These are significant and serious issues. The question is, \nWhat do we do about it? What is causing all of this? And what can we do \nabout it? We start out by understanding that it is complicated. It is \nnot simple.\n  One of the first and most important aspects of understanding this is \nour country is far too dependent on foreign sources of energy. We are \nfar too dependent especially on the OPEC countries for our oil. When we \nhave to send people from our country to the OPEC countries to beg them \nto open the faucets and produce more, it has a significant impact on \nour economy and our future and our economic growth. We ought to \nunderstand that this makes us far to vulnerable. We need in the long \nterm to move away from that vulnerability.\n  Second, with respect to consumers, they ask the question: Not only is \nOPEC cutting back, but why? The answer to that is, yes; OPEC is cutting \nback. Why? Because it is in their interest and they can do so. But they \nare also asking: Is somebody profiteering at the gas pumps? They see \nmerger after merger in the energy industry. They see that British \nPetroleum and Amoco get married. They see Exxon and Mobil decide they \nare going to get hitched.\n  All of these big companies gather together, and then at a time when \nwe have an energy crisis, we have a circumstance where the largest 14 \noil companies show profits of over $10 billion in one quarter--up 112 \npercent--and those who drive to the gas pumps, those who are buying \nhome heating fuel, and those who are paying for natural gas prices are \nasking the question: Is somebody profiteering at my expense?\n  As I say, this is a complex issue. But all of these questions need to \nbe answered. The Federal Trade Commission has a current investigation \ngoing on. I hope they can wrap that up soon and tell the American \npeople what is happening with respect to prices.\n  The issue of supply and demand in energy is something I want to talk \nabout just for a moment. There has been a lot of discussion in the last \nfew weeks on this issue of energy. We have some people saying in the \nlast 6 to 8 years we have seen a decrease in production. That is \ncausing our problem. We have been talking about energy supplies. Let's \ntalk about the production of oil. Let's take a look at this line of \nproduction and what you see going back to about the late 1960s or \n1970s. There has been a continual and diminished production.\n  That has happened under Republican administrations and Democratic \nadministrations. That has happened under a series of administrations \nover many years. You see the line on the chart. There is no change in \nit at all. There is a systematic reduction in the production of energy.\n  With respect to the consumption of energy, we also see what has \nhappened. In the 1970s, we had this energy scare for a number of \nreasons. We had a very brief reduction. We had a significant \nconservation movement in this country to conserve energy. We had some \nbrief reductions. But the fact is, we have begun to trend upward once \nagain in a significant way. You will see that imports are continuing \nnow to increase once again, which makes us much more dependent on \nforeign source energy.\n\n  This is important to everybody. I am a Senator who represents the \nState of North Dakota. It is important to us. When the price of gas at \nthe pump spikes way up, or the price of diesel fuel begins to spike way \nup, this is what it means to a State such as North Dakota. We have \nfarmers who are heavy users of fuel in order to put the crop in and to \nget the crop off the field. Higher prices for fuel means real trouble \nespecially at a time when we have collapsed grain prices. It means \npeople living in North Dakota, or other State such as ours, who drive a \nlot just to get places, that we pay a much heavier burden than others \ndo. Do you know that North Dakotans drive almost twice as much per \nperson as New Yorkers just to get to a grocery store? Why? Because we \nare a very large State with a sparse population and you have to drive \nlong distances to get to places.\n  I have a friend in New York. They have relatives in New Jersey 50 \nmiles away. I am told they pack an emergency kit in the trunk, put \nblankets in the car, and plan for 6 months to take a little trip to see \ntheir relatives 50 miles away. I don't know if that is true. But on the \neast coast, you don't travel as much. Populations are near. In North \nDakota and Montana and States like those, we have to travel a lot. \nTherefore, we pay twice as much\n\n[[Page S9021]]\n\nfor our energy and for our transportation needs.\n  There is a significant interest in what is happening. The consumption \nis going up. Our production has for 25 years been trending down, and \nimports are moving up.\n  Here is the consumption by sector on the chart: Transportation, \nindustrial, residential, and commercial. What we see is a significant \ntrend up in transportation.\n  It is interesting as we talk about all of these issues, one of the \nthings happening in the Congress is a consistent resistance in Congress \nto ask anybody to work on vehicles that are more efficient. We have had \nthese issues called CAFE standards, and I know it is very \ncontroversial. Does anybody think it is prudent for this country to \nresist trying to get more efficient automobiles? It makes sense to \nbegin to continue to apply pressure to say we need more efficiency in \nour vehicles. We can see what is happening in transportation \nconsumption of energy. Yet this Congress continues to demand we not try \nto establish some new goals with respect to fuel efficiency.\n  I have not been the biggest cheerleader on these issues because we \ndrive a lot of pickup trucks. We have to make accommodations for that \nin sparsely populated areas, but we ought to expect the auto industry \nand others to join in trying to move in a relentless way toward more \nefficient vehicles and toward trying to provide some balance in this \ntop line. More efficiency will result in less consumption on the \ntransportation side. That is one way to deal with this.\n  We need to respond to this issue, to respond on two sides of this \ncoin; one is production, and one is consumption. I will describe both \nquickly, especially in the context of the discussion of the last couple \nof days.\n  Vice President Gore says we ought to consider taking some oil out of \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. They call that the SPR. We have over \n500 million barrels of oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and Vice \nPresident Gore says we should take some out to provide stability in oil \nprices. Frankly, I have not been the biggest fan of moving to SPR \nanytime quickly. We have had this discussion before--8 or 9 months ago.\n  There is a circumstance today with the intransigence of the OPEC \ncountries in being unwilling to increase production sufficient to \nprovide some short-term balance in energy supply. We could, it seems to \nme, take half a million barrels a day out of SPR for 6 months, 9 \nmonths, 120 days, without dramatically diminishing the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, and at the same time contribute stability to \ninternational supply in a way that brings prices down and provides \npeople the ability to see over this hump.\n  When we get over the heaviest use of supply in this fourth quarter \nand get into the next year, we will see more production because $35 and \n$36 a barrel has moved all kinds of rigs into areas where we have not \nhad production before. A year and a half ago, we had zero production \nrigs drilling for oil in North Dakota; today, we have 20. I am told if \nthere were enough workers, we would probably have 30 rigs in North \nDakota. That is just a small amount compared to what is happening all \nover the world relative to today's oil prices.\n  My point is, what will provide some stability in the next 2, 3, 4 \nmonths? We have an economy that is a blessing. This has been the \nlongest sustained economic growth in this country's history. It doesn't \ntake much to tip an economy. We saw that in the early 1990s with some \nenergy price spikes. Now it seems to me we ought to engineer a serious \npublic discussion about the value of using, in a very cautious and \nconservative way, a portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve--only a \nvery small portion--to come in and provide a cushion for the daily \nneeds, as of yet unmet, that will provide some stability in energy \nprices. This will then provide, in my judgment, the opportunity to not \nhave to worry quite so much about having these price spikes in energy, \ntipping this economy out of balance and moving toward a slowdown and a \nrecession.\n  Vice President Gore talks about SPR. I say again, I have not been a \nbig cheerleader for saying let's run into tapping the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. Normally, the use of the SPR is for national \nsecurity interest reasons. We have barrels of oil put away for \nemergencies. Given the production that exists in OPEC, the amount we \nare short on a daily basis, and the production we expect to come in \naround the corner sometime beginning January of next year because of \nthe new rigs, it seems to me we can provide some filler with a small \namount of inventory from the SPR in a way that provides stability to \nthis market. In providing stability to the market, we will provide some \ninsurance for this economy. I think that would be very important.\n\n  We must, however, understand this is a wake-up call for our country. \nWe cannot allow this moment to pass without understanding we are far \ntoo dependent on foreign sources of energy. We need more production at \nhome, we need more conservation at home, and less dependence on foreign \nenergy.\n  In production in this country, I have favored some ability to use \nroyalties as well as the Tax Code to provide some stabilization of \nprices with respect to production. Ten dollars a barrel for oil was too \nlow; we all understood that. When oil went to $10 a barrel, nobody was \ndrilling anymore; $10 a barrel was too low. We need some price \nstability for that industry; I understand that.\n  Even as we work on price stability and to encourage greater \nproduction in this country, we also need to understand the issue of \nconservation is a critically important issue, because in this \nconsumption line we have to understand part of our balance is a \nproduction line that we need to get up, and the other part of our \nbalance is a consumption line that we need to trend down, if we can.\n  We face serious challenges. This is the moment for our country to \nstop and think a bit about how we get over this short-term problem. I \nthink we ought to have a good discussion about the short-term use of \nSPR in a very cautious and conservative way to stabilize these markets. \nThis ought to spark a good discussion about conservation and greater \nfuel efficiencies in our vehicles. It ought to spark a significant \ndiscussion about conservation.\n  Even as we do that in the short run, we need to understand in the \nlong run, we can't sustain an industrialized economy--the strongest, \nbiggest economy in the world--the economy with the longest sustained \neconomic growth in the world, we cannot sustain that with the vagaries \nof production decisions made by oil sheiks in other countries. We are \ntoo vulnerable to allow that to happen.\n  I make an additional point on a related issue. A part of the problem \nof these increasing oil imports--but only a part and really not even \nthe largest part--is what it is doing to our trade deficits. When I \ntalk about challenges we face, aside from the fact that this process \naround here is broken, and we are not passing appropriations bills when \nwe should, and we are in a state of confusion on how to get this 106th \nCongress adjourned, there are two larger challenges about which we need \nto be very concerned.\n  One I just mentioned, and that is the oil issue, the energy issue, \nand what has happened to energy prices, what might happen to our \neconomy as a result of what is happening in energy prices. The second \nis our trade deficit. It relates to the energy issue, as well. This is \nthe second challenge to our economic opportunities in the future. Our \ntrade deficit is spiking up, up, up, way up. Importing more oil, \nobviously, is causing part of this, but it is just part. Our trade \ndeficit is a very serious, abiding, long-term problem.\n  We are now headed toward a yearly merchandise trade deficit that is \ngoing to be around $430 billion in the year 2000. In July, the overall \ntrade deficit in goods and services was $31.9 billion. The merchandise \ndeficit was $38.7 billion. That is unsustainable. A $7.5 billion \nmonthly trade deficit with Japan, a $7.6 billion trade deficit with \nChina, a $6.3 billion trade deficit with the European Union, $4.7 \nbillion with Canada, $2.2 billion with Mexico--we can't sustain that. \nThat cannot continue. The merchandise deficit with Japan for the first \nhalf of 2000 was nearly $40 billion; with China, $36 billion; Europe, \n$26 billion; Canada, $23 billion.\n  Not many people seem to care much about this. Nobody talks much about \nit. But this is a deficit that must be repaid. It regrettably will be \nrepaid in the future with a lower standard of living in this country, \nand the higher the\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\ndeficit, the more difficulty we will have to respond to this \nobligation.\n  This results from a wide range of things. It results from China, \nJapan, Europe, Canada, Mexico--which have the largest bilateral trade \ndeficits--deciding they should sell more to us than they are willing to \nbuy from us. This cannot continue.\n  Even Alan Greenspan, with whom I have had substantial disagreements \nfor a long period of time, says something has to give; this trade \ndeficit is unsustainable.\n  I was intending to speak at greater length about our trade deficit, \nbut I will save that for a later time. Suffice it to say that if this \ntrade deficit continues to spike up, we could very well see it \nundermine confidence in the U.S. dollar and we could see the dollar \nbegin falling on international currency markets. That could cause all \nkinds of problems for our country's economy.\n  There are two challenges we must meet--dealing with an energy policy \nboth short term and long term that makes sense, and the challenge of \ndealing with a trade policy that begins to straighten out this trade \nmess.\n  I know other colleagues have things they want to talk about. I will \ncome back later to talk about the specific trade issues we have with \nChina and Japan and Canada and Europe. But it is my hope to end where I \nbegan today. It is my hope, in the next 2 weeks or so when the 106th \nCongress is expected to adjourn, that we can decide to bring the issues \nI have discussed to the floor for a vote. If someone believes we should \nkeep using food as a weapon, good for them. They are dead wrong, but \nthey have a right to think that. Everybody has a right to be wrong.\n  The point is, if 75 percent of the Senate and 75 percent of the House \nbelieves we ought to stop using food as a weapon and stop holding our \nfarmers hostage by preventing them from shipping food to other \ncountries, and stop hurting poor and sick and hungry people in Cuba and \nIran and Libya and other places, if you believe that, then let us have \na conference and cast a vote to stop it, as the Senate has done with \nover 70 percent of its Members. But those who bottle this up and try to \nhijack it by saying, ``We are not going to allow you to vote on this,'' \nthat is not the way the system is supposed to work. If they try to do \nthat in a dozen or so areas--where we have already passed legislation \nbut they are trying not to have a conference and are trying to hijack \nthe process--this place is going to slow way down in a big hurry.\n  Let me ask for cooperation on the part of the majority leader, the \nmajority party, and my colleagues on my side and let's get this done. \nLet's do it right.\n  Another thing, we can't end this session without dealing with the \nissue of the minimum wage for the people at the lowest rung of the \nladder in this country. We have an obligation to do that. That has been \nkicking around like a Ping-Pong ball for months.\n  We can't end this session without passing a Patients' Bill of Rights. \nOf course we ought to do that. That just makes sense. There are the \nvotes to do that, in my judgment. It passed the House. We have the \nvotes in the Senate. If we get it back up, we will win it by one vote.\n  There are a series of important things we should do, we ought to do--\nthings the American people should expect us to do--and we only have a \ncouple of weeks. I say to the people who run this place: Let's go back \nto regular order. If you don't like a provision, fine, try to kill it. \nBut at least give us a vote on it. We will see, how the American public \nfeels about it, how our colleagues feel about it. The way they are \nkilling things these days is by putting them in a closet someplace and \nhoping nobody will see. It is happening to the issue of reimportation \nof prescription drugs, to the issue of food as a weapon in \ninternational sanctions. Frankly, that is the wrong way to legislate. \nIf you have the votes, beat us. If you do not have the votes, give us \nthe chance to win on the floor of the Senate and House as well on these \nimportant issues.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota, it is too bad there \nare not more discussions about trade. I say my colleague has tried, \nmore than any other Member of the Senate. If we take a look at what is \nhappening with these tremendous trade deficits--we are all kind of fat \nand sassy around here these days. Because the economy is so good, it \nburies these trade deficits. But if the economy begins to lag a little \nbit--and it will someday--we are going to feel these trade deficits \nmore than you can imagine--not more that you can imagine but more than \nmost people can imagine.\n  So I compliment you for trying so hard to keep the fact that we need \nto be concerned about our trade deficit in the forefront of what we are \ndoing. We cannot have this imbalance of trade going on forever and \nremain the strong, powerful country that we are. If the trade deficit \ncontinues and it keeps getting larger and larger, as the Senator's \npictures have shown--I am trying to figure out a way to say ``a picture \nis worth a thousand words,'' and it really is. What you have shown here \ntugs at my heartstrings because it really is an issue we need to be \naddressing, and we are not.\n  Basically, I want to say to the Senator from North Dakota how much I \nappreciate his doing everything within his power, not only today but \nover the past 5 years, to bring this to the forefront so we start \ntalking about these issues.\n  I have to say we failed. We have not followed your lead. We have not \ndiscussed, in any depth at all, the trade deficit.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada is very generous. \nI must say the two things I came to talk about today are the energy \nproblems that we have that are abiding and serious and that have a huge \nimpact, not only on the State of North Dakota and the citizens I \nrepresent, but an impact on all Americans. And also the trade deficit, \nwhich has a similar impact on an agricultural State such as the State I \nrepresent. These are big issues, big challenges. Unfortunately, they \nare going unresolved.\n  There is the old story about a Cherokee Indian chief who is reputed \nto have said at one point:\n\n       The success of a rain dance depends a lot on the timing.\n\n  That was tongue in cheek, I expect, but that is true also with \nCongress and what it is willing to address and not willing to address, \nwhat it is willing to bring out here and sink its teeth into and what \nit wants to put in a closet and pretend doesn't exist.\n  These are big issues. We deal with a lot of small issues every day as \nwell, but these are big issues and we have to deal with these issues. \nThese issues will affect the economic lives of millions of small \nbusinessmen and women. It will affect the economic future of kids \ncoming out of school, and they want a job and they need a good, growing \neconomy to get a job.\n  These issues are the kinds of things that can tip a growing economy \nover into a recession, or something worse. That is why it is important. \nWhen you see storm clouds gather on the horizon, you pay attention to \nthem. These are storm clouds on the horizon. Things are good now. This \nis a blessing. We have a great economy. You wouldn't rather be anywhere \nthan here because we have a wonderful economy and things are very good \nin a lot of areas of this country, but these are storm clouds and our \njob is to anticipate and respond to things that we know are going to \nhave a significant impact on the future of this country--energy and \ntrade. We better get busy. We better respond to these issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I say, before my friend does leave the floor--I ask I be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we in the United States, because of the \npower of our economy, are not feeling the increase in fuel prices. We \nare feeling it a little bit. But other places in the world are feeling \nit very dramatically.\n  What I say to my friend, talking about the trade deficit and problems \nwith energy, is that we may not be feeling them now, but if we do not \naddress these problems we are going to feel these fuel problems \ndramatically because it was not long ago a barrel of oil was costing \n$10. We did nothing. At the time, of course, because of the low prices, \nwe could have done something to put this fuel into our reserves. We did \nnot do anything about that. We, of course, during the good times, have\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\ndone nothing to develop alternative fuel sources. We could do that. We \nhave not done that. Now that there is the spike in oil prices, we are \nlooking back and saying: Gee, I wish we would have done something. Tax \npolicy does not do anything to favor alternative fuels.\n  There are a lot of things that are facing this country that we need \nto get ahold of while we have the opportunity. This economy is looked \nupon as the greatest of all time. But as good as our economy is, it can \nfalter just as it has gone up. It does not take a lot of things to \nstart going wrong before we have a problem with our economy.\n  So, again, before my friend leaves the floor, he could not talk about \ntwo issues that are any more important to this thriving economy than \nthe trade deficit--that is pronounced and we are not doing anything \nabout it--and, of course, energy, about which we are doing very little.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might respond, Mr. President, the folks in this \ncountry who are now worried sick about what is happening to energy \nprices are people such as senior citizens who know they are going to \npay a home heating fuel bill that is multiples of what they paid last \nyear. They are living on fixed incomes and do not have the money. They \nare saying: How do I do this? These are people who are living on fixed \nincomes, who drive up to the gas pump and now discover it costs a \nsignificant amount of money to fill their gas tank. Or small truckers--\nI just make this final point.\n  Mike and Jenny Mellick from Fargo, ND, called me. They operate seven \ntrucks. It is a small company, a man and wife trying to run an \noperation with seven tractor-trailer rigs that haul loads across the \ncountry. They said the increase in fuel costs is devastating to them \nand they are worried about losing their business.\n  This is having repercussions all across this country. This could tip \nthe economy. We have to get ahead of this and say we need more \nproduction and more conservation and we need to care about these folks \nwho are being dislocated by the significant energy crisis we face.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the one thing I am appreciative of is the \nVice President has a plan; that is, he has recommended that if these \nprices stay where they are, we should start drawing down our reserves. \nThis is one alternative. I am glad he is doing this rather than just \ncomplaining.\n  We have to have an energy policy. This is not a problem of Democrats \nor Republicans; it has been a problem of administrations for the last \n30 years. They simply will not get involved and work with Congress to \ncome up with a long-term energy policy, and we need one.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I mentioned earlier about the Vice \nPresident's proposal. I have not been a big cheerleader to move to SPR. \nBy the same token, SPR is 570 million barrels of stored reserves. If we \ntake half a million barrels a day, we could for 90 or 120 days, which \nis what we need at this point to get back into a supply equilibrium, \nprovide some significant stability in energy prices just by taking a \nvery small portion. So we take a very small fraction of the SPR and \nwith it provide stability to oil prices.\n  We need to work on the longer issues as well. There is merit in \nhaving this debate and discussion. The Vice President has raised a very \nimportant issue. Good for him. We have a short-term issue, intermediate \nissues, and long-term issues. In the short term, we ought to take a \nlook at this issue. Maybe half a million barrels a day will be the \ncatalyst to provide the stability we want in oil prices at this moment \nin order to get to the next intersection, which I think after the first \nof the year is an intersection of much more production.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9023-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9023-S9026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE NEED FOR AN AMERICAN ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the one driving factor in the advancement \nof mankind has been energy. Fire, oil for heat and lamps, water mills, \ncoal, electricity, refined oil, hydro power, nuclear power. \nAdvancements in energy have fueled the great advancements of \ncivilization.\n  Today, energy touches every facet of our lives. It heats, cools, \npowers, and lights our homes, our places of business, our schools, and \nour hospitals. It fuels our modes of transportation whether on road, \nrail, sea, or air. It powers up our computers, the Internet and the \ninformation superhighway. It goes into the production of food, \nmedicine, clothing, and every consumer product ranging from household \nappliances to health and beauty products. It allows the stock markets \nto open each morning around the world. It powers the transactions of \ncommerce and business. It fuels the planes, ships, tanks, submarines, \nand weapons that protect America.\n  Energy is the great connector. It fuels the productive capacity of \nthe world. It affects world stability.\n  Energy is serious business. America must have a national energy \npolicy that ensures we have reliable, stable, and affordable sources of \nenergy. This cannot be neglected. To do so leaves our Nation vulnerable \non all fronts.\n  Energy policy ties together America's economy, standard of living, \nnational security, and our geopolitical strategic interests around the \nworld--and our future.\n  Perhaps the area where energy has the most immediate and visible \neffect is on the pocketbooks of individual Americans and the economic \ngrowth of our Nation.\n  Oil prices have more than tripled in less than 2 years, to nearly $37 \na barrel this week--the highest price since the buildup to the Persian \nGulf war in November of 1990. The President of the Organization of \nPetroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, said last Friday that the price of \noil may temporarily hit $40 a barrel this winter. I suspect we might \nsee $50 a barrel in the next few months.\n  American consumers have felt this most immediately at the gas pimp.\n  This winter, consumers are likely to feel an even stronger bite when \nthey heat their homes. Natural gas and home heating oil prices are also \non the rise. The prices for natural gas, which is used to heat 58 \nmillion homes, have doubled since the beginning of the year. Customers \nof heating oil, including more than one-third of the homeowners in the \nNortheastern part of the United States may pay more than $2 a gallon--\nor twice the current price--to heat their homes this winter.\n  As energy prices rise this winter, Americans will again be reminded \nof the lessons we learned in the 1970s about the volatility of energy \nprices and the impact on our economy. The forecasts are not optimistic. \nSaid Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy \nStudies, ``I think the only thing we can do is pray for a very warm \nwinter.'' Praying for a warm winter is not an energy policy.\n  The concern over natural gas prices is so great that on Wednesday, \nseveral of our Nation's Governors met in Columbus, Ohio, to discuss the \n``natural gas crisis.''\n  And it is not just gasoline, natural gas and heating oil prices that \nare affected by the current energy predicament. It is all energy. Over \nthe past 12 months, costs paid by consumers for all forms of energy \nhave increased by 13 percent.\n  High energy costs ripple through the economy. They drive up \ninflation. Then deflation. The Consumer Price Index has risen 3.4 \npercent in the last year, with energy price increases responsible for \nnearly one-quarter of that increase.\n  It also saps the strength of our economy. Energy fuels economic \ngrowth. ``Oil shocks'' send a shock through the economy, increasing \nprices for everything that uses energy. It is a draining force on our \nsociety and economy. When consumers are forced to spend more on energy, \nthey spend less on other items.\n  Higher energy prices increase the cost of doing business, of moving \ngoods, of manufacturing, and of farming.\n  We are seeing the beginning of the consequences of higher fuel costs \nin Europe. Protests virtually shut down Great Britain last week, at one \npoint more than 90 percent of their petrol stations were dry. These \nprotests blocked transportation and caused disruption in medical \nservices, postal delivery, education, and food supply. As a matter of \nfact, for the first time since the years after World War II, Great\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n\nBritain had to ration food. Great Britain, one of the great powers of \nour time had to ration food at the supermarkets last week, and they \nintroduced a policy of one loaf of bread per customer. The British \nChambers of Commerce estimated that the protests cost Britain's economy \n$351 million per day. These protests erupted throughout Europe. In \nalmost every country in Europe there were protests.\n  High energy prices will dramatically affect the United States, \nEurope, Japan, and other industrialized nations. But these \nindustrialized nations' economies are better prepared to cushion the \nheavy blow than the recovering economies in Asia, developing countries, \nand emerging market economies. These nations, including South Korea and \nTaiwan, still depend on such heavy industries as steel production for \ntheir economic growth. Studies have shown that if oil prices do not \nfall quickly, these economies could lose at least 2 percent of their \ngross national product this year.\n  One of Europe's central bankers has predicted that the current spike \nin oil prices could cut a full percentage point off the GDP growth \nexpected around the world during the next 12 months. This is an awesome \nnumber when you step back and understand what that means. And what that \nmeans is catastrophe. The President of the World Bank, James \nWolfensohn, echoed these fears in an interview in the International \nHerald Tribune. He predicted a $10 shift in oil prices could decrease \nglobal economic growth by at least one-half of a percentage point.\n  In the United States, a slowdown in economic growth due to higher \nenergy prices will have a negative impact on our Federal budget. The \nassumptions for projected Federal budget surpluses over the next 10 \nyears do not take into account what would happen if high energy prices \nor energy shortages stalled our economy.\n  Where then would be our proposals to finance new prescription drug \nplans for Medicare recipients, provide more funding for education, \ngrapple with the restructuring of our entitlement programs, and much-\nneeded funds to improve our Nation's military? Where then would the \nmoney come from? The money needed to fund these areas of the Federal \nbudget and pay down our national debt would have gone up in smoke--\nliterally.\n  Other countries would be affected in the same way. High energy prices \naffect nations the same way they affect individual households--the more \nmoney spent on energy, the less there is available for other \npriorities.\n  But this has broader implications than budgetary issues. Increasing \nenergy prices will affect efforts to improve the environment. In recent \nyears, we have made great strides in working with developing nations to \nhelp them use responsible measures to grow their economies. But they \nwill do what they must do to survive. If their national self-interests \nare at stake, they will clear cut forests to grow food, and they will \nnot consider environmental measures. They will draw natural resources \nfrom wherever they can get them. They will abandon efforts to upgrade \nto cleaner technologies and stay with their dirty smokestacks and other \nenergy-producing methods that damage the environment, if energy costs \ngo too high.\n  The price of oil also has broad national security implications, as \nyou know so well. These broad national security implications to the \nUnited States are there because we are so reliant on foreign sources \nfor our supply of crude oil.\n  During 1973, at the peak of the energy crisis, we relied on foreign \nsources of oil for 35 percent of our domestic supply. Since that time, \nwe have become more--not less--dependent on foreign oil. Today, we \nimport almost 60 percent of the oil used in the United States. The \nDepartment of Energy estimates that we will at least be 65-percent \nreliant on foreign oil by 2020.\n  The response to the current high oil prices by the Clinton \nadministration has been to try and cajole oil-exporting nations to \nincrease production in an effort to lower prices. U.S. Secretary of \nEnergy Bill Richardson has said, regarding the pressure on OPEC \nnations: ``Our quiet diplomacy is working.'' I ask, what diplomacy?\n  Crude oil is at a record high. We import more oil than we did during \nthe energy crisis in the 1970s, spending more than $300 million a day. \nPetroleum accounts for one-third of the U.S. total trade deficit.\n  Who are we kidding? This has bigger implications than high gas \nprices. In February 1995, President Clinton issued the following \nstatement:\n\n       . . . the nation's growing reliance on imports of crude oil \n     and refined petroleum products threatens the nation's \n     security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to oil \n     supply interruptions . . . I concur with the Department's \n     recommendation that the Administration continue its present \n     efforts to improve U.S. energy security.\n\n  Yet through the Clinton-Gore administration policies, this \nadministration has discouraged, and in many cases blocked, American oil \nand gas producers from increasing domestic production. Since that time, \nwe have increased our use of oil and turned more and more to foreign \ncountries to supply the oil we use. We import 1.5 million barrels of \noil more per day than we did 5 years ago. That is an increase of nearly \n22 percent in the last 5 years. Therefore, it should not be surprising \nthat President Clinton issued a nearly identical ruling on March 24 of \nthis year, stating again that oil imports threaten U.S. national \nsecurity.\n  High energy prices also impact the security of other nations and \nthreaten global stability. Energy fuels the productive capacity of \nnational economies. The adverse effect of high energy prices can cause \ninstability in emerging democracies and in market economies, which then \ncan quickly erupt into regional turmoil, conflict, and war, devastating \nall prospects for growth, prosperity, and for eliminating hunger and \npoverty.\n\n  The contributing factors to the current high oil prices demonstrate \nthe geopolitical consequences of energy, and the leverage granted to \noil-exporting nations. Prices have increased for oil and natural gas \nbecause supply has not kept pace with demand. From 1994 to 1999, global \noil consumption grew by almost 10 percent, while production rose only \nat about 7 percent.\n  Do we have a supply problem? Of course we have a supply problem. When \ndemand stretches supply to the breaking point, the result is rationing. \nWhat a dangerous, dangerous development--the rationing of energy.\n  When the price of oil fell dramatically a few years ago, drilling \ncompanies cut back on their exploration of both oil and natural gas. \nThey reduced their spending. There was a drastic decline in global \ndrilling during 1998, 1999, and early this year. Astonishingly, there \nare only about 40 percent as many drilling rigs working today as there \nwere in the early 1980s. Even OPEC nations must constantly drill to \noffset depletion. Low levels of drilling reflect a capital shortage, \nand the result is that oil production has been falling continuously in \nthe United States; it is stable or falling in the North Sea; it is \nfalling in most of Latin America; and it is not growing hardly anywhere \nelse in the world. Capital not invested in energy production a few \nyears ago is now reflected in lower supplies and product.\n  During this time, global demand for oil has increased, fueled by a \nstrong U.S. economy--which we all applaud, which we all take advantage \nof, and which we based projected surpluses on--economic growth in \nEurope, and a stronger than expected economic recovery in Asia, which \nare all responsible for this demand.\n  The economic growth of developing nations is a very energy-intensive \nexercise, we must know. China and India show oil demand growing at \nnearly 8 percent a year on a sustained basis. This increased demand, \ncoupled with low supplies, has pushed oil reserves near their limits \nworldwide. Inventories are at low levels. In most industrialized \nnations, it will take many years to correct the imbalance between \nsupply and demand.\n  In addition to current inventories, the oil industry normally has \nanother cushion to use to meet increased demand. This is called ``spare \ncapacity'' or unused wells that can be called on to produce additional \nsupplies when necessary.\n  Turning on these spigots can help correct the imbalance between \nsupply and demand. However, except for the days of the gulf war, the \nworld's spare capacity is at its lowest point since the days leading up \nto the 1973 energy crisis--less than 3 million barrels per day.\n\n[[Page S9025]]\n\n Therefore, the world oil market is very tight and very vulnerable to \nsupply disruptions and price fluctuations. A further tightening of the \nmarket could lead to the kind of energy rationing we saw in the 1970s.\n  The situation is even worse in the natural gas market, especially for \nNorth America.\n  But correcting imbalances of supply and demand in oil markets is very \ndifferent from traditional economic models. Oil does not move on a free \nmarket. The demand is given--individuals and nations do not have a \nchoice about whether they need energy or not, and oil is still the \ngreatest source of global energy in the world today. Its production is \nconcentrated in the hands of a few who have the ability to control the \nflow of oil into the market and, thereby, the price of this commodity. \nThis makes oil a political commodity.\n\n  Our reliance on foreign oil leaves the U.S. vulnerable to the whims \nof foreign oil cartels. If something happened to threaten this supply, \nwe could not turn on the spigots here in the United States overnight.\n  A tight oil market gives additional leverage to individual oil-\nexporting nations. Half of the world's spare production capacity today \nnow is in Saudi Arabia. Iraq, interestingly enough--Iraq, whom we \nbombed almost daily--is the fastest growing source of U.S. oil imports. \nWe import about 750,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq.\n  What if Saddam Hussein were to decide to bully the market by turning \noff its tap, which currently pumps 2.3 million barrels a day on to the \nglobal market?\n  On Monday, he warned that OPEC nations were bowing to pressures \nfrom--in his words--``superpowers'' in agreeing to increase production \nin an attempt to lower prices. He said, ``The superpowers will fasten \ntheir grip on oil producing countries.'' This is a very dangerous \ndevelopment.\n  Our allies, of course, would be even more vulnerable to threats from \noil-producing nations because Europe and Japan are even more dependent \nthan the U.S. on foreign oil.\n  How did we, the United States, get ourselves into this precarious \nposition?\n  How did we get here? We have bumbled into it because we were not \npaying attention. Every administration in the last 25 years must share \nsome responsibility for where we are today. But in particular, this \nadministration, the Clinton-Gore administration, has drifted through \nthe last 8 years without an energy policy, content to sit back and \nenjoy a good economy--of course, to take credit for that economy--but \nunwilling to prepare our Nation for the challenges ahead and make the \ntough choices and hard decisions necessary for energy independence.\n  The lack of a Federal energy policy for the last 8 years has worked \nto decrease U.S. oil production, making American consumers more \nvulnerable to the volatility of prices set by oil cartels such as OPEC. \nThe wild swings in price over the last 2 years have hurt U.S. oil and \ngas producers and shut down many drilling wells because of instability \nin the markets, loss of investment capital, loss of qualified \nemployees, and elimination of the petroleum infrastructure.\n  The lack of an overall policy has made U.S. producers more \nsusceptible to the manipulation of prices by cartels such as OPEC. In \ntestimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March, \nDenise Bode, an Oklahoma corporation commissioner, discussed the impact \nof OPEC's manipulation on oil markets:\n\n       Whatever OPEC's motivation, the impact on American \n     petroleum production is that each time this happens, they \n     make the domestic oil and gas production industry in America \n     a little less predictable, driving away capital, qualified \n     oil field employees and scrapping petroleum infrastructure. . \n     . .\n\n  The policies of this administration have actually served to \ndiscourage and at some point completely block or shut off domestic oil \nand natural gas production. While oil consumption in the United States \nhas risen by 14 percent since 1992, over the last 8 years U.S. crude \noil production has dropped by 17 percent. The number of American jobs \nin exploring and producing oil and gas has declined by 27 percent. The \nnumber of working oil rigs has declined by 77 percent. This \nadministration has failed to encourage viable energy alternatives. They \npursue policies promoted by environmentalists with no comprehension or \nacknowledgment of the consequences of these policies and what these \nconsequences are for real Americans, for our economy, our Nation, and \nour future.\n\n  This administration has blocked exploration in the Alaska National \nWildlife Refuge which could contain 16 billion barrels of domestic \ncrude oil. In 1995, President Clinton vetoed legislation to allow any \nexploration in Alaska. In 1998, President Clinton closed most of the \nFederal Outer Continental Shelf to any exploration until the year 2012.\n  Vice President Gore has vowed to prohibit any future exploration for \noil and natural gas on the Outer Continental Shelf. Increased \nGovernment regulations over the last 8 years have affected investment \nin our energy industry. Thirty-six oil refineries have been closed in \nthe last 8 years, and no major oil refinery has been built in the last \n25 years. This is in part due to the requirements of the Clean Air Act \nthat make it difficult to build or upgrade any refineries.\n  EPA regulation has placed more and more and more burdens on fewer and \nfewer oil refineries by forcing them to produce reformulated gasoline \nfor different markets. Use of hydroelectric power has been sharply \ndeclining due to the onerous regulatory burdens on the industry. This \nadministration does not consider water to be a renewable resource--that \nis the definition by this administration of ``water''--and has even \nadvocated taking down current valuable hydroelectric dams in the \nPacific Northwest that supply power.\n  Nuclear energy has not been promoted as a clean energy alternative by \nthis administration. No new plants are scheduled to begin operating. \nThis administration has steadfastly opposed and recently vetoed \nlegislation that would ensure timely construction of a desperately \nneeded Federal storage facility for spent nuclear fuel. In addition, \nvirtually all nuclear operating licenses are up for renewal by 2015. \nYet the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has indicated it expects no more \nthan 85 of the 103 units will file renewals. That means we will be \ntaking out of current service, at a minimum, 18 nuclear powerplants in \nthe next few years. Where in the world are we going to recover that \ncapacity? Where will that capacity come from? We don't talk about that.\n  Furthermore, this administration, while professing a desire to \nincrease natural gas as a source of energy, works constantly against \nefforts to increase the availability of domestic natural gas. The \nNational Petroleum Council has identified a critical barrier to \nincreasing supplies of natural gas: Access to over 200 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas reserves is either off limits or is being severely \nrestricted on multiple-use lands and the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  This administration says, well, use natural gas but just don't drill \nfor it. This administration's budget clearly demonstrates where its \nenergy priorities are. This year's Department of Energy budget, \nsubmitted by this administration, has $1.2 billion for climate change \nactivities, but yet it has only $92 million for oil, gas, and energy \nresearch and development--a clear statement on where they are with \ntheir priorities. An energy policy that emphasizes only some energy \nsources and priorities without regard for their negative impacts on \nenergy markets threatens the sustainability of this economy, the \nwelfare of our people, the stability of the world, and the future of \nthis country.\n\n  What can we do to address this problem? Can we address this problem? \nOf course, we can address this problem. Both the next President and the \nCongress must pursue a comprehensive energy policy that decreases our \nreliance on foreign oil by increasing the safe, environmentally sound \nproduction of our domestic oil and gas resources and by developing a \nmore diversified supply of energy sources.\n  The answer is not, as Vice President Gore recommended yesterday, to \ntap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. These 570 million barrels \nwere set aside to deal with severe disruptions in oil supply caused by \nwar or other national emergencies.\n  The strategic reserve was not created to make up for 8 years of \ninattention from the Clinton-Gore administration\n\n[[Page S9026]]\n\nor to make up for the detrimental impact their policies have had on \ndomestic production. The Vice President himself acknowledged in \nFebruary this statement when he said it would be a ``bad idea''--his \nwords --to tap into the strategic reserve. And so has the President's \nSecretary of the Treasury, Mr. Summers; as has the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, Mr. Greenspan.\n  Furthermore, opening up the strategic reserve will not do anything to \naddress the shortage of home heating oil. Why? The strategic reserve \nconsists of crude oil. It would need to be refined into heating oil, \nand our refineries are already running at full capacity. If we still \nhad the 36 refineries that were shut down over the last 8 years of this \nadministration, then we might be able to refine that extra oil from the \nstrategic reserve, but it does nothing to help our current situation. \nIt is bad policy, shortsighted policy.\n  In addition to augmenting domestic oil production, the United States \nmust explore other future energy options that will reduce other foreign \noil dependency. Our Nation's future is directly connected to energy \ncapacity. If we fail this great challenge, our children and history \nwill judge us harshly and we will leave the world more dangerous than \nwe found it. That is not our heritage. That is not our destiny. It will \nrequire bold, forceful, intelligent new leadership. That is America's \nheritage. That is America's destiny.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside so that I may offer, on behalf of Senator \nDaschle, Senator Kennedy, myself, and others, the Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first, I know \nthere is a lot of interest in this amendment, and there are a number of \nSenators who have interest in other amendments on both sides of the \naisle--additional immigration amendments.\n  There is a lot of interest on this side--and probably on both sides \nof the aisle--with regard to a H-2A provisions, which has to do with \nadditional, I guess, temporary visas in the agriculture area. I \nunderstand the interest and support in both of these areas. But Senator \nDaschle and I tried to get clearance. We worked on it over a period of \ndays. We both were very serious in trying to get it agreed to. We have \nnot been able to get it cleared. Even though I think Senator Daschle \ngot an agreement cleared on his side, there was objection on our side.\n  We have tried over a period of months to get an agreement on how to \ntake up this H-1B immigrant visa issue. It is important to industry in \nAmerica. We have over 2,000 jobs that are going unfilled now. We need \nthese high-tech workers. It is not something that is critical in my own \nState, but it is critical to the economy and the high-tech industry in \nour Nation.\n  We are down to the last few days. We need to get this done. \nTherefore, I have to object. I object, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have tried hard and, as the Senator so \ngraciously stated, we have been able to clear an agreement that we \nwould have five amendments per side, with an hour time agreement. We \ncould finish this bill, certainly, in 1 day.\n\n  It is so important that we get this done. I understand the importance \nof H-1B. I supported it. We have had 420,000 people come to this \ncountry as a result of our H-1B legislation in the past. But there are \nother things that we simply need to do, including the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act, of which I am a cosponsor. I strongly support \nthis piece of legislation that seeks to provide permanent and legally \ndefined groups of immigrants who are already here working and \ncontributing as taxpayers and to the social fabric of the company. They \nare awaiting U.S. citizenship.\n  I say to the majority leader that we need to have an opportunity to, \nin\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\nsome way, in the waning days of this Congress to work this out. We are \ngoing to work very hard. We will do it with the support and \nconsideration of the majority leader, or without it. We really believe \nthis is necessary. We are sorry the majority leader has objected, but \nwe understand the reasons.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me say, Mr. President, I am sure we have not heard the \nlast of this issue. As we get to the conclusion of the session, there \nwill be other areas or bills where this issue will be presented and \nargued. I fully expect that to happen.\n  Mr. President, is there objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. We are back to the original objection to the motion and the \nreading be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9029-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL ENERGY SECURITY ACT OF 2000--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, Senator Dorgan had indicated he had some \nquestions he would like to ask. I have some tributes and routine \nbusiness and also the closing script that we would like to go into. I \nthought maybe I would yield for some questions before we begin that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Mississippi \nyielding to me. I wanted to propound a series of questions.\n  First of all, let me say that I respect the difficult job the \nmajority leader has. As we come to the end of the 106th Congress and \ntry to put all the pieces together and make them fit, and so on, it is \na difficult job.\n  One specific piece of legislation that is very important to me--as \nare many others--is the Agriculture appropriations bill.\n  I come from a farm State. This is a critically important piece of \nlegislation.\n  The House of Representatives passed an Agriculture appropriations \nbill on July 11. The Senate passed one on July 20. It is now September \n22. I was appointed a conferee for this appropriations conference. I am \non the subcommittee, and there has been no appropriations conference at \nall. We are toward the end of this legislative session, and I worry \nabout the regular process.\n  Will we have an appropriations conference?\n  The reason I am asking this question is, as the majority leader \nknows, there are some very controversial things in this legislation. I \nunderstand there are, because the Senate by a majority vote said we \nwant them. One of those controversial issues is a policy that says: Let \nus stop using food as a weapon. We want to abolish sanctions on food \nshipments all around the world. It is controversial.\n  Some don't want to do that. Some want to continue to use food \nsanctions against Cuba and other countries. I don't. Seventy Members of \nthe Senate voted not to do it. We want to abolish that approach. That \nis one.\n  The other controversial issue is--Senator Jeffords and I offered the \namendment on the reimportation of prescription drugs approved by the \nFDA. That was controversial.\n  The reason I am asking the question of the majority leader is, \nyesterday someone from the news media called me and said another Member \nof the Senate indicated that next week the Agriculture appropriations \nbill will be coming to the floor of the Senate. This Senator asked: How \nwill that happen? He said: By magic.\n  By magic? I am a conferee. If there is a conference report on the \nAgriculture appropriations bill being brought to the floor of the \nSenate, it is not coming from a conference I was ever invited to \nattend.\n  These are very important issues.\n  I haven't mentioned the issue of crop loss and quality loss on crops \nin North Dakota and across the country where farmers have been \ndevastated by disease and quality loss in their crops. We want to focus \non that in this bill as well.\n  I will not give a speech. But I want to ask the majority leader: Can \nhe tell me anything about this conference or anything about this \n``magic'' that one Member of the Senate suggested was going to happen? \nDo we expect to have a conference with the House on Agriculture \nappropriations? And will those of us who are conferees and who come \nfrom farm States and have an abiding interest in doing the right thing \nhave the opportunity to pursue these policies and get votes on them?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would be glad to try to respond to some of \nthe questions and comments.\n  First of all, I certainly understand the Senator's interest in this \nvery important funding bill for agriculture in America. There is a lot \nof funding here. I don't know the total amount of this bill, but it is \nmultibillion dollars, and it is important for our farm economy, for \nfood for our people in this country, and also for exports in many ways.\n  My State also is heavily involved in agriculture and has to deal with \na number of problems, all the way from droughts to floods--everything \nbut locusts.\n  Then, of course, we have the timber industry, which is an important \npart of our agricultural economy. Now that is in very difficult \nstraits, caused to a large degree because of subsidized timber products \nand lumber from other countries--Canada, Russia, and every place else. \nIt is just killing our domestic timber industry. When you add to that \nthe administration's very bad national forest policy and timber \npolicies, they are having a hard time. So I agree, it is important, and \nI share the Senator's interest in it.\n  Maybe he is asking the wrong Mississippian about this bill. I \ncertainly have an interest, and as majority leader I continue to try to \nurge the various Senate committees of appropriations and conferees to \nget together and complete their work. But the Senator from Mississippi, \nMr. Cochran, is the chairman of the Senate agriculture appropriations \nsubcommittee. He is directly and intimately involved.\n  I think there are two or three reasons that conference has not yet \nmet. First of all, the main reason is the House hasn't appointed \nconferees. They have to appoint conferees. One of the reasons they \nhaven't done that, as the Senator from North Dakota knows, as a former \nHouse Member knows, and I do, after they do that, they are then subject \nto motions in the House that could be a further complicating factor in \ngetting the work done. I think they are waiting to appoint conferees \nwhen they are ready to complete action in conference. That is one \nthing.\n  The second thing is there still has been, up until yesterday, I \nthink, some question about exactly how much money was going to be \nneeded in the disaster area because, as the Senator knows, there \ncontinue to be problems that are related to the fires, and they are \nstill trying to get an estimate of exactly what that amount of money \nwould be.\n  Then there are some issues that are not going to be easy to resolve, \nbut they are going to have to be resolved--reimportation of drugs, as \nthe Senator mentioned. The Senate acted on that. We had the Jeffords-\nDorgan amendment as amended by Senator Cochran, then the House language \nby Congressman Coburn, I believe.\n  You have to find some way to get a result. I am satisfied that there \nis\n\n[[Page S9030]]\n\ngoing to be some language in that bill in this area. I don't know what \nit is going to be. There are a lot of people with a lot more expertise \nin how that will work, and the safety aspects of it, and what \nindividuals will be able to do. All of that is going to have to be \nresolved.\n  You have the sanctions question. There is no easy solution there. You \nhave kind of the Senate position, the House position, a third position, \nand other options. I wish the Senator the very best in working all of \nthat out. I am not a member of the agriculture appropriations \nsubcommittee, and I hope not to be there when the final decision is \nmade.\n  Last but not least, I assume within the next week or so the conferees \nwill meet.\n  There are areas sometimes when communication between the bodies of \nthe Congress or between the parties is not as good as it could be, I \nguess. But usually in agriculture you have pretty good input all around \nbecause it is so important to individual Senators.\n  But I am assuming conferees will be appointed at some point before \ntoo long and that there will be a vote and action taken. I quite often \nwish for magic, but I rarely see it in dealing with these \nappropriations issues.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for one further \npoint, I have consulted with the senior Senator from Mississippi, Mr. \nCochran, someone for whom I have great regard. He has done a wonderful \njob as chairman of that subcommittee. He indicated, pretty much as the \nmajority leader did, that the House didn't appoint conferees. The House \npassed the agriculture appropriations bill on July 11.\n  It may be a stretch, but I think sometimes there are teams around \nhere, and the team kind of gets together to talk about how they are \ngoing to do something. When teams huddle up, they do not call both a \npass play and run play; they normally call one play. It may be a \nstretch on my part, but I figured there is a team that has huddled up \nand said: You know the play. We are not going to call on agriculture \nbecause we have a couple of things we don't want to have people vote \non, and we are not going to have a conference.\n  That is the only explanation I can have for being a conferee and \nnever having a conference. I guess the easiest choice is the obvious \nchoice. Let the House and the Senate vote on these controversial \nissues. Both of them that I mentioned would have passed by 75 percent \nof the House and the Senate easily.\n\n  The reason the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, knows I \nhave a little bit of tension about this is, last year we had the same \nissue on sanctions and food shipments. The same issue went through the \nSenate with 70 votes and went into conference. I was a conferee. The \nfirst order of business in the conference was to say: We insist on the \nSenate's position. Let's stop using food as a weapon. Let's stop having \nembargoes on food shipments.\n  The Senate voted. The Senate conferees insisted on their position, \nand the conference was disbanded and never met again, because the House \nconferees were prepared to support us and the House leadership said: \nNo. We are going to disband the conference and bring the conference \nreport to the floor that we haven't had a chance to work on.\n  My great concern is, that might happen again this year and maybe \nthere has been no play called yet. But I hope that, really soon the \nmajority leader will tell them that the easiest play for these \ncontroversial issues is to bring them back, and let's have votes in the \nHouse and Senate. I am willing to lose the votes if, after we count \nthem, I am on the wrong end. But we won't lose on either of these \nissues.\n  I finally say to the majority leader, it is true that we have \nsuffered, and his State has suffered droughts and floods. We have had \nfires in my State and devastating quality losses on top of floods. We \nneed to put a piece in this agriculture appropriations bill in response \nto those disasters as well. That is another significant part of it.\n  I want to work with the majority leader. But my great concern is that \nthere won't be a conference. If the majority leader is telling me he \nthinks there will be, I hope he will consult with the Speaker of the \nHouse. We both served in the House. I think it is unusual to have a \nbill passed on July 11, and now on September 22 they haven't appointed \nconferees.\n  Mr. LOTT. Has the Senator ever tried giving Senate or House \nappropriations members orders or directions? What I am saying to the \nSenator is, it won't do any good; they are going to do what they are \ngoing to do in due time.\n  All I ask from the appropriators on Agriculture, Energy and Water, \nand Interior is to give me a bill. Whatever you agree on is fine with \nme. All I want is to be able to schedule the conference report. I have \ntried saying, Do this; do that. How about that? What about this time? \nWhat about another time? They will act when they get ready, I \nguess. They will have a conference meeting and do their work or they \nwon't. It beats the heck out of me. It is mystifying.\n\n  They have a job to do. All I am saying is I have confidence in Thad \nCochran. I will support whatever he wants to do. I believe the farmers \nof North Dakota and Mississippi are going to be better for whatever he \ndoes. That is all I can do.\n  I am ready to go the minute they get a conference report. We will \nbring it to the floor like white lightning. Hopefully, that is next \nweek. I would love to do it next week. The last time I checked, that is \nthe end of the fiscal year. If they have it ready Tuesday, Wednesday, \nThursday, the happier I will be.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If they get it ready, I hope it goes through a conference \nat some point. If I am a conferee, I hope I am invited.\n  There is the television commercial where the cowboys are trying to \nherd cats.\n  Mr. LOTT. I was one of the cowboys trying to keep the cats; they \nwon't herd up, though.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I know that.\n  It is one thing for me to be mystified; that is probably acceptable, \nbut I am worried when the leader is mystified.\n  Mr. LOTT. You are a cat, and you will want to get grouped up for a \nconclusion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Things will slow down a lot if we have a process that \ntries to partition people off from this. These are important issues, \nand they are not done at the end of the session; they probably should \nhave been done long ago. As we get to the end of the session, I am \nasking we have conferences.\n  To the extent you are talking to the Speaker, I hope you will \nencourage them: Appoint conferees, get to conference, and get the \nbusiness done. That is all I am asking today. I expect to be at a \nconference next week.\n  Somebody in this Senate said yesterday to a member of the press--I \nassume it is probably printed today--that the conference report was \ngoing to come to the Senate floor by ``magic.'' Well, that is a magic \ncarpet that will surprise a lot of Members, I suppose, and will cause a \nlot of problems. If the Senator will support us in regular order in \nhaving a conference in which we can all participate, that is what we \nexpect to be the case in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9030-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9030-S9031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO PAT WADE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise in support today and bid farewell to \na dear colleague and a member of our Senate family. That person is \nPatricia ``Pat'' Wade, who has worked on Capitol Hill with distinction \nand loyalty for over 28 years.\n  Pat came to Washington from Memphis, TN. I have known her throughout \nthese 28 years. I have been in Congress all those years and remember \nwhen she first came. She came in 1970 and actually began working for \nCongressman Dan Kuykendall from Tennessee--the Tennessee talking horse, \nwe affectionately called him, a great guy and a good friend.\n  During her tenure on the House side, she also worked for then-\nCongressman Thad Cochran and his successor in the House, Jon Henson, \nboth from the great State of Mississippi.\n  After a stint in the House, she moved over to the Senate side to work \nfor Vice President George Bush in his Capitol office. Senate Majority \nLeader Bob Dole's office was her next stop. Then I brought her on board \nwhen I took the position in the Senate majority leader's office.\n  She now works with Elizabeth Letchworth, and she is administrative\n\n[[Page S9031]]\n\nassistant to the secretary for the majority's office. She is invariably \nfriendly and effective. When I call looking for this very important \nfloor staff director, Pat can find her no matter where she is. She \nalways has a smile on her face. She has a fun-loving attitude and is \njust a very nice person. I will miss her dearly. Pat will certainly do \nwell as she goes back to her home State and spends more time with her \nbeloved mother. We will miss her, but we wish her luck in all future \nendeavors and thank her for her contributions to this body over these \nmany years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9031-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. President, I noticed that Senator Byrd from West Virginia was \nseeking to ask me to yield. I am happy to yield for any kind of \nquestion or comment the Senator desires.\n  Mr. BYRD. The majority leader is very, very gracious. I appreciate \nthat. I have a speech I want to make today. Could the majority leader \nenter an order that I be recognized for 25 or 30 minutes at the close \nof day.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, certainly. We will modify our closing script \nto make that possible for Senator Byrd. I know it will be informative, \ninteresting, and entertaining, as his speeches always are, and it will \nrecognize some great moment, some great individual, or some important \npoint about the Senate itself.\n  We will certainly accommodate that request.\n  Mr. BYRD.

CHEN\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I rise to welcome Mr. C.J. \nChen as the new Representative at the Taiwan Economic and Cultural \nRepresentative Office (TECRO). Mr. C.J. Chen, former foreign minister \nof Taiwan, has recently replaced Mr. Stephen Chen as Taiwan's top \ndiplomat in the United States. Mr. C.J. Chen is certainly qualified to \nspeak for his government and to brief us on all the issues affecting \nthe good relations between the United States and Taiwan.\n  Representative Chen was born in China and educated in Taiwan and \nGreat Britain. He received a law degree at the University of Cambridge \nand was a resident fellow at the University of Madrid. Following his \ntraining in Europe, he returned to Taipei and served in many key \npositions. Most notably he was senior deputy in Taiwan's Washington \noffice in the 1980's; later he was a vice foreign minister, a senator \nin the Parliament, and a government spokesman. Prior to June of this \nyear, he was the Foreign Minister for the Republic of China.\n  Representative Chen's appointment as Taiwan's chief diplomat in the \nUnited States is a strong indication of the importance his government \nattaches to Taiwan-United States relations. He will have a unique \nopportunity to keep us abreast of the new administration's peace \ninitiatives for the region.\n  Representative Chen has already made a great start on Capitol Hill. I \ntrust that he will have a very successful stay in Washington and on \nCapitol Hill. He is a very talented and respected representative for \nTECRO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9031-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BABY SAFETY MONTH\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the month \nof September as Baby Safety Month. This year's theme, ``Good Night, \nSleep Tight,'' stresses crib safety. As a grandparent, I experienced \nthe tragic loss of my grandson Blake on March 30, 1995, when he passed \naway from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS. My experience, and the \nexperiences of the many others I have met since then who faced similar \nlosses, have helped heighten for me the importance of doing everything \nwe can to ensure the safety of an infant.\n  A baby brings so much joy and excitement into a family, along with a \nnew perspective on life. Of course, a birth also means a host of baby \nproducts coming into the home--everything from a car seat and safety \nlocks on cabinet doors, to a crib. Experts recommend parents do not use \nsecond-hand products because of the safety standards new baby products \nhave to meet. However, if older products are used, parents should make \ncertain they do not have loose or missing parts.\n  The most important thing parents can do for the safety of their baby \nis to supervise them carefully, especially when they are using juvenile \nproducts. Baby products are designed for safe use, but not as a \nsubstitute for parental supervision. For more than 20 years, the \nJuvenile Products Manufacturers Association has been helping parents \nkeep their babies safe from harm by certifying juvenile products and \nworking with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), a \nnonprofit organization, to inform and educate the American public on \nsafe products.\n  Research has told us that normal, healthy infants should ALWAYS sleep \non their backs unless otherwise advised by a pediatrician. Consulting \ntheir pediatrician and using a safe crib that meets current federal and \nASTM standards will help parents feel comfortable placing their babies \nto sleep. Despite all the precautions, however, nearly 50 babies \nsuffocate or strangle themselves each year in cribs with unsafe \ndesigns. During Baby Safety Month, JPMA provides promotional materials \nat retail outlets to help promote crib and baby safety to every new \nparent.\n  Since the death of my grandson, I have been privileged to get to know \nthe men and women of the Minnesota SIDS Center, which serves \nMinnesotans by working to prevent SIDS and helping families who have \nsuffered a loss due to SIDS. They are doing important work, and their \nefforts are very much appreciated. The Minnesota SIDS Center and other \norganizations have helped reduce SIDS rates by 43 percent by spreading \nthe word to parents that putting infants to sleep on their backs has \nbeen proven to reduce SIDS deaths in some cases. The lives of more than \n1,500 infants are being spared each year. That is exciting news. Even \nwith the recent progress, though, SIDS claims nearly 3,000 lives every \nyear and remains the leading cause of death for infants between one \nmonth and one year of age. Clearly, there is still much more we need to \nlearn.\n  Mr. President, I hope every parent, new and expecting, takes the \nnecessary precautions to prevent all potential risks to the safety of \ntheir baby. I would also like to thank those at the Minnesota SIDS \nCenter and similar organizations across America who are working hard to \nimprove the safety of every baby, thereby ensuring that ``Good Night, \nSleep Tight'' is more than just another catchy slogan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9031-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9031-S9032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICAN BUSINESS WOMEN'S DAY\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize September \n22 as American Business Women's Day. On this day in 1949, the American \nBusiness Women's Association (ABWA) was founded as a support \norganization for women either entering or already in the workforce. The \nABWA was founded by Mr. Hilary A. Bufton, Jr., a Missouri business \nowner who realized the positive economic impact women can have in the \nworkplace.\n  American Business Women's Day won national attention after passage of \na congressional resolution in 1983 and 1986, and President Ronald \nReagan issued a proclamation granting it official recognition. Today, \nAmerican Business Women's Day gives every American an opportunity to \nrecognize the vital contributions women are making to this nation.\n  Women have long played a vital role in America's workforce. As \nscientists, elected officials, presidents of companies, and small \nbusiness owners, in every job category in every profession upon which \nthis nation depends, women take key roles in all facets of business. \nSome 27.5 million women work in the 9.1 million women-owned businesses \nin the United States, representing 38 percent of all businesses and \ngenerating over $3.6 trillion in annual sales. Consisting of nearly 48 \npercent of the overall workforce in the United States, more than 61 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S9032]]\n\nworking women continue to prove their excellence with the positive \ninfluence they have on America's growing economy.\n  These women are rightly concerned about the critical issues in \nCongress that affect their ability to work and provide for their \nfamilies, at the same time they are often trying to balance the \ncompeting demands of business and family. The tax burden, for example, \nimposes a marriage penalty on women who choose to get married, which in \nturn often forces both spouses to take jobs just to meet their annual \ntax obligations. And that, of course, ultimately forces families to \nspend less time together. The estate tax, or ``death tax,'' severely \nlimits the ability of a business owner to pass along her business to \nher children, and often results in that business having to be sold upon \nher death. Social Security discriminates against women, especially \nthose who are forced to return to the workforce after the death of a \nspouse, or who choose to work part time while raising a family. \nObsolete federal laws restrict the ability of employers to offer \nflexible working arrangements. For example, a week in which a working \nmother must stay home with a sick child cannot legally be ``balanced'' \nwith the hours of the following week, when a lighter home schedule \nmeans a worker could spend extra hours on the job.\n  At the urging of thousands of Minnesota's working women, these are \nconcerns I have worked hard to address. We have made progress--the $500 \nper-child tax credit I authored is helping ease the family tax burden--\nbut much work remains.\n  The American Business Women's Association has recognized 10 \ninfluential women each year since 1953 for their stellar achievements \nand contributions to the American work force.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the emergency declared with respect to \nthe National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) is to \ncontinue in effect beyond September 26, 2000, to the Federal Register \nfor publication.\n  The circumstances that led to the declaration on September 26, 1993, \nof a national emergency have not been resolved. The actions and \npolicies of UNITA pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to \nthe foreign policy of the United States. United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolutions 864 (1993), 1127 (1997), 1173 (1998), and 1176 \n(1998) continue to oblige all member states to maintain sanctions. \nDiscontinuation of the sanctions would have a prejudicial effect on the \nprospects for peace in Angola. For these reasons, I have determined \nthat it is necessary to maintain in force the broad authorities \nnecessary to apply economic pressure on UNITA to reduce its ability to \npursue its military operations.\n                                                  William J.

The order also prohibits the sale or supply of such \ncommodities to UNITA. On December 12, 1997, in order to take additional \nsteps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive \nOrder 12865, I issued Executive Order 13069, closing all UNITA offices \nin the United States and imposing additional sanctions with regard to \nthe sale or supply of aircraft or aircraft parts, the granting of take-\noff, landing and overflight permission, and the provision of certain \naircraft-related services. On August 18, 1998, in order to take further \nsteps with respect to the national emergency declared in Executive \nOrder 12865, I issued Executive Order 13098, blocking all property and \ninterests in property of UNITA and designated UNITA officials and adult \nmembers of their immediate families, prohibiting the importation of \ncertain diamonds exported from Angola, and imposing additional \nsanctions with regard to the sale or supply of equipment used in \nmining, motorized vehicles, watercraft, spare parts for motorized \nvehicles or watercraft, mining services, and ground or waterborne \ntransportation services.\n  Because of our continuing international obligations and because of \nthe prejudicial effect that discontinuation of the sanctions would have \non prospects for peace in Angola, the national emergency declared on \nSeptember 26, 1993, and the measures adopted pursuant thereto to deal \nwith that emergency, must continue in effect beyond September 26, 2000. \nTherefore, in accordance with section 202(d) of the National \nEmergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)), I am continuing the national \nemergency with respect to UNITA.\n  This notice shall be published in the Federal Register and \ntransmitted to the Congress.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease and modify the exclusion relating to qualified small business; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              encouraging investment in small business act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Encouraging \nInvestment in Small Business Act, legislation intended to stimulate \nprivate investment in the entrepreneurs who drive our economy. I am \nvery pleased to be joined today by my good friend, the Senator from \nGeorgia, Mr. Cleland, and by the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, in introducing this important legislation. \nSenators Cleland and Roth both understand the importance of small \nbusinesses to our economy and have been tireless advocates on their \nbehalf.\n  The bill we are introducing today will encourage long-term investment \nin small and emerging businesses by rewarding individuals who risk \ninvestment in such firms. According to the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration, small firms account for three-quarters of the Nation's \nemployment growth and almost all of our net new jobs.\n  Small businesses employ more than 50 percent of all private workers, \nprovide 51 percent of our private sector output, and are responsible \nfor a disproportionate share of innovations. Moreover, small businesses \nare avenues of opportunity for women and minorities, younger and older \nworkers, and those making the transition from welfare to work.\n  At the same time, small businesses face unique financing challenges. \nI know this from my experience serving as the New England Administrator \nfor the Small Business Administration. There are so many small \nentrepreneurs who have a wonderful idea for an innovative product but \nsimply have great difficulty in getting the financing they need to get \nthat idea off the ground.\n  Simply put, entrepreneurs need access to more capital to start and \nexpand their businesses. Small businesses that cannot deliver ``dot-\ncom'' rates of return are particularly having trouble raising needed \nfunds. As the Small Business Administration noted earlier this year, \n``Adequate financing for rapidly growing firms will be America's \ngreatest economic policy challenge of the new century.''\n  A recent report by the National Commission on Entrepreneurship \npresented findings of 18 focus groups with more than 250 entrepreneurs \nfrom across the country. According to the report, these entrepreneurs \nwere ``nearly unanimous in identifying difficulties in obtaining seed \ncapital investments.'' That is the early stage financing that helps get \na business off the ground.\n  Moreover, minority-owned small businesses and research-intensive \nbusinesses that may take many years to develop a product find raising \nsufficient capital to be particularly difficult. Consider that it \ntakes, on average, 14 years for a biotechnology company to develop a \nnew pharmaceutical. This promising and growing sector of our economy \nrequires patient capital--and lots of it.\n\n[[Page S9034]]\n\n  Cheryl Timberlake, the executive director of the Biotechnology \nAssociation in my State, recently wrote to endorse the legislation I am \nintroducing today and to reinforce the need to stimulate more \ninvestment in biotech firms. Cheryl wrote that:\n\n       Many of the Maine biotech companies are still in the \n     research stage and rely on venture capital to fund their \n     innovative drug development. Most research-stage biotech \n     companies do not yet have products on the market. Without a \n     source of revenue, there are no profits to fund their \n     business. These companies are dependent on private investors \n     for most or all of their financial support. [Therefore, \n     the Biotechnology Association of Maine] believes that the \n     changes in . . . the Internal Revenue Code [such as you \n     propose] will enable more small business investment in our \n     member companies.\n\n  I think Cheryl summed up the problem well in Maine. We have a growing \nand diverse biotechnology sector, but they are having difficulty in \nfinding the kind of financial support that they need to grow.\n  I also received recently a letter of support from the executive \ndirector of the National Commission on Entrepreneurship. He noted that \nstartup companies are ``struggling to find access to equity investments \n[particularly in the range] between $100,000 and $3 million.''\n  His letter continues:\n\n       So the question becomes: how can we motivate more \n     individuals with investment capital, who may not have \n     previous experience with entrepreneurial companies, to invest \n     in such companies at the ``seed'' or ``early-stage'' level? \n     The Encouraging investment in Small Business Act, by \n     increasing the incentives provided by Section 1202 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code, may well provide one important part of \n     the answer to this question.\n\n  Similarly, the National Federation of Independent Business, our \nNation's largest small business group, has also written in support of \nthe legislation that the Senator from Georgia and I are introducing \ntoday.\n  Dan Danner wrote:\n\n       Unfortunately, while our nation's current prosperity has \n     brought unprecedented funds to certain sectors of our \n     economy, small business entrepreneurs still lack access to \n     valuable capital needed to start and expand their businesses.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the three letters from \nwhich I quoted this morning be printed in the Record, in their \nentirety.\n  There being no objection, the letter were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Biotechnology Association\n\n\n                                                     of Maine,\n\n                                     Augusta, ME, August 28, 2000.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Biotechnology \n     Association of Maine (BAM), a trade organization representing \n     Maine's biotechnology companies, our affiliated educational \n     institutions, and the not for profit research organizations. \n     I am writing to endorse the Encouraging Small Business Act.\n       In an industry survey conducted by our sister organization \n     the Center for Innovation in Biotechnology (CIB), the first \n     most critical challenge to the success of biotechnology firms \n     in Maine is financing. The incredible pace of new \n     technological developments create unceasing demands for new \n     and established companies to remain competitive and grow. All \n     efforts to stay competitive require investment. Businesses in \n     Maine involved in biotechnology and life sciences look for \n     any opportunity to increase their financial footing.\n       Many of the Maine biotech companies are still in the \n     research stage and rely on venture capital to fund their \n     innovative drug development. Most research-stage biotech \n     companies do not yet have products in the market. Without a \n     source of revenue, there are no profits to fund their \n     business. These companies are dependent on private investors \n     for most or all of their financial support.\n       BAM believes the changes in Section 1202 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code, as proposed will enable more small business \n     investment in our member companies. The changes will enable \n     private investors to use the Code, as it was intended and \n     eliminate the duplication and unnecessary provisions that \n     complicate the process. The key is to encourage investment, \n     in whatever means possible. It should be recognized that the \n     Section 1202 has proven useful to small and large companies, \n     but it frequently burdensome, with difficult accounting \n     procedures and other unrelated hurdles.\n       On behalf of the Biotechnology Association of Maine, I \n     appreciate your continued leadership and thank you for \n     proposing the Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act. \n     We look forward to working with you on passage of this \n     important piece bill. Thank you.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                             Cheryl C.

Susan M. Collins,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: I congratulate you on your \n     introduction of The Encouraging Investment in Small Business \n     Act of 2000. The bill represents one way that tax policy can \n     help address the current ``capital gap'' facing emerging \n     high-growth companies throughout the country, especially in \n     regions just beginning to build entrepreneurial economies.\n       The National Commission on Entrepreneurship has just \n     completed 18 focus groups with 250 entrepreneurs around the \n     country. We asked these entrepreneurs to tell us what key \n     external constraints face the start-up and growth of their \n     companies. Finding qualified people--from entry level to \n     technical to management employees--was their number one \n     concern. But also very high on their lists was a growing \n     ``seed capital'' or ``early-stage capital'' gap. \n     Entrepreneurial companies are struggling to find access to \n     equity investments roughly between $100,000 and $3,000,000.\n       In brief, the ``early stage capital'' problem is this. \n     Entrepreneurs can cobble together the equity they need up to \n     about $100,000 through the use of credit cards, second \n     mortgages, and cash investments from friends and family. And \n     if they are building a company, say in ``hot'' sectors like \n     the Internet or biotech, where the dynamics of the industry \n     require extraordinary amounts of cash early in a firm's life, \n     they can find venture capital firms to invest a minimum of \n     three to five million dollars. But if they need less than \n     $3,000,000 for the near future, investors at that funding \n     level are very hard to find.\n       Highly developed entrepreneurial regions provide this \n     ``early-stage capital'' typically in the form of organized \n     ``angel'' investor networks. ``Angels'' are usually \n     previously successful entrepreneurs and other wealthy \n     investors connected with the entrepreneurial economy in their \n     regions who regularly and systematically review potential \n     investments. They then serve either as board members or \n     mentors to their new investee companies, and prepare them for \n     a round of venture capital investment or acquisition by \n     another company or an initial public offering.\n       Unfortunately, regions just beginning to build \n     entrepreneurial economies do not yet have these ``angel \n     networks'' in place. So the question becomes: how can we \n     motivate more individuals with investment capital, who may \n     not have previous experience with entrepreneurial companies, \n     to invest in such companies at the ``seed'' or ``early-\n     stage'' level?\n       The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act, by \n     increasing the incentives provided by Section 1202 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code, may well provide one important part of \n     the answer to this question. While we have not reviewed in \n     detail all the provisions of your legislation, your bill \n     takes two important steps in this direction.\n       First, the bill accounts for post-1993 changes in tax rates \n     for capital gains of all kinds, by increasing the capital \n     gains exclusion for investments in small businesses from 50% \n     to 75%. And second, the bill excludes the gains from these \n     investments from calculations under the Alternative Minimum \n     Tax (AMT) provisions of the Code. Combined with the other \n     provisions of your bill that simplify the use of Section \n     1202, the tax incentives could well motivate many more \n     investors to allocate more of their investment dollars to \n     high-growth entrepreneurial companies. Typically, the \n     combined investments of several individuals in one such \n     company would amount to meeting the critical ``seed'' or \n     ``early stage'' capital needs of that company.\n       We look forward to working with you as your legislation \n     moves forward and would be delighted to provide any \n     additional information about ``angel'' investing and the \n     growing ``early-stage'' capital gap. To that end, I have \n     taken the liberty of attaching a copy of one of our bi-weekly \n     columns that addresses the topic.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Patrick Von Bargen,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             NFIB, The Voice of Small Business\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I \n     want to express our support for the Encouraging Investment in \n     Small Business Act, which you will be introducing in \n     September.\n       As you are aware, small businesses are the engines driving \n     our economy. They constitute 98 percent of all businesses in \n     America, and they employ almost 60 percent of the workforce. \n     Additionally, small businesses have created roughly two-\n     thirds of the net new jobs in the American economy since the \n     early 1970's.\n       Unfortunately, while our nation's current prosperity has \n     brought unprecedented funds to certain sectors of our \n     economy, small business entrepreneurs still lack the access \n     to valuable capital needed to start and expand their \n     businesses.\n       Your legislation goes along way towards addressing this \n     problem. By reforming and improving Section 1202 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code, investors will now have a true \n     incentive to invest in small businesses. Under current law, \n     Section 1202 is no longer a viable option in many of the \n     circumstances it\n\n[[Page S9035]]\n\n     was originally intended to address. Moreover, Section 1202's \n     impact will continue to be diluted by a scheduled decrease in \n     long-term capital gains rates applicable to most stock \n     purchased after 2000 and the probability that still more \n     taxpayers will be subject to the extremely complicated and \n     cumbersome Alternative Minimum Tax. The Encouraging \n     Investment in Small Business Act would eliminate unnecessary \n     complexity in Section 1202 and make it a more robust engine \n     of capital formation for small businesses.\n       Senator Collins, thank you for your continued support of \n     small businesses. We look forward to working with you to get \n     the Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act enacted into \n     law.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                            Federal Public Policy.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if we want to remain the world's most \nentrepreneurial country, which is certainly the strength of this \nNation, where small businesses generate the ideas and create the jobs \nthat fuel our economy, we must continue to create an environment that \nnurtures and supports entrepreneurs. Our bill would help to create such \nan environment, not by establishing a new Federal program or adding a \ncomplicated new section to our Tax Code but, rather, by simplifying and \nimproving a provision that is already there.\n  By way of background, section 1202 was added to the Internal Revenue \nCode in 1993 in order to encourage investment in small business. The \nbill that created this section was introduced by senator Dale Bumpers \nand enjoyed widespread bipartisan support. Similarly, the legislation \nwe introduce today will improve upon the 1993 legislation.\n  In brief, section 1202 of the Internal Revenue Code permits \nnoncorporate taxpayers to exclude from gross income 50 percent of the \ngain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock, known \nas QSB stock, held for more than 5 years. The concept is a sound one. \nIn practice, however, this section has proven to be cumbersome to use \nand less advantageous than originally intended.\n  As an article in the December 1998 edition of the Tax Adviser noted:\n\n       Section 1202 places numerous and complex requirements on \n     both the qualified small business and the shareholder.\n\n  The article went on to note that the provision ``is no longer the \ndeal it seemed to be.''\n  The Encouraging investment in Small Business Act would amend section \n1202 to eliminate unnecessary complexity and to make it a more robust \nengine of capital formation for small business. As it stands now, that \nengine needs some fine-tuning. Given the reductions in capital gains \nrates subsequent to section 1202's enactment and the fact that more and \nmore taxpayers are now subject to the alternative minimum tax, section \n1202 is no longer a viable option in many circumstances. Moreover, its \nimpact will continue to be diluted by a scheduled decrease in long-term \ncapital gains rates applicable to most stock purchased after the year \n2000, as well as the probability that still more taxpayers will be \nsubject to the AMT.\n  The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act makes a number of \nimprovements to this section of the code. First, the bill increases the \namount of qualified small business stock gain that an individual can \nexclude from gross income from 50 percent to 75 percent. Second, the \nlegislation strikes the section of the Tax Code that makes a portion of \nthe section 1202 exclusion a preference item under the alternative \nminimum tax. These two changes rejuvenate the section and make it the \npotent generator of small business capital that it was intended to be.\n  Currently, an individual who invested in QSB stock, sold it, and \nfound her or himself subject to the AMT, would face an effective \ncapital gains rate of 19.9 percent or just .1 percent less than the \nexisting rate on long-term capital gains. When we consider that the \nnumber of taxpayers subject to the AMT is predicted to triple over the \nnext 5 years, it becomes crystal clear that a fix is needed now. The \nlegislation would take additional steps to make section 1202 more \nattractive to small businesses and investors.\n  The legislation may sound complicated and, indeed, revising tax law \nis always a challenge, but the bottom line is that our legislation \nmakes a number of common sense changes that are all designed to \nencourage more investment in small businesses, the engine of our \neconomy.\n\n  These changes have been endorsed by the leading small business \norganizations. They are changes recommended by a recent Securities and \nExchange Commission forum on small business capital formation, and they \nare the changes needed to accommodate and, indeed, to foster the \ncapital-raising needs of small business, the foundation of our national \neconomy.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I applaud the distinguished Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins, for her gargantuan effort to tackle the Byzantine \naspects of the U.S. Tax Code to see if there is some way we can assist \nour venture capitalists to help our small businesses, particularly our \nhigh-tech small business more.\n  It is a pleasure to work with Senator Collins, not only in this \nendeavor but in other endeavors. We serve together on the Government \nAffairs Committee. One of our responsibilities is oversight of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission which looks at the world of \ninvestments in businesses in this country. I applaud her for her \ninsight, for her innovation in this area, she is right on target. I am \npleased to associate myself with her remarks today and pleased to \ncosponsor the legislation of which she speaks.\n  On that point, in terms of being relevant to what is driving the \nAmerican economy, not only in my home State of Georgia, particularly in \nAtlanta, where more and more high-tech businesses are located, but in \nSilicon Valley, where I just got back from a tour in early August, it \nis obvious that we are generating a lot of talented young minds in \nAmerica with great ideas and that those young minds can form together, \nand with the right capital at the right time can generate businesses \nthat literally were unknown or unheard of just months ago. We see those \nkind of successes now driving the American economy. Information \ntechnology economies now provide the leading edge for American economic \ngrowth and our prosperity. I couldn't agree more with the Senator from \nMaine. We will do everything in our power to assist this legislation \nand move it forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN:\n  S. 3098. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to phase \nin a full estate tax deduction for family-owned business interests; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        estate tax deduction for family-owned business interests\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one of the things Americans like least \nabout Congress is the way we wrangle over things we don't agree about \ninstead of acting on things we can agree about.\n  The estate tax is a case in point. There is wide agreement in the \nSenate that we should act to eliminate the burden of the estate tax on \nfamily farms and businesses. We could accomplish that this year--this \nweek in fact--with little fuss or ado.\n  I propose that we do just that, and save for later the parts of the \nestate tax that we don't agree on. We should not hold the family farms \nand businesses of this nation hostage to the heirs of multi-billion-\ndollar investment fortunes. We can address that problem right now so \nlet's do it.\n  We often forget in this country that a family is an economic unit as \nwell as a social unit. This nation was built upon an economy of family-\nbased farms and businesses. That is why the values of family--a \ncommitment to community, a loyalty to place, a sense of tradition \npassing through the generations--were an important part of the economy \nin the formative days of our republic.\n  Those values weakened as the economy became national and corporate. \nThey have weakened further still as the economy has become global, and \nthe cold calculus of the global marketplace has displaced \nconsiderations of family and community in our economic life.\n  In this setting it is crucial that we strive to keep the family farms \nand businesses that we have, and to encourage new ones. Family-based \nenterprise\n\n[[Page S9036]]\n\nprovides a counterweight to the centrifugal forces of the global \neconomy. It can help to anchor the market in values and concerns that \nthe large impersonal corporation does not share, and we should \nencourage this form of enterprise whenever we can.\n  Certainly the Federal Government never should force the sale of such \nan enterprise just to pay an estate tax. That does not happen often \ntoday. But not often is still too often. It should never happen, and \nthat is why I am introducing a bill today to make sure it doesn't.\n  Under this bill, the estate tax on farms and businesses under active \nfamily management would phase out over 6 years, until by 2006 it would \nbe gone completely.\n  This bill is different from the one that passed this Chamber earlier \nthis year in one key respect: It applies onto family farms and \nbusinesses passed along to the next generation. It does not apply to \nthe heirs of multi-billion dollar investment fortunes and the like. \nThere was a strange disconnect in the debate over that earlier bill. \nVirtually all the talk from proponents was about family farms and \nbusinesses. Yet the bulk of the actual belief of their bill would have \ngone to the heirs of investment fortunes instead.\n  That is why many of us voted against the bill. The walk didn't match \nthe talk. And that is why I am proposing today that, for once, we move \nforward on what we do agree on instead of wrangling continuously, for \npolitical advantage, over what we don't. Large stock fortunes are not \nthe same as family farms and businesses. They raise a different set of \nquestions where the estate tax is concerned, and we ought to deal with \nthose questions separately and at a later time.\n  This is not the place to debate the merits of the estate tax as it \napplies to large fortunes as opposed to operating farms and businesses. \nI will just note briefly a few of the reasons why many of us could not \nsupport the previous bill.\n  For one thing, the tax was enacted out of the conviction that those \nwho have benefited most from our democracy in the past ought to \ncontribute to its security and well-being in the future. That was true \nback in 1916 and it is equally true today. To repeal the estate tax \ncompletely would shift the burden of paying for the Federal Government \neven more onto the working men and women of this country. That is not \nfair.\n  Second, the estate tax encourages people with large fortunes to make \nsignificant contributions to charity. If we are going to rely less on \ngovernment in addressing our social problems, and more on the efforts \nof individuals and private nonprofit organizations, then we must not \ndry up a prime source of funding for these efforts.\n  Third, the estate tax encourages the work ethic, as it applies to \nestates other than family-based farms and businesses. Those who might \notherwise be able to live on inherited fortunes occasionally have to \nsome useful work instead.\n  I know that there is disagreement on these points. They deserve an \nhonest debate. But as I said, we should not hold family based farms and \nbusinesses hostage to that debate. We can agree that help for these \nfamily based enterprises is the first priority of estate tax reform. We \ncan agree that no family farm or family business should have to be sold \nto pay an estate tax.\n  So let's do that now and save the rest for another day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 3099. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe exemption from tax for small property and casualty insurance \ncompanies, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          Small Property and Casualty Insurance Exemption Act\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to clarify the \ntax exemption status for small property and casualty insurance \ncompanies. These small companies are vitally important to provide \nneeded services for our rural and farming communities.\n  Under current law, an insurance company with up to $350,000 in \npremium is tax-exempt. In addition, companies with premiums that exceed \n$350,000 but do not exceed $1,200,000 are allowed to elect to be taxed \non their net investment income.\n  Investment income or assets are not considered when determining \nqualification for either tax-exempt status or investment income \ntaxation. These companies are allowed to elect to be taxed on their net \ninvestment income.\n  Early this year, President proposed in his FY 2001 budget to modify \nthis calculation to include investment and other types of income. The \nproposal would also change the tax law to allow companies with premiums \nbelow $350,000 to elect to be taxed on their net investment income.\n  By including investment income into the calculation, it is the intent \nof the administration to prohibit foreign companies and other large \ninsurers from sheltering income from taxes.\n  However, by including investment into the calculation, the intended \nbeneficiaries, small property and casualty insurance companies, will \nnot be able to qualify for the exemption defeating the intent of \nCongress and purpose for the provision.\n  Mr. President, since 1921, small insurance companies have been exempt \nfrom federal taxation so that all their financial resources could be \nused for claims paying.\n  It has been the public policy goal to maintain small, rural, farm-\noriented insurers so that all Americans would have access to coverage \nat a reasonable cost.\n  While the administration's goal of closing the loophole is admirable, \nthe current proposal would only serve to harm the small U.S. farm \ninsurance company that the provision is there to protect.\n  My legislation would close the loophole by limiting the provision to \nonly those companies that are directly owned by their policyholders and \nthe company operates in only one state.\n  In addition, the legislation would increase the tax exemption level \nfrom $350,000 to $531,000, indexed for inflation every year thereafter, \nand it would increase the investment income election from $1.2 million \nto $1.8 million, indexed for inflation every year thereafter.\n  The last time these levels were increased was 1986. Inflation has \neroded the levels to the point of being irrelevant. The increased \nlevels were calculated by using the CPI to adjust the levels for \ninflation.\n  Mr. President, by making these changes we can ensure that our rural \nand farming communities will continue to receive the needed insurance \nservices. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9036-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9036-S9037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 670\n\n  At the request of Mr. Jeffords, the name of the Senator from Utah \n(Mr. Hatch) was added as a cosponsor of S. 670, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide that the exclusion from gross \nincome for foster care payments shall also apply to payments by \nqualifying placement agencies, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1536\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the names of the Senator from Vermont \n(Mr. Leahy), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi) and the Senator from \nKansas (Mr. Roberts) were added as cosponsors of S. 1536, a bill to \namend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to extend authorizations of \nappropriations for programs under the Act, to modernize programs and \nservices for older individuals, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1855\n\n  At the request of Mr. Murkowski, the name of the Senator from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Feinstein) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1855, a bill \nto establish age limitations for airmen.\n\n\n                                S. 2264\n\n  At the request of Mr. Rockefeller, the name of the Senator from New \nMexico (Mr. Bingaman) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2264, a bill to \namend title 38, United States Code, to establish within the Veterans \nHealth Administration the position of Advisor on Physician Assistants, \nand for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2686\n\n  At the request of Mr. Cochran, the name of the Senator from Georgia \n(Mr. Cleland) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2686, a bill to amend \nchapter 36 of title 39, United States Code, to modify rates relating to \nreduced rate mail matter, and for other purposes.\n\n[[Page S9037]]\n\n                                S. 2787\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grams, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n2787, a bill to reauthorize the Federal programs to prevent violence \nagainst women, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2986\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hutchinson, the name of the Senator from \nWyoming (Mr. Enzi) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2986, a bill to limit \nthe issuance of regulations relating to Federal contractor \nresponsibility, to require the Comptroller General to conduct a review \nof Federal contractor compliance with applicable laws, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                            S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Ecstasy Anti-\n     Proliferation Act of 2000''.\n\n      SEC. 3662. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The illegal importation of 3,4-methylenedioxy \n     methamphetamine, commonly referred to as ``MDMA'' or \n     ``Ecstasy'' (referred to in this subtitle as ``Ecstasy''), \n     has increased in recent years, as evidenced by the fact that \n     Ecstasy seizures by the United States Customs Service have \n     increased from less than 500,000 tablets during fiscal year \n     1997 to more than 9,000,000 tablets during the first 9 months \n     of fiscal year 2000.\n       (2) Use of Ecstasy can cause long-lasting, and perhaps \n     permanent, damage to the serotonin system of the brain, which \n     is fundamental to the integration of information and emotion, \n     and this damage can cause long-term problems with learning \n     and memory.\n       (3) Due to the popularity and marketability of Ecstasy, \n     there are numerous Internet websites with information on the \n     effects of Ecstasy, the production of Ecstasy, and the \n     locations of Ecstasy use (often referred to as ``raves''). \n     The availability of this information targets the primary \n     users of Ecstasy, who are most often college students, young \n     professionals, and other young people from middle- to high-\n     income families.\n       (4) Greater emphasis needs to be placed on--\n       (A) penalties associated with the manufacture, \n     distribution, and use of Ecstasy;\n       (B) the education of young people on the negative health \n     effects of Ecstasy, since the reputation of Ecstasy as a \n     ``safe'' drug is the most dangerous component of Ecstasy;\n       (C) the education of State and local law enforcement \n     agencies regarding the growing problem of Ecstasy trafficking \n     across the United States;\n       (D) reducing the number of deaths caused by Ecstasy use and \n     the combined use of Ecstasy with other ``club'' drugs and \n     alcohol; and\n       (E) adequate funding for research by the National Institute \n     on Drug Abuse to--\n       (i) identify those most vulnerable to using Ecstasy and \n     develop science-based prevention approaches tailored to the \n     specific needs of individuals at high risk;\n       (ii) understand how Ecstasy produces its toxic effects and \n     how to reverse neurotoxic damage;\n       (iii) develop treatments, including new medications and \n     behavioral treatment approaches;\n       (iv) better understand the effects that Ecstasy has on the \n     developing children and adolescents; and\n       (v) translate research findings into useful tools and \n     ensure their effective dissemination.\n\n     SEC. 3663. ENHANCED PUNISHMENT OF ECSTASY TRAFFICKERS.\n\n       (a) Amendment to Federal Sentencing Guidelines.--Pursuant \n     to its authority under section 994(p) of title 28, United \n     States Code, the United States Sentencing Commission \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Commission'') shall \n     amend the Federal sentencing guidelines regarding any offense \n     relating to the manufacture, importation, or exportation of, \n     or trafficking in--\n       (1) 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine;\n       (2) 3,4-methylenedioxy amphetamine;\n       (3) 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-ethylamphetamine;\n       (4) paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMA); or\n       (5) any other controlled substance, as determined by the \n     Commission in consultation with the Attorney General, that is \n     marketed as Ecstasy and that has either a chemical structure \n     substantially similar to that of 3,4-methylenedioxy \n     methamphetamine or an effect on the central nervous system \n     substantially similar to or greater than that of 3,4-\n     methylenedioxy methamphetamine;\n\n     including an attempt or conspiracy to commit an offense \n     described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5) in \n     violation of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et \n     seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 951 et seq.), or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act \n     (46 U.S.C. 1901 et seq.).\n       (b) General Requirements.--In carrying out this section, \n     the Commission shall, with respect to each offense described \n     in subsection (a)--\n       (1) review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to \n     provide for increased penalties such that those penalties \n     reflect the seriousness of these offenses and the need to \n     deter them; and\n       (2) take any other action the Commission considers to be \n     necessary to carry out this section.\n       (c) Additional Requirements.--In carrying out this section, \n     the Commission shall ensure that the Federal sentencing \n     guidelines for offenders convicted of offenses described in \n     subsection (a) reflect--\n       (1) the need for aggressive law enforcement action with \n     respect to offenses involving the controlled substances \n     described in subsection (a); and\n       (2) the dangers associated with unlawful activity involving \n     such substances, including--\n       (A) the rapidly growing incidence of abuse of the \n     controlled substances described in subsection (a) and the \n     threat to public safety that such abuse poses;\n       (B) the recent increase in the illegal importation of the \n     controlled substances described in subsection (a);\n       (C) the young age at which children are beginning to use \n     the controlled substances described in subsection (a);\n       (D) the fact that the controlled substances described in \n     subsection (a) are frequently marketed to youth;\n       (E) the large number of doses per gram of the controlled \n     substances described in subsection (a); and\n       (F) any other factor that the Commission determines to be \n     appropriate.\n       (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the base offense levels for Ecstasy are too low, \n     particularly for high-level traffickers, and should be \n     increased, such that they are comparable to penalties for \n     other drugs of abuse; and\n       (2) based on the fact that importation of Ecstasy has \n     surged in the past few years, the traffickers are targeting \n     the Nation's youth, and the use of Ecstasy among youth in the \n     United States is increasing even as other drug use among this \n     population appears to be leveling off, the base offense \n     levels for importing and trafficking the controlled \n     substances described in subsection (a) should be increased.\n       (e) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the amendments \n     pursuant to this section\n\n[[Page S9088]]\n\n     have been promulgated, the Commission shall--\n       (1) prepare a report describing the factors and information \n     considered by the Commission in promulgating amendments \n     pursuant to this section; and\n       (2) submit the report to--\n       (A) the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and the Committee on \n     Appropriations of the Senate; and\n       (B) the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on \n     Commerce, and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 3664.

GENERAL FINDINGS REGARDING FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Value of Research and Development.--The Congress makes \n     the following\n\n[[Page S9089]]\n\n     findings with respect to the value of research and \n     development to the United States:\n       (1) Federal investment in research has resulted in the \n     development of technology that has saved lives in the United \n     States and around the world.\n       (2) The research and development investment across all \n     Federal agencies has been effective in creating technology \n     that has enhanced the American quality of life.\n       (3) The Federal investment in research and development \n     conducted or underwritten by both military and civilian \n     agencies has produced benefits that have been felt in both \n     the private and public sector.\n       (4) Discoveries across the spectrum of scientific inquiry \n     have the potential to raise the standard of living and the \n     quality of life for all Americans.\n       (5) Science, engineering, and technology play a critical \n     role in shaping the modern world.\n       (6) Studies show that about half of all United States post-\n     World War II economic growth is a direct result of technical \n     innovation; science, engineering, and technology contribute \n     to the creation of new goods and services, new jobs and new \n     capital.\n       (7) Technical innovation is the principal driving force \n     behind the long-term economic growth and increased standards \n     of living of the world's modern industrial societies. Other \n     nations are well aware of the pivotal role of science, \n     engineering, and technology, and they are seeking to exploit \n     it wherever possible to advance their own global \n     competitiveness.\n       (8) Federal programs for investment in research, which lead \n     to technological innovation and result in economic growth, \n     should be structured to address current funding disparities \n     and develop enhanced capability in States and regions that \n     currently are underrepresented in the national science and \n     technology enterprise.\n       (b) Status of the Federal Investment.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to the status of the \n     Federal investment in research and development activities:\n       (1) Civilian research and development expenditures reached \n     their pinnacle in the mid-1960s due to the Apollo Space \n     program, declining for several years thereafter. Despite \n     significant growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s, these \n     expenditures, in constant dollars, have not returned to the \n     levels of the 1960s.\n       (2) Fiscal realities now challenge Congress and the \n     President to steer the Federal Government's role in science, \n     engineering, and technology in a manner that ensures a \n     prudent use of limited public resources. There is both a \n     long-term problem--addressing the ever-increasing level of \n     mandatory spending--and a near-term challenge--apportioning a \n     dwindling amount of discretionary funding to an increasing \n     range of targets in science, engineering, and technology. \n     This confluence of increased national dependency on \n     technology, increased targets of opportunity, and decreased \n     fiscal flexibility has created a problem of national urgency. \n     Many indicators show that more funding for science, \n     engineering, and technology is needed but, even with \n     increased funding, priorities must be established among \n     different programs. The United States cannot afford the \n     luxury of fully funding all deserving programs.\n\n     SEC. 102. SPECIAL FINDINGS REGARDING HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings with respect to \n     health-related research:\n       (1) Health and economic benefits provided by health-related \n     research.--Because of health-related research, cures for many \n     debilitating and fatal diseases have been discovered and \n     deployed. At present, the medical research community is on \n     the cusp of creating cures for a number of leading diseases \n     and their associated burdens. In particular, medical research \n     has the potential to develop treatments that can help manage \n     the escalating costs associated with the aging of the United \n     States population.\n       (2) Funding of health-related research.--Many studies have \n     recognized that clinical and basic science are in a state of \n     crisis because of a failure of resources to meet the \n     opportunity. Consequently, health-related research has \n     emerged as a national priority and has been given \n     significantly increased funding by Congress in both fiscal \n     year 1999 and fiscal year 2000. In order to continue \n     addressing this urgent national need, the pattern of \n     substantial budgetary expansion begun in fiscal year 1999 \n     should be maintained.\n       (3) Interdisciplinary nature of health-related research.--\n     Because all fields of science and engineering are \n     interdependent, full realization of the Nation's historic \n     investment in health will depend on major advances both in \n     the biomedical sciences and in other science and engineering \n     disciplines. Hence, the vitality of all disciplines must be \n     preserved, even as special considerations are given to the \n     health research field.\n\n     SEC. 103. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING THE LINK BETWEEN \n                   RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Flow of science, engineering, and technology.--The \n     process of science, engineering, and technology involves many \n     steps. The present Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology structure reinforces the increasingly artificial \n     distinctions between basic and applied activities. The result \n     too often is a set of discrete programs that each support a \n     narrow phase of research or development and are not \n     coordinated with one another. The Government should maximize \n     its investment by encouraging the progression of science, \n     engineering, and technology from the earliest stages of \n     research up to a pre-commercialization stage, through funding \n     agencies and vehicles appropriate for each stage. This \n     creates a flow of technology, subject to merit review at each \n     stage, so that promising technology is not lost in a \n     bureaucratic maze.\n       (2) Excellence in american university research \n     infrastructure.--Federal investment in science, engineering, \n     and technology programs must foster a close relationship \n     between research and education. Investment in research at the \n     university level creates more than simply world-class \n     research. It creates world-class researchers as well. The \n     Federal strategy must continue to reflect this commitment to \n     a strong geographically-diverse research infrastructure. \n     Furthermore, the United States must find ways to extend the \n     excellence of its university system to primary and secondary \n     educational institutions and to better utilize the community \n     college system to prepare many students for vocational \n     opportunities in an increasingly technical workplace.\n       (3) Commitment to a broad range of research initiatives.--\n     An increasingly common theme in many recent technical \n     breakthroughs has been the importance of revolutionary \n     innovations that were sparked by overlapping of research \n     disciplines. The United States must continue to encourage \n     this trend by providing and encouraging opportunities for \n     interdisciplinary projects that foster collaboration among \n     fields of research.\n       (4) Partnerships among industry, universities, and federal \n     laboratories.--Each of these contributors to the national \n     science and technology delivery system has special talents \n     and abilities that complement the others. In addition, each \n     has a central mission that must provide their focus and each \n     has limited resources. The Nation's investment in science, \n     engineering, and technology can be optimized by seeking \n     opportunities for leveraging the resources and talents of \n     these three major players through partnerships that do not \n     distort the missions of each partner. For that reason, \n     Federal dollars are wisely spent forming such partnerships.\n\n     SEC. 104. MAINTENANCE OF FEDERAL RESEARCH EFFORT; GUIDING \n                   PRINCIPLES.\n\n       (a) Maintaining United States Leadership in Science, \n     Engineering, and Technology.--It is imperative for the United \n     States to nurture its superb resources in science, \n     engineering, and technology carefully in order to maintain \n     its own globally competitive position.\n       (b) Guiding Principles.--Federal research and development \n     programs should be conducted in accordance with the following \n     guiding principles:\n       (1) Good science.--Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology programs include both knowledge-driven science \n     together with its applications, and mission-driven, science-\n     based requirements. In general, both types of programs must \n     be focused, peer- and merit-reviewed, and not unnecessarily \n     duplicative, although the details of these attributes must \n     vary with different program objectives.\n       (2) Fiscal accountability.--The Congress must exercise \n     oversight to ensure that programs funded with scarce Federal \n     dollars are well managed. The United States cannot tolerate \n     waste of money through inefficient management techniques, \n     whether by Government agencies, by contractors, or by \n     Congress itself. Fiscal resources would be better utilized if \n     program and project funding levels were predictable across \n     several years to enable better project planning; a benefit of \n     such predictability would be that agencies and Congress can \n     better exercise oversight responsibilities through \n     comparisons of a project's and program's progress against \n     carefully planned milestones and international benchmarks.\n       (3) Program effectiveness.--The United States needs to make \n     sure that Government programs achieve their goals. As the \n     Congress crafts science, engineering, and technology \n     legislation, it must include a process for gauging program \n     effectiveness, selecting criteria based on sound scientific \n     judgment and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. The Congress \n     should also avoid the trap of measuring the effectiveness of \n     a broad science, engineering, and technology program by \n     passing judgment on individual projects. Lastly, the Congress \n     must recognize that a negative result in a well-conceived and \n     executed project or program may still be critically important \n     to the funding agency.\n       (4) Criteria for Government funding.--Program selection for \n     Federal funding should continue to reflect the Nation's 2 \n     traditional research and development priorities: (A) basic, \n     scientific, and technological research that represents \n     investments in the Nation's long-term future scientific and \n     technological capacity, for which Government has \n     traditionally served as the principal resource; and (B) \n     mission research investments, that is, investments in \n     research that derive from necessary public functions, such as \n     defense, health, education, environmental protection, all of \n     which may also raise the standard of living, which may \n     include pre-commercial, pre-competitive engineering research \n     and technology development. Additionally, Government funding \n     should not compete with or displace the short-term, market-\n     driven, and typically\n\n[[Page S9090]]\n\n     more specific nature of private-sector funding. Government \n     funding should be restricted to pre-competitive activities, \n     leaving competitive activities solely for the private sector. \n     As a rule, the Government should not invest in commercial \n     technology that is in the product development stage, very \n     close to the broad commercial marketplace, except to meet a \n     specific agency goal. When the Government provides funding \n     for any science, engineering, and technology investment \n     program, it must take reasonable steps to ensure that the \n     potential benefits derived from the program will accrue \n     broadly.\n\n     SEC. 105.

This could threaten American dominance of \n     high-technology industrial leadership.\n       (d) Future Fiscal Year Allocations.--\n       (1) Goal.--The goal of this title is to increase the \n     percentage of the Federal discretionary budget allocated for \n     civilian research and development by 0.3 percent annually to \n     realize a total of 10 percent of the Federal discretionary \n     budget by fiscal year 2011.\n       (2) Amounts authorized.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to the agencies listed in subsection (b) for \n     civilian research and development the following amounts:\n       (A) $43,080,000,000 for fiscal year 2001.\n       (B) $45,160,000,000 for fiscal year 2002.\n       (C) $47,820,000,000 for fiscal year 2003.\n       (D) $50,540,000,000 for fiscal year 2004.\n       (E) $53,410,000,000 for fiscal year 2005.\n       (3) Fiscal years 2006-2011.--There is authorized to be \n     appropriated to the agencies listed in subsection (b) for \n     civilian research and development for each of the fiscal \n     years 2006 through 2011 an amount that, on the basis of \n     projections of Federal discretionary budget amounts as such \n     projections become available, will meet the goal established \n     by paragraph (1).\n       (4) Acceleration to meet national needs.--\n       (A) In general.--If an agency listed in subsection (b) has \n     an accelerated funding fiscal year, then, except as provided \n     by subparagraph (C), the amount authorized by paragraph (2) \n     or determined under paragraph (3) for the fiscal year \n     following the accelerated funding fiscal year shall be \n     determined in accordance with subparagraph (B).\n       (B) Exclusion of accelerated funding agency.--The amount \n     authorized to be appropriated for civilian research and \n     development under this subparagraph for a fiscal year shall \n     be determined--\n       (i) by reducing the total amount that, but for subparagraph \n     (A), would be authorized to be appropriated by paragraph (2) \n     or paragraph (3) by a percentage equal to the percentage of \n     the total amount authorized by that paragraph for the fiscal \n     year preceding the accelerated funding fiscal year to the \n     agency that had the accelerated funding fiscal year; and\n       (ii) allocating the reduced amount among all agencies \n     listed in subsection (b) other than the agency that had the \n     accelerated funding fiscal year.\n       (C) Exception to accelerated funding agency rule.--\n     Subparagraph (B) does not apply if the amount appropriated to \n     an agency for civilian research and development purposes for \n     a fiscal year, adjusted for inflation (assuming an annual \n     rate of inflation of 3 percent), does not exceed the amount \n     appropriated to that agency for those purposes for fiscal \n     year 2000 increased by 2.5 percent a year for each fiscal \n     year after fiscal year 2000.\n       (D) Accelerated funding fiscal year defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term ``accelerated funding fiscal year'' \n     means a fiscal year for which the amount appropriated to an \n     agency for civilian research and development purposes is an \n     increase of more than 8 percent over the amount appropriated \n     to that agency for the preceding fiscal year for those \n     purposes.\n       (e) Conformance with Budgetary Caps.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, no funds may be made available under \n     this title in a manner that does not conform with the \n     discretionary spending caps provided in the most recently \n     adopted concurrent resolution on the budget or threatens the \n     economic stability of the annual budget.\n       (f) Balanced Research Portfolio.--Because of the \n     interdependent nature of the scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, the aggregate funding levels authorized by the \n     section assume that the Federal research portfolio will be \n     well-balanced among the various scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, and geographically dispersed throughout the \n     States.\n       (g) Congressional Authorization Process.--The policies and \n     authorizations in this Act establish minimum levels for the \n     overall Federal civilian research portfolio across the \n     agencies listed in subsection (b) under the procedures \n     defined in subsection (d). The amounts authorized by \n     subsection (d) establish a framework within which the \n     authorizing committees of the Congress are to work when \n     authorizing funding for specific Federal agencies engaged in \n     science, engineering, and technology activities.\n\n     SEC. 106. ANNUAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ANALYSES.\n\n       The Director of the Office of Science and Technology shall \n     provide, no later than February 15th of each year, a report \n     to Congress that includes--\n       (1) a detailed summary of the total level of funding for \n     civilian research and development programs throughout all \n     Federal agencies;\n       (2) a focused strategy that is consistent with the funding \n     projections of this title for each future fiscal year until \n     2011, including specific targets for each agency that funds \n     civilian research and development;\n       (3) an analysis which details funding levels across Federal \n     agencies by methodology of funding, including grant \n     agreements, procurement contracts, and cooperative agreements \n     (within the meaning given those terms in chapter 63 of title \n     31, United States Code);\n       (4) a Federal strategy for infrastructure development and \n     research and development capacity building in States with \n     less concentrated research and development resources in order \n     to create a nationwide research and development community; \n     and\n       (5) an annual analysis of the total level of funding for \n     civilian research and development programs throughout all \n     Federal agencies as compared to the previous fiscal year's \n     Congressional budget appropriations for science, engineering, \n     and technology activities of the agencies described in \n     section 105(b), that details for the current fiscal year--\n       (A) how total funding levels compare to those authorized \n     according to section 105(d);\n       (B) how the differences in those funding levels will affect \n     the health, stability, and international standing of the \n     Federal civilian research and development infrastructure;\n       (C) how the disparities in those levels affect the ability \n     of the agencies covered by this Act to perform their \n     missions; and\n       (D) which agencies are excluded under this Act due to \n     accelerated funding and the aggregate amount to be authorized \n     to other agencies under section 105(d).\n\n     SEC. 107. COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTABILITY STUDY FOR FEDERALLY-\n                   FUNDED RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Director of the Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy shall enter into agreement with the \n     National Academy of Sciences for the Academy to conduct a \n     comprehensive study to develop methods for evaluating \n     federally funded research and development programs. The \n     Director shall report the results of the study to the \n     Congress not later than 18 months after the date of enactment \n     of this Act. This study shall--\n       (1) recommend processes to determine an acceptable level of \n     success for federally funded research and development \n     programs by--\n\n[[Page S9091]]\n\n       (A) describing the research process in the various \n     scientific and engineering disciplines;\n       (B) describing in the different sciences what measures and \n     what criteria each community uses to evaluate the success or \n     failure of a program, and on what time scales these measures \n     are considered reliable--both for exploratory long-range work \n     and for short-range goals; and\n       (C) recommending how these measures may be adapted for use \n     by the Federal Government to evaluate federally funded \n     research and development programs;\n       (2) assess the extent to which civilian research and \n     development agencies incorporate independent merit-based \n     review into the formulation of their strategic plans and \n     performance plans;\n       (3) recommend mechanisms for identifying federally funded \n     research and development programs which are unsuccessful or \n     unproductive;\n       (4) evaluate the extent to which independent, merit-based \n     evaluation of federally funded research and development \n     programs and projects achieves the goal of eliminating \n     unsuccessful or unproductive programs and projects; and\n       (5) investigate and report on the validity of using \n     quantitative performance goals for aspects of programs which \n     relate to administrative management of the program and for \n     which such goals would be appropriate, including aspects \n     related to--\n       (A) administrative burden on contractors and recipients of \n     financial assistance awards;\n       (B) administrative burdens on external participants in \n     independent, merit-based evaluations;\n       (C) cost and schedule control for construction projects \n     funded by the program;\n       (D) the ratio of overhead costs of the program relative to \n     the amounts expended through the program for equipment and \n     direct funding of research; and\n       (E) the timeliness of program responses to requests for \n     funding, participation, or equipment use.\n       (6) examine the extent to which program selection for \n     Federal funding across all agencies exemplifies our Nation's \n     historical research and development priorities--\n       (A) basic, scientific, and technological research in the \n     long-term future scientific and technological capacity of the \n     Nation; and\n       (B) mission research derived from a high-priority public \n     function.\n       (b) Alternative Forms for Performance Goals.--Not later \n     than 6 months after transmitting the report under subsection \n     (a) to Congress, the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, after public notice, public comment, and approval by \n     the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy \n     and in consultation with the National Science and Technology \n     Council shall promulgate one or more alternative forms for \n     performance goals under section 1115(b)(10)(B) of title 31, \n     United States Code, based on the recommendations of the study \n     under subsection (a) of this section. The head of each agency \n     containing a program activity that is a research and \n     development program may apply an alternative form promulgated \n     under this section for a performance goal to such a program \n     activity without further authorization by the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget.\n       (c) Strategic Plans.--Not later than one year after \n     promulgation of the alternative performance goals in \n     subsection (b) of this section, the head of each agency \n     carrying out research and development activities, upon \n     updating or revising a strategic plan under subsection 306(b) \n     of title 5, United States Code, shall describe the current \n     and future use of methods for determining an acceptable level \n     of success as recommended by the study under subsection (a).\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n       (2) Program activity.--The term ``program activity'' has \n     the meaning given that term by section 1115(f)(6) of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (3) Independent merit-based evaluation.--The term \n     ``independent merit-based evaluation'' means review of the \n     scientific or technical quality of research or development, \n     conducted by experts who are chosen for their knowledge of \n     scientific and technical fields relevant to the evaluation \n     and who--\n       (A) in the case of the review of a program activity, do not \n     derive long-term support from the program activity; or\n       (B) in the case of the review of a project proposal, are \n     not seeking funds in competition with the proposal.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out the study required by \n     subsection (a) $600,000, which shall remain available until \n     expended.\n\n     SEC. 108.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Information technology will continue to change the way \n     Americans live, learn, and work. The information revolution \n     will improve the workplace and the quality and accessibility \n     of health care and education and make Government more \n     responsible and accessible. It is important that access to \n     information technology be available to all citizens, \n     including elderly Americans and Americans with disabilities.\n       (2) Information technology is an imperative enabling \n     technology that contributes to scientific disciplines. Major \n     advances in biomedical research, public safety, engineering, \n     and other critical areas depend on further advances in \n     computing and communications.\n       (3) The United States is the undisputed global leader in \n     information technology.\n       (4) Information technology is recognized as a catalyst for \n     economic growth and prosperity.\n       (5) Information technology represents one of the fastest \n     growing sectors of the United States economy, with electronic \n     commerce alone projected to become a trillion-dollar business \n     by 2005.\n       (6) Businesses producing computers, semiconductors, \n     software, and communications equipment account for one-third \n     of the total growth in the United States economy since 1992.\n       (7) According to the United States Census Bureau, between \n     1993 and 1997, the information technology sector grew an \n     average of 12.3 percent per year.\n       (8) Fundamental research in information technology has \n     enabled the information revolution.\n       (9) Fundamental research in information technology has \n     contributed to the creation of new industries and new, high-\n     paying jobs.\n       (10) Our Nation's well-being will depend on the \n     understanding, arising from fundamental research, of the \n     social and economic benefits and problems arising from the \n     increasing pace of information technology transformations.\n       (11) Scientific and engineering research and the \n     availability of a skilled workforce are critical to continued \n     economic growth driven by information technology.\n       (12) In 1997, private industry provided most of the funding \n     for research and development in the information technology \n     sector.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed \ntoday, H.R. 4365, the Children's Health Act of 2000, a comprehensive of \nseveral important children's health bills on which I and the rest of \nthe Senate have spent a great amount of time over the past year and a \nhalf. These bills address a wide variety of critical children's health \nissues, including day care safety, maternal and infant health, \npediatric public health promotion, pediatric research, and efforts to \nfight youth drug abuse and provide mental health services. \nCollectively, this comprehensive bill will form the backbone of efforts \nthat will improve the health and safety of America's children well into \nthe coming years.\n  The bill which passed the Senate today includes two divisions, with \nDivision A addressing issues regarding children's health, while \nDivision B addresses youth drug abuse.\n  Perhaps the most critical section in Division A of this bill are \nprovisions relating to day care health and safety, which were included \nin S. 2263, the ``Children's Day Care Health and Safety Improvement \nAct,'' which I introduced with Senator Dodd on March 9, 2000. These \nprovisions recognize that while more than 13 million children under the \nage of six spend some part of their day in day care, including 254,000 \nchildren in Tennessee alone, evidence suggests a need to make these \nsettings safer and improve the health of children in child care \nsettings.\n  The danger in child care settings has recently become evident in \nTennessee. Tragically, within the span of 2 years, there have been 4 \ndeaths in child care settings in Memphis, and 1 in 5 child-care \nprograms in the Nashville area were found to have potentially put the \nhealth and safety of children at risk during 1999. But this isn't just \na Tennessee concern. It affects parents nationwide.\n  For example, according to a Consumer Product Safety Commission Study, \nin 1997, 31,000 children ages four and younger were treated in hospital \nemergency rooms for injuries sustained in child care or school \nsettings. Since 1990, more than 60 children have died in child care \nsettings. This is unacceptable. The thousands of parents leaving their \nchildren in the hands of child care providers each day deserve \nreassurance that their children are safe.\n  Further evidence of day care health and safety concerns were made \nclear in a recent study by the American Academy of Pediatrics which \nshowed a disturbing trend among infants and Sudden Infant Death \nSyndrome (SIDS) in day care. The study examined 1,916 SIDS cases from \n1995 to 1997 in 11 states, and found that about 20 percent, 391 deaths, \noccurred in day care settings. Most troubling was the fact that in over \nhalf of the cases where caretakers placed children on their stomach, \nthe children were usually put to sleep on their backs by their parents.\n  Parents and advocates who are dedicated in helping to eliminate the \nincidence of SIDS have urged that child care providers be required to \nhave SIDS risk reduction education. I agree, which is why I included \nprovision in the bill to carry out several activities, including the \nuse of health consultants to give health and safety advice to child \ncare providers on important issues like SIDS prevention.\n  Overall the bill provides $200 million to states, including $4.2 \nmillion for my state of Tennessee, to help improve the health and \nsafety of children in child care. The grants could be used for a number \nof activities, including child care provider training and education; \ninspections and criminal background checks for day care providers; \nenhancements to improve a facility's ability to serve children with \ndisabilities; transportation safety procedures; and information for \nparents on choosing a safe and healthy day care setting. The funding \ncould also be used to help child care facilities meet health and safety \nstandards or employ health consultants to give health and safety advice \nto child care providers.\n  As a father, my highest concern is the safety of my three sons, and I \nunderstand the fears that so many parents have. Parents shouldn't be \nafraid to leave their children in the care of a licensed child care \nfacility. This bill helps ensure that our child care centers will be \nsafer.\n  The major portion of Division A are provisions which were included in \nthe ``Children's Public Health Act of 2000'' which I introduced on July \n13, 2000 with Senators Jeffrods and Kennedy. Provisions in the \n``Children's Public Health Act of 2000'' address a wide range of \nchildren's health issues including maternal and infant health, \npediatric health promotion, and pediatric research.\n  Unintentional injuries are the leading cause of death for every age \ngroup between 1 and 19 years of age, comprising 26 deaths per 100,000 \nchildren aged 1-14 and 62 deaths per 100,000 children aged 15-19. More \nthan 1.5 million American children suffer a brain injury each year. \nTherefore, the bill reauthorizes and strengthens the Traumatic Brain \nInjury programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\n[[Page S9095]]\n\n(CDC), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Health Resources \nand Services Administration (HRSA).\n  Because birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality and \nare responsible for about 30 percent of all pediatric hospital \nadmissions, the bill also focuses on maternal and infant health. This \nlegislation establishes a National Center for Birth Defects and \nDevelopmental Disabilities at the CDC to collect, analyze, and \ndistribute data on birth defects. In addition, the bill authorizes the \nHealthy Start program to reduce the rate of infant mortality and \nimprove perinatal outcomes by providing grants to areas with a high \nincidence of infant mortality and low birth weight.\n  Furthermore, over 3,000 women experience serious complications due to \npregnancy. Two out of three will die from complications in their \npregnancy. Therefore, the bill develops a national monitoring and \nsurveillance program to better understand maternal complications and \nmortality, and to decrease the disparities among populations at risk of \ndeath and complications from pregnancy.\n  The bill also combats some of the most common childhood diseases and \nconditions. For instance, it provides comprehensive asthma services and \ncoordinates the wide range of asthma prevention programs in the federal \ngovernment to address the most common chronic childhood disease, \nasthma, which affects nearly 5 million children.\n  We also focus on childhood obesity, which has doubled in just the \npast 15 years, and produced 4.7 million seriously overweight children \nand adolescents ages 6-19 years. To address this epidemic, the bill \nsupports state and community-based programs to promote good nutrition \nand increased physical activity among American youth.\n  In examining the problems affecting children across the nation and in \nTennessee, I was very concerned to learn that in Memphis, over 12 \npercent of children under the age of 6 may have lead poisoning. Such \npoisoning can cause a variety of debilitating health problems, \nincluding seizure, and coma, and even death. Even at lower levels, lead \ncan contribute to learning disabilities, loss of intelligence, \nhyperactivity, and behavioral problems. This bill includes physician \neducation and training programs on current lead screening policies, \ntracks the percentage of children in the Health Centers program who are \nscreened for lead poisoning, and conducts outreach and education for \nfamilies at risk of lead poisoning,\n  The May 2000 Surgeon General's report noted that oral health is \ninseparable from overall health, and that while a majority of the \npopulation has experienced great improvements in oral health, \ndisparities affecting poor children and those who live in underserved \nareas represent 80 percent of all dental cavities in 20 percent of \nchildren. This bill encourages pediatric oral health by supporting \ncommunity-based research and training to improve the understanding of \netiology, pathogenesis, diagnoses, prevention, and treatment of \npediatric oral, dental, and craniofacial diseases.\n  Finally, the bill strengthens pediatric research efforts by \nestablishing a Pediatric Research Initiative within the NIH to enhance \ncollaborative efforts, provide increased support for pediatric \nbiomedical research, and ensure that opportunities for advancement in \nscientific investigations and care for children are realized.\n  I also want to highlight the critical issue of childhood research \nprotections. Included in this bill are provisions to address safety \nissues in children's research by requiring the Secretary of HHS to \nreview the current federal regulations for the protection of children \nparticipating in research, which address such issues as determining \nacceptable levels of risk and obtaining parental permission, and to \nreport to Congress on how to ensure the highest standards of safety. \nAlso, the provision requires that all HHS-funded and regulated research \ncomply with these additional protections for children. During this \nyear, the Senate Subcommittee on Public Health, which I chair, held two \nimportant hearings relating to gene therapy trials and human subject \nprotections. The Subcommittee discovered that there was a lapse of \nprotection for individuals participating as subjects in clinical trial \nresearch. Next Congress, I intend to make the further review and \nupdating of human subject protections a major priority of the \nSubcommittee.\n  Division B of the bill contains provisions which address the scourge \nupon children of drug abuse. The 1999 National Household Survey on Drug \nAbuse, conducted by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration (SAMHSA), reported that 10.9 percent of youths age 12-17 \ncurrently use illicit drugs. It further estimated that nearly 11.3 \npercent of 12-17 year-old boys and 10.5 percent of 12-17 year-old girls \nused drugs in the past month. But just as important is the growth in \nalcohol abuse among our youth, as SAMHSA reports that 10.4 million \ncurrent drinkers are younger than the legal drinking age of 21 and that \nmore than 6.8 million engaged in binge drinking. Tragically, all of \nthese numbers among youth substance abuse have risen since 1992.\n  To address the tragedy of drug use by our children, the bill \nincorporates the ``Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act,'' which I \nintroduced with Senator Kennedy last spring and was first passed the \nSenate on November 3, 1999.\n  The ``Youth Drug'' bill addresses the problem of youth substance \nabuse by reauthorizing and improving SAMHSA through a renewed focus on \nyouth and adolescent substance abuse and mental health services, in \nconjunction with greater flexibility and new accountability for States \nfor the use of federal funds.\n  Created in 1992 to assist States in reducing the incidence of \nsubstance abuse and mental illness through prevention and treatment \nprograms, SAMHSA provides funds to States for alcohol and drug abuse \nprevention and treatment programs and activities, as well as mental \nhealth services, with its block grants accounting for 40 percent and 15 \npercent respectively of all substance abuse and community mental health \nservices funding in the States. In my own State of Tennessee, SAMHSA \nprovides more than 70 percent of overall funding for the Tennessee \nDepartment of Health's Bureau of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Services.\n  This bill accomplishes six critical goals: (1) promotes State \nflexibility by easing outdated or unneeded requirements governing the \nexpenditure of Federal block grants; (2) ensures State accountability \nby moving away from the present system's inefficiencies to a \nperformance based system; (3) provides substance abuse treatment \nservices and early intervention substance abuse services for children \nand adolescents; (4) helps local communities treat violent youth and \nminimize outbreaks of youth violence through partnerships among \nschools, law enforcement and mental health services; (5) ensures \nFederal funding for substance abuse or mental health emergencies; and \n(6) supports and expands programs providing mental health and substance \nabuse treatment services to homeless individuals.\n  The bill also includes a number of other important provisions, \nincluding those to address how to treat individuals with co-occurring \nmental health and substance abuse disorders the proper and safe use of \nrestraints and seclusions in mental health facilities, and important \n``charitable choice'' provision that permits Federal assistance for \nreligious organizations providing substance abuse services. We know \nthat no one approach works for everyone who needs and wants substance \nabuse treatment and that faith-based programs have strong records of \nsuccessful rehabilitation. This provision will allow faith-based \nprograms to continue to offer their assistance and expertise.\n  The ``Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act'' provides Tennessee \nand other states needed funds for community based programs helping \nindividuals with substance abuse and mental health disorders, \ndramatically increasing State flexibility and ensuring that each State \nis able to address its unique needs. The bill provides a much needed \nfocus on the troubling issue of drug use by our youth and helps local \ncommunities deal with the issue of children and violence.\n  I would also like to highlight the ``Methamphetamine Anti-\nProliferation Act of 1999,'' which is sponsored by Senator Ashcroft and \nincluded in this comprehensive bill. This bill address the plague of \nmethamphetamine which has severely impacted Tennessee, other\n\n[[Page S9096]]\n\nsouthern states, the Mid-West, and Rocky Mountain states. Under these \nprovisions, criminal penalties are increased for individuals who \nmanufacture methamphetamine. The provisions also increase funding for \nlaw enforcement training and target high intensity methamphetamine \ntrafficking areas.\n  Finally the bill also tackles another devastating drug which has \nshown signs of increased use in our youth, the drug known as \n``Ecstasy.'' In short, the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to \nreview and amend the Ecstasy guidelines to provide for increased \npenalties to reflect the seriousness of the offenses of trafficking in \nand importing Ecstasy and related drugs.\n  Mr. President, this legislation which has passed the Senate today is \na comprehensive, multifaceted attack on the numerous threats to our \nchildren's health. I am thankful for all my colleagues for their \nsupport and willingness to help the children of this nation. I would \nespecially like to thank Senators Jeffords and Kennedy and \nRepresentatives Tom Bliley, Michael Bilirakis, John Dingell and Sherrod \nBrown, and their excellent staffs for all the hard work and dedication \nwhich has gone into this bill. I would also like to thank Mr. Bill \nBaird and Ms. Daphne Edwards, of the Office of Senate Legislative \nCounsel, for their tireless work and for their great expertise in \ndrafting this comprehensive bill. I would also like to personally thank \nMr. Joseph Faha, Director of Legislation and External Affairs of the \nSubstance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration as well as \nother member of the Department of Health of Human Services. Finally, I \nwould like to thank my Staff Director, of the Public Health \nSubcommittees, Anne Phelps and my Health Policy Advisor, Dave Larson. \nFinally, I would like to thank the may groups advocating on behalf of \nchildren and parents and families who have worked so hard to bring this \nbill to fruition. I look forward to swift action in the House on this \nmeasure and it's enactment into law.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this legislation will help millions of \nchildren in the years ahead. It takes needed action to improve \nchildren's health by expanding pediatric research and taking specific \nsteps to deal with a wide range of childhood illnesses, disorders, and \ninjuries. It also reauthorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Adminstration, which has an important role in reducing \nsubstance abuse and maintaining and improving the mental health of the \nnation's children and adolescents. Coordinated efforts in these areas \ncan lead to significant benefits for all children.\n  Senator Frist and I have worked closely with many of our Democratic \nand Republican colleagues on this important legislation. We have talked \nwith experts and advocates in the children's health community and in \nthe mental health and substance abuse treatment communities. This \nlegislation will lead to significant progress in addressing many of \ntoday's most pressing pediatric public health problems.\n  The legislation includes a variety of new and reauthorized children's \nhealth provisions. It represents a compromise with our colleagues in \nthe House and addresses a wide range of pediatric public health issues \nraised by experts in the field and championed by numerous members from \nboth sides of the aisle in both chambers.\n  Division A of the bill focuses on general children's health. It \nincludes programs to improve the health of pregnant women and prenatal \noutcomes, including prevention of birth defects and low birth weight. \nIt establishes a new Center for Birth Defects and Developmental \nDisabilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in \norder to focus the nation's activities more effectively in these \nimportant areas. It also directs the Secretary of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to expand public education efforts on folic \nacid consumption in order to decrease neural tube birth defects.\n  The bill also deals with traumatic brain injury which is the leading \ncause of death and disability in young Americans. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention has estimated that 5.3 million Americans \nare living with long-term, severe disability as a result of brain \ninjuries, and each year 50,000 people die as a result of such injuries. \nThe Children's Public Health Act revises and extends the authorization \nfor a series of important programs that were enacted in 1996 to deal \nwith these injuries. This reauthorization will assure continued \nprogress toward understanding, treating and preventing them.\n  In addition, the bill includes the long overdue reauthorization of \nthe CDC's Injury Prevention and Control Programs. There are steps we \nshould take to modernize this authority and increase the authorization \nlevels, but it is welcome progress at last to renew its authorization.\n  Improving and protecting the safety of child care facilities is also \na high priority for Congress. This legislation creates a new program to \nimprove the safety of children in child care settings, and to encourage \nchild care providers to take steps to prevent illness and injuries and \nprotect the health of the children they serve.\n  It is said that the 21st century will be the century of life \nsciences. Our national health policy will have the benefit of brilliant \nnew scientific discoveries that have already begun to change how we \ndiagnose, treat and prevent countless conditions. The legislation \ncreates a new grant program that focuses on inherited disorders. Based \non legislation introduced last year that has the strong support of a \nbroad-based coalition of both the genetics and public health \ncommunities, our bill provides funds for state or local public health \ndepartments to expand existing programs or initiate new programs that \nprovide screening, counseling or health services to infants and \nchildren who have genetic conditions or are at risk for such \nconditions. It also establishes an Advisory Committee to assist the \nSecretary on these issues.\n  The bill also takes a number of steps to address other prevalent \nchildhood conditions. Asthma is the most common chronic childhood \nillness, affecting more than seven percent of all American children. \nThe death rate for children with asthma increased by 78 percent between \n1980 and 1993, and asthma-related costs total nearly $2 billion \nannually in direct health care for children. The nation is handicapped \nby a lack of basic information on where and how asthma strikes, what \ntriggers it, and how effectively the health care system is responding \nto those who suffer from this chronic disease. Our bill will provide \ngreater asthma services to children, including mobile clinics and \npatient and family education, and it will help to reduce allergens in \nhousing and public facilities.\n  Poor nutrition and lack of physical activity are also hurting many \nAmerican children and contributing to lifelong health problems. The \nnation spends $39 billion a year--equal to six percent of overall U.S. \nhealth care expenditures--on direct health care related to obesity. \nTwenty percent of American children--one in five--are overweight. \nUnhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity in childhood can lead \nto heart disease, cancer and other serious illnesses decades later. \nChildren and adolescents who suffer from eating disorders, such as \nanorexia nervosa and bulimia, can have wide-ranging physical and mental \nhealth impairments. Our legislation establishes new grant programs to \nreduce childhood obesity and eating disorders, promote better \nnutritional habits among children, and encourage an appropriate level \nof physical activity for children and adolescents.\n  The bill also requires the Secretary to study issues related to \neffective treatment for metabolic disorders, including PKU, and access \nto such treatments, in order to prevent worsening of these conditions. \nIt is my hope that this study will be useful for employers, insurers, \ninsurance commissioners and others who provide insurance or set \ncoverage standards.\n  Another major area where additional efforts are needed is dental \ncare. Last May, the Surgeon General published a landmark report on oral \nhealth in America, emphasizing the need to consider oral health as an \nessential part of total health. There is no question that oral and \ndental health care should be included in primary care. Tooth decay is \nthe most common childhood infectious disease, and it can lead to \ndevastating consequences, including problems with eating, learning and \nspeech. Twenty-five percent of children in the United States suffer 80 \npercent of the tooth decay, with significant racial and\n\n[[Page S9097]]\n\nage disparities. The number of dentists in the country has been \ndeclining since 1990, and is projected to continue to decline through \nthe year 2020.\n  According to a 1995 report by the Inspector General, only one in five \nMedicaid-eligible children receive dental services annually, and the \nshortage of dentists exacerbates the problem of unmet needs. Yet tooth \ndecay is largely preventable. More effective efforts to educate parents \nand children about the causes of tooth decay--and initiatives to \nprevent and treat it--can lead to lasting public health improvements. \nOur legislation includes a variety of approaches to deal with this \nsilent epidemic, including a new grant program to improve the \nunderstanding of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric oral \ndiseases and conditions, and grants to increase community-wide \nfluoridation and school-based dental sealant programs. It also directs \nthe Secretary to undertake a coordinated oral health initiative to fund \ninnovative activities to improve the oral health of low-income \nchildren.\n  Research has long shown that childhood lead poisoning can have \ndevastating effects on children, causing reduced IQ and attention span, \nstunted growth, behavior problems, and reading and learning \ndisabilities. Yet too many children remain unscreened and untreated, \nand adequate services often are not available for children with \nelevated levels of lead in their blood. There is no excuse for not \ntaking greater steps to eliminate childhood lead poisoning. Our bill \nincludes screening for early detection and treatment, professional \neducation and training programs, and outreach and education activities \nfor at-risk children.\n  Pediatric research discoveries promote and maintain health throughout \na child's life span, and also contribute significantly to new insights \nthat aid in the prevention and treatment of illnesses among adults. A \ngrowing body of evidence shows that risk factors for conditions such as \ncoronary artery disease and stroke begin in childhood and persist \nthrough adulthood. Congress has a strong record of promoting basic and \nclinical research, and the steps taken in this legislation continue \nthat priority with a special focus on children.\n  The legislation establishes a pediatric research initiative, \nauthorized at $50 million annually, that will increase support for \npediatric biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health, \nincluding an increase in collaborative efforts among multidisciplinary \nfields in areas that are promising for children. The legislation also \nrequires coordination with the Food and Drug Administration to increase \nthe number of pediatric clinical trials, and to provide greater \ninformation on safer and more effective use of prescription drugs in \nchildren.\n  Children have unique health care needs. They are not simply small \nadults. Nothing is more important to the future health of America's \nchildren than maintaining a steady supply of pediatricians, pediatric \nspecialists and pediatric-focused scientists.\n  Our legislation takes several important steps to improve the growth \nand development of a pediatric-focused medical community. It enhances \nsupport through the NIH expressly for training and career development \nactivities of pediatric researchers, including establishing a loan \nrepayment program for health care professionals who focus on pediatric \nresearch.\n  It revises and extends the authorization of a program enacted last \nyear to support graduate medical education at independent children's \nhospitals. These hospitals train half of all pediatric specialists, and \n30 percent of all pediatricians. However, because GME activities have \nhistorically been supported by Medicare and because these hospitals \nserve very few Medicare patients, they have traditionally received very \nlittle federal financial support for this important and costly \nactivity. As a result, children's hospitals are struggling to maintain \nthe important training, pediatric research, and primary and specialty \ncare services that they provide. Children's hospitals should be treated \nlike all other teaching hospitals when it comes to support for their \nGME activities. I have sponsored other legislation to guarantee full \nfunding each year, without being subject to the appropriations process. \nThat proposal has been included in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act \nof 2000. It is awaiting consideration in the Finance Committee, and I \nhope it will be enacted this year.\n  The bill also authorizes a new long-term study to monitor and \nevaluate health and development of children through adulthood. The kind \nof information that will be obtained by this study is long-overdue, and \nI look forward to its results.\n  The bill also takes two steps to protect children who participate in \nclinical trials and other research. It requires all HHS-regulated and \nfunded research to comply with current pediatric-specific human subject \nprotection regulations. This provision is supported by the FDA and \nindustry alike, and it is an important step toward assuring full public \nconfidence in life-saving research activities. In addition, it requires \nthe Secretary to review those regulations and report on their adequacy \nand recommendations, if any, for changes within six months. Our \ncommittee intends to look more broadly at the issue of human subject \nprotections next year, and this report will help inform those \ndiscussions.\n  Finally, this legislation also includes a variety of directives to \nincrease activities at public health agencies on specific disorders and \ndiseases affecting children. Children living with autism, Fragile X, \ndiabetes, arthritis, muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, cystic fibrosis, and \na number of other conditions have much to be grateful for today. We all \nhave the highest hopes that the provisions in this bill will lead to \nsuccessful efforts to combat these debilitating and often deadly \nconditions.\n  Division B of the bill will enable the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration to meet the mental health and substance \nabuse needs of communities through its successful existing programs and \nthrough new and innovative initiatives.\n\n  The recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse indicates that we \nhave made important progress in combating substance abuse, especially \namong the nation's youth. The goal of this legislation is to build on \nthat progress with expanded prevention and treatment services. Several \nof the bill's provisions come from the Mental Health Early \nIntervention, Treatment, and Prevention Act, which Senator Domenici and \nI introduced in response to the Surgeon General's groundbreaking Report \non Mental Health. These provisions take needed steps to give the \nmentally ill the services they need.\n  This legislation is the product of bi-partisan cooperation, and I \nespecially commend Senator Frist for his leadership in bringing \neveryone together. His efforts have helped ensure that the measure we \npass today is an effective response to the mental illness and substance \nabuse problems we face.\n  Over the past two decades, we have made great progress in determining \nthe causes of mental illnesses and developing strategies to treat them. \nWe have also begun to understand the biological basis of substance \nabuse. Despite these scientific advances, mental illness and substance \nabuse continue to be a national crisis. One in five Americans will \nexperience some form of mental illness this year--and two-thirds of \nthem will not seek treatment. Substance abuse costs the country an \nestimated $270 billion in annual economic costs, and it leads to \nunacceptable violence, injury, and HIV infection in our communities.\n  Too often, patients with mental illness are denied the state-of-the-\nart treatment that would be available if their illnesses were physical \ninstead of mental. We have failed to provide them with the services \nthey need to meet the overwhelming obstacles they face. We have not \nmade an adequate effort to help them overcome their addictions. The \nbill we pass today is intended to correct these injustices.\n  It will provide treatment to those who desperately need it and \nprevention services to those at risk. Much of the bill focuses on the \nunique needs of youths, adolescents, and young adults. It provides \nservices for children of substance abusers, training for teachers to \nrecognize the symptoms of mental illness, and a suicide prevention \nprogram for children and youth. In addition, it provides a range of \ncommunity services for children with serious emotional disturbances and \nfor youth offenders. Agencies will receive funding to study\n\n[[Page S9098]]\n\nand treat post-traumatic stress disorder in children. The bill also \nprovides funds to coordinate welfare and mental health services for \nchildren who would benefit from this approach.\n  For homeless individuals, the bill provides expanded mental health \nand substance abuse services, along with transition assistance. For \nresidents of treatment facilities, it offers protections from the \ninappropriate and often harmful use of seclusion and restraints. The \nbill will help to divert persons with mental illness from the criminal \njustice system, which for too long has served as a dumping-ground, and \ngive them the services they need. It will provide special treatment for \nthose who suffer simultaneously from mental illness and addiction. It \nwill also provide funds to designate facilities as emergency mental \nhealth centers, especially in underserved areas. In all the services \nincluded, there will be a special emphasis on meeting the unique needs \nof specific cultures and ethnic groups, and on giving states the \nflexibility they need to address the concerns of their individual \ncommunities.\n  For too long, we have blamed the mentally ill and those addicted to \nalcohol and other drugs for their behavior, rather than extending a \nhelping hand. Recent scientific advances have opened new windows onto \nthe biochemical basis of mental illness and addictive behavior. This \nlegislation will ensure that these advances are translated into \npractical services for those who need them. By creating this more \neffective framework to deliver appropriate services, we will help many \nmore individuals to re-enter society as productive members, and do much \nmore to dispel the stigma of diseases that affect the mind.\n  This legislation deserves to be a major public health priority for \nthe nation. Congress should send the President this legislation before \nthe end of this session.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the summary of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    The Children's Health Act of 2000: Division A--Children's Health\n\n                            Title I--Autism\n\n       Under this provision, the Director of NIH shall expand, \n     intensify, and coordinate the activities of the NIH with \n     respect to research on autism. The Director of NIH will \n     establish not less than 5 Centers of Excellence on autism \n     research. Each center will conduct basic and clinical \n     research into the cause, diagnosis, early detection, \n     prevention, control and treatment of autism, including \n     research in the fields of developmental neurobiology, \n     genetics and psychopharmacology. The Director shall provide \n     for the coordination of information among centers.

Directs HHS to \n     evaluate whether the supply of pediatric rheumatologists is \n     adequate to meet the health care needs of children with \n     arthritis.\n\n     Title IV--Reducing Burden of Diabetes Among Children and Youth\n\n       Directs the Secretary, acting through the CDC, to develop a \n     sentinel system to collect incidence and prevalence data on \n     juvenile diabetes. Requires NIH to conduct or support long-\n     term epidemiology studies to investigate the causes and \n     characteristics of juvenile diabetes, and to support regional \n     clinical research centers for the prevention, detection, \n     treatment and cure of juvenile diabetes. Provides for \n     research and development of prevention strategies.\n\n                 Title V--Asthma Services for Children\n\n       This provision authorizes the Secretary to award grants to \n     provide comprehensive asthma services to children, equip \n     mobile health care clinics, conduct patient and family \n     education on asthma management, and identify children \n     eligible for Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program, and other children's health programs. This provision \n     amends the Preventive Health and Health Services Block Grant \n     program to provide for the establishment, operation, and \n     coordination of effective and cost-efficient systems to \n     reduce the prevalence of asthma and asthma-related illnesses, \n     especially among children, by reducing the level of exposure \n     to allergens through the use of integrated pest management.\n       This provision also requires the National Heart Lung and \n     Blood Institute, through the National Asthma Education \n     Prevention Program Coordinating Committee, to identify all \n     federal programs that carry out asthma-related activities, \n     develop a Federal plan for responding to asthma in \n     consultation with appropriate federal agencies, professional \n     and voluntary health organizations, and recommend ways to \n     strengthen and improve the coordination of asthma-related \n     Federal activities. CDC will collect and publish data on the \n     prevalence of children suffering from asthma in each State, \n     as well as mortality data at the national level.\n\n             Title VI--Birth Defects Prevention Activities\n\n       This provision expands CDC's folic acid education program \n     to prevent birth defects. In partnership with the States and \n     local, public, and private entities, CDC shall expand an \n     education and public awareness campaign; conduct research to \n     identify effective strategies for increasing folic acid \n     consumption by women of reproductive capacity; evaluate the \n     effectiveness of these strategies; and conduct research to \n     increase our understanding of the effects of folic acid in \n     preventing birth defects.\n       This provision elevates the Division of Birth Defects and \n     Developmental Disabilities to a National Center for Birth \n     Defects and Developmental Disabilities within CDC. The \n     purpose of this Center would be to collect, analyze, and \n     distribute data on birth defects and developmental \n     disabilities including information on causes, incidence, and \n     prevalence; conduct applied epidemiological research on the \n     prevention of such defects and disabilities; and provide \n     information to the public on proven prevention activities.\n\n Title VII--Early Detection, Diagnosis and Treatment Regarding Hearing \n                            Loss in Infants\n\n       Authorizes grants or cooperative agreements to develop \n     statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation \n     and intervention programs and systems, and provide technical \n     assistance to State agencies. Directs the NIH to continue a \n     program of research and development on the efficacy of new \n     screening techniques and technology. Provides for federal \n     coordination with State and local agencies, consumer groups, \n     national medical, health, and education organizations. \n     Coordinated activities shall include policy recommendations \n     and development of a data collection system.\n\n                   Title VIII--Children and Epilepsy\n\n       Authorizes the agencies of HHS to expand current epilepsy \n     surveillance activities; implement public and professional \n     education activities; enhance research initiatives; and \n     strengthen partnerships with government agencies and \n     organizations that have experience addressing the health \n     needs of people with disabilities. Authorizes demonstration \n     projects in medically underserved areas, to improve access to \n     health services regarding seizures, to encourage early \n     detection and treatment in children.\n\n         Title IX--Safe Motherhood and Infant Health Promotion\n\n       The provision authorizes the Secretary of HHS to develop a \n     national surveillance program to better understand the burden \n     of maternal complications and mortality and to decrease the \n     disparities among populations at risk of death and \n     complications from pregnancy. The provision allows the \n     Secretary to expand the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring \n     System to provide surveillance and data collection in each \n     State. Furthermore, the provision would expand research \n     concerning risk factors, prevention strategies, and the roles \n     of the family, health care providers, and the community in \n     safe motherhood. The provision also authorizes public \n     education campaigns on healthy pregnancy, education programs \n     for health care providers, and activities to promote \n     community support services for pregnant women. Finally, the \n     provision authorizes grant funding for research initiatives \n     and programs to prevent drug, alcohol, and tobacco use among \n     pregnant women.\n\n                 Title X--Pediatric Research Initiative\n\n       This provision establishes a Pediatric Research Initiative \n     within the National Institutes of Health to enhance \n     collaborative efforts, provide increased support for \n     pediatric biomedical research, and ensure that expanding \n     opportunities for advancement in scientific investigations \n     and care for children are realized.\n       The Secretary of HHS will make available enhanced support \n     for activities relating to the training and career \n     development of pediatric researchers, including general \n     authority for loan repayment of a portion of education loans.\n       This provision also requires that all HHS-funded and \n     regulated research comply with current pediatric-specific \n     human subject protection regulations. (Currently FDA-\n     regulated research is not required to comply).\n\n[[Page S9099]]\n\n       National Institute of Child Health and Human Development is \n     authorized to convene and direct a consortium of federal \n     agencies, including CDC and EPA, to develop and implement a \n     prospective cohort study to evaluate the effects of both \n     chronic and intermittent external influences on human \n     development, and to investigate basic mechanisms of \n     developmental disorders and environmental factors, both risk \n     and protective, that influence growth and developmental \n     processes. The study will incorporate behavioral, emotional, \n     educational, and contextual consequences to enable a complete \n     assessment of the physical, chemical, biological and \n     psychosocial environmental influences on children's well-\n     being. The study shall gather data on environmental \n     influences and outcomes until at least age 21, shall include \n     diverse populations, and shall consider health disparities.\n\n                    Title XI--Childhood Malignancies\n\n       Directs the Secretary of HHS, through CDC and NIH, to study \n     risk factors that affect or cause childhood cancers and carry \n     out projects to improve outcomes for children with cancer and \n     resultant secondary conditions. Provides for the expansion of \n     current data collection and support for CDC's National Limb \n     Loss Information Center.\n\n                     Title XII--Adoption Awareness\n\n       This title authorizes the Secretary of HHS to make grants \n     to adoption organizations to train the staff of eligible \n     health centers in providing adoption information and \n     referrals based on guidelines developed by the adoption \n     community. The Secretary, through the Health Resources and \n     Services Administration and the Agency for Healthcare \n     Research and Qaulity, shall evaluate the effectiveness of the \n     training program as well as the extent to which such training \n     complies with federal requirements which may apply to \n     eligible health centers, to provide adoption information and \n     referrals on an equal basis with all other courses of action \n     included in nondirective pregnancy options counseling.\n       The Secretary shall carry out a national campaign to \n     provide information to the public about adoption of children \n     with special needs. Additionally, the Secretary shall make \n     grants to provide assistance to adoption support groups and \n     carry out studies to identify components that lead to \n     favorable long-term outcomes for families that adopt children \n     with special needs.\n\n                   Title XIII--Traumatic Brain Injury\n\n       This provision reauthorizes the Traumatic Brain Injury Act \n     of 1996 to extend the authority for CDC to support research \n     into strategies for the prevention of TBI and to implement \n     public information and education programs for the prevention \n     of traumatic brain injuries. CDC will support additional data \n     collection and development of State TBI registries. NIH \n     research is expanded to include cognitive disorders and \n     neurobehavioral consequences arising from TBI. The bill \n     authorizes HRSA to make grants for new and expanded community \n     support services. Grants may be used to educate consumers and \n     families, train professionals, improve case management, \n     develop best practices in the areas of family support, return \n     to work, and housing for people with traumatic brain injury. \n     HRSA shall also make grants to protection and advocacy \n     systems, to provide services to individuals with traumatic \n     brain injury. This title also reauthorizes CDC's injury \n     prevention and control programs to 2005.\n\n             Title XIV--Child Care Safety and Health Grants\n\n       To address the need for increased safety of child care \n     facilities, the Secretary of HHS shall provide grants to \n     States to carry out activities related to the improvement of \n     the health and safety of children in child care settings. \n     Grants may be used for two or more of the following \n     activities: train and educate child care providers to prevent \n     injuries and illnesses and to promote health-related \n     practices; strengthen and enforce child care provider \n     licensing, regulation, and registration; rehabilitate child \n     care facilities to meet health and safety standards; provide \n     health consultants to give health and safety advice to child \n     care providers; enhance child care providers' ability to \n     serve children with disabilities; conduct criminal background \n     checks on child care providers; provide information to \n     parents on choosing a safe and healthy setting for their \n     children; or improve the safety of transportation of children \n     in child care.\n\n                   Title XV--Healthy Start Initiative\n\n       Healthy Start, which was created as a demonstration project \n     in 1991, is authorized in this bill for the first time. The \n     Healthy Start program is designed to reduce the rate of \n     infant mortality and improve perinatal outcomes by providing \n     grants to areas with a high rate of infant mortality and low \n     birth weight infants. This provision also authorizes a new \n     grant program to conduct and support research and provide \n     additional services to enhance access to health care for \n     pregnant women and infants.\n\n                         Title XVI--Oral Health\n\n       This provision requires HHS to support community-based \n     research to identify interventions that reduce the burden and \n     transmission of oral, dental and craniofacial diseases in \n     high risk populations, and develop clinical approaches for \n     pediatric assessment. HHS is authorized to fund innovative \n     oral health activities to decrease the incidence of baby \n     bottle and early childhood tooth decay, and to increase \n     utilization of pediatric dental services in children under 6.\n       The Secretary of HHS is authorized to provide grants to \n     States to increase community water fluoridation and to \n     provide school-based dental sealant services to children in \n     low income areas. This provision also authorizes HHS to \n     provide for the development of school-based dental sealant \n     programs to improve the access of children to sealants. \n     Finally, HHS shall make grants to dental training \n     institutions and community-based programs, as well as those \n     operated by the Indian Health Service, to develop oral health \n     promotion programs and to increase utilization of dental \n     services by children eligible for such services under a \n     federal health program.\n\n                  Title XVII--Vaccine-Related Programs\n\n       Modifies the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, to allow \n     compensation for those who suffer an adverse reaction to the \n     rota virus. This provision provides compensation if a vaccine \n     causes an injury that requires hospitalization and surgical \n     intervention. Additionally, the preventive health services \n     childhood immunization program is reauthorized to 2005.\n\n                        Title XVIII--Hepatitis C\n\n       Authorizes HHS to implement a national system to determine \n     the incidence of hepatitis C virus infection, and to assist \n     the States in determining the prevalence of HCV infection. \n     Also authorizes HHS to identify, counsel and offer testing to \n     individuals who are at risk of HCV infection, and to develop \n     public and professional education programs for the detection \n     and control of HCV infection. Provides for improvements in \n     clinical laboratory procedures regarding Hepatitis C.\n\n            Title XIX--NIH Initiative on Autoimmune Diseases\n\n       The Director of NIH shall expand, intensify, and coordinate \n     the activities of NIH with respect to autoimmune diseases.\n\n Title XX--Graduate Medical Education Programs in Children's Hospitals\n\n       This provision makes technical corrections to the pediatric \n     GME program, which supports training activities in \n     freestanding children's hospitals, and extends its \n     authorization through fiscal year 2005.\n\n  Title XXI--Special Needs of Children Regarding Organ Transplantation\n\n       Requires HHS to implement organ donation policies that \n     recognize the unique needs of children. HHS shall carry out \n     studies and demonstration projects to improve rates of organ \n     donation and determine the unique needs of children. HHS \n     shall conduct a study to determine the costs of \n     immunosupressive drugs for children who have received \n     transplants and the extent to which public and private health \n     insurance plans cover these costs.\n\n                Title XXII--Muscular Dystrophy Research\n\n       NIH will expand and increase coordination in activities \n     with respect to research on muscular dystrophies.\n\n         Title XXIII--Children and Tourette Syndrome Awareness\n\n       HHS will implement public and professional education \n     programs on Tourette Syndrome, with a particular emphasis on \n     children.\n\n                Title XXIV--Childhood Obesity Prevention\n\n       This provision authorizes the CDC to support the \n     development, implementation, and evaluation of state and \n     community-based programs to promote good nutrition and \n     increased physical activity. States would be required to \n     develop comprehensive, inter-agency school- and community-\n     based approaches to encourage and promote nutrition and \n     physical activity in local communities, with technical \n     support from CDC.\n       The CDC will coordinate and conduct research to improve our \n     understanding of the relationship between physical activity, \n     diet, health, and other factors that contribute to obesity. \n     Research will also focus on developing and evaluating \n     effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of \n     obesity and eating disorders, as well as study the prevalence \n     and cost of childhood obesity and its effects into adulthood.\n       The CDC in collaboration with State and local health, \n     nutrition, and physical activity experts, will develop a \n     nationwide public education campaign regarding the health \n     risks associated with poor nutrition and physical inactivity, \n     and will promote effective ways to incorporate good eating \n     habits and regular physical activity into daily living.\n       The CDC, in collaboration with HRSA, will develop and carry \n     out a program to train health professionals in effective \n     strategies to better identify, assess, and counsel (or refer) \n     patients with obesity, an eating disorder, or who are at risk \n     of becoming obese or developing an eating disorder. They will \n     also develop and carry out a program to train educators and \n     child care professionals in effective strategies to teach \n     children and their families about ways to improve dietary \n     habits and levels of physical activity.\n\n   Title XXV--Early Detection and Treatment Regarding Childhood Lead \n                               Poisoning\n\n       This provision requires HRSA to report annually to the \n     Congress on the percentage of children in the Health Centers \n     program who are screened for lead poisoning, and requires \n     HRSA to work with the CDC and HCFA to conduct physician \n     education and training programs on current lead screening \n     policies. CDC will issue recommendations and establish \n     requirements for its grantees to ensure\n\n[[Page S9100]]\n\n     uniform reporting of blood lead levels from laboratories to \n     State and local health departments and to improve data \n     linkages between health departments and federally funded \n     benefit programs.\n       This provision authorizes new funding through the Maternal \n     and Child Health Block Grant to states with a demonstrated \n     need to conduct outreach and education for families at risk \n     of lead poisoning, provide individual family education \n     designed to reduce exposures to children with elevated blood \n     lead levels, implement community environmental interventions, \n     and ensure continuous quality measurement and improvement \n     plans for communities committed to comprehensive lead \n     poisoning prevention.\n\n             Title XXVI--Screening for Heritable Disorders\n\n       Amends the Public Health Service Act to enhance, improve or \n     expand the ability of State and local public health agencies \n     to provide screening, counseling or health care services to \n     newborns and children having or at risk for heritable \n     disorders. This provision also creates an advisory committee \n     to provide advice and recommendations to the Secretary for \n     the development of grant administration policies and \n     priorities, and to enhance the ability of the Secretary to \n     reduce mortality or morbidity from heritable disorders.\n\n              Title XXVII--Pediatric Research Protections\n\n       This provision addresses critical safety issues in \n     children's research by requiring the Secretary of HHS to \n     review the current federal regulations for the protection of \n     children participating in research, which address such issues \n     as determining acceptable levels of risk and obtaining \n     parental permission, and to report to Congress on how to \n     update them to ensure the highest standards of safety.\n\n                 Title XXVIII--Miscellaneous Provisions\n\n       This provision would require the NIH Director to report to \n     Congress within 180 days of enactment on activities conducted \n     and supported by the NIH during FY 2000 with respect to rare \n     diseases in children and the activities that are planned to \n     be conducted and supported by the NIH with respect to such \n     diseases during the FY 2001-2005. This provision also \n     requires HHS to study issues related to access to effective \n     treatment for metabolic disorders, including PKU. Results of \n     the study shall be made available to public health agencies, \n     Medicaid, insurance commissioners, and other interested \n     parties.\n\n           DIVISION B--YOUTH DRUG AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES\n\n       This division reauthorizes programs within the Substance \n     Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to \n     improve mental health and substance abuse services for \n     children and adolescents, implement proposals giving States \n     more flexibility in the use of block grant funds with \n     accountability based on performance, and consolidate \n     discretionary grant authorities to give the Secretary more \n     flexibility to respond to the needs of those who need mental \n     health and substance abuse services. It also provides a \n     waiver from the requirements of the Narcotic Addict Treatment \n     Act that would permit qualified physicians to dispense or \n     prescribe schedule III, IV, or V narcotic drugs or \n     combinations of such drugs approved by FDA for the treatment \n     of heroin addiction. It also provides a comprehensive \n     strategy to combat Methamphetamine use.\n\n     Title XXXI--Provisions Relating to Services for Children and \n                              Adolescents\n\n\n                  Section 3101--Children and Violence\n\n       Authorizes $100 million for the Secretary to make grants to \n     public entities in consultation with the Attorney General and \n     the Secretary of Education to assist local communities in \n     developing ways to assist children in dealing with violence. \n     Four different types of grants are permitted under the \n     authority: grants to provide financial support to enable the \n     communities to implement the programs; to provide technical \n     assistance to local communities; to provide technical \n     assistance in the development of policies; and to assist in \n     the creation of community partnerships among the schools, law \n     enforcement and mental health services. Grantees would have \n     to ensure that they will carry out six activities which \n     include: security of the school; educational reform to deal \n     with violence; review and updating of school policies to deal \n     with violence; alcohol and drug abuse prevention and early \n     intervention; mental health prevention and treatment \n     services; and early childhood development and psychosocial \n     services. However, Federal funding is available for \n     prevention, early intervention, and treatment services.\n       Authorizes $50 million for the Secretary to develop \n     knowledge with regard to evidence-based practices for \n     treating psychiatric disorders resulting from witnessing or \n     experiencing domestic, school and community violence and \n     terrorism. Establishes centers of excellence to provide \n     technical assistance to communities in dealing with the \n     emotional burden of domestic, school and community violence \n     and terrorism if and when they occur.\n\n\n                    Section 3102--Emergency Response\n\n       Permits the Secretary to use up to 2.5% of the funds \n     appropriated for discretionary grants for responding to \n     emergencies. The authority would permit an objective review \n     instead of peer review. This would permit an expedited \n     process for making awards. The Secretary is required to \n     define an emergency in the Federal Register subject to public \n     comment.\n       The section also includes language that provides additional \n     confidentiality protection for the information collected from \n     individuals who participate in national surveys conducted by \n     the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration.\n\n\n             Section 3103--High Risk Youth Reauthorization\n\n       Reauthorizes the High Risk Youth Program, which provides \n     funds to public and non-profit private entities to establish \n     programs for the prevention of drug abuse among high risk \n     youth.\n\n\n   Section 3104--Substance Abuse Treatment Services for Children and \n                              Adolescents\n\n       Authorizes $40 million for the Secretary to make grants, \n     contracts or cooperative agreement to public and non-profit \n     private entities including American Indian tribes and tribal \n     organizations for the purpose of providing substance abuse \n     treatment services for children and adolescents. Priority is \n     given to applicants who can apply evidenced based and cost \n     effective methods, coordinate services with other social \n     service agencies, provide a continuum of care dependent on \n     the needs of the individual, provide treatment that is gender \n     specific and culturally appropriate, involve and work with \n     families of those in treatment, and provide aftercare.\n       Authorizes $20 million for the Secretary to make grants, \n     contracts or cooperative agreements to public and non-profit \n     private entities including local educational agencies for the \n     purposes of providing early intervention substance abuse \n     services for children and adolescents. Under the provision, \n     priority is given to applicants who demonstrate an ability to \n     screen for and assess the level of involvement of children in \n     substance abuse, make appropriate referrals, provide \n     counseling and ancillary services, and who develop a network \n     with other social agencies. Requires the Secretary to ensure \n     geographical distribution of awards.\n       Authorizes $4 million to create centers of excellence to \n     assist States and local jurisdictions in providing \n     appropriate care for adolescents who are involved with the \n     juvenile justice system and have a serious emotional \n     disturbance.\n       Authorizes $10 million for the Secretary to make grants, \n     contracts, or cooperative agreements to carry out school \n     based as well as community based programs to prevent the use \n     of methamphetamine and inhalants.\n\n\n   Section 3105--Comprehensive Community Services for Children With \n                     Serious Emotional Disturbance\n\n       This program was begun in 1994 to provide seed money to \n     local communities to develop systems of care for children \n     with serious emotional disturbances thus improving the \n     quality of care and increasing the likelihood that these \n     children would remain in local communities rather than being \n     sent to residential facilities. This section reauthorizes \n     this program through fiscal year 2002 and provides an \n     authority for the Secretary to waive certain requirements for \n     territories and American Indian tribes.\n       This section also would extend some grants under this \n     program to 6 years. The intent of the program is to provide \n     seed funding for comprehensive systems of care. \n     Unfortunately, many successful programs have had a difficult \n     time ensuring their continuation without Federal support. \n     This provision would give them an additional year to secure \n     that support.\n\n\n        Section 3106--Services for Children of Substance Abusers\n\n       Improves coordination by transferring this program from \n     Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) to SAMHSA \n     and authorizes the Secretary to make grants to public and \n     non-profit private entities to provide the following services \n     to children of substance abusers: periodic evaluations, \n     primary pediatric care, other health and mental health \n     services, therapeutic interventions, preventive counseling, \n     counseling related to witnessing of chronic violence, \n     referrals for and assistance in establishing eligibility for \n     services under other programs, and other developmental \n     services. Grantees would also provide services to families \n     where one or both of the parents are substance abusers. The \n     program requires that grantees match Federal funds with funds \n     from other sources.\n       The program is authorized at $50 million through fiscal \n     year 2002 and the authority is updated to include changes \n     that have occurred since fiscal year 1992 when it was first \n     authorized: e.g. developing connection to the Temporary \n     Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and the Children's \n     Health Insurance Program (CHIP) programs.\n\n\n               Section 3107--Services for Youth Offenders\n\n       Authorizes $40 million for the Secretary to make grants, \n     contracts or cooperative agreements to State and local \n     juvenile justice agencies to help such agencies provide \n     aftercare services for youth offenders who have or are at \n     risk of a serious emotional disturbance and who have been \n     discharged from juvenile justice facilities. The funds may be \n     used for planning, coordinating and implementing these \n     services.\n\n\n   Section 3108--Grants for strengthening families through community \n                              partnerships\n\n       Provides for grants to develop and implement model \n     substance abuse prevention programs and substance abuse \n     prevention services for individuals in high risk families.\n\n[[Page S9101]]\n\n                    Section 3109--Underage Drinking\n\n       Authorizes $25 million for the Secretary to make awards of \n     grants, cooperative agreements or contracts to public and \n     nonprofit private entities, including Indian tribes and \n     tribal organizations to enable such entities to develop plans \n     for and to carry out school based and community based \n     programs for the prevention of alcoholic beverages \n     consumption by individuals who have not attained the legal \n     drinking age.\n\n\n   Section 3110--Services for Individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome\n\n       Authorizes $25 million for the Secretary to make grants, \n     cooperative agreement or contracts with public or nonprofit \n     private entities including Indian tribes and tribal \n     organizations to provide services to individuals diagnosed \n     with fetal alcohol syndrome or alcohol related birth defects. \n     The funds can be used for screening and testing; mental \n     health, health or substance abuse services; vocational \n     services; housing assistance; and parenting skills.\n       Authorizes $5 million for the Secretary to make grants, \n     cooperative agreements or contracts to public or nonprofit \n     private entities for the purposes of establishing not more \n     than 4 centers of excellence to study techniques for the \n     prevention of fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol related \n     birth defects and adaptations of innovative clinical \n     interventions and service delivery improvements.\n\n\n                    Section 3111--Suicide Prevention\n\n       The provision authorizes $75 million for the Secretary to \n     make grants, contracts or cooperative agreement to public and \n     nonprofit private entities to establish programs to reduce \n     suicide deaths in the United States among children and \n     adolescents. The provision requires collaboration among \n     various agencies with the Department of Health and Human \n     Services. Findings from the programs are then to be \n     disseminated to public and private entities.\n\n\n                    Section 3112--General Provisions\n\n       This provision amends the sections that establish the \n     responsibilities of the Centers for Substance Abuse \n     Treatment, Substance Abuse Prevention and the Mental Health \n     Services to include an emphasis on children. In the case of \n     the Center for Mental Health Services it would require the \n     Director to collaborate with the Attorney General and the \n     Secretary of Education on programs that assist local \n     communities in developing programs to address violence among \n     children in schools.\n\n           Title XXXII--Provisions Relating to Mental Health\n\n\n  Section 3201--Priority Mental Health Needs of Regional and National \n                              Significance\n\n       In 1996, the appropriation committees started a practice \n     which they have continued through fiscal year 1999 of \n     appropriating funds to SAMHSA's general authority (Section \n     501) instead of specific programs. This section codifies what \n     the appropriations committees have done by repealing several \n     specific authorities related to mental health services in \n     favor of a broad authority that gives the Secretary more \n     flexibility in responding to individuals in need of mental \n     health services. It would authorize four types of grants: (1) \n     knowledge development and application grants which are used \n     to develop more information on how best to serve those in \n     need; (2) training grants to disseminate the information that \n     the agency garners through its knowledge development; (3) \n     targeted capacity response which enables the agency to \n     respond to service needs in local communities; and (4) \n     systems change grants and grants to support family and \n     consumer networks in States. Repealed in this section are \n     sections 303, 520A and 520B of the Public Health Service Act \n     and section 612 of the Stewart B. McKinney Act.\n       This section includes a provision that would permit \n     $6,000,000 of the first $100,000,000 appropriated to the \n     program and 10 percent of all funds above $100,000,000 to be \n     given competitively to States to assist them in developing \n     data infrastructures for collecting and reporting on \n     performance measures.\n       This section also addresses the importance of the interface \n     between mental health services and primary care.\n\n\n      Section 3202--Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals\n\n       The section reauthorizes the Grants for the Benefit of \n     Homeless Individuals program which provides grants to develop \n     and expand mental health and substance abuse treatment \n     services to homeless individuals. Preference is maintained \n     for organizations that provide integrated primary health \n     care, substance abuse and mental health services to homeless \n     individuals, programs that demonstrate effectiveness in \n     serving homeless individuals, and programs that have \n     experience in providing housing for individuals who are \n     homeless.\n\n\n Section 3203--Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness \n                                 (PATH)\n\n       This section reauthorizes the PATH program which provides \n     funds to States under a formula for the provision of mental \n     health services to homeless individuals. Preference is \n     maintained for organizations with demonstrated effectiveness \n     in serving homeless veterans. The section also provides an \n     authority for the Secretary to waive certain requirements for \n     territories.\n\n\n   Section 3204--Community Mental Health Services (CMHS) Performance \n                          Partnership Program\n\n       The Community Mental Health Services Block Grant is a \n     formula program under which funds are distributed to States \n     for the provision of community based mental health services \n     for adults with a serious mental illness and children with a \n     serious emotional disturbance. This program and the Substance \n     Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant provide funds to \n     States to provide services. State accountability under these \n     programs is built on State expenditure of funds.\n       Provisions in this section and other sections of this bill \n     provide for the first steps in increasing State flexibility \n     in the use of funds while establishing an accountability \n     system based on performance. In this section, the number of \n     elements that States must include in their plan for use of \n     CMHS Block Grant funds are reduced from 12 to 5, thus \n     providing additional flexibility for the States and reduced \n     administrative costs.\n       This section also expands the responsibilities of the \n     already existing State Planning Councils. Under current law, \n     these councils are required to review and comment on State \n     plans for use of CMHS Block Grant funds. Under this provision \n     they would also be required to review and comment on State \n     reports on the outcomes of their activities.\n       One provision within current law requires States to \n     maintain their financial support for providing community \n     based mental health services at an average of what they spent \n     over the past two years. This requirement discourages States \n     from adding one time infusions of funds into community mental \n     health services since it would increase the States' \n     maintenance of effort requirement. This provision would \n     indicate that an infusion of funds of a non-recurring nature \n     for a singular purpose may be exempt from the calculation of \n     the maintenance of effort requirement.\n       Current law allows for the Secretary to set a date for the \n     submission of grant applications. Applications must include a \n     plan on how the State intends to use the funds and a report \n     on how funds were spent the previous year. A provision in \n     this section would establish that State plans for use of \n     funds must be submitted by September 1 of the fiscal year \n     prior to the fiscal year for which the State is seeking \n     funds and the reports by the following December 1.\n       The section also makes changes to the current waiver \n     authority for territories.\n\n\n                Section 3205--Determination of Allotment\n\n       There are three elements to determine the allocation of \n     funding for SAMHSA block grants: (1) the population of \n     individuals needing services; (2) the cost of providing \n     services; and (3) the state income level. In August of 1997, \n     SAMHSA changed the data on determining the cost of providing \n     services from the use of manufacturing wages to \n     nonmanufacturing wages, which was determined to be the most \n     appropriate method to reflect cost differences among states. \n     This action would have caused a decline of funding in several \n     states. To address this problem, this section makes permanent \n     provisions enacted in Public Law 105-277 on the formula for \n     distribution of funds under the Community Mental Health \n     Services Block Grant (CMHS). The CMHS Block Grant formula \n     includes a ``hold harmless'' provision which guarantees that \n     no State will receive less funding than it did in fiscal year \n     1998.\n\n\nSection 3206--Protection and Advocacy for Mentally Ill Individuals Act \n                                of 1986\n\n       This section makes technical changes to the formula for \n     distribution of funds under this program to correct a \n     provision that would have inappropriately reduced minimum \n     State allotments. It also provides for the renaming of the \n     Act to conform with changes made in previous laws, makes a \n     technical change to the provision on territories and \n     reauthorizes the program through fiscal year 2002.\n       The bill would also permit an American Indian Consortia to \n     receive direct funding after the appropriation exceeds $25 \n     million. It would also extend the responsibilities of the \n     Protection and Advocacy program to individuals living in the \n     communities when the appropriation exceeds $30 million.\n\n\n   Section 3207--Requirement Relating to the Rights of Residents of \n                           Certain Facilities\n\n       This measure would require facilities that are both within \n     the purview of the Protection and Advocacy program and which \n     receive appropriated funding from the Federal government to \n     protect and promote the rights of individuals with regard to \n     the appropriate use of seclusions and restraints. Such \n     covered facilities are required to inform the Secretary of \n     each death that occurs while a patient is restrained or in \n     seclusion, or each death that occurs within 24 hours after a \n     patient is restrained or in seclusion, or where it is \n     reasonable to assume that a patient's death is a result of \n     seclusion or restraint. The Secretary is required to issue \n     regulations within one year of enactment on appropriate staff \n     levels, appropriate training for staff on the use of \n     restraints and seclusions.\n       Requires any such facility that is supported in whole or in \n     part with funds appropriated under the Public Health Service \n     Act to protect and promote the rights of each resident of the \n     facility, including the right to be free from physical or \n     mental abuse, corporal punishment, and any restraints or \n     involuntary seclusion imposed for purposes of discipline or \n     convenience; sets standards for when restraints or seclusion \n     may be imposed; requires each such facility to notify\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\n     the appropriate State licensing or regulatory agency of each \n     death that occurs in the facility and of the use of seclusion \n     or restraint in accordance with regulations promulgated by \n     the Secretary. Failure to comply with these requirements \n     including the failure to appropriately train staff makes such \n     facility ineligible for participation in any program \n     supported in whole or in part by funds appropriated under \n     this Act.\n\n\n   Section 3208--Requirements relating to the rights of residents of \n certain non-medical community-based facilities for children and youth\n\n       Ensures that appropriately-trained supervisory personnel \n     are present whenever a physical restraint is required of a \n     resident of a non-medical community-based treatment facility. \n     The use of mechanical or chemical restraints in such \n     facilities is prohibited and physical restraint must be used \n     only in emergency situations. The section also authorizes the \n     Secretary to develop guidelines for licensing rules regarding \n     training use of restraints.\n\n\n        Section 3209--Grants for Emergency Mental Health Centers\n\n       This provision authorizes $25 million for the Secretary to \n     make grants to States, political subdivisions of States, \n     Indian tribes and tribal organizations to support the \n     designation of hospitals and health centers as Emergency \n     Mental Health Centers which will serve as a central receiving \n     point in the community for individuals who may be in need of \n     emergency mental health services.\n\n\n            Section 3210--Grants for Jail Diversion Programs\n\n       Authorizes $10 million for the Secretary to make grants to \n     States, political subdivisions of States, Indian tribes and \n     tribal organizations to develop and implement programs to \n     divert individuals with a mental illness from the criminal \n     justice system to community-based services.\n\n\n     Section 3211--Grants for Improving Outcomes for Children and \n  Adolescents Through Services Integration Between Child Welfare and \n                         Mental Health Services\n\n       The provision authorizes $10 million for the Secretary to \n     make grants to States, political subdivisions of States, \n     Indian tribes and tribal organizations to provide integrated \n     child welfare and mental health services for children and \n     adolescents under 19 years of age in the child welfare system \n     or at risk for becoming part of the system, and parents or \n     caregivers with a mental illness or a mental illness and a \n     co-occurring substance abuse disorder.\n\n\n  Section 3212--Grants for the Integrated Treatment of Serious Mental \n                Illness and Co-occurring Substance Abuse\n\n       Authorizes $40 million for the Secretary to make grants, \n     contracts or cooperative agreements with States, political \n     subdivisions of States, Indian tribes and tribal \n     organizations for the development or expansion of programs to \n     provide integrated treatment services for individuals with a \n     serious mental illness and a co-occurring substance abuse \n     disorder.\n\n\n                     Section 3213--Training Grants\n\n       The prevision authorizes $25 million for the Secretary to \n     award grants States, political subdivisions of States, Indian \n     tribes and tribal organizations or non-profit private \n     entities to train teachers and other relevant school \n     personnel to recognize symptoms of childhood and adolescent \n     mental disorders and to refer family members to the \n     appropriate mental health services if necessary; to train \n     emergency services personnel to identify and appropriately \n     respond to persons with a mental illness; and to provide \n     education to such teachers and emergency personnel regarding \n     resources that are available in the community for individuals \n     with a mental illness.\n\n          Title XXXIII--Provisions Relating to Substance Abuse\n\n\nSection 3301--Priority Substance Abuse Treatment Needs of Regional and \n                         National Significance\n\n       As explained in section 3201, this section codifies what \n     the appropriations committees have done by repealing several \n     specific authorities related to substance abuse treatment \n     services that gives the Secretary more flexibility in \n     responding to the needs of people in need of substance abuse \n     treatment. It would authorize three types of grants: (1) \n     knowledge development and application grants, which are used \n     to develop more information on how best to serve those in \n     need; (2) training grants to disseminate the information that \n     the agency garners through its knowledge development; and (3) \n     targeted capacity response, which enables the agency to \n     respond to services needs in local communities. Repealed in \n     this section are sections 508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 571 and \n     1971 of the Public Health Service Act.\n       This section also addresses the importance of the interface \n     between substance abuse treatment services and primary care.\n\n\nSection 3302--Priority Substance Abuse Prevention Needs of Regional and \n                         National Significance\n\n       This section implements in authorization for substance \n     abuse prevention what the appropriations committees did in \n     fiscal year 1996. It authorizes the same type of grants as \n     described in the previous section except that they pertain to \n     substance abuse prevention. Repeals sections 516 and 518 of \n     the Public Health Service Act.\n       This section also addresses the importance of the interface \n     between substance abuse prevention services and primary care.\n\n\n  Section 3303--Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Performance \n                        Partnership Block Grant\n\n       This program provides funds to States for their use in \n     providing substance abuse prevention and treatment services. \n     While there is considerable flexibility in State use of \n     funds, there are a number of requirements which are directly \n     related to public health issues. This provision would begin \n     the process of giving States greater flexibility in their use \n     of funds and accountability based on performance instead of \n     expenditures.\n       Greater flexibility is enhanced by the repeal of a \n     requirement that States spend 35 percent of their allotment \n     on drug related activities and 35 percent on alcohol related \n     activities. A provision requiring States to maintain a \n     $100,000 revolving fund to support homes for persons \n     recovering from substance abuse would be made optional thus \n     permitting States to continue such efforts or to use those \n     funds for other services as they deem necessary.\n       This section also creates authority for the Secretary to \n     waive certain requirements for States who meet established \n     criteria. Those criteria would be established in regulation \n     after consultation with the States, providers and consumers.\n       One provision within current law requires the State to \n     maintain its financial support for substance abuse prevention \n     and treatment services at the average of what it spent over \n     the past two years. While States support this requirement, it \n     discourages States from adding one time infusions of funds \n     into substance abuse services since it would increase the \n     calculation of the State's maintenance of effort requirement. \n     This section includes a provision that would exempt from \n     maintenance of effort requirements any one time infusion of \n     funds which are for a singular purpose.\n       Current law allows the Secretary to set a date for the \n     submission of grant applications. Applications include a plan \n     on how funds will be used and a report on how funds were \n     spent the previous year. A provision in this section would \n     establish that State applications are due on October 1 of the \n     fiscal year prior to the fiscal year for which they are \n     seeking funds.\n       This section also simplifies the waiver for territories and \n     reauthorizes the program through fiscal year 2002.\n\n\n                Section 3304--Determination of Allotment\n\n       There are three elements to determine the allocation of \n     funding for SAMHSA block grants: (1) the population of \n     individuals needing services; (2) the cost of providing \n     services; and (3) the state income level. In August of 1997, \n     SAMHSA changed the data on determining the cost of providing \n     services from the use of manufacturing wages to \n     nonmanufacturing wages, which was determined to be the most \n     appropriate method to reflect cost differences among states. \n     This action would have caused a decline of funding in several \n     states. To address this problem, this section makes permanent \n     provisions in Public Law 105-277 on the formula for \n     distribution of funds under the Substance Abuse Prevention \n     and Treatment Block Grant (SAPT).\n       The SAPT Block Grant formula includes Minimum Growth and \n     Small State Minimum Rules needed to complete the phase-in of \n     the new formula. Also, the provision includes a Proportional \n     Scale Down Rule if appropriations decline in future years.\n\n\n   Section 3305--Nondiscrimination and Institutional Safeguards for \n                          Religious Providers\n\n       This section would permit religious organizations which \n     provide substance abuse services to receive Federal \n     assistance either through the Substance Abuse Prevention and \n     Treatment Block Grant or discretionary grants through the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \n     while maintaining their religious character and their ability \n     to hire individuals of the same faith. Such programs may not \n     discriminate against anyone interested in treatment at the \n     facility. If a person who is referred for services needs or \n     would prefer to be served in a different facility, the \n     program will refer that person to an appropriate treatment \n     program.\n       The provision further stipulates that Federal funds \n     received under a block or discretionary grant for substance \n     abuse services by a religious organization will be maintained \n     in a separate account and only the Federal funds used by such \n     providers shall be subject to Federal audit requirements.\n       A religious organization that believes that it has been \n     discriminated against based on the fact that it is a faith \n     based program may bring an action for injunctive relief \n     against the appropriate government agency or entity that has \n     allegedly committed the violation.\n       Federal funds may not be used for sectarian worship, \n     instruction or proselytization.\n       If a State or local government chooses to co-mingle their \n     funds with Federal funds, then the State and or local \n     government funds are subject to the provisions of this \n     section.\n\n\n Section 3306--Alcohol and Drug Prevention and Treatment Services for \n                      Indians and Native Alaskans\n\n       Authorizes $15 million for the Secretary to make grants, \n     contracts or cooperative agreements with public and private \n     non-profit private entities including American Indian\n\n[[Page S9103]]\n\n     tribes and tribal organizations and Native Alaskans for the \n     purpose of providing alcohol and drug prevention or treatment \n     services for Indians and Native Alaskans. Priority is given \n     to those entities that will provide such services on \n     reservations or tribal lands, employ culturally appropriate \n     approaches, and have provided prevention or treatment \n     services for at least one year prior to applying for a grant. \n     The Secretary is required to submit a report to the \n     Committees of jurisdiction after three years and annually \n     thereafter describing the services that have been provided \n     under this program.\n\n\n               Section 3307--Establishment of Commission\n\n       Authorizes $5 million to establish a Commission on Indian \n     and Native Alaskan Health Care that shall carry out a \n     comprehensive examination of the health concerns of Indians \n     and Native Alaskans living on reservations or tribal lands. \n     The Commission will consist of the Secretary as Chair and 15 \n     appointed and voting members, 10 of whom must be American \n     Indians or Native Alaskans. The Director of the Indian Health \n     Service and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs are non-voting \n     members. The commission is to issue a report within three \n     years detailing the health condition of individuals living on \n     tribal lands, what services are currently available and if \n     there are insufficient services detail why this situation \n     exists, and make recommendations to the Congress on how to \n     address these issues.\n\n   Title XXXIV--Provisions Relating to Flexibility and Accountability\n\n\n           Section 3401--General Authorities and Peer Review\n\n       This section removes the requirement that there be an \n     Associate Administrator for Alcohol Policy, and makes \n     necessary corrections to the peer review requirements to \n     reflect changes since 1992. The section also includes \n     language that provides additional confidentiality protection \n     for the information collected from individuals who \n     participate in national surveys conducted by the Substance \n     Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\n\n                    Section 3402--Advisory Councils\n\n       SAMHSA and each of its Centers are required under statute \n     to have an Advisory Council. Current law requires that they \n     meet three times a year. This section reduces the number of \n     times the councils are required to meet to two.\n\n\nSection 3403--General Provisions for the Performance Partnership Block \n                                 Grants\n\n       As part of the effort to change the current CMHS and SAPT \n     Block Grants into performance-based systems, the Secretary is \n     required to submit to Congress within two years a plan for \n     what these performance based programs would look like and how \n     they would operate. This plan would include how the States \n     would receive greater flexibility, what performance measures \n     would be used in holding States accountable, definitions for \n     the data elements that would be collected, the funds needed \n     to implement this system and where those funds would come \n     from, and needed legislative changes. This would give the \n     committees of jurisdiction one year to consider the plan and \n     implement any necessary changes in the next reauthorization \n     of SAMHSA in 2003.\n\n\n               Section 3404--Data Infrastructure Projects\n\n       This section creates an authority for the Secretary to make \n     grants to States to assist them in developing the data \n     infrastructure necessary to implement a performance based \n     system. States are required to match the Federal \n     contribution.\n\n\n      Section 3405--Repeal of Obsolete Addict Referral Provisions\n\n       This section repeals certain obsolete provisions of the \n     Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966.\n\n\n         Section 3406--Individuals with Co-Occurring Disorders\n\n       The section requires the Secretary to report to the \n     committees of jurisdiction on how services are currently \n     being provided to those with a co-occurring mental health and \n     substance abuse disorder, what improvements are needed to \n     ensure that they receive the services they need, and a \n     summary of best practices on how to provide those services \n     including prevention of substance abuse among individuals who \n     have a mental illness and treatment for those with a co-\n     occurring disorder.\n\n\n   Section 3407--Services for Individuals with Co-Occurring Disorders\n\n       The section clarifies that both Substance Abuse Prevention \n     and Treatment and Community Mental Health Service Block Grant \n     funds may be used to provide services to those with a co-\n     occurring mental health and substance abuse disorder as long \n     as the funds are used for the purposes for which they were \n     authorized.\n\n Title XXXV--Waiver Authority for Physicians Who Dispense or Prescribe \n  Certain Narcotic Drugs for Maintenance Treatment or Detoxification \n                               Treatment\n\n\n                       Section 3501--Short Title\n\n                  Drug Addition Treatment Act of 2000\n\n\nSection 3502--Waiver Authority for Physicians Who Dispense or Prescribe \n  Certain Narcotic Drugs for Maintenance Treatment or Detoxification \n                               Treatment\n\n       The waiver from the requirements of the Narcotic Addict \n     Treatment Act would permit qualified physicians to dispense \n     (including prescribe) schedule III, IV, or V narcotic drugs \n     or combinations of such drugs approved by FDA for the \n     treatment of heroin addiction. The physician would be \n     required to refer the patient for appropriate counseling and \n     limit his or her practice to 30 patients.\n       Physicians are qualified if they are licensed under State \n     law and hold a subspeciality board certification in addiction \n     psychiatry from the American Board of Medical Specialties, \n     certification in a subspeciality from the American \n     Osteopathic Association, certification from the American \n     Society of Addiction Medicine, the physician has participated \n     in a clinical trial on the narcotic drug, is approved by the \n     State licensing board or has such other training or \n     experience as the Secretary considers necessary. Permits the \n     Secretary to issue regulation on criteria for using other \n     credentialing bodies or on the limit of 30 patients. The \n     Secretary is also required under the provision to issue \n     practice guidelines within 120 days. States are given 3 years \n     in which to pass legislation that would prohibit a \n     practitioner from dispensing such drugs or combinations of \n     such drugs if they want.\n       The Secretary or the Attorney General are authorized to \n     determine whether the program is working and to stop the \n     program with 60 days notice.\n\n            Title XXXVI--Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation\n\n\n                       Section 3601--Short Title\n\n             Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act of 1999\n\n                 Subtitle A--Methamphetamine Production\n\n                       Part I--Criminal Penalties\n\n\n Section 3611--Enhanced Punishment of Amphetamine Laboratory Operators\n\n       Section 3602 directs the Sentencing Commission to raise the \n     penalties for amphetamine related offenses to a level \n     comparable to those for methamphetamine.\n\n\n  Section 3612--Enhance Punishment of Amphetamine and Methamphetamine \n                               Operators\n\n       This section amends the Sentencing Guidelines by increasing \n     the base offense level for manufacturing amphetamine or \n     methamphetamine to not less than level 27 if the offense \n     created a substantial risk of harm to human life or to the \n     environment and to not less than level 30 if the offense \n     created a substantial risk of harm to the life of a minor or \n     incompetent.\n\n\n       Section 3613--Mandatory Restitution for Meth Lab Clean-Up\n\n       Section 103 makes reimbursement for the costs incurred by \n     the U.S. or State and local governments for the cleanup \n     associated with the manufacture of amphetamine or \n     methamphetamine mandatory. It also provides that the \n     restitution money will go to the Asset Forfeiture Fund \n     instead of the treasury.\n\n\n              Section 3614--Methamphetamine Paraphernalia\n\n       This section amends the anti-paraphernalia statute to \n     include paraphernalia used in connection with methamphetamine \n     use.\n\n                   Part II--Enhanced Law Enforcement\n\n\nSection 3621--Environmental Hazards Associated With Illegal Manufacture \n                   of Amphetamine and Methamphetamine\n\n       This section authorizes the DEA to receive money from the \n     Asset Forfeiture Fund to pay for clean-up costs associated \n     with the illegal manufacture of amphetamine or \n     methamphetamine for the purposes of federal forfeiture and \n     disposition. It also allows for reimbursement to State and \n     local entities for clean-up costs when they assist in a \n     federal prosecution on amphetamine or methamphetamine related \n     charges to the extent such costs exceed equitable sharing \n     payments made to such State or local government in such \n     case. The section also expressly states that funds from \n     the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund can be used to pay \n     for clean-up costs.\n\n\n  Section 3622--Reduction in Threshold for Non-Safe Harbor Productions\n\n       This section reduces the threshold for retail sales of non-\n     safe harbor products containing pseudoephedrine or \n     phenylpropanolamine from 24 grams to 9 grams. It also limits \n     the package size to not more than 3 grams of pseudoephedrine \n     or phenylpropanolamine base.\n\n\n Section 3623--Training for Drug Enforcement Administration and State \n      and Local Law Enforcement Personnel Relating to Clandestine \n                              Laboratories\n\n       Section 3613 authorizes $5.5 million in funding for DEA \n     training programs designed to (1) train State and local law \n     enforcement in techniques used in meth investigations (2) \n     provide a certification program for State and local law \n     enforcement enabling them to meet requirements with respect \n     to the handling of wastes created by meth labs; (3) create a \n     certification program that enables certain State and local \n     law enforcement to recertify other law enforcement in their \n     regions; and (4) staff mobile training teams which provide \n     State and local law enforcement with advanced training in \n     conducting clan lab investigations and with training that \n     enables them to recertify other law enforcement personnel. \n     The training programs are authorized for 3 years after which \n     the States, either alone or in consultation/combination with \n     other States, will be responsible for training their own \n     personnel. The\n\n[[Page S9104]]\n\n     States will be required to submit a report detailing what \n     measures they are taking to ensure that they have programs in \n     place to take over the responsibility after the three year \n     federal program expires.\n\n\nSec. 3624--Combating Methamphetamine in High Intensity Drug Trafficking \n                                 Areas\n\n       This section authorizes $15 million a year for fiscal years \n     2000-2004 to be appropriated to ONDCP to combat trafficking \n     of methamphetamine in designated HIDTA's by hiring new \n     federal, State, and local law enforcement personnel, \n     including agents, investigators, prosecutors, lab technicians \n     and chemists. It provides that the funds shall be apportioned \n     among the HIDTA's based on the following factors: (1) number \n     of Meth labs discovered in the previous year; (2) number of \n     Meth prosecutions in the previous year; (3) number of Meth \n     arrests in the previous year; (4) the amounts of Meth seized \n     in the previous year; and (5) intelligence and predictive \n     data from the DEA and HHS showing patterns and trends in \n     abuse, trafficking and transportation patterns in \n     methamphetamine, amphetamine and listed chemicals. Before \n     apportioning any funds, the Director must certify that the \n     law enforcement entities responsible for clan lab seizures \n     are providing lab seizure data to the national clandestine \n     laboratory database at the El Paso Intelligence Center. It \n     also provides that not more than five percent of the \n     appropriated amount may be used for administrative costs.\n\n\n Section 3625--Combating Amphetamine and Methamphetamine Manufacturing \n                            and Trafficking\n\n       This section authorizes $6.5 million to be appropriated for \n     the hiring of new agents to (1) assist State and local law \n     enforcement in small and mid-sized communities in all phases \n     of drug investigations, including assistance with foreign-\n     language interpretation; (2) staff additional regional \n     enforcement and mobile enforcement teams; (3) establish \n     additional resident offices and posts of duty to assist State \n     and local law enforcement in rural areas; and (4) provide the \n     Special Operations Division with additional agents for \n     intelligence and investigative operations.\n       It also authorizes $3 million to enhance the investigative \n     and related functions of the Chemical Control Program to \n     implement further the provisions of the Comprehensive \n     Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996. The funds shall be used \n     to account accurately for the import and export of List I \n     chemicals and coordinate investigations surrounding the \n     diversion of these chemicals; to develop a computer \n     infrastructure sufficient to process and analyze time \n     sensitive enforcement information from suspicious orders \n     reported to DEA field offices and other law enforcement; and \n     to establish an education, training, and communications \n     process to alert industry of current trends and emerging \n     patterns of illicit manufacturing activities.\n\n                Part III--Abuse Prevention and Treatment\n\n\n          Section 3631--Expansion of Methamphetamine Research\n\n       This section allows the Director of the National Institute \n     on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to make grants and enter into \n     cooperative agreements to expand the National Drug Abuse \n     Treatment Clinical Trials Network and current and on-going \n     research and clinical trials with treatment centers relating \n     to methamphetamine abuse and addiction and other biomedical, \n     behavioral and social issues related to methamphetamine abuse \n     and addiction. It authorizes to be appropriated such sums as \n     may be necessary and such sums are to supplement and not \n     supplant any other amounts appropriated for research on \n     methamphetamine abuse and addiction.\n\n\n   Section 3632--Methamphetamine and Amphetamine Addiction Treatment\n\n       This section authorizes $10 million in grants to States \n     that have a high rate, or have had a rapid increase, in \n     methamphetamine or amphetamine abuse or addiction, for \n     treatment of methamphetamine and amphetamine addiction.\n\n\n            Section 3633--Study of Methamphetamine Treatment\n\n       This section requires the Secretary of HHS, in consultation \n     with the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of \n     Sciences, to conduct a study on the development of \n     medications for the treatment of addiction to amphetamine and \n     methamphetamine and to report the findings to the Judiciary \n     Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n                Part IV--Abuse Prevention and Treatment\n\n\n   Section 3641--Report on Consumption of Methamphetamine and Other \n  Illicit Drugs in Rural Areas, Metropolitan Areas, and Consolidated \n                           Metropolitan Areas\n\n       This section requires HHS to include in its annual National \n     Household Survey on Drug Abuse prevalence data on the \n     consumption of methamphetamine and other illicit drugs in \n     rural, metropolitan, and consolidated metropolitan areas.\n\n\n    Section 3642--Report on Diversion of Ordinary, Over-the-Counter \n            Pseudoephedrine and Phenylpropanolamine Products\n\n       This section requires the Attorney General to conduct a \n     study on the use of ordinary over-the-counter pseudoephedrine \n     and phenylpropanolamine products in the clandestine \n     production of illicit drugs. The report is to be submitted to \n     Congress and shall include the AG's findings and \n     recommendations on the need for additional measures, \n     including thresholds, to prevent diversion of blister pack \n     products.\n\n               Subtitle B--Controlled Substance Generally\n\n\n  Section 3651--Enhanced Punishment of Trafficking in List I Chemicals\n\n       This section directs the Sentencing Commission to increase \n     the penalties for violations involving ephedrine, \n     pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine so that the \n     penalties correspond to the quantity of controlled substance \n     that could reasonably have been manufactured from these \n     chemicals. The Sentencing Commission is also directed to \n     establish a conversion table to determine the quantity of \n     controlled substances that can be manufactured from these \n     chemicals. The Sentencing Commission also shall review and \n     amend its guidelines concerning list I chemicals other than \n     those above, to provide for increased penalties to reflect \n     the dangerous nature of such offenses and the dangers \n     associated with manufacturing methamphetamine.\n\n\n                 Section 3652--Mail Order Requirements\n\n       This section represents changes to the reporting \n     requirements of 21 U.S.C. 830(b)(3) worked out between the \n     DEA and industry. Reporting will no longer be required for \n     valid prescriptions, limited distributions of sample \n     packages, distributions by retail distributors if consistent \n     with authorized activities, distributions to long term care \n     facilities, and any product which has been exempted by the \n     AG. It also allows the AG to revoke an exemption if he finds \n     the drug product being distributed is being used in violation \n     of the Controlled Substances Act.\n\n\n    Section 3653--Theft and Transportation of Anhydrous Ammonia For \n        Purposes of Illicit Production of Controlled Substances\n\n       This section makes it unlawful for a person to steal \n     anhydrous ammonia or to transport stolen anhydrous ammonia \n     across State lines knowing, intending, or having reasonable \n     cause to believe that such anhydrous ammonia will be used to \n     manufacture a controlled substance. Also provides funding to \n     Iowa State University to permit it to continue and expand its \n     current research into the development of inert agents that \n     will eliminate the usefulness of anhydrous ammonia as an \n     ingredient in the production of methamphetamine.\n\n           Subtitle C--Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act of 2000\n\n\n                           Section 3661--3665\n\n       Directs the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the \n     Ecstasy guidelines to provide for increased penalties such \n     that those penalties reflect the seriousness of the offenses \n     of trafficking in and importing Ecstasy and related drugs. \n     Section 3665 authorizes $10 million in grants for prevention \n     efforts concerning Ecstasy and other ``club drugs.''\n\n                       Subtitle D--Miscellaneous\n\n\n    Section 3671--Anti-drug Messages on Federal Government Internet \n                                Websites\n\n       This section requires all federal departments and agencies, \n     in consultation with ONDCP, to place anti-drug messages on \n     their Internet websites and an electronic hyperlink to \n     ONDCP's website. Numerous government agencies have children's \n     websites, including the Social Security Administration.\n\n\n   Section 3672--Reimbursement By Drug Enforcement Administration of \n      Expenses Incurred To Remediate Methamphetamine Laboratories\n\n       Authorizes $20 million to be appropriated in FY 2001 for \n     the DEA to reimburse States, units of local government, \n     Indian tribal governments, and other public entities for \n     expenses incurred to clean-up and safely dispose of \n     substances associated with clandestine methamphetamine \n     laboratories which may present a danger to public health or \n     the environment.\n\n\n                   Section 3673--Severability Section\n\n       Any provision held to be invalid or unenforceable by its \n     terms, or as applied to any person or circumstance, is to be \n     given the maximum effect permitted by law, or if it is held \n     to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be \n     severed from this Act.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues, the chair and \nranking member of the Public Health Subcommittee of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, for all of their efforts in \nbringing the Children's Health Act of 2000 to the Senate floor. This \nomnibus bill is the result of months of bipartisan collaboration and \ndiscussion between Members of both the House and the Senate in an \neffort to address important children's health issues in this Congress.\n  As the co-chair of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I am particularly \npleased that the Pediatric Diabetes Research and Prevention Act, which \nI introduced earlier this year with Senators Breaux, Abraham, Craig, \nand Bunning, has been included in this bill. Our legislation--which was \nalso cosponsored by Senators Grassley,\n\n[[Page S9105]]\n\nBingaman, Chafee, Roth, Hollings, and Schumer--will help us to reduce \nthe tremendous toll that diabetes takes on our nation's children and \nyoung people, and I want to thank my colleagues for including it in the \nomnibus bill.\n  As noted in the recent cover story in Newsweek, diabetes is a \ndevastating, lifelong condition that affects people of every age, race, \nand nationality. Sixteen million Americans suffer from diabetes and \nabout 800,000 new cases are diagnosed each year. It is one of our \nnation's most costly diseases in both human and economic terms. \nDiabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, blindness in adults, \nand amputations not related to injury. It is a major risk factor for \nheart disease and stroke and shortens life expectancy up to 15 years. \nMoreover, diabetes costs our nation more than $105 billion a year in \nhealth-related expenditures. More than one out of every ten health care \ndollars and about one out of four Medicare dollars are spent on people \nwith diabetes.\n  Unfortunately, there currently is no method to prevent or cure \ndiabetes and available treatments have only limited success in \ncontrolling its devastating consequences. The burden of diabetes is \nparticularly heavy for children and young adults with type I, also \nknown as juvenile diabetes. Juvenile diabetes is the second most common \nchronic disease affecting children. Moreover, it is one that they never \noutgrow.\n  As the founder of the Senate Diabetes Caucus, I have met many \nchildren with diabetes who face a daily struggle to keep their blood \nglucose levels under control: kids like nine-year-old Nathan Reynolds, \nan active young boy from North Yarmouth, who was Maine's delegate to \nthe Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's Children's Congress last year. \nNathan was diagnosed with diabetes in December of 1997, which forced \nhim to change both his life and his family's life. He has learned how \nto take his blood--something his four-year-old brother reminds him to \ndo before every meal--check his blood sugar level, and give himself an \ninsulin shot on his own, sometimes with the help of his parents or his \nschool nurse. Nathan told me that his greatest wish was that, just \nonce, he could take a ``day off'' from his diabetes.\n  The sad fact is that children like Nathan with diabetes can never \ntake a day off from their disease. There is no holiday from dealing \nwith their diabetes. They face a lifetime of multiple daily finger \npricks to check their blood sugar levels and daily insulin shots. \nMoreover, insulin is not a cure for diabetes, and it does not prevent \nthe onset of serious complications. As a consequence, children like \nNathan also face the possibility of lifelong disabling complications, \nsuch as kidney failure and blindness.\n  Reducing the health and human burden of diabetes and its enormous \neconomic impact depends upon identifying the factors responsible for \nthe disease and developing new methods for prevention, better \ntreatment, and ultimately a cure. The provisions of the Pediatric \nDiabetes Research and Prevention Act that have been included in the \nChildren's Health Act of 2000 will do just that.\n  One of the most important actions we can take is to establish a type \nI diabetes monitoring system. Currently there is no way to track the \nincidence of type I diabetes across the country. As a consequence, the \nestimates for the number of people with type I diabetes from the \nAmerican Diabetes Association, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institutes \nof Health vary enormously from 123,000 to over 1.5 million, a 13-fold \nvariation. One of the best ways to define the prevalence and incidence \nof a disease, as well as to characterize and study populations, is to \nestablish a national database specific to that disease, which our \nlegislation would do.\n  Obesity and inadequate physical activity--both major problems in the \nUnited States today--are important risk factors for type 2, or non-\ninsulin dependent diabetes. Unfortunately, obesity is a significant and \ngrowing problem among children in the United States, which has led to a \ndisturbing increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes among young \npeople. This is particularly alarming since type 2 diabetes has long \nbeen considered an ``adult'' disease. Nearly all of the documented \ncases of type 2 diabetes in young people have occurred in obese \nchildren, who are also at increased risk for the complications \nassociated with the disease. Moreover, these complications will likely \ndevelop at an earlier age than if these children had developed type 2 \ndiabetes as adults. Our legislation therefore calls for the \nimplemention of a national public health effort to address the \nincreasing incidence of type 2 diabetes in children and young people.\n  In addition, the legislation calls for long-term studies of persons \nwith type 1 diabetes at the National Institutes of Health where these \nindividuals will be followed for 10 years or more. This long-term \nanalysis of type 1 diabetes will provide an invaluable basis for the \ninvestigation and identification of the causes and characteristics of \ndiabetes and its complications and it will also help to identify a \npotential study population for clinical trials. The legislation also \ndirects the Secretary of Health and Human Services to support regional \nclinical research centers for the prevention, detection, treatment and \ncure of type 1 diabetes. And finally, the legislation directs the \nSecretary of HHS to provide for a national program to prevent type 1 \ndiabetes, including efforts to develop a vaccine.\n  Mr. President, these provisions will help us to better understand and \nultimately conquer diabetes, which has had such a devastating impact on \nmillions of American children and their families. It is therefore most \nappropriate that they be included in the Children's Health Act of 2000, \nand I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to add my voice to the chorus of \nsupport for this legislation, which will have a strong positive impact \non the youth of this nation.\n  The first element of this initiative that I would like to highlight \nare the provisions regarding children's public health. This effort will \ngreatly enhance health promotion and disease prevention directed \ntowards youth, improve access to certain health care services for needy \nchildren and bolster resources for pediatric-specific medical research. \nChildren are our most precious resource, and we should do all we can to \nenable our children to reach their full potential both physically and \nintellectually. The Children's Public Health Act takes an important \nstep toward achieving this goal by creating an environment where \nchildren are able to grow and develop unhindered by the burden of \ndisease.\n  Medical science has made incredible strides in reducing and \npreventing devastating childhood diseases that were prevalent only a \ngeneration ago. Yet, despite these advances in our ability to stem the \nspread of deadly infectious diseases, there has been an increase in the \nincidence of chronic and debilitating disorders that afflict children. \nSpecifically, over the past decade, we have seen a rise in the number \nof children suffering from asthma, autism, and other diseases \nattributed to poor diet and lack of physical activity, such as \ndiabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension in young children. This \nlegislation sets forth a balanced, creative approach to these troubling \npediatric conditions by augmenting pediatric clinical research, while \nalso expanding and intensifying screening, education, outreach, \nmonitoring and training efforts led by State and local public health \nagencies and other health care providers.\n  There are two specific initiatives that I am especially proud of in \nthis legislation. The first seeks to address an entirely preventable \nproblem that continues to plague far too many children in this nation--\nlead poisoning. While tremendous strides have been made over the last \n20 years in reducing lead exposure among our citizens, it is estimated \nthat nearly one million preschoolers nationwide still have excessive \nlevels of lead in their blood--making lead poisoning the leading \nchildhood environmental disease.\n  Lead is most harmful to children under age six because lead is easily \nabsorbed into their growing bodies, and interferes with the developing \nbrain and nervous system. The effect of lead poisoning on a child \nranges from mild to severe. Most often in the U.S., children are \npoisoned through chronic, low-level exposure to lead-based paint, which \ncan cause reduced IQ and attention span, hyperactivity, impaired\n\n[[Page S9106]]\n\ngrowth, reading and learning disabilities. Children with high blood \nlead levels can suffer from brain damage, behavior and learning \nproblems, slowed growth, and hearing loss, among other maladies.\n  Timely childhood lead screening and appropriate follow-up care for \nchildren most at-risk of lead exposure is critical to mitigating the \nlong-term health and developmental effects of lead. Regrettably, our \ncurrent system is not adequately protecting children, particularly low-\nincome children, from this hazard. It is estimated that two-thirds of \nat-risk children have never been screened and, consequently, remain \nuntreated.\n  This legislation takes some of the critical steps necessary to begin \nto address this problem. Specifically, the bill strengthens the lead \nprogram at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by providing \nnew resources to conduct extensive outreach and education in \ncoordination with other state programs that serve families with \nchildren at-risk of lead poisoning, such as WIC and Head Start. The \nbill also authorizes the implementation of community-based \ninterventions to mitigate lead hazards and establishes guidelines for \nthe reporting and tracking of blood lead screening tests so that we may \nhave more accurate data on the number of lead-exposed children \nnationwide. The legislation also designates resources for health care \nprovider education and training on current lead screening practices.\n  The second element of this bill that I believe will have a major \nimpact on improving the overall health of children relates to the \nproblem of childhood obesity. Over the past fifteen years, the number \nof overweight children in this country has doubled. It is estimated \nthat an alarming five million youth 6-19 years of age are overweight, \nwhile another six million children are overweight to the point that \ntheir health is endangered.\n  Contributing to this alarming trend has been the rise in fast food \nconsumption, coupled with an increasingly sedentary lifestyle where \ntime engaged in physical activity has been replaced by hours playing \ncomputer games and watching television. The New York Times recently \nnoted that the average child between the ages of 6 and 11 watches 25 \nhours of television a week--and this does not include time spent \nplaying video games or on a computer.\n  Another reason for the lack of physical activity in children is the \nreduction in daily participation in physical education classes. Fewer \nand fewer States require school districts to offer physical education, \ndespite the fact that children who engage in regular physical activity \noften perform better in school. We are raising a generation of inactive \nchildren that will likely become inactive, chronically ill adults. By \nnot ensuring kids take time to participate in regular physical \nactivity, we, as a society, are doing them a great disservice in the \nlong run.\n  Already, we are seeing younger and younger Americans with the signs \nof heart disease and diabetes, among other obesity-linked illnesses. \nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 60 percent \nof overweight 5-10 year old children already have at least one risk \nfactor for heart disease, such as hypertension, while the number of \nchildren diagnosed with Type II diabetes has skyrocketed. If we \ncontinue on this trajectory, obesity-related illnesses will soon rival \nsmoking as a leading cause of preventable death, costing hundreds of \nthousands of American lives and billions of dollars in health care \ncosts and lost productivity. Clearly, action needs to be taken.\n  This legislation acknowledges this trend and attempts to reverse it \nthrough a multi-faceted approach. First, the bill authorizes a new \ncompetitive grant program through the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention to assist states and localities to develop and implement \ncomprehensive school- and community-based approaches to promoting good \nnutrition and physical activity among children. The bill also calls for \ngreater applied research to improve our understanding of the multiple \nfactors that contribute to obesity and eating disorders and emphasizes \nthe need for a nationwide public education campaign to educate families \nabout the importance of good eating habits and regular physical \nactivity. Lastly, the bill provides for health professional education \nand training to aid in the identification and treatment of overweight \nchildren, children suffering from an eating disorder or children at \nrisk of these conditions.\n\n  The other major component of this bill is based on S. 976, the Youth \nDrug and Mental Health Services Act, which originated in the Senate \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and passed the full \nSenate last year. This legislation reauthorizes programs administered \nby the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \n(SAMHSA), and also provides many enhancements that will specifically \nbenefit children and adolescents suffering from substance abuse or \nmental health problems, children who have witnessed violence, and \nchildren from families needing substance abuse or mental health \ntreatment and other support services.\n  I am pleased that this legislation includes a provision that I worked \non to address the severe shortage of transitional services for youth \nwho are leaving the juvenile justice system. Specifically, the bill \naddresses this shortage by authorizing grants to local juvenile justice \nagencies to provide comprehensive community-based services such as \nmental health and substance abuse treatment, job training, vocational \nservices, and mentoring programs to juvenile offenders.\n  Studies have found that the juvenile population has a special need \nfor these types of services, mental health and substance abuse \ntreatment, in particular. It is estimated that the rate of mental \ndisorder is two to three times higher among the juvenile offender \npopulation than among youth in the general population. According to a \n1994 Department of Justice study, 73 percent of the juveniles surveyed \nreported mental health problems, and 57 percent reported past \ntreatment. Also, it is estimated that 60 percent of youth in the \njuvenile justice system have substance abuse disorders, compared to 22 \npercent in the general population.\n  Unfortunately, there currently exists little, if any, support for \nyouth who are leaving the juvenile justice system. Many services, such \nas mental health and substance abuse treatment, provided while the \nyoungster was detained or incarcerated, are discontinued upon their \nrelease. Given this breakdown in the continuity of services, it is \nhardly surprising that of the 4 million youngsters arrested each year, \n30 percent are likely to recidivate within the year of arrest.\n  In the handful of places where transitional services have been \nprovided, the results have been outstanding. For instance, in Rhode \nIsland we have a successful program called ``Project Reach.'' Yale \nUniversity, in its evaluation of Project Reach, found that children \nreceiving transitional services improved dramatically: 80 percent had \nsignificant increases in their grades in school; school attendance \nincreased from 50 to 75 percent; and there was a 60 percent reduction \nin youth encounters with police after enrolling in the program. In \naddition, there was a 50 percent decrease in out-of-home placement for \nthese children. In other words, children who once had problems so \nsevere that they had to be removed from their homes are now able to \nremain with their families in their communities.\n  Adequate transitional and aftercare services to prevent recidivism \nare essential to reducing the societal costs associated with juvenile \ndelinquency, promoting teen health, and fostering safe communities. \nThese provisions recognize the serious gap in services for youth \noffenders and takes important steps to address this serious deficiency. \nI am grateful for the inclusion of this critical language in the bill.\n  As I have noted, there are many positive aspects to this legislation. \nHowever, I have deep reservations about a particular provision that was \nretained in the SAMHSA bill that allows all religious institutions, \nincluding pervasively religious organizations, such as churches and \nother houses of worship, to use taxpayer dollars to advance their \nreligious mission. I oppose this ``charitable choice'' language and \noffered an amendment to modify it when the original legislation was \nconsidered in Committee last year.\n  Although charitable choice has already become law as a part of \nwelfare reform and the Community Services Block Grant, CSBG, section of \nthe Human Services Reauthorization Act,\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\nthe inclusion of charitable choice in this legislation is particularly \ndisturbing since, unlike its application to the intermittent services \nprovided under Welfare Reform and CSBG, SAMHSA funds are used to \nprovide substance abuse treatment which is ongoing, involves direct \ncounseling of beneficiaries and is often clinical in nature. In the \ncontext of these programs it would be difficult if not impossible to \nsegregate religious indoctrination from the social service.\n  Faith-based organizations do have an important and necessary role to \nplay in combating many of our nation's social ills, including youth \nviolence, homelessness, and substance abuse. In fact, I have seen \nfirst-hand the impact that faith-based organizations such as Catholic \nCharities have on delivering certain services to people in need in my \nown state. By enabling faith-based organizations to join in the battle \nagainst substance abuse, we add another powerful tool in our ongoing \nefforts to help people move from dependence to independence.\n  While there are many benefits that come with allowing religious \norganizations to provide social services with federal funds, I am \nconcerned that without proper safeguards, well-intentioned proposals to \nhelp religious organizations aid needy populations, might actually harm \nthe First Amendment's principle of separation of church and state. The \ncharitable choice provision creates a disturbing new avenue for \nemployment discrimination and proselytization in programs funded by \nSAMHSA. Under current law, many religiously-affiliated nonprofit \norganizations already provide government-funded social services without \nemployment discrimination and proselytization. However, the legislation \nextends Title VII's religious exemption to cover the hiring practices \nof organizations participating in SAMHSA programs.\n  As I already mentioned, during markup, I offered an amendment that \nwould have addressed this issue by including important safeguards and \nprotections for beneficiaries and employees of SAMHSA funded programs. \nSpecifically, the amendment would have removed the provision that \nallows religious organizations to require employees hired for SAMHSA \nfunded programs to subscribe to the organization's religious tenets and \nteachings. Since the bill prohibits religious organizations from \nproselytizing in conjunction with the dissemination of social services \nunder SAMHSA programs, it seems contradictory to permit religious \norganizations to require their employees to subscribe to the \norganization's tenets and teachings when it has no bearing on the \nprovision of services. Second, the amendment would have eliminated the \nextension of Title VII's religious exemption to cover the hiring \npractices of organizations participating in SAMHSA funded programs.\n  Ultimately, my proposal would not have reduced the ability of \nreligious groups to hire co-religionists or more actively participate \nin SAMHSA funded programs. It merely would have eliminated the explicit \nability to discriminate in taxpayer-funded employment and left to the \ncourts the decision of whether employees who work on, or are paid \nthrough, government grants or contracts are exempt from the prohibition \non religious employment discrimination.\n  For the last 30 years, federal civil rights laws have expanded \nemployment opportunities and sought to counter discrimination in the \nworkplace. I recognize that we need the assistance of religious \norganizations in the battle against substance abuse. However, \npartnerships with faith-based organizations should augment--not \nreplace--government programs. These partnerships should respect First \nAmendment protections and not allow taxpayer dollars to be used to \nproselytize or to support discrimination. I believe we need a far more \nrobust and informed debate before we allow any expansion of current \nexemptions to Title VII.\n  Nevertheless, this combined legislation has many meaningful \nprovisions that will go a long way towards improving the health and \nwell-being of our children. This legislation not only strengthens \npediatric medical research, it also includes important enhancements in \nmaternal and prenatal health as well as several other health promotion \nand disease prevention initiatives that will greatly enhance the \nquality of life for children. Similarly, the bill contains elements \nthat will greatly improve mental health and substance abuse services \nfor children and adolescents.\n  I am pleased to have worked on this legislation and look forward to \nits expeditious passage this year.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly speak about the \npassage of the children's health bill and the Substance Abuse and \nMental Health Services Administration reauthorization bill.\n  I would like to begin by congratulating Senators Frist and Kennedy \nfor their work on this important piece of legislation and to tell them \nhow pleased I am the package contains a number of provisions from the \nMental Health Early Intervention, Treatment, and Prevention Act of \n2000, S. 2639.\n  Today we do not even question whether mental illness is treatable. \nBut, today we recoil in shock and disbelief at the consequences of \nindividuals not being diagnosed or following their treatment plans. The \nresults are tragedies we would have prevented.\n  Just look at the tragic incidents at the Baptist Church in Dallas/\nFort Worth, the Jewish Day Care Center in Los Angeles, and the United \nStates Capitol to see the common link: a severe mental illness. Or the \nfact that there are 30,000 suicides every year, including 2,000 \nchildren and adolescents.\n  It was not too long ago that our Nation decided we did not want to \nkeep people with a mental illness institutionalized. Simply put, it was \ninhumane to simply lock these individuals up without even using science \nto consider other alternatives.\n  Make no mistake, our Nation still has these same individuals with \nmental illness, we just do not have a very good way to deal with these \nindividuals. Many of these individuals formerly locked up are now our \nneighbors taking the proper medication to manage their illness.\n  However, our Nation simply does not have an understanding of what \nhappens when individuals stop taking their medications because sadly \nmany of these highly publicized incidents of mass violence all too \noften involve an individual with a mental illness.\n  When these incidents occur, my wife and I watch with horror on \ntelevision and we often turn to each other and say that person was a \nschizophrenic or that individual was a manic depressive.\n  Some of you may have seen the recent 4 part series of articles in the \nNew York Times reviewing the cases of 100 rampage killers. Most notably \nthe review found that 48 killers had some kind of formal diagnosis for \na mental illness, often schizophrenia.\n  Twenty-five of the killers had received a diagnosis of mental illness \nbefore committing their crimes. Fourteen of 24 individuals prescribed \npsychiatric drugs had stopped taking their medication prior to \ncommitting their crimes.\n  With this in mind I am especially pleased that with the passage of \nthis package we are taking a very positive step forward to address the \nproblem I have mentioned. The provisions adopted from the Mental Health \nEarly Intervention, Treatment, and Prevention Act of 2000 will serve to \ngive more people the ability to identify when someone might be \nsuffering from mental illness and pose a threat to themselves or \nothers.\n  I think it's important that we begin to find ways to get these people \nhelp before we find them involved in a violent tragedy and I would like \nto briefly touch upon several of those provisions I believe will take \nus a long way towards that goal:\n  A grant program will provide training to teachers and emergency \nservices personnel to identify and respond to individuals with mental \nillness, and to raise awareness about available mental health \nresources. Another grant program creates Emergency Mental Health \nCenters that will serve as a specific site in communities for \nindividuals in need of emergency mental health services, and will also \nprovide mobile crisis intervention teams.\n  The Jail Diversion Demonstration will create 125 programs to divert \nindividuals with mental illness from the criminal justice system to \ncommunity-based services. And finally, the Mental Illness Treatment \nGrant will provide integrated treatment for individuals with a serious \nmental illness and a co-\n\n[[Page S9108]]\n\noccurring substance abuse disorder with an emphasis placed on \nindividuals with a history of involvement with law enforcement or a \nhistory of unsuccessful treatment.\n  In closing, I really believe we have a historic opportunity to become \npreventers of serious, serious acts of violence before they happen and \nI look forward to working with my colleagues in the future to continue \naddressing this important issue.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the passage \nof the Children's Health Act of 2000, an extraordinary bipartisan bill \nthat includes so many outstanding provisions to improve the health and \nmental health of the children of our country. The bill includes the \nreauthorization of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, a long-overdue reauthorization and revitalization of an \nagency that provides most of the public funding of mental health and \naddiction services to our communities. SAMHSA has many dedicated staff \nwho have worked so hard to develop and manage remarkable programs over \nthe last several years. I am proud to have played a role in the \ndevelopment of this comprehensive bill, and to join my colleagues in \nencouraging its quick passage into law.\n  The Children's Health Act of 2000 takes a major step forward in \nsupporting research, services, treatment, and professional training to \nbegin to address some of the most significant health problems affecting \nchildren of all ages. This legislation clearly states that children's \nhealth, including their mental health and addiction treatment needs, \nmust be a priority for our country. It is not enough to deal with our \nchildren's health needs only after they have become crises. Many of the \nprograms outlined in this bill recognize this problem by focusing on \nprevention and education programs, and by supporting programs to train \nresearchers and health care providers who specialize in children's \nhealth.\n  Many of the health areas included in this comprehensive bill were \nidentified by the Department of Health and Human Services as among the \ntop 10 leading health indicators for children in its major public \nhealth initiative ``Healthy People 2010,'' launched in January 2000. \nSeveral were of particular importance to me as I worked on this bill, \nespecially programs supporting treatment of mental illness and \naddiction; increased access to health care, especially for our mentally \nill youth in correctional facilities; and overall improvements in \nfitness and oral health for all our children, including low-income \nchildren and children living in rural areas.\n  Dr. David Satcher, the United States Surgeon General, has released \nseveral groundbreaking reports in recent years which highlight the \nscope and the specific health needs of our children. These reports \nincluded ``Mental Health: A Report of the Surgeon General''; ``The \nSurgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent Suicide''; and the first \never ``Oral Health In America: A Report of the Surgeon General,'' which \neach begins to address these severe health crises in these areas for so \nmany of our children. The problems identified by Dr. Satcher touch on \nboth the national problems across our country, and also highlight the \nsignificant health care disparities for different groups. I am pleased \nto have contributed to many new legislative and funding efforts to \nsupport improvements in these areas of health care.\n  In the Surgeon General's 2000 report on oral health, the strong link \nbetween oral health and overall health was highlighted, and this bill \nhelps to address the problems identified in the report. Dr. Satcher \nemphasized the devastating consequences of untreated oral disease and \nhow it can affect children's health and well-being, leading to serious \npain and suffering, time lost from school, loss of permanent teeth, \ndamage to self-esteem, and co-existing medical conditions. So much of \nwhat we need to do is already known. We need to identify the unmet need \nand improve access to care for those who need it most. This bill \nincludes funding for school-based and other innovative oral health care \nprograms to improve the overall health of our children. The oral health \nprograms included in this bill are an important step forward.\n  Healthy People 2010 goals also identified obesity as a major problem \nfor children, particularly because of the decline in physical activity \namong our children. One-fourth of our children aged 6-17 are \noverweight, and the percentage of children who are seriously overweight \nhas doubled in the last thirty years. This is not a minor issue for the \nhealth of our children: obesity as a chronic illness is related to \nother serious chronic conditions in children, including type II \ndiabetes, hypertension, and asthma. Research has also shown that 60% of \noverweight children 5-10 years old already have at least one risk \nfactor for heart disease. Adult obesity is associated with many of the \nleading causes of death and disability, including heart disease, \ndiabetes, arthritis, and cancer. The public health efforts in this bill \nthat focus on this serious national problem, including improvements in \nphysical education funding, public health education, and nutrition \neducation, are ones I enthusiastically support. In the future we must \ndo even more to again make physical education a high priority for our \ncountry and establish a national foundation to promote physical \nactivity for all ages.\n  I am particularly proud of the section of this bill that supports \nlocal suicide prevention programs focusing on our young people. Youth \nsuicide must be recognized for the national crisis that it is. In my \nown state of Minnesota, suicide is the second leading cause of death \namong our youth, as it is in half of the states in our country. \nOverall, in the United States, it is the third leading cause of death \namong our children, taking more lives than homicide. We know from the \noutstanding research supported by the National Institute of Mental \nHealth that 90% of all completed suicides are linked to untreated or \ninadequately treated mental illness or addiction. More than 500,000 \nAmericans attempt to take their own lives every year. In this bill, $75 \nmillion will be authorized to support local prevention programs \nfocusing on our children who are at risk of taking their own lives. \nMore than 50 groups supported our efforts to improve funding for \nsuicide prevention programs this year, including local programs, like \nthe Minnesota group, Suicide Awareness/Voices of Education (SA/VE), as \nwell as national groups, such as Suicide Prevention and Advocation \nNetwork (SPAN), the National Hope Line Network, and the National Mental \nHealth Association.\n  We can no longer afford to turn our eyes away from the horrible \nreality that many of our citizens, even our children, may want to die. \nWe continue to treat mental illness and severe drug addiction as \nsomehow less important than other illnesses. We blame the sick for \ntheir disease, and the result can be death and tragedy. Today, we begin \nto acknowledge that this kind of discrimination is against many of our \nown children.\n  I am also pleased to have worked to include an additional $4 million \nto support resource centers for those who work with our mentally ill \nyouth in correctional facilities. Our children need help in many areas: \neducation, child care, juvenile justice, and health care. Many are \nexperiencing severe drug addiction, mental illness, and lack of access \nto health care coverage. The Director of the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy (ONDCP) has recognized that the number one priority for \nthe nation's National Drug Control Strategy is to educate and enable \nAmerica's youth to reject illegal drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco. \nAnd yet 80 percent of adolescents needing treatment are unable to \naccess services because of the severe lack of coverage for addiction \ntreatment or the unavailability of treatment programs or trained health \ncare providers in their community. Many of these children end up in the \njuvenile justice system as a result.\n  The reauthorization of SAMHSA within this bill, with its state block \ngrant funding for mental health and addiction treatment, is a good \nbeginning. But so much more must be done to stop treating our children \nas second class citizens, and to stop treating mental illness and \naddiction as second class illnesses. We must continue to fight for \nfairness and parity in health care coverage for our children, indeed \nfor all of our citizens, who suffer from mental illness and addiction. \nIt is their future, and ours, as a country, that is at stake.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Children's\n\n[[Page S9109]]\n\nHealth Act of 2000 that will pass the Senate today. This legislation is \nthe result of months of dedicated work by a number of Senators and \nHouse members. I believe the final language represents a comprehensive \napproach to promote physical and mental health for children, and \nprotect them from dangerous, illegal drugs. I am a co-sponsor of the \nSenate version of this bill, a previous Senate version of the \nChildren's Health Act (S. 2868), as well as the author of two key \nprovisions contained in the package we are considering today.\n  I rise today to speak in favor of this legislation and to thank the \nbill's sponsor, Senator Frist, for working with me to include two \nprovisions that I believe are essential tools for advancing health and \nsafety of America's children. The bill that will pass today, H.R. 4365, \ncontains three main sections: (1) the text of S. 486, the \nMethamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act, a bill I introduced last year \nthat previously passed the Senate and has been approved by the House \nJudiciary Committee for consideration by the House of Representatives; \n(2) the Youth Drug and Mental Health Services Act, which reauthorizes \nprograms within the jurisdiction of the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration (SAMHSA) to improve mental health and \nsubstance abuse services for children and adolescents and allows the \nCharitable Choice concept, which I first authored in the 104th \nCongress, to be applied to the programs covered by this Act and (3) the \nChildren's Health Act, which amends the Public Health Services Act to \nrevise, extend, and establish programs with respect to children's \nhealth research, health promotion and disease prevention activities \nconducted through Federal public health agencies.\n  Mr. President, let me touch briefly on each of these three main \nsections.\n  First, this bill includes the text of S. 486, the Methamphetamine \nAnti-Proliferation Act, a bill I introduced in February 25, 1999 in \nresponse to the growing problem of methamphetamine production and use \nin my home state of Missouri, throughout the Midwest and in many other \nstates as well. Unfortunately, the problem of methamphetamine has only \ngotten worse in the past year and a half. This anti-meth measure I \nauthored will help fight meth in Missouri and the U.S. with $55 million \nin new resources for enforcement, cleanup, school- and community-based \nprevention efforts, and rehabilitation services.\n  The Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act will bolster the fight \nagainst meth through stiffer penalties for drug criminals; more money \nfor law enforcement, education, and prevention; and a wider ban on meth \nparaphernalia. The bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to raise \nits guidelines for sentencing meth offenders. It requires mandatory \nreimbursement for the costs incurred by federal, state and local \ngovernments for the cleanup associated with meth labs. It authorizes \n$5.5 million in funding for DEA programs to train State and local law \nenforcement in techniques used in meth investigations and staff mobile \ntraining teams which provide State and local law enforcement with \nadvanced training in conducting lab investigations. It also provides \n$15 million in funding to combat the trafficking of meth in counties \ndesignated High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas.\n  This legislation also provides for further research into the use of \nmeth; authorizes $15 million in funds for community- and school-based \nanti-meth education programs; and includes an additional $10 million in \nresources for treatment of meth addiction. It directs HHS to include \nits annual National Household Survey on Drug Abuse prevalence data on \nthe consumption of methamphetamine and other illicit drugs in rural, \nmetropolitan, and consolidated metropolitan areas and requires the \nSecretary of HHS, in consultation with the Institute of Medicine, to \nconduct a study on the development of medications for the treatment of \naddiction to methamphetamine.\n  The nation's lead anti-drug agency, the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration (DEA), has thrown its support behind the Methamphetamine \nAnti-Proliferation Act. In endorsing this bill, DEA Administrator \nDonnie Marshall said this bill is ``landmark methamphetamine \nlegislation.'' Marshall stated: ``I believe this bill (the \nMethamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act) will prove instrumental in the \nDrug Enforcement Administration's efforts to bring to a halt the \ncontinued spread of methamphetamine across our country.''\n  Mr. President, I am sad that Missouri is notorious as a national \ncenter of meth production and distribution. Methamphetamine, for those \nwho are lucky enough not to have a meth problem in their areas, is a \nhighly addictive synthetic drug that is typically made in illegal \nclandestine ``labs.'' Missouri and California lead the nation in \nseizures of such labs. In Missouri, the federal Drug Enforcement \nAdministration and state and local law enforcement officers seized only \ntwo such labs in 1992, 14 in 1994, and a record 679 in 1998. This \nnumber jumped to 920 in 1999, setting a new record.\n  The second section of this bill is the Youth Drug and Mental Health \nServices Act, which reauthorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration (SAMHSA). This section addresses the issue of \ndrug abuse in our nation's youth which has dramatically increased this \ndecade. It creates new programs to provide additional funding for \nyouth-targeted treatment and early intervention services. Under this \nbill, states will receive more flexibility in the use of block grant \nfunds and the Secretary of Health and Human Services will have more \nflexibility to respond to the needs of young people who need mental \nhealth and substance abuse services.\n  I am especially pleased that included in the Youth Drug and Mental \nHealth Services Act is an expansion of the Charitable Choice provision, \nwhich will allow federally-funded substance abuse services to be open \nto faith-based providers. Under Charitable Choice, which was first \nenacted into law in 1996 as part of the welfare reform law, churches \nand other faith-based providers are able to compete on an equal footing \nwith other non-governmental organizations in providing services to \ndisadvantaged Americans.\n  Since its enactment, Charitable Choice has been expanded from job \ntraining and related services for welfare clients to include the \nCommunity Services Block Grant program, which is used for a variety of \nanti-poverty activities, such as improving job and educational \nopportunities and providing financial management and emergency \nassistance. This latest expansion will apply Charitable Choice to \nfederal drug treatment programs that will total $1.6 billion for Fiscal \nYear 2000. My home state of Missouri is slated to receive $24.46 \nmillion in substance abuse block grant funding for the coming fiscal \nyear.\n  Charitable Choice calls our nation to its highest and best in our \neffort to help those in need. It meets the tests of compassion and \ncommon sense that count for so much in Missouri. When people of faith \nextend compassionate help to those in need, the results can be \nstunningly successful. Where too many traditional substance abuse \ntreatment programs have failed to help those in need, faith-based \nprograms have succeeded. For example, Teen Challenge has show that 86% \nof its graduates remain drug-free. San Antonio's Victory Fellowship \nboasts of a success rate of over 80%. This is the test of common sense: \nAmerica needs to create a vibrant partnership that succeeds where other \napproaches have failed.\n  Mr. President, the bipartisan support for Charitable Choice is \noverwhelming in Congress. In additional, both Presidential candidates--\nGovernor Bush and Vice President Gore--strongly support the program. It \nis my hope that this broad national consensus will continue to grow and \nthat soon will be able to enact a comprehensive expansion of Charitable \nChoice to all federally-funded social services programs.\n  Third, the Children's Public Health Act has four overriding themes \nrepresented in its four titles: Injury Prevention, Maternal and Infant \nHealth, Pediatric Health Promotion, and Pediatric Research. This \nlegislation focuses federal research efforts in these areas and \nprovides a comprehensive approach to children's health. For example, \nthe bill includes authorization for research to prevent traumatic brain \ninjuries, provides federal grants for comprehensive asthma services to \nchildren, and establishes a National Center for Birth\n\n[[Page S9110]]\n\nDefects and Development Disabilities within the CDC. The bill also \nincludes childhood obesity prevention programs, childhood lead \nprevention programs, and a groundbreaking pediatric research initiative \nwithin NIH to ensure the realization of expanding opportunities for \nadvancement in scientific investigations and care for children. This \nlegislation also includes support for pediatric graduate medical \neducation in children's hospitals, an issue that has been a high \npriority of mine for years.\n  I am hopeful, that with passage of this landmark legislation, we can \nimprove the lives of America's children. By funding research for many \nchildhood diseases and disabilities, expanding programs to assist youth \nwith addiction and mental health problems through faith-based \nproviders, and drastically increasing the war against meth, this bill \nis an important step in the right direction. I thank all those who \nworked on this legislation, and urge the President to sign this bill to \nhelp secure a safer and healthier future for the next generation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask consent that the amendment that is \noffered in the nature of a substitute be agreed to, the bill be read \nthe third time and passed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid \non the table, and that any statements related to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4181) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 4365), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak on an issue of great \nimportance to America's families--the health of our nation's children--\nand to talk about crucial legislation which the Senate has passed today \ncalled the Children's Health Act of 2000.\n  Whenever we talk about children's health, we should not ignore the \nfact that there is a lot of good news. The fact is that most children \nare persistently healthy. A majority of children can actually go \nthrough a year with no more serious health problems than scrapes and \nbruises, a stuffy nose, or an easily-treatable earache. I'm not sure \nhow many of us can say that--I know I can't. And on a variety of \nindicators that measure children's health, the good news is only \ngetting better. In the last decade, we have seen improvements in \nimmunization rates, infant mortality, child mortality, and reduced teen \nbirth rates.\n  There are of course exceptions to these healthy kids. Thousands of \nchildren are born every year with a birth defect. Too many children \nsuffer moderate to serious accidents of all types. And an unfortunate \nminority face other serious or long-term health problems. Worse, \nchildren who are sick are often very sick. These exceptions to the rule \nare all the more tragic because our expectation is that our children \nwill be healthy.\n  That is why the Children's Health Act, which the Senate has passed \ntoday, is so important. As sound as our children's overall health is, \nit can be better. As well as our nation is doing to protect our \nchildren's health, we can do more.\n  Mr. President, the Children's Health Act covers many specific health \nproblems that afflict children--autism, arthritis, asthma, brain \ninjuries, lead poisoning, and so on. Each of the legislative provisions \nthat addresses these problems deserves attention, and I hope that the \nmerits of each of these sections can be presented. Right now, I would \nlike to focus on the sections of the Children's Health Act that I have \nstrongly supported. Most of these provisions were included in \nlegislation--called Healthy Kids 2000--which I introduced last year.\n  As both a Governor and a Senator, one of my main priorities in health \ncare has been to try to find new ways to prevent birth defects. Because \nwe expect our children and our babies to be healthy, birth defects can \nbe truly devastating to a family. Yet they happen far too frequently--\n150,000 children are born every year with some type of birth defect.\n  Today alone, about 6 or 7 families in this country will have a child \nwith one very serious type of birth defect, called a neural tube \ndefect. Spina bifida is the most well known of these defects of the \nbrain and spine. The complications that result from this type of birth \ndefect range from serious, long-term health problems to death, but the \nreal tragedy is that many of these birth defects could have been \nprevented.\n  One simple step--women of childbearing age taking 400 micrograms of \nfolic acid every day--can help women and families significantly reduce \nthe chance of this type of birth defect by up to 70 percent. Yet most \nwomen just don't know about folic acid. Simply making them aware of the \nimportance of folic acid is such an easy and inexpensive way to prevent \nbirth defects, it is simply silly not to do everything we can to make \nsure every woman in this country knows about the benefits of folic \nacid.\n  One provision of the Children's Health Act was taken from the Folic \nAcid Promotion Act, which I have introduced with Senator Abraham. This \nsection authorizes expanded effort by the Centers for Disease Control \nto get more women of childbearing age to use folic acid. The CDC has \nbegun activity in this area, but the continued depth of the problem \ndemonstrates that much more can be done.\n  Another easy thing we can do to bring greater focus and attention to \nthe problem of birth defects is to simply reorganize how and where the \nwork on birth defects is done within the Centers for Disease Control. \nRight now, the CDC's work on birth defects is done within one of its \nmain branches, the National Center for Environmental Health, whose \nresponsibilities expand significantly beyond birth defects.\n  I believe the seriousness of this problem--over 400 infants are born \nevery day with some type of birth defect--and the significant amount of \nCDC funding spent on birth defects justify a Center within the Centers \nfor Disease Control focused exclusively on this issue. The Children's \nHealth Act calls for a fourth Center within the CDC--the National \nCenter for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities--which will \nallow for consolidation, greater visibility and expansion of CDC's \nefforts to prevent birth defects. This builds on the comprehensive \nprevention program outlined in the Birth Defects Prevention Act, which \nI sponsored and Congress passed in 1998.\n  One area of children's health that has been getting worse over the \nlast decade is the percentage of babies born with a low birth weight. \nLow birth-weight babies have a much higher chance of developmental and \nother problems as they grow up. One reason for this declining trend is \nthe persistent levels of cigarette, alcohol, and drug use during \npregnancy. Somewhere between 19 and 27 percent of pregnant women in the \nU.S. smoke during pregnancy, despite the fact that these smokers are at \na significantly higher risk for stillbirth, premature births, low \nbirth-weight, and birth defects.\n  The Children's Health Act contains another provision from my Healthy \nKids 2000 legislation which establishes a grant program run by CDC to \nestablish community-based programs designed to reduce and prevent \nprenatal smoking, alcohol, and drug use. We can work with women to help \nthem understand the consequences of using these types of substances \non their babies and to help them change their behavior so they can have \nhealthier infants.\n\n  The health of a mother during her pregnancy obviously has a \ntremendous health impact on her child. Yet we as a nation still have a \nsurprisingly large amount of serious complications that occur during \npregnancy even before labor. 1,000 women actually die every year during \npregnancy, and this figure has been increasing in the 1990s. A full 20 \npercent of women have serious health problems even before they go into \nlabor.\n  But despite these problems, our public health system does not have a \ncomprehensive system in place to monitor, research, and try to prevent \nthese maternal deaths and complications. Only 15 states have a program \nof their own that does this. Well, if we can't look at a problem and \nstudy it, we certainly can't hope to understand the problem, much less \nto solve it. I believe the CDC needs to do further work with states to \nunderstand exactly why so many women are having pregnancy-related \nproblems and to figure out what we can do about it. The Children's \nHealth Act authorizes CDC to expand their efforts so we can prevent \nthese problems and help women have healthy pregnancies so they can have \nhealthy kids.\n  Finally, I have been a strong supporter of Senator DeWine's Pediatric\n\n[[Page S9111]]\n\nResearch Initiative within the National Institutes of Health. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor of his bill, and I included the Pediatric \nResearch Initiative in my Healthy Kids 2000 legislation. I am happy to \nreport that the Pediatric Research Initiative has been included in the \nChildren's Health Act.\n  I believe we need to encourage the NIH to focus more on children's \nhealth care research. In recent years, NIH has seen significant \nincreases in the funding needed to support the critical research they \ndo. This crucial work helps us better understand how various diseases \nwork, what we can do to prevent them, and how to cure those who are \nafflicted. I am concerned, however, that pediatric research at NIH has \nnot shared fully in this research expansion.\n  The Pediatric Research Initiative provides the NIH with additional \nfunds that are specifically dedicated to pediatric research. This \nfunding can be used by the NIH Director for research that shows the \nmost promise to address successfully childhood health concerns. The \nPediatric Research Initiative would not earmark funds to any specific \ninstitute or to any specific disease. This commonsense legislation \nsimply provides extra funding to the Office of the Director with \nmaximum flexibility to invest that money in any area of pediatric \nresearch in any of the NIH Institutes. I believe this is a reasonable, \nand not a very restrictive, response to concerns that the NIH \nshortchanges pediatric research.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend and thank Senators Frist, \nKennedy, and all of the other distinguished Senators who have worked to \nput this crucial bill together. I have been pleased to work with them \nto ensure that this bill addresses some of the most pressing health \ncare concerns our nation's children face. I hope and expect that the \nHouse of Representatives will follow-up quickly on Senate action so we \ncan send this bill to the President.\n  Last year, I introduced the Healthy Kids 2000 Act based on a simple \nidea--we want children to be healthy, and we want pregnant women to be \nhealthy. Passage today of the Children's Health Act promises to bring \nus closer to this simple but critically important goal.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, according to the experts, the number of \nheroin users is on the rise while the average age of first heroin use \nis dropping. Heroin addiction is a public health crisis of significant \nproportion. This legislation, the Hatch-Levin Drug Addiction Act, S. \n324, will allow us to effectively utilize a new medical discovery of a \nsubstance called Buprenorphine, which has proven to be an \nextraordinarily effective means for combating heroin addiction by \nblocking the craving for heroin.\n  But this anti-addiction medication can help us win the war against \nheroin and heroin addiction only if we change our laws so that the \nmedication can be dispensed in physician's offices instead of a \ncentralized clinic. That is what this legislation accomplishes.\n  It is estimated that there are approximately one million heroin \naddicts in the U.S. According to the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services, many of these heroin addicts want to kick their habit, \nbut do not wish to receive treatment in methadone clinics ``. . . \nbecause of the stigma of being in methadone treatment or their concerns \nabout the medical effects of methadone.''\n  The Drug Addiction Treatment Act has now passed the House of \nRepresentatives in slightly different form than we passed in the Senate \non November 19. Its adoption again by the Senate as Title XXXV, Section \n3501 and Section 3502 of the substitute amendment to H.R. 4365, the \nChildren Health Act of 2000, paves the way for physician office-based \ndispensing of a medication which has been the subject of extensive \nsuccessful research and clinical trials in the U.S. and France. This \nmedication, Buprenorphine, was developed under a Cooperative Research \nand Development Agreement between the National Institute on Drug Abuse \nand a private pharmaceutical manufacturer, and is expected to receive \nFDA approval in the weeks ahead. Buprenorphine has already been in use, \nin physician offices, for a number of years in France, where \nsignificant success has been achieved in getting individuals off of \nheroin, reducing crime and heroin-related deaths. For example, since \nthe introduction of Buprenorphine in France, there has been an 80 \npercent decline in deaths by heroin overdose--from 505 in 1994 to 92 in \n1998; user crime and arrests are down by 57 percent--from 17,356 in \n1995 to 7,649 in 1998; and trafficking arrests have declined by 40 \npercent--from 3,329 in 1995 to 1,979 in 1997.\n  Over a year ago, I introduced the Drug Addiction Treatment Act, S. \n324, along with Senator Hatch, Senator Moynihan and Senator Biden, in \norder to put in place the necessary mechanisms to accommodate this \nrevolutionary new treatment that can block the craving for heroin and \ndramatically restore the quality of the lives of individuals and \nfamilies who have struggled to get out from under heroin addiction.\n  There are a number of reasons why our legislation is necessary. Under \ncurrent law, the Narcotic Addict Treatment Act of 1974, the process by \nwhich individual physicians must be approved in order to prescribe \nnarcotics in drug treatment is a cumbersome and complex regulatory \nprocess. Federal regulations and State regulations, which could, under \nexisting law, be written to allow Buprenorphine to be utilized in \nphysician offices will take an extensive period of time to be written \nand take many years to be implemented. Indeed, there is no assurance \nthat such regulations will ever be written by both federal and state \ngovernments. In the meantime, a very effective medication is \nunavailable to those who are addicted to Heroin.\n  The Hatch-Levin legislation would allow for the utilization of \nBuprenorphine by qualified physicians in a physician's office. It will \nalso assure that Buprenorphine will be made available in every state \nunless a state expressly opts out of the program through legislation.\n  The current federal regulatory process needed to be utilized before \ntreatment of addiction in an office-based setting is allowed include: \n(1) Writing the regulations, which could take up to a year or more; (2) \nIssuance of the proposed rule which would be published in the Federal \nRegister, including the announcement of a period of time for public \ncomment on the proposed rule; (3) A review of the public comments, \nwhich could take a year or more; (4) The issuance of the final rule, \n(5) Then each State is required to affirmatively approve and implement \nthe physician office approach which typically takes 2-4 years, in those \nstates that do act.\n  Based on the experience with the introduction of LAAM for the \ntreatment of heroin addiction--a medication similar to methadone which \nis effective for up to three days, as opposed to the daily dosage \nrequired by methadone--most states may never approve the physician \noffice approach and for those that do the process could go on for as \nmany as 4-5 years. That was the case with California and New York. \nAccording to findings reported by the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services on July 14, 1999: ``Current federal and state \nregulations prevent ease of entry into methadone or LAMM maintenance \ntreatment. . . .''\n  So, while it is possible under current law for regulations to be \nwritten by HHS allowing for the use of Buprenorphine in the treatment \nof heroin addiction and to allow for it to be prescribed in physician \noffices,\n  (1) there is no certainty that they will be written;\n  (2) if such regulations are written, it would take years for them to \ntake effect; and\n  (3) each state must explicitly opt into the program by writing \nregulations or adopting a law.\n  In each state not opting in, the treatment in a physician office \nwould not be available as described\n  The result of the above cumbersome and complex process has been a \ntreatment system consisting primarily of large methadone clinics, \npreventing physicians from treating patients in convenient office-based \nsettings, thereby making treatment unavailable as a practical matter to \nmany in need of it. Also, experts say that many heroin addicts who want \ntreatment are often deterred because, in addition to the stigma that is \nassociated with large centralized methadone clinics, they must travel \nlong distances daily to receive such treatment and cannot maintain a \njob while doing so. Even though Buprenorphine does not possess the \naddictive qualities of methadone, because of the constraints in current \nlaw, it\n\n[[Page S9112]]\n\nwould nonetheless have to be dispensed in this same manner--in \ncentralized clinics--rather than in the private office of a qualified \nphysician.\n  The Drug Addiction Treatment Act, S. 324 (H.R. 2634), will make it \npossible for medications like Buprenorphine, which have little or no \nlikelihood of diversion or abuse, to be made available in the offices \nof physicians who have the training and certification and license to \ntreat persons addicted to opiates. It is anticipated that the initial \ngroup of eligible physicians to dispense Buprenorphine will come from \nthe 10,000 practitioners with addiction treatment certification from \nthe American Society of Addiction Medicine, or board certification in \naddiction psychiatry or medical toxicology from the American Board of \nMedical Specialties or certification in addiction medicine from the \nAmerican Osteopathic Association. The protections in the legislation \nagainst abuse are as follows: Physicians may not treat more than 30 \npatients in an office setting; appropriate counseling and other \nancillary services are a requirement under this legislation; the \nAttorney General may terminate a physician's DEA registration if these \nconditions are violated; and the program may be discontinued altogether \nif the Secretary of HHS and Attorney General determine that this new \ntype of decentralized treatment has not proven to be an effective form \nof treatment. Finally, states may opt out of the provision.\n\n  Recent findings of the Monitoring the Future Program, headed by Dr. \nLloyd Johnson of the University of Michigan, indicates that heroin use \namong American teens doubled between 1991 and 1998, and represents a \nclear danger for a significant number of American young people. Dr. \nJohnson attributes this sharp increase to non-injectable use--smoking \nand snorting, and notes that the very high purity and low cost of \nheroin on the street has made these new developments possible; and \nthat, unfortunately, a number of those users will switch over to \ninjection.\n  The Drug Enforcement Administration reports that the price of heroin \nhas steadily declined since 1980, though it is more potent. In 1980, \nheroin cost $3.90 per milligram and was 3.6 percent pure heroin. Today, \nheroin costs about $1 per milligram, yet it is 10 times more pure. This \npurer, cheaper heroin is available everywhere--in our inner cities, in \nour suburbs and in our small towns. For instance, according to the \nNational Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, over 32 percent of \npersons living in small towns, age of 12 and over, have easy access to \nheroin.\n  The need for this change in our law to make available more broadly an \neffective heroin blocker was expressed by experts at a May 9, 1997 Drug \nForum on Anti-addiction Research, which I convened along with Senator \nMoynihan and Senator Bob Kerrey. Forum participants, including \ndistinguished experts such as Dr. Herbert Kleber and Dr. Donald Landry \nof Columbia University, Dr. Charles Schuster of Wayne State University \nand Dr. James H.Wood of the University of Michigan told us that this \ndramatic new anti-addiction medication is coming in the nick of time. \nThe untreated population of opiate addicts, and other injection drug \nusers, is the primary means for the spread of HIV, hepatitis B and C, \nand tuberculosis into the general population, not to mention the \nfamilies of such addicted persons. Failure to block the craving for \nillicit drugs along with failure to provide traditional treatment will \nmost certainly contribute to the crime related to addiction and \ncontinue the spiral of huge health care costs--costs that will largely \nbe borne not by the addicts, not by insurance companies--but by the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  The President of the Michigan Public Health Association, Dr. \nStephanie Meyers Schim, has spoken out eloquently about the ``great \nproblems'' of substance abuse. In her letter to me in support of our \nbill she says: ``Substance abuse affects health care costs, mortality, \nworkers' compensation claims, reduced productivity, crime, suicide, \ndomestic violence, child abuse, and increased costs associated with \nextra law enforcement, motor vehicle crashes, crime, and lost \nproductivity.'' Dr. Schim goes on to say, ``Buprenorphine will allow \ndrug addicted individuals to maximize everyday life activities, and \nparticipate more fully in work day and family activities while seeking \nthe needed treatment and counseling to become drug free''.\n  Dr. James H. Wood, Professor of Pharmacology at the University of \nMichigan Medical School recently wrote: ``One of the most important \naspects of your bill is the use of Buprenorphine by well-trained \nphysicians to treat narcotic addiction from their offices, which has \nthe potential to attract and treat effectively sizable populations of \ncurrently untreated addicts. A major byproduct of this increased \ntreatment, of course, will be reduction in the demand for illicit \nnarcotics in the U.S.''\n  Dr. Thomas Kosten, President of the American Academy of Addiction \nPsychiatry echoed these sentiments in recent testimony on The Drug \nAddiction Treatment Act before the House Commerce Committee on Health \nand Environment, and I quote: ``. . . I would like to support the \navailability of Buprenorphine for office based practice. Addiction is a \nbrain disease and office-based practice is primarily needed for \neffective treatment of Buprenorphine.''\n  The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), and the College on \nProblems of Drug Dependence which is the nation's longest standing \norganization of scientists addressing drug dependence and drug abuse, \nhave stated that the availability of Buprenorphine in physicians' \noffices adds a needed expansion of current treatment for heroin \naddiction. ASAM also cautioned that Buprenorphine will lose much of its \nutility if it is tied to the very heavily regulated structure for \ncurrent treatments of heroin addiction.\n\n  There are other compelling reasons why we must expedite the delivery \nof anti-addiction medications. Of the juveniles who land behind bars in \nstate institutions, more than 60 percent of them reported using drugs \nonce a week or more, and over 40 percent reported being under the \ninfluence of drugs while committing crimes, according to a report from \nthe Bureau of Justice Statistics. Drug-related incarcerations are up \nand we are building more jails and prisons to accommodate them--more \nthan 1000 have been built over the past 20 years. According to the July \n14, 1999 Office of National Drug Control Policy Update, ``Drug-related \narrests are up from 1.1 million arrests in 1988 to 1.6 million arrests \nin 1997--steady increases every year since 1991''.\n  In crafting the provisions of this legislation, we consulted with the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services, including the Federal \nDrug Administration, and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Of \ncritical importance is the fact that Buprenorphine is not addictive \nlike methadone so the likelihood of diversion is small. Nothing in our \nbill is intended to change the rules pertaining to methadone clinics or \nother facilities or practitioners that conduct drug treatment services \nwith addictive substances. I received a very supportive letter from HHS \nSecretary Donna Shalala in which she reports on the safety and utility \nof Buprenorphine, as follows:\n\n       I am especially encouraged by the results of published \n     clinical studies of Buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a partial \n     mu opiate receptor agonist, in Schedule V of the Controlled \n     Substances Act, with unique properties which differentiate it \n     from full agonists such as methadone or LAAM. The \n     pharmacology of the combination tablet consisting of \n     Buprenorphine and naloxone results in. . . .low value and low \n     desirability for diversion on the street.\n       Published clinical studies suggest that it has very limited \n     euphorigenic affects, and has the ability to percipitate \n     withdrawal in individuals who are highly dependent upon other \n     opioids. Thus, Buprenorphine and Buprenorphine/naloxone \n     products are expected to have low diversion potential. \n     Buprenorphine and Buprenorphine/naloxone products are \n     expected to reach new groups of opiate addicts--for example, \n     those who do not have access to methadone programs, those who \n     are reluctant to enter methadone treatment programs, and \n     those who are unsuited to them {this would include for \n     example, those in their first year of opiates addiction or \n     those addicted to lower doses of opiates .\n       Buprenorphine and Buprenorphine/naloxone products should \n     increase the amount of treatment capacity available and \n     expand the range of treatment options that can be used by \n     physicians. Buprenorphine and Buprenorphine/Naloxone would \n     not replace methadone. Methadone and LAAM clinics would \n     remain an important part of the treatment continuum.\n\n\n[[Page S9113]]\n\n\n  In closing, I would like to include excerpts from the statement which \nwas presented by Dr. Charles O'Brien before the Senate Caucus on \nInternational Narcotics Control, May 9, 2000. Dr. O'Brien is Professor \nand Vice Chair of Psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, \nDirector of the Behavioral Health, Philadelphia VA Medical Center, \nCenter for Studies of Addiction, Upenn/VAMC, and Research Director, \nPhiladelphia VA. Mental Illness Research, Education and Clinical \nCenter. Dr. O'Brien's remarks are as follows:\n\n       While our first goal in the treatment of heroin addiction \n     is complete abstinence, we know that this is not realistic \n     for a great majority of patients. Even those who do well \n     initially in a drug free residential program have a high \n     frequency of relapse when they return to the neighborhood \n     where drugs are available.\n       Another new medication that is being successfully used in \n     France and is currently being reviewed by the FDA for use in \n     the U.S. is buprenorphine. Its chemical category is somewhat \n     different from methadone in that it is a partial agonist at \n     opiate receptors. This medication has been found to be as \n     effective as methadone and in some cases even better. It \n     seems to be particularly effective for adolescents with a \n     heroin problem. Buprenorphine is very unlikely to produce \n     overdose and in France, the death rate due to opiate overdose \n     has dropped by about 75 percent. Not only does it not produce \n     overdose itself, but it may even provide a measure of \n     protection against overdose by heroin.\n       The safety and efficacy of buprenorphine is such that it \n     should be made available to all physicians to treat patients \n     with opiate problems in their offices. This would be a major \n     benefit to patients who are unable and unwilling to come to \n     specialized methadone programs. It would be available not \n     just to heroin addicts, but to anyone with an opiate problem, \n     including many citizens who would not ordinarily be \n     associated with the term addiction. The availability of \n     buprenorphine would enable physicians to control the opiate \n     abuse problems of many Americans who are now being \n     inadequately treated or not treated at all.\n       One important development is the combination of \n     buprenorphine with naloxone, a full antagonist. If the \n     combination is taken by mouth, this new medication is \n     effective in reducing drug craving and stabilizing the person \n     to lead a normal life. If someone tries to abuse it by \n     injecting it, the naloxone component would then be effective \n     in blocking the effects and preventing a ``high'' or \n     euphoria. Thus, the diversion potential of this new \n     medication should be minimized.\n       Several treatment programs have already studied \n     buprenorphine in the treatment of adolescent heroin abusers. \n     It has been found to detoxify, that is treat withdrawal \n     symptoms, while the body cleanses itself of heroin, more \n     effectively than other medications. Thus a greater proportion \n     of young people are able to get off of heroin and receive \n     counseling and other forms of rehabilitation. Buprenorphine \n     is also very effective as a longer term medication that a \n     young person can take daily, return to school or job training \n     and after six months or more maintain a stable drug free \n     state. Once this medication is approved by the FDA and is \n     allowed to be used in physicians' offices, it could \n     dramatically improve the treatment of heroin addiction in the \n     U.S.\n       In summary Mr. Chairman, we are in the midst of the highest \n     availability of relatively pure heroin in our recorded \n     history. Fortunately we have effective treatments including \n     new medications that are coming on line. One of them, \n     buprenorphine, is well advanced in the FDA approval process \n     and is being considered for use in a new approach to opiate \n     addiction. This new approach [embodied in S. 324] in keeping \n     with the scientific data, would allow physicians to treat \n     heroin addiction in their offices just as we treat any other \n     medical problem.\n\n  The success of this vital legislation would not have been possible \nwithout the leadership and support of Senator Hatch, Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. Nor would it have been possible without the strong \nsupport of Senator Moynihan, Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, \nand Senator Biden, Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nYouth Violence, both of whom possess a clear grasp of the issues \nsurrounding illicit drug addiction and have long sought to address \nthem.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to commend the Senate for again \nunanimously passing the Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000. Today it \npassed as an amended version of S. 324, of which I am an original \ncosponsor, in Title XXXV, sections 3501 and 3502, of the Senate \nsubstitute to the Children's Health Act of 2000, H.R. 4365. The \nSenate's action today marks a milestone in the treatment of opiate \ndependence. The Drug Addiction Treatment Act increases access to new \nmedications, such as buprenorphine, to treat opiate addiction. I thank \nmy colleagues Senator Levin (whose long-term vision inspired this \nlegislation), Senator Hatch, and Senator Biden for their leadership and \ndedication in developing this Act, and I look forward to seeing the \nDrug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 become law.\n  Determining how to deal with the problem of addiction is not a new \ntopic. Just over a decade ago when we passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of \n1988, I was assigned by our then-Leader, Senator Robert Byrd, with \nSenator Sam Nunn, to co-chair a working group to develop a proposal for \ndrug control legislation. We worked together with a similar Republican \ntask force. We agreed, at least for a while, to divide funding under \nour bill between demand reduction activities (60 percent) and supply \nreduction activities (40 percent). And we created the Director of \nNational Drug Control Policy (section 1002); next, ``There shall be in \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy a Deputy Director for Demand \nReduction and a Deputy Director for Supply Reduction.''\n  We put demand first. To think that you can ever end the problem by \ninterdicting the supply of drugs, well, it's an illusion. There's no \npossibility.\n  I have been intimately involved with trying to eradicate the supply \nof drugs into this country. It fell upon me, as a member of the Nixon \nCabinet, to negotiate shutting down the heroin traffic that went from \ncentral Turkey to Marseilles to New York --``the French Connection''--\nbut we knew the minute that happened, another route would spring up. \nThat was a given. The success was short-lived. What we needed was \ndemand reduction, a focus on the user. And we still do.\n  Demand reduction requires science and it requires doctors. I see the \nscience continues to develop, and The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of \n2000 will allow doctors and patients to make use of it.\n  Congress and the public continue to fixate on supply interdiction and \nharsher sentences (without treatment) as the ``solution'' to our drug \nproblems, and adamantly refuse to acknowledge what various experts now \nknow and are telling us: that addiction is a chronic, relapsing \ndisease; that is, the brain undergoes molecular, cellular, and \nphysiological changes which may not be reversible.\n  What we are talking about is not simply a law enforcement problem, to \ncut the supply; it is a public health problem, and we need to treat it \nas such. We need to stop filling our jails under the misguided notion \nthat such actions will stop the problem of drug addiction. The Drug \nAddiction Treatment Act of 2000 is a step in the right direction.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today the United States Senate has passed \nthe Children's Health Act of 2000, an Act which will have a far-ranging \nimpact on the health of America's youth. This legislation not only \naddresses juvenile arthritis, diabetes, asthma and other childhood \ndiseases, but it also takes important steps to address what I would \nargue is a public health epidemic for both children and adults--\nsubstance abuse and addiction.\n  The Children's Health Act reauthorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration (SAMHSA), the federal agency devoted to \nsubstance abuse prevention and treatment services as well as a wide \nrange of mental health programs. The bill also includes three important \ndrug bills which I have cosponsored: the Methamphetamine Anti-\nProliferation Act, the Ecstasy Anti-Proliferation Act and the Drug \nAddiction Treatment Act. The result is a comprehensive piece of \nlegislation which includes the law enforcement, treatment and \nprevention services necessary to address substance abuse in the United \nStates today.\n  Mr. President, in 1996 I joined with my distinguished friend and \ncolleague, Senator Hatch, to introduce the ``Hatch-Biden \nMethamphetamine Control Act'' to address the growing threat of \nmethamphetamine use in our country before it was too late.\n  Our failure to foresee and prevent the crack cocaine epidemic is one \nof the most significant public policy mistakes in recent history. We \nwere determined not to repeat that mistake with methamphetamine.\n  That 1996 Act provided crucial tools that we needed to stay ahead of \nthe methamphetamine epidemic--increased penalties for possessing and \ntrafficking in methamphetamine and the precursor\n\n[[Page S9114]]\n\nchemicals and equipment used to manufacture the drug; tighter reporting \nrequirements and restrictions on the legitimate sales of products \ncontaining precursor chemicals to prevent their diversion; increased \nreporting requirements for firms that sell those products by mail; and \nenhanced prison sentences for meth manufacturers who endanger the life \nof any individual or endanger the environment while making this drug. \nWe also created a national working group of law enforcement and public \nhealth officials to monitor any growth in the methamphetamine epidemic.\n  I have no doubt that our 1996 legislation slowed this epidemic \nsignificantly. But we are up against a powerful and highly addictive \ndrug.\n  The Methamphetamine Anti-Proliferation Act--which I have \ncosponsored--builds on the 1996 Act. First and foremost, it closes the \n``amphetamine loophole'' in current law by making the penalties for \nmanufacturing, distributing, importing and exporting amphetamine the \nsame as those for meth. After all, the two drugs differ by only one \nchemical and are sold interchangeably on the street. If users can't \ntell the difference between the two substances, there is no reason why \nthe penalties should be different.\n  The bill also addresses the growing problem of meth labs by \nestablishing penalties for manufacturing the drug with an enhanced \npenalty for those who would put a child's life at risk in the process. \nWe provide $20 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to \nreimburse states for cleaning up toxic meth labs and $5.5 million for \nthe DEA to certify state and local officials to handle the hazardous \nbyproducts at the lab sites. We also provide $15 million for additional \nlaw enforcement personnel--including agents, investigators, \nprosecutors, lab technicians, chemists, investigative assistants and \ndrug prevention specialists--in High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas \nwhere meth is a problem.\n  Also included in the bill is $6.5 million for new agents to assist \nState and local law enforcement in small and mid-sized communities in \nall phases of drug investigations and assist state and local law \nenforcement in rural areas. The bill also provides $3 million to \nmonitor List I chemicals, including those used in manufacturing \nmethamphetamine, and prevent their diversion to illicit use.\n  Further, the legislation provides $10 million in prevention funds and \n$10 million for treating methamphetamine addiction, as well as much \nneeded money for researching new treatment modalities, including \nclinical trials. It asks the Institute of Medicine to issue a report on \nthe status of the development of pharmacotherapies for treatment of \namphetamine and methamphetamine addiction, such as the good work that \nthe scientists at the National Institute on Drug Abuse have done to \nisolate amino acids and develop medications to deal with meth overdose \nand addiction.\n\n  The Children's Health Act also includes the ``Ecstasy Anti-\nProliferation Act,'' a bill which Senators Graham, Grassley and Thomas \nand I introduced in May to address the new drug on the scene--Ecstasy, \na synthetic stimulant and hallucinogen. The legislation takes the \nsteps--both in terms of law enforcement and prevention--to address this \nproblem in a serious way before it gets any worse.\n  Ecstasy belongs to a group of drugs referred to as ``club drugs'' \nbecause they are associated with all-night dance parties known as \n``raves.'' There is a widespread misconception that it is not a \ndangerous drug--that it is ``no big deal.'' I believe that Ecstasy is a \nvery big deal. The drug depletes the brain of serotonin, the chemical \nresponsible for mood, thought, and memory.\n  If that isn't a big deal, I don't know what is.\n  A few months ago we got a significant warning sign that Ecstasy use \nis becoming a real problem. The University of Michigan's Monitoring the \nFuture survey, a national survey measuring drug use among students, \nreported that while overall levels of drug use had not increased, past \nmonth use of Ecstasy among high school seniors increased more than 66 \npercent.\n  The survey showed that nearly six percent of high school seniors have \nused Ecstasy in the past year. This may sound like a small number, but \nput in perspective it is deeply alarming--it is five times the number \nof seniors who used heroin and it is just slightly less than the \npercentage of seniors who used cocaine.\n  And with the supply of Ecstasy increasing as rapidly as it is, the \nnumber of kids using this drug is only likely to increase. So far this \nyear, the Customs Service has already seized 9 million Ecstasy pills--\nthree times the total amount seized in all of 1999 and twelve times the \namount seized in all of 1998.\n  Though New York is the East Coast hub for this drug, it is spreading \nquickly throughout the country. In my home state of Delaware, law \nenforcement officials have seized Ecstasy pills in Rehoboth Beach and \nare noticing the emergence of an Ecstasy problem in Newark among \nstudents at the University of Delaware.\n  The legislation directs the United States Sentencing Commission to \nincrease the recommended penalties for manufacturing, importing, \nexporting or trafficking Ecstasy.\n  The legislation also authorizes a $10 million prevention campaign in \nschools and communities to make sure that everyone--kids, adults, \nparents, teachers, cops, coaches, clergy, etc.--know just how dangerous \nthis drug really is. We need to dispel the myth that Ecstasy is not a \ndangerous drug because, as I stated earlier, this is a substance that \ncan cause brain damage and can even result in death. We need to spread \nthe message so that kids know the risk involved with taking Ecstasy, \nwhat it can do to their bodies, their brains, their futures. Adults \nalso need to be taught about this drug--what it looks like, what \nsomeone high on Ecstasy looks like, and what to do if they discover \nthat someone they know is using it.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor of the United States Senate \non numerous occasions to state what I view as the most effective way to \nprevent a drug epidemic. My philosophy is simple: the best time to \ncrack down on a drug with uncompromising enforcement pressure is before \nthe abuse of the drug has become rampant. The advantages of doing so \nare clear--there are fewer pushers trafficking in the drug and, most \nimportant, fewer lives and fewer families will have suffered from the \nabuse of the drug.\n  It is clear that Ecstasy use is on the rise and I am pleased that the \nSenate has acted today to address the escalating problem of this drug \nbefore it gets any worse.\n  In addition to stopping the proliferation of new drugs, we also need \nto invest in treating those who are already addicted. More than ten \nyears ago, in December 1989, I released a Senate Judiciary Committee \nReport entitled ``Pharmacotherapy: A Strategy for the 1990s.'' In this \nreport I argued that there was scientific promise for medicines that \nmight lessen an addict's craving for cocaine and heroin, as well as to \nreduce their enjoyment of those drugs.\n  This report asked the question: ``If drug abuse is an epidemic, are \nwe doing enough to find a medical `cure'?''\n  At the time, despite the efforts of myself and other members of \nCongress, the answer to that question was as clear as it was \ndistressing: the nation was doing far too little to find medicines that \ntreat the disease of drug addiction.\n  To address this shortfall, I authored, along with Senator Kennedy, \nthe Pharmacotherapy Development Act--which passed into law in 1992. The \ncornerstone of this Act was its call for a ten year, $1 billion effort \nto research and develop anti-addiction medications.\n  I cannot think of a more worthwhile investment. There is no other \ndisease that effects so many, directly and indirectly. We have 14 \nmillion drug users in this country, four million of whom are hard-core \naddicts. We all have a family member, neighbor, colleague or friend who \nhas become addicted. We are all impacted by the undeniable correlation \nbetween drugs and crime--an overwhelming 80 percent of the men and \nwomen behind bars today have a history of drug and alcohol abuse or \naddiction or were arrested for a drug-related crime. It only makes \nsense to unleash the full powers of medical science to find a ``cure'' \nfor this social and human ill.\n  Ten years ago, the question was: ``Are we doing enough to find a \n`cure'?''\n\n[[Page S9115]]\n\n Unfortunately that question is still with us. But today we also have \nanother question: ``Are we doing enough to get the `cures' we have to \nthose who need them?'' We have an enormous ``treatment gap'' in this \ncountry. Only two million of the estimated 4.4 to 5.3 million people \nwho need drug treatment are receiving it.\n  That is why I have worked with Senators Hatch, Levin and Moynihan and \nRepresentative Biley to craft the ``Drug Addiction Treatment Act,'' a \nbill which creates a new system for delivering anti-addiction \nmedications to patients who need them. Under the bill qualified doctors \ncan be granted a waiver to prescribe certain Schedule III, IV and V \nmedications from their offices. This is a significant step toward \nbridging the treatment gap.\n  Right now we have some highly effective pharmacotherapies to treat \nheroin addiction and we are still working on developing similar \nmedications for cocaine addiction. Access to currently available \nmedications such as methadone and LAAM (Levo-Alpha Acetylmethadol) has \nbeen strangled by layers of bureaucracy and regulation. As a result, \nonly 22 percent of opiate addicts are now receiving pharmacotherapy \ntreatment. General McCaffrey and Secretary Shalala are leading the \ncharge to fix that problem and I applaud their efforts.\n  Under the legislation passed today, patients will be able to get new \nmedications such a buprenorphine and a buprenorphine-naloxone \ncombination product--which are now under review by the Food and Drug \nAdministration--much like they can get other medications: a doctor \nprescribes them and the patient can get the medication from the local \npharmacy. This new system helps to move drug treatment into the \nmainstream of medicine.\n  The difficulties of distributing treatment medications to addicts not \nonly hurts those who are not getting the treatment they need, but it \nalso stifles private research. I have often bemoaned the fact that \nprivate industry has not aggressively developed pharmacotherapies. As \nwe increase access to these drugs, we increase incentives for private \ninvestment in this valuable research.\n  I am proud that the Senate has acted today to pass ``The Drug \nAddiction Treatment Act'' because it helps get new, promising anti-\naddiction medications get to those who need them. By allowing certain \ndoctors to dispense Schedule III, IV and V drugs from their offices, \nthe bill expands treatment flexibility and access and encourages others \nto develop similar medications.\n  Mr. President, in passing the Children's Health Act today, the Senate \nhas taken an important step to addressing the problem of substance \nabuse and all of the social ills that go along with it. I congratulate \nall of my colleagues who have worked on this legislation which will \nmake an important contribution to public health and public safety in \nthis country.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today as a co-author of the \n``Children's Health Act of 2000.'' This bill is essential in enabling \nus to build a health care system that is responsive to the unique needs \nof children. The ``Children's Health Act of 2000'' is a big step in the \nright direction, and I commend my colleagues, Senators Frist, Jeffords, \nand Kennedy for their efforts to construct a bill that can really make \na positive difference in the health and the lives of children.\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased that the ``Children's Health \nAct'' contains several important initiatives that my colleagues and I \nhad introduced already as separate bills. One such initiative--the \nPediatric Research Initiative--would help ensure that more of the \nincreased research funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) \nis invested specifically in children's health research.\n  While children represent close to 30 percent of the population of \nthis country, NIH devotes only about 12 percent of its budget to \nchildren, and, in recent years, that proportion has been declining even \nfurther. We must reverse this disturbing trend. It simply makes no \nsense to conduct health research for adults and hope that those \nfindings also will apply to children. A ``one size fits all'' research \napproach just doesn't work. The fact is that children have medical \nconditions and health care needs that differ significantly from adults. \nChildren's health deserves more attention from the research community. \nThat's why the Pediatric Research Initiative is such an important part \nof the ``Children's Health Act.'' It would provide the federal support \nfor pediatric research that is so vital to ensuring that children \nreceive the appropriate and best health care possible.\n  The Pediatric Research Initiative would authorize at least $50 \nmillion for each of the next five years for the Office of the Director \nof the National Institute of Health (NIH) to conduct, coordinate, \nsupport, develop, and recognize pediatric research. In doing so, we \nwill be able to ensure researchers target and study child-specific \ndiseases. With more than 20 Institutes and Centers and Offices within \nNIH that conduct, support, or develop pediatric research in some way, \nthis investment would promote greater coordination and focus in \nchildren's health research, and hopefully encourage new initiatives and \nareas of research.\n  The ``Children's Health Act'' also would authorize the Secretary of \nHHS to establish a pediatric research loan repayment program for \nqualified health professionals who conduct pediatric research. Trained \nresearchers are essential if we are to make significant advances in the \nstudy of pediatric health care, especially in light of the new and \nimproved Food and Drug Administration (FDA) policies that encourage the \ntesting of medications for use by children.\n  Additionally, the ``Children's Health Act'' includes the ``Children's \nAsthma Relief Act,'' which Senator Durbin and I introduced last year. \nThe sad reality for children is that asthma is becoming a far too \ncommon and chronic childhood illness. From 1979 to 1992, the \nhospitalization rates among children due to asthma increased 74 \npercent. Today, estimates show that more than seven percent of children \nnow suffer from asthma. Nationwide, the most substantial prevalence \nrate increase for asthma occurred among children aged four and younger. \nThose four and younger also were hospitalized at the highest rate among \nall individuals with asthma.\n  According to 1998 data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), my \nhome state of Ohio ranks about 17th in the estimated prevalence rates \nfor asthma. Based on a 1994 CDC National Health Interview Survey, an \nestimated 197,226 children under 18 years of age in Ohio suffer from \nasthma. We need to address this problem adequately. The ``Children's \nHealth Act'' would help do that by ensuring that children with asthma \nreceive the care they need to lead healthy lives. The bill would \nauthorize funding for fiscal years 2001 through 2005 for the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services (HHS) to establish state and local \ncommunity grants to be used for asthma detection, treatment, and \neducation services; require coordination with current children's health \nprograms to identify children who are asthmatic and may otherwise \nremain undetected and untreated; require NIH to direct more resources \nto its National Asthma Education Prevention Program to develop a \nfederal plan for responding to asthma; and require the Center for \nDisease Control to conduct local asthma surveillance activities to \ncollect data on the prevalence and severity of asthma. This \nsurveillance data will help us better detect asthmatic conditions, so \nthat we can treat more children and ensure that we are targeting our \nresources in an effective and efficient way to reverse the disturbing \ntrend in the hospitalization and death rates of asthmatic children.\n  Since research shows that children living in urban areas suffer from \nasthma at such alarming rates and that allergens, such as cockroach \nwaste, contribute to the onset of asthma, this bill also adds urban \ncockroach management to the current preventive health services block \ngrant, which currently can be used for rodent control.\n  The ``Children's Health Act'' also includes a bill I introduced \nseparately with Senator Dodd. This section would require that the \nSecretary of HHS ensure that all research that is conducted, supported, \nor regulated by HHS complies with regulations governing the protection \nof children involved in research. Children who participate in clinical \ntrials are medical pioneers. It is just common sense that we update and \napply the strongest federal guidelines to ensure the safety of these \nyoung people as they participate in clinical trials that will ensure \nthat\n\n[[Page S9116]]\n\nmedicines will be safe and appropriate for use in all children.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the ``Children's Health Act'' includes \nlanguage that I strongly support to re-authorize funding for children's \nhospitals' Graduate Medical Education (GME) programs for four \nadditional years. Last year, as part of the ``Health Care Research and \nQuality Act,'' which was signed into law, we authorized funding for two \nyears for children's hospitals' GME programs. The teaching mission of \nthese hospitals is essential. Children's hospitals comprise less than \none percent of all hospitals, yet they train five percent of all \nphysicians, nearly 30 percent of all pediatricians, and almost 50 \npercent of all pediatric specialists. By providing our nation with \nhighly qualified pediatricians, children's hospitals can offer children \nthe best possible care and offer parents peace of mind. They serve as \nthe health care safety net for low-income children in their respective \ncommunities and are often the sole regional providers of many critical \npediatric services. These institutions also serve as centers of \nexcellence for very sick children across the nation. Federal funding \nfor GME in children's hospitals is a sound investment in children's \nhealth and provides stability for the future of the pediatric \nworkforce.\n  Mr. President, as the father of eight children and the grandfather of \nfive, I firmly believe that we must move forward to protect the \ninterests--and especially the health--of all children. The ``Children's \nHealth Act of 2000'' makes crucial investments in our country's \nfuture--investments that will yield great returns. If we focus on \nimproving health care for all children today, we will have a generation \nof healthy adults tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9116-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TO AMEND THE ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm transportation \n     corridor is a major gateway to Alaska and includes a range of \n     transportation routes used first by indigenous people who \n     were followed by pioneers who settled the Nation's last \n     frontier;\n       (2) the natural history and scenic splendor of the region \n     are equally outstanding; vistas of nature's power include \n     evidence of earthquake subsidence, recent avalanches, \n     retreating glaciers, and tidal action along Turnagain Arm, \n     which has the world's second greatest tidal range;\n       (3) the cultural landscape formed by indigenous people and \n     then by settlement, transportation, and modern resource \n     development in this rugged and often treacherous natural \n     setting stands as powerful testimony to the human fortitude, \n     perseverance, and resourcefulness that is America's proudest \n     heritage from the people who settled the frontier;\n       (4) there is a national interest in recognizing, \n     preserving, promoting, and interpreting these resources;\n       (5) the Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm region is \n     geographically and culturally cohesive because it is defined \n     by a corridor of historical routes-trail, water, railroad, \n     and roadways through a distinct landscape of mountains, \n     lakes, and fjords;\n       (6) national significance of separate elements of the \n     region include, but are not limited to, the Iditarod National \n     Historic Trail, the Seward Highway National Scenic Byway, and \n     the Alaska Railroad National Scenic Railroad;\n       (7) national heritage area designation provides for the \n     interpretation of these routes, as well as the national \n     historic districts and numerous historic routes in the region \n     as part of the whole picture of human history in the wider \n     transportation corridor including early Native trade routes, \n     connections by waterway, mining trail, and other routes;\n       (8) national heritage area designation also provides \n     communities within the region with the motivation and means \n     for ``grassroots'' regional coordination and partnerships \n     with each other and with borough, State, and Federal \n     agencies; and\n       (9) [resolution and letters of support have been received \n     from] national heritage area designation is supported by the \n     Kenai Peninsula Historical Association, the Seward Historical \n     Commission, the Seward City Council, the Hope and Sunrise \n     Historical Society, the Hope Chamber of Commerce, the Alaska \n     Association for Historic Preservation, the Cooper Landing \n     Community Club, the Alaska Wilderness Recreation and Tourism \n     Association, Anchorage Historic Properties, the Anchorage \n     Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Cook Inlet Historical \n     Society, the Moose Pass Sportsman's Club, the Alaska \n     Historical Commission, the Gridwood Board of Supervisors, \n     the Kenai River Special Management Area Advisory Board, \n     the Bird/Indian Community Council, the Kenai Peninsula \n     Borough Trails Commission, the Alaska Division of Parks \n     and Recreation, the Kenai Peninsula Borough, the Kenai \n     Peninsula Tourism Marketing Council, and the Anchorage \n     Municipal Assembly.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to recognize, preserve, and interpret the historic and \n     modern resource development and cultural landscapes of the \n     Kenai Mountains-Turnagain Arm historic transportation \n     corridor, and to promote and facilitate the public enjoyment \n     of these resources; and\n       (2) to foster, through financial and technical assistance, \n     the development of cooperative planning and partnerships \n     among the communities and borough, State, and Federal \n     Government entities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I rise to honor a great Montanan, a great \nAmerican, who passed away just a few days ago, Maureen Hayes Mansfield.\n  These are remarks about Maureen, but it is also a love story. Maureen \nwas born Maureen Hayes in the State of Washington at the beginning of \nthe last century, in 1905, and spent most of her youth in Butte, MT. \nButte, at that time, was a live, bustling, raucous mining city, with \nbig copper mines. Living in Butte, she met a grade school dropout, a \nmucker working in the Butte mines, a profound young man named Mike--\nMike Mansfield.\n  Mike was not only a grade school dropout but he also was an extremely \nwonderful person. Maureen must have recognized the strength in Mike at \nthe time. Mike, as many of us know, served in all three branches of the \narmed services--age 17, 18, and 19. He had to maybe tell a little story \nabout his age so he could get into--I think it was the Navy at the \ntime.\n  Mike served, and Maureen noticed that. They became very close--they \nfell in love with each other, Mike living as a solitary boarder in a \nboarding house, Maureen living up in a nice spacious house with her \nlarge family in Butte. After they got to know each other even more, \nMaureen, who was a high school teacher in Butte, persuaded Mike to go \nback to school. She persuaded Mike to leave the mines, go back to \nschool and get an education.\n  A few years later, they moved to Missoula, MT. In Missoula, Maureen \nquit her job. She cashed in her life insurance policy to support Mike's \neducation so Mike could go back and get a university degree.\n  Mike gradually worked his way up and became a professor in history at \nthe University of Montana. He got his master's degree at the University \nof Montana. And Maureen, in the year Mike got his master's in history, \ngot hers in English, writing a thesis on Emily Bronte. Mike's thesis \nwas on U.S.-Korea diplomatic relations.\n  Maureen persuaded Mike to run for Congress in 1940. It was the \nWestern District in Montana. Mike was unsuccessful. It, ironically, is \nthe same district that Jeannette Rankin, a very strong woman, held for \na couple of terms. It is a district I once represented, and Lee Metcalf \nand other Montanans of great note have held.\n  Mike finally won in 1942. He came to Washington on a train --he did \nnot take one of these jets; it was on a train, to Washington, DC--and \nset up his office. Maureen worked in his office without compensation.\n  They worked together; they were such a wonderful team. Mike then, \nafter 10 years in the House, served 10 years in the Senate beginning in \n1952. Years after his service in the House, he was elected majority \nleader of the Senate. He served 16 years, longer than any other \nAmerican, as majority leader of the Senate. Then Mike, as we know, went \noff to serve as Ambassador to Japan under both President Carter and \nPresident Reagan.\n  This is a story probably about Mike Mansfield, but Maureen's death is \ntime for us to reflect upon Maureen herself and upon the love that Mike \nand Maureen had for each other. They were inseparable. They were always \ntogether, always giving each other support, help, and confidence as a \nteam.\n  I can remember when I met Mike. The majority leader's office at that \ntime was a little more modest than it is today. Maureen was sitting in \nthere, and they were talking a little bit. Right away I realized Mike \nand Maureen just did not have all the time\n\n[[Page S9119]]\n\nthey would have liked to have had together because Mike was so busy as \nmajority leader.\n  I said: You two don't get much chance to be together. I am going to \nleave so you can have some time together.\n  I did. I walked out. I could tell they liked it very much. Maureen's \neyes twinkled and smiled. I say this because Maureen always smiled. She \nwas always optimistic, always upbeat, always helping people, always a \nvery kind person, self-effacing, a lady of few words but uncommon \ntalent and knowledge and wisdom.\n  She attended St. Mary's University, a women's college which was then \nattached to Notre Dame in Indiana. She got her master's degree in \nEnglish in 4 years, which was quite a feat for women in those years. \nShe read constantly. She was always taking home books from the Library \nof Congress.\n  I believe if one looks throughout history, very often people who read \na lot are wiser, have more confidence in themselves, and have a greater \nimprint upon other people in a positive way. I am thinking of people \nsuch as Harry Truman. He read a lot. Justice Blackmun read a lot, and \nMaureen was one of those who constantly read and was just a wonderful \ninfluence on Mike.\n  Let me give a couple examples to demonstrate just how much Mike \nbelieved in Maureen.\n  We all know that Mike never took credit for what he did. Maureen \nnever took credit for all that she did. It was an era, a time when \npeople did not take credit for what they did. They just did a good job. \nThat was in the sixties, seventies, less so in this era.\n  Whenever somebody wanted to credit Mike for his tremendous \naccomplishments, Mike would always insist: No, Maureen is first. \nWhatever I did, Mike Mansfield, whatever honors I had is because of \nMaureen.\n  It is true. Often the people of the State of Montana would say: OK, \nMike, we want to dedicate a building to you, the Mansfield Center.\n  Mike would say: No, it has to be the Maureen and Mike Mansfield \nCenter, and they would agree.\n  The legislature in Montana wanted to create a statue honoring Mike \nMansfield, one of the most famous Montanans in our State's history. \n``No way,'' Mike said, ``unless it is a statue of Maureen and myself.'' \nOtherwise he was very much opposed. The legislature agreed.\n  I wish you could have seen the two of them together. They were always \ntogether. They celebrated their 68th wedding anniversary last March. \nThey were married 68 years, solidly helping to reinforce each other. \nThey were always together helping each other.\n  I asked Mike once: Mike, you have lived such a rich life. When are \nyou going to write your memoirs?\n  Mike said: I am not going to.\n  I asked why.\n  He said: I was told so much in confidence, it would not be proper for \nme to write memoirs. Those are confidential statements.\n  And that is Maureen. The two of them were just like that. I am sure \nMaureen's influence on Mike helped make Mike the great, wonderful \nperson he is, and it was mutually reinforcing. I also have a view that \nteachers tend to be more dedicated than most other professions. After \nall, teachers are servants in a sense. If one looks at achievers, very \noften one of their parents was a teacher or there was a teacher \nsomewhere in the family.\n  Maureen was a teacher. She was a teacher in the public school system. \nMike was a teacher at the University of Montana. The best lessons they \ntaught us were by example: Honest as the day is long; their word is \ntheir bond; upbeat, positive, contributing, giving, thinking, searching \nfor a better way for more people.\n  I believe the most noble human endeavor is service--service to \ncommunity, to church, to family, to friends, to State, whatever makes \nthe most sense for an individual. Maureen Mansfield served her husband, \nher State, and her country more than any other person I have had the \nprivilege to know or to meet and with such grace, such style, and such \ninspiration.\n  I stand here today, Mr. President, in great honor of Maureen \nMansfield, in awe of the wonderful love affair between Mike and \nMaureen. As many of Maureen's Indian friends would say: This is not \ngoodbye; we will see you later.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Shelby). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I again thank the distinguished majority \nleader for arranging for me to have this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9119-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9119-S9122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE 213TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SIGNING OF THE U.S. CONSTITUTION--\n                           SEPTEMBER 17, 1787\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in commemoration of the signing of the \nConstitution and in recognition of the importance of active, \nresponsible citizenship in preserving the Constitution's blessings for \nour Nation, the Congress, by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 \nU.S.C. 159), requested that the President proclaim the week beginning \nSeptember 17 and ending September 23 of each year as ``Constitution \nWeek.'' That has happened each year since.\n  This week the United States celebrates one of its greatest \nachievements. Two-hundred and thirteen years ago, on September 17, \n1787, the Founding Fathers placed their signatures on the newly created \nConstitution in Philadelphia's Independence Hall. Eleven years earlier, \n6 of the 39 signers of the U.S. Constitution signed the Declaration of \nIndependence in the same building in Philadelphia. Within the lifespan \nof a single generation, Americans had effectively declared their \nindependence twice.\n  In many ways, the liberation claimed from Britain in 1776 was less \nremarkable than the historical achievement that Americans claimed by \nframing the Constitution in 1787. The Constitution represented a \ntriumph of political imagination and pragmatism by recognizing that \nultimate political authority resides not in the government, or in any \nsingle government official, but rather, in the people.\n  The Founding Fathers had used the doctrine of popular sovereignty as \nthe rationale for their successful rebellion against English authority \nin 1776 when they framed the Declaration of Independence. They argued \nthat the government's legitimacy remains dependent on the governed, who \nretain the inalienable right to alter or to abolish their government. \nThe Declaration of Independence set forth their justifications for \nbreaking with Britain, but, until September 17, 1787, they had not yet \nbeen able to work out fully how to implement principles of popular \nsovereignty, while, at the same time, preserving a stable government \nthat protects the rights and liberties of all citizens. The \nConstitution is a mechanism for advancing the principles of the \nAmerican Republic stated so eloquently in the Declaration of \nIndependence. To paraphrase former Chief Justice Warren Burger, the \nDeclaration is the promise, the Constitution is its fulfillment.\n  The new republican union created in 1776 was a truly unprecedented \nexperiment, whose future was very much in doubt. Not only were the \nformer British colonies unsure of whether they would be successful in \ntheir war for independence, but there was also doubt that the American \ncolonials would be able to create a stable republican government, able \nto protect the rights and liberties of its citizens, without \nbacksliding into the same authoritarian rule experienced under Britain. \nFor this reason, it is appropriate that we take this moment, 213 years \nlater, to reflect on a document that completed an uncertain process \nthat was begun, from a documentary standpoint, on July 4, 1776.\n  I have spoken on several occasions about the taproots and the origins \nof the U.S. Constitution. Of course, the State constitutions, some of \nwhich had been in existence since early 1776, greatly influenced the \nframers. Many of the ideas in the State constitutions had already been \ntested under colonial experience, and as a matter of fact, under the \nBritish experience, and were later reborn in our national charter. The \nestablishment of a national bicameral legislature finds its roots in at \nleast 9 out of 13 State constitutions. Of course, the roots extended \nprior to that but in at least 9 of the 13 State constitutions we find \nthe enlargement of the roots, the fleshing out of the roots, the \nnourishing of the roots.\n\n  Lessons derived from recent political experiences were arguably as \nlikely to influence the thinking of the founding\n\n[[Page S9120]]\n\nframers as the maxims and axioms of, among others, the English \nphilosophers John Locke, Sir William Blackstone--one of the great legal \nauthorities of all time--John Milton--that great author of ``Paradise \nLost'' and ``Paradise Regained'', Algernon Sydney, and other great \nworks--Scottish philosopher David Hume, and French philosopher Baron de \nMontesquieu, all of whom were part of the intellectual Enlightenment \nperiod.\n  Likewise, many of the institutional practices embedded in the U.S. \nConstitution hark back to England and its Constitution, which, although \nit is largely unwritten, does contain such written documents as the \nMagna Carta, the Petition of Right, and the English Bill of Rights. \nMany of the amendments incorporated into the U.S. Bill of Rights can be \nfound, almost word for word, in those political documents.\n  But, to truly understand and appreciate the U.S. Constitution and the \npolitical movement that led to its creation, one must become familiar \nwith the first national charter that was established by the newly \nindependent colonies--namely, the Articles of Confederation.\n  Many Americans have heard of the Articles of Confederation, fewer \nAmericans probably ever read those Articles of Confederation.\n  The operation of government under that national charter provided the \nmost visible examples of what republicanism meant in practice. Its \nfailure not only drove the movement for constitutional reform--when I \nsay ``its failure,'' I mean the failure of the Articles of \nConfederation--not only drove the movement for constitutional reform \nthat brought the framers to Philadelphia in 1787, but also brought \nexperimental evidence--ah, how important was that experimental \nevidence--from which the framers drew in creating a greatly improved \nmodel of republican government.\n  From its inception, the first national charter--the Articles of \nConfederation--had limited goals. The Articles provided for what was \nessentially a continuation of the Second Continental Congress by \ncreating a unicameral legislature, where each State was represented \nwith one vote. This body had the authority to declare war, to conduct \ndiplomacy, to regulate Indian affairs, to coin money, and to issue \ncurrency, among other things. However, to limit the threat of a \ncentralized authority, Congress could not levy taxes or regulate trade. \nThe crucial power of the purse rested solely with the States, which \nwere to contribute funds at the request of the Congress. The Articles \nfurther limited centralized power by providing the States with total \nenforcement authority so that the Congress could do no more than to \nrecommend policies to the States. When it came to money, it could do no \nmore than just request the funds from the States. The States, which \nthen could accept or ignore these recommendations, most of the time \nfailed to provide the funds. Many times the States would provide some \nof the funds but not all of the funds requested.\n\n  Looking back, the inherent weaknesses of the Articles seem obvious \nnow, but all of these limitations on the Congress were designed with \nthe specific intention of making the State legislatures the dominant \nforce in the Government. This may seem peculiar to us today, but, at \nthe time, loyalty to the State Governments rather than to the Nation \nunderlaid the mentality of post-war America. We oftentimes forget that \nthe Articles were drafted in 1777 in the midst of the Revolutionary \nWar. At the time, delegates were more concerned about keeping up with \nthe demands of the Continental army, and, perhaps more importantly, \navoiding capture by the British army which had occupied New York City \nand Philadelphia in 1777 than in drafting a national charter. In fact, \nit was not until 1781--4 years later--that the Articles of \nConfederation had been ratified by the thirteen States. With the new \nNation in the midst of a military crisis, Congress assumed correctly \nthat the States would contribute funds and men to the common defense. \nFrom the Framers' perspective--the framers of the Articles of \nConfederation--the greatest problem in 1777 was curbing executive \npower. And that is still a problem today. What had driven the colonies \ninto rebellion was an abuse of executive power by the king, his \nministers, and his agents. To ensure that the executive could never \nagain threaten the popular liberty, national government was made \nsubservient to the States in order to preserve the sovereignty of the \nStates.\n  What ultimately began to alter the American psyche can only be \ndescribed as Congress' impotence in addressing incidents of unrest in \nthe Nation. Efforts had been underway to amend the Articles even before \nthey took effect on March 1, 1781. One week earlier, Congress had asked \nthe States to approve an amendment authorizing it to collect a five \npercent tariff on imported goods. This amendment was the outgrowth of \nthe economic condition of the country at the time. By 1781, American \nmerchants found themselves deeply in debt after the British and French \nclosed markets in the Caribbean to their trade, and Americans continued \nto import large amounts of luxury goods. At the same time, the Congress \nand States were printing paper money to finance their debts, which were \nbacked only by their promise to redeem the bills with future tax \nreceipts. By 1781, the currency had become worthless and led Americans \nto coin the expression, ``not worth a continental.'' The printing of \npaper money combined with a wartime shortage of goods led to an \ninflationary spiral of fewer and fewer goods costing more and more \nmoney. The goal of the amendment introduced in February 1781 was to tax \nimports, which would simultaneously reduce the demand for imports while \nforcing British and French merchants to open their Caribbean trade \nroutes. The amendment would ultimately fail when Rhode Island refused \nto approve it.\n  Congress was faring no better in foreign diplomacy. In 1784, Spain \nclosed New Orleans and the Mississippi river to American trade, \npreventing settlers living to the west of the Appalachian mountains \nfrom shipping their goods to the Gulf of Mexico, and thence to other \nmarkets. This action, coupled with the abortive separatist movements in \nKentucky and Tennessee, threatened to divide the American Nation into \ntwo or three separate confederacies by forcing southwestern territories \nto accommodate themselves to Spain. In 1785, Congress instructed \nSecretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay to negotiate a treaty with Spain \nthat would allow the southwestern States to navigate the Mississippi, \nand thus, ensure southwestern loyalty to the American Nation. The \nSpanish emissary, Don Diego de Gardoqui, however, proved to be the more \nformidable diplomat. He convinced Jay to sign a treaty by which the \nUnited States would relinquish all rights to the Mississippi for \ntwenty-five years in return for Spain acknowledging U.S. territorial \nclaims in the southwest. When the treaty became public knowledge, \nhowever, southwestern territories were outraged, further dividing the \nNation. Congress attempted several times in the 1780s to give Congress \ngreater authority to regulate both foreign and interstate commerce. The \namendments, however, were never unanimously approved by the States.\n  In both of these matters of diplomacy and economics, Congress under \nthe Articles of Confederation, found that its proposals would founder \non the requirement of unanimous State ratification. This requirement \nled the supporters of a stronger national government to believe that \nsuch a policy could only be pursued through a limited, piecemeal \napproach. The desultory history of all of the amendments that Congress \nhad fruitlessly considered since 1781 suggested that more radical \napproaches stood little chance. However, by 1786, it became clear that \nthe states stood little chance of ever unanimously agreeing to \namendments. With Congress losing what little influence it had, it soon \nbecame clear to a group of Virginians that any reform efforts would \nhave to first come from the states.\n\n  The most important effort toward reform therefore took place in \nVirginia in January 1786, when the state legislature approved a \nresolution calling for an interstate conference to consider vesting \nmore power in the confederation Congress to regulate commerce. The \nConvention was to take place in Annapolis, Maryland, and, although only \nfive states sent delegates to attend the Annapolis convention in \nSeptember 1786, the delegates did agree to a second convention in \nPhiladelphia ``. . . to devise such further provisions\n\n[[Page S9121]]\n\nas shall appear to them necessary to render the constitution of the \nfederal government adequate to the exigencies of the union.'' The \npotential radical thrust of this proposal suggests that the gradual \nstrategy of reform had collapsed, and that many of those present had \nturned to a desperate maneuver after having exhausted all other \nmeasures. Among those present were Hamilton and Madison.\n  Yet, up until the winter of 1786-1787, when the Shays' Rebellion took \nplace, the Founding Fathers did not suggest that the Philadelphia \nconvention should address anything other than the conspicuous failings \nof the Articles.\n  However, events in Massachusetts in the winter of 1786-1787 cast the \nproblems of the nation in more comprehensible terms. Shays' Rebellion \nbegan as a protest by Massachusetts farmers laboring under heavy state \ntaxation and private debt. Led by Daniel Shays, a veteran of the \nRevolution, an armed mob of two thousand men marched on the federal \narsenal in Springfield, Massachusetts, and closed the county courts to \nhalt creditors from foreclosing on any more farms. The State Militia \nquelled the uprising, but the news of the event left the rest of the \ncountry shaken. The Massachusetts state constitution was widely \nconsidered the most balanced of the revolutionary charters. If the \nMassachusetts state government could not protect the property of its \ncitizens, one of the most fundamental aims of Republican government, \nhow could the less balanced state and national governments endure if \nsuch unrest spread?\n  As Minister to France in 1787, Thomas Jefferson dismissed Shays' \nRebellion. ``A little rebellion now and then is a good thing,'' he \nwrote James Madison on January 30, 1787, ``and as necessary in the \npolitical world as storms in the physical.'' Madison was hardly \ninclined to agree. As he examined the ``vices of the political system \nof the United States'' in the early months of 1787, he became convinced \nthat the agenda of the upcoming convention should not be limited to the \nfailings of the Articles. The time had come to undo the damages caused \nby the excesses of republicanism.\n  But, consider for a moment the odds that were against the delegates \nin crafting a workable government. The record of reform was hardly \nencouraging. The states had taken more than three years to ratify the \nArticles, and in the six years since, not one amendment that Congress \nhad proposed to the states had been approved. There was also the \nquestion of whether the Congress should endorse the Philadelphia \nconvention. By 1787, its reputation had fallen so low that it was \nunclear whether its endorsement would aid or kill reform efforts. \nMoreover, the convention had to attract an impressive array of legal \nminds to lend validity to whatever document would be produced. Yet, \nthere was little guarantee that the convention would muster such \npersons. Even George Washington, who among all others probably most \nrecognized the need for the convention, was hesitant to attend for fear \nthat his reputation would suffer if the convention should fail. He \naccepted the invitation reluctantly at the urging of Madison, and even \nthen, not until the last minute. But, perhaps more importantly, the \nArticles never provided for such a device of amending the \nConfederation, which caused many in Congress to question the propriety \nof the convention. After all, if the conventional delegates did produce \na revised document, would it be considered law if the Articles never \nallowed for a constitutional convention in the first place?\n  In the face of these obstacles, any proposal put forth by the Framers \nwould have to be more complex than that of simply shifting the powers \nof taxation and regulation of commerce from the state governments to a \nnational government. Because the state governments were already \nentrenched, it was unlikely that the states would agree to the creation \nof a powerful central government at the expense of their self-governing \nauthority. Granting the states specific self-governing powers and \nrights was not only politically expedient, but also served the Framers' \nintent to limit the central government's authority. The sharing of \npower between the states and the national government was one more \nstructural check in what was to be an elaborate governmental scheme of \nchecks and balances. The Framers further decentralized authority \nthrough a separation of powers, which distributed the business of \ngovernment among three separate branches.\n  This ensured against the creation of too strong a national government \ncapable of overpowering the individual state governments.\n  In a seemingly paradoxical fashion, governmental powers and \nresponsibilities were also intentionally shared among the separate \nbranches. Congressional authority to enact laws can be checked by an \nexecutive veto, which in turn can be overridden by a two-thirds \nmajority vote in both houses; the President serves as commander-in-\nchief, but only the Congress has the authority to raise and support an \narmy, and to declare war; the President has the power to appoint \nambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme \nCourt, and all other officers of the United States, but only by and \nwith the advice and consent of the Senate; and the Supreme Court has \nfinal authority to strike down both legislative and presidential acts \nas unconstitutional. This balancing of power is intended to ensure that \nno one branch grows too powerful and dominates the national government.\n  What happened in Philadelphia was then truly remarkable. Committed at \nfirst to limiting executive power by making state legislatures supreme, \nAmericans created a constitution that provided for an independent \nexecutive branch and a balanced government. Committed at first to \npreserving the sovereignty of states, Americans drafted a constitution \nthat established a national government with authority that was \nindependent of the states.\n  So each of the two--the National Government and the State \ngovernments--was supreme in its own sphere and, yet, separate, in a \nsense, and overlapping.\n  Doubtful at first that a strong national republic was possible, \nAmericans created a strong national republic that still endures.\n  ``The real wonder,'' James Madison wrote in Federalist Number 37, \n``is that so many difficulties should have been surmounted, and \nsurmounted with a unanimity almost as unprecedented as it must have \nbeen unexpected. It is impossible for any man of candor to reflect on \nthis circumstance without partaking of the astonishment. It is \nimpossible for the man of pious reflection not to perceive in it a \nfinger of that Almighty hand which has been so frequently and signally \nextended to our relief in the critical stages of the revolution.''\n  There is a story, often told, that upon exiting the Constitutional \nConvention Benjamin Franklin was approached by a group of citizens \nasking what sort of government the delegates had created. ``A republic, \nMadame,'' he answered, ``if you can keep it.'' Characteristic of \nFranklin's statements, we should not allow the brevity of his response \nto undervalue its essential meaning: it is not enough that democratic \nrepublics are founded on the consent of the people; they are also \nabsolutely dependent upon the active and informed involvement of the \npeople.\n  Yet, opinion polls show that Americans have either never read the \nConstitution or have forgotten most of what they learned about it in \nschool. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are the \ncommon bonds that unite the nation because they articulate our \npolitical, moral, and spiritual values. To a degree Americans recognize \nthe ideologies of liberty and freedom that are contained in these \ndocuments, but we should also recognize that these beliefs were shaped \nby the political climate in large part in which they occurred. Too \noften these ideals are used as catch phrases to describe the founding \ndocuments which can obscure the complex political processes that \nproduced both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. The \npost-Revolutionary era provides Americans with perhaps the clearest \nexamples of why the Constitution is so vital to the stability of the \ncountry and the protection of our most basic freedoms. It is critical \nthat we reaffirm our knowledge of these events to preserve, in \nMadison's own words, ``. . . that veneration which time bestows on \neverything, and without which perhaps the wisest and freest governments\n\n[[Page S9122]]\n\nwould not possess the requisite stability.''\n  Those words can be found in the Federalist No. 49, by James Madison.\n  In closing, let me refer back to something I said earlier when I said \nthat it is not enough that democratic republics are founded on the \nconsent of the people; they are absolutely dependent upon the active \nand informed involvement of the people.\n  In this regard, the American people will shortly be called upon to be \ninvolved. There is a national election coming. Elections will occur in \nevery State. I think it is very appropriate, if I may, to state those \nwords again.\n  It is not enough that democratic republics are founded on the consent \nof the people; they are also absolutely dependent upon the active and \ninformed involvement of the people.\n  It is a disgrace, if we look at the record of the voter turnout in \nthis country, the American people, it seems to me, are less and less \ninvolved when it comes to voting. Fewer and fewer of the people \nexercise this right--this duty. This is a foremost duty of American \ncitizenship. Fewer people are involved.\n  I close with this reference to history.\n  In 1776, in September, George Washington asked for a volunteer to go \nbehind the British lines and draw pictures and develop information with \nrespect to the placement of the British guns, their breastworks, their \nfortifications, and to bring that information back to the American \nlines. A young man by the name of Nathan Hale responded to the call. He \nwas a schoolteacher. He went behind the British lines. This was an \nexceedingly dangerous assignment.\n  Nathan Hale achieved his purpose, but on the night before he was to \nreturn to the American lines, he was discovered by the British to be an \nAmerican spy. The papers, the drawings, were upon his person. The next \nmorning, September 22, 1776--224 years ago today--he stood before the \nhastily built gallows. He saw just before him the crude wooden coffin \nin which his body would soon be laid. He asked for a Bible. The request \nwas denied. Whether or not the British at that point had a Bible near, \nwe don't know. But there he stood with his hands tied behind him.\n  The British commander, whose name was Cunningham, asked Hale if he \nhad anything to say. His last words, which are remembered by every \nschoolchild in America who has had the opportunity to read American \nhistory, were these: I only regret that I have but one life to lose for \nmy country.\n  The British commander said: ``String the rebel up''.\n  Nathan Hale gave his one life for his country.\n  My final question is this: If Nathan Hale was willing to give his \nonly life--all he had--for his country, why is every American, \nRepublican or Democrat or Independent, not willing to give his one vote \nfor his country?\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/22/senate-section/article/S9122-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS UNTIL MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
