Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning during \nmorning business to say a few words about a couple of subjects that are \nvery important to me and to the people of my State. As the American \npublic knows, the last couple of days we have been engaged in a \ntremendous debate about the Interior appropriations bill. It is 1 of \nthe 13 appropriations bills in this Congress we are trying to negotiate \nand pass as part of our overall budget, and it is a very important and \nquite contentious piece of legislation. There are many issues about \nbalancing our resources: how they should be harvested, how they should \nbe spent, how they should be invested.\n  There are about 21 Senators in this body, on the Republican and \nDemocratic side, who have worked very hard on a very comprehensive \nConservation and Reinvestment Act which is now pending in the Energy \nCommittee. Next year, as this bill comes out of this committee and \nbecomes part of the national debate, it is my hope and vision we will \nbe debating how to use the resources we have been able to set aside \nthis year for the American public.\n  In the bill we have crafted, which is S. 25, the Conservation and \nReinvestment Act, we have made a statement\n\n[[Page S10714]]\n\nthat there is a better way to spend the money that is coming from \noffshore oil and gas, a much better way to spend this money than what \nwe have done the last 50 years. For the last 50 years, we have taken \nalmost every dime that has come from oil and gas, almost every dime, \nand put it back into the general treasury of this country and operated \nour Government.\n  I believe, and I think the American people strongly believe, that a \ngood portion of that money should go back to protect the environment. \nWe are depleting one resource, a great resource that we have in oil and \nnatural gas, we are depleting it at a tremendous rate in the Gulf of \nMexico, which is now the place, basically, outside of Alaska, where \nmost of the offshore drilling occurs, and of course a little in the \ninterior States. But the Gulf of Mexico has the bulk of our reserves. \nStates such as Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and, to a certain degree, \nAlabama contribute.\n  We are happy for the industry. We are learning to manage it in a more \nenvironmentally friendly way. We believe they can coexist, the oil \nindustry and other industries and the environment. But all of this \nmoney, as you know, has gone into the general fund. We think it is time \nsome of this money be reinvested before the wells run dry. One day \nthere is not going to be any gas left, there is not going to be any oil \nleft, and I, frankly, would like to have something to show for it.\n  For those of use who have children and grandchildren and nieces and \nnephews and families, we would like to be able to say we were wise and \nsmart and conservative and careful and good stewards of the great \nbounty God has given us, and we have decided to set aside permanently--\nnot hit or miss, not willy-nilly but permanently--a portion of this \nmoney to create and sustain our National Park System, to create green \nspaces and places from New Jersey to California, from Washington State \nto Florida, from one point of this Nation to the other, to expand the \npublic areas, to expand the green space, to protect our habitat, to \nprovide wilderness areas in a way that makes sense for every \ncommunity. That is what this bill does. It fully funds the land and \nwater conservation fund which was promised by the last five Presidents, \nboth Democratic and Republican, a great promise that sounded terrific \nand probably got some votes for them in the elections. The problem is, \nit was never funded consistently.\n\n  I quote from a poll recently taken by Frank Lunz. As you know, he is \na Republican pollster, but he did an absolutely outstanding job in this \nsurvey of the American people: 94 percent of the American people would \nlike to set aside and create a special way of funding these kinds of \nprograms. In fact, it might be of interest for some Members of this \nbody to know that in a head-up polling, a true trust fund ``for land \nand water and open spaces beats the wildly popular highway and airport \ntrust fund head to head 45 to 37.''\n  We know how much support there is for a highway trust fund. People \nbelieve gasoline taxes that are levied should go to provide for \nhighways, mass transit, fast trains, and environmentally friendly \ntransportation vehicles of the future. That is what the American people \nwant, and I agree with them. I voted for that and so did almost \neveryone in this body. But according to this poll, more people in this \ncountry believe there should be a real trust fund, that this promise \nshould be kept, and when a promise is made, it should be kept.\n  That is what S. 25 does. We are gaining support for it. If it can \npass this year, next year when we have this debate on the Interior \nbill, we will be talking about the wonderful opportunity to allocate \n$900 million a year--$450 million hopefully for the State side of land \nand water and $450 million for the Federal side of land and water--what \nparks to expand, how to expand them, what picnic areas and wilderness \nwill we create.\n  In addition, that part of the bill will also bring some much-needed \nrevenue to the coastal States, including the Great Lakes States, to \nmitigate against the challenges of being a coastal State. I do not \nthink we have to look much further than the weather report from last \nweek when Dennis battered the eastern shore and we have had hurricane \nafter hurricane loss of barrier islands, loss of beach areas.\n  If there is one thing the American people like to do on the Fourth of \nJuly, besides the fireworks and the celebration of our great \nIndependence Day, it is to spend the holiday at the beach. People do it \nall over the world, and we are no different. But in many parts of this \ncountry, there is limited public access unless you are rich enough to \nown a million-dollar condo or have the money or resources to buy a \nsection near a beach. Sometimes you cannot get there; it is crowded and \njam packed.\n  We would like to have some money for beach restoration, public space \nexpansion, and mitigation against the impacts of being a coastal State. \nThis money has been fairly spread around to States that produce oil and \ngas and, in a very generous way, even those States that do not. Those \nof us supporting this bill believe the money should go for those \ncoastal areas. We have Governors, mayors, and county commissioners \naround this Nation who most certainly support that effort and can use \nthe help as they struggle to keep their coastal communities intact.\n  In addition, a part of this bill will also create a permanent, \nreliable stream of money for some much-needed conservation programs.\n  I have gone fishing most of my life. I am not an expert, but I most \ncertainly enjoy it. I do not do any fancy fishing. We had a camp for 30 \nyears on Lake Pontchartrain. I have gone fishing for croakers and \nspeckled trout most of my life. There are millions of Americans who are \nserious sports people and fishermen and enjoy being in the outdoors and \nfishing and hiking and walking in the wilderness.\n\n  Part of this bill is going to be a help for States and agencies in \nall the 50 States to manage their wildlife resources better, both game \nand nongame. The States, under tremendous budget constraints, are doing \na pretty good job. Some States are doing better than others. But the \nFederal Government should be a better partner. I believe it is much \nbetter to deal on the front end, before species are endangered, before \nhabitat areas are endangered, to have money invested to keep them from \nbecoming endangered. It will save us a lot of money, a lot of lawsuits, \nand a lot of headaches. That is what this bill also does.\n  I am very hopeful, as the Energy and Natural Resources Committee of \nthis Senate comes back from this recess, we are going to seriously \nconsider this measure. I anticipate that it will pass. It will go \nthrough a tremendous debate. There is a similar bill on the House side. \nWe are anticipating passage of that bill and are in negotiations with \nthe administration.\n  Next year when we come to this floor, Democrats and Republicans can \nproudly say: Last year we just did not talk about the environment, we \njust did not argue about how to fund our parks and what to do, but we \ntook the opportunity when it presented itself.\n  We are running a surplus, and I know there are calls for a tax cut. I \nsupport a modest, reasonable, and fiscally responsible tax cut and \ninvestments in education, but we can also make room in this budget to \nredirect revenues to the places they should have been when it started. \nLouisiana and other producing States most certainly should be able to \ncount on a fair portion of that revenue coming back to them as well as \nsharing it generously, in the way I have described, with everyone else. \nI am hopeful that we will do that this year.\n  So this debate will be quite exciting for the American people--shall \nI say more exciting next year because they will have seen us actually \nhaving done something, taking the bull by the horns and redirecting \nthese revenues.\n  These poll numbers speak for themselves. We do not need to always \nfollow polls. Sometimes we do, and sometimes we do not. But, in this \ncase, it is a good indication of how much the American people want us \nto take action and actually make progress, to stop talking about it and \nactually do something.\n  I am hopeful S. 25 will pass. I thank the 22 Members of this body who \nhave worked tirelessly over the last 2 years, and the Members of the \nHouse--Congressman John and Congressman Tauzin, Congressman Dingell, \nCongressman Young, Congressman Miller--who have all engaged in trying \nto work this out in final negotiations on their side. I thank them for \ntheir diligence. I thank all the environmental groups, all\n\n[[Page S10715]]\n\nthe fishing, hunting, and sports enthusiasts who have helped bring this \nbill to where it is today, to the possibility of actually having this \npromise, which was made but never kept, become real for our children \nand grandchildren.\n  On that point, let me also add a word about this oil valuation. I \njust finished speaking for 10 minutes about using these oil and gas \nrevenues for a really special purpose. So why would I also then come to \nthe floor and talk about the oil valuation rule? The reason is that is \nexactly on point in this debate.\n\n  There are some Members who think the oil companies are intentionally \nunderpaying these royalties. Most certainly, based on the speech I just \ngave, I want to make sure, and will make sure to the best of my \nability, that the oil companies are paying every single penny of \nroyalties that are due to the American taxpayer because that money will \ngo directly, if this bill passes, into this trust fund to be spent on \nparks and recreation.\n  I most certainly will not be one of the Senators who will come to \nthis floor and try to come up with some scheme, if you will, to get the \noil companies off the hook. I want them to pay their fair share. In \naddition, being from Louisiana, when I was State treasurer before I \ncame here, 45 percent--let me repeat that--45 percent of our State \nbudget relied on oil and gas royalty rents and severance tax onshore \nand near shore. Many of these revenues went to fund our schools and put \ncomputers in our classrooms. We most certainly wanted every single \npenny to come our way.\n  It is ludicrous to think these oil companies, which last year wrote \nchecks to the Federal Government for $2.8 billion according to our \nroyalty valuation, would flinch at writing another check for $60 \nmillion.\n  Sixty million dollars is not a lot of money compared to $2.8 billion. \nThey are not intentionally underpaying.\n  The rules we have set up, like many rules we write, unfortunately--\nour tax rules--are complicated. Lawyers and accountants can look at the \nsame rule and come up with different ideas about what it says or what \nit means or how much you owe. That is all this is.\n  The oil companies are looking for--and I believe they are right--a \nsimpler way. I was not here 3 years ago, but the year before I came, \nthere was a bill which was passed that was to have made the rule more \nsimple and more transparent in relation to what was owed in terms of \nrents and royalties and severance for those who dealt in Federal \nwaters. We passed that law overwhelmingly. The rule was created and \ndeveloped by the Department of Minerals Management.\n  Unfortunately, the rule they are proposing is not going to work. It \ndoes not make the current system more simple. It, in fact, makes it \nmore complicated. It is not going to get us out of court. It is going \nto keep us in court and litigation.\n  I think the vote is going to be very close. The honorable Senator \nfrom California has a different view. She has stated on the floor that \nshe thinks the oil companies are intentionally underpaying, although \nthere has not been one lawsuit, to my knowledge, filed that has claimed \n``intentional'' underpayment. The claimed underpayment is based on an \nhonest disagreement of what the rules and regulations say and how these \npayments should be calculated, which is very complicated, as the \nSenator from Oklahoma, who is quite knowledgeable and quite an expert \nin this area, has shared on this floor.\n  In conclusion, I am the lead author of a bill to put every single \npenny we can get from these oil royalties into the U.S. Treasury. The \nbill I have, with 21 other Senators, proposes a good way to spend that \nmoney. So I do not want to see us shortchanged at all. But I also think \nthat going forward with this rule, which makes it more complicated, \nwill not meet that end; it will only make it worse. It will keep us \nfrom redirecting these revenues, at least the full amount of them, the \nway we know we can.\n\n  So I urge, when we vote next week, to vote with the Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison, to keep this rule as a work-in-progress until we \ncan come up with a simple way to get this done. I will be voting that \nway and urge my colleagues to also.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10715-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KOREAN ADOPTEES\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I feel compelled to say something about \na special group of people. There is a wonderful gathering of people in \nWashington. As you know, we have hundreds and thousands of people who \ncome every week to Washington. We cannot come to the floor to talk \nabout every group that comes to Washington because then we would be on \nthe floor for a long time.\n  But there is a very special group in Washington, and it is a group of \n400 Korean American, American Korean adults who were adopted from Korea \nin the 1950s and 1960s.\n  I will read from a wonderful article that appeared in USA Today \nyesterday about one particular orphan and her experience. But I want to \nsay how proud I am, as cochair of the Adoption Caucus, to host, with \nmany Members of this body, this gathering of Americans who have come, \nactually, from all over the world--it is not just Korean adoptees from \nAmerica but from Europe and other places who were adopted out of \nKorea--to share their stories.\n  This is one story by war orphan No. 1371. She is a writer for USA \nToday at this time in her life. She writes:\n\n       Malnutrition and a bacterial infection had drawn all but 8 \n     pounds from my 24-inch frame. My thick black hair teemed with \n     lice; my body glistened with circles of fresh infection \n     created by oozing sores that covered 80% of my body.\n       Yet somehow I survived. Less than two months later, I was \n     packed onto a shiny airliner with 96 other Korean children--\n     four to a wicker basket--and carried to my adoptive parents, \n     Dominic and Dorothy Enrico, in southern California.\n       At that moment I suffered what now seems like \n     incomprehensible losses for one so young: my birth family, my \n     country and the comfortable anonymity of growing up among \n     people of the same race. What I gained was the opportunity to \n     participate in an international adoption revolution that \n     continues to be a testimony to the human potential for love \n     and acceptance regardless of blood ties, race or ethnicity.\n\n  This young woman will join 400 other adults who have had this \nexperience. And there have been over 140,000 young people--infants and \nyoung children and teenagers--adopted from Korea, and many of them have \ncome to the United States. In almost every instance, it has been a \nhappy and joyful experience for the adoptee and for the family.\n  The Korean adoptions have opened up a new thought in America: that \nfamilies could be made of a people who looked different--because love \ndoes not know a color; love does not know family bounds.\n  So because of the great work of the Government and Catholic Charities \nand many others that have made this possible, we now have families in \nAmerica that look very different with family members who love others \nfrom different parts of the world and from different races. It is a \ntestimony to the greatness of the human potential for love and for \ncompanionship.\n  I am proud to sponsor this group of adults. We hope to continue the \nwork of international adoption. We would like to find a home for every \nchild in the world in the country in which they were born. But if there \nis not a home there--if no one wants them, if they are not able to find \na home--then we need to find them a home somewhere in the world.\n  Senator Jessie Helms, an adoptive father himself, which a lot of \npeople do not know--he and his wife adopted a special needs child, so \nhe has personal experience in adoption--is the lead sponsor of a \ntremendous piece of legislation that is going to lay an international \nframework, a legal framework, so children from all over the world, \nincluding the United States, can find a home and they will not have to \ngrow up infested with lice or they will not have to have a little body \noozing with sores, so they will have a mother and a father, preferably \ntwo parents. But if we could find one caring adult for each child in \nthe world, that is our hope.\n  So that is one of the great gatherings that is taking place. I wanted \nto honor them by reading from that article this morning and by wishing \nthem a wonderful conference at the J.W. Marriott. We will be hosting a \nreception for them in the Capitol later today.\n  I invite my colleagues to drop by and see for themselves the great \nmiracle of adoption.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10716-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S10716]]\n           TRIBUTE TO JIMMIE DAVIS OF BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of Senator Breaux and \nmyself to take note of the 100th birthday of one of Louisiana's \nfavorite sons and one of our Nation's finest talents. Most Americans \nknow Jimmie Davis through his world-famous song, ``You Are My \nSunshine,'' one of the most popular songs in the history of recorded \nmusic. However, for Louisianians, Jimmie Davis is much more than a \nconsummate entertainer and southern gentleman, he also helped lead \nLouisiana's government to new heights, passing the first retirement \nbenefits for State employees, the first reforestation legislation and \nthe first program to give free milk to school children.\n  Jimmie Davis has been a college teacher, shaken hands with five or \nsix Presidents, appeared in half a dozen movies, performed with stars \nsuch as Gene Autry, Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley, and twice was \nelected Governor of Louisiana.\n  During his second term as Governor, the State's economy was in a \ndownward spiral. However, by the end of his term, employment was higher \nthan ever, personal incomes were up, school teachers saw their full \nsalary schedule implemented and the ambitious Toledo Bend Dam was \nstarted.\n  Jimmie Davis is widely known as a beloved and colorful leader. One \nday on the way to his office, he rode his horse up the Capitol steps, \ninto the elevator and into his office. He ended every State legislative \nsession with his band's rendition of ``It Makes No Difference Now.''\n  Jimmie Davis is truly a Louisiana State treasure and a treasure for \nall Americans. He definitely is our sunshine.\n  He is a man whom we all hope we can be like, because he is, as I say, \ncelebrating his 100th birthday. So with those of us who hope to live to \nbe 100, Jimmie Davis is a good example of how to do it.\n  Jimmie Davis still loves to sing to this day, and if Majority Leader \nLott would encourage him, he would probably join the Senate singing \ngroup because he is still quite active.\n  Governor Jimmie Davis is one of Louisiana's favorite sons.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at the end of July, beginning of \nAugust, the Congress, in an almost unprecedented fashion and with \nspeed, passed a very significant tax relief bill in Washington. It has \nbeen the subject of much discussion and debate.\n  We could not find very accurate descriptions of this tax proposal, \nand so Senators and House Members who believed in tax relief went home, \nand for the last month they have held 500, 700 town halls. They have \nbeen throughout the country describing what the tax proposal actually \nis.\n  I remember being in a small city in the northern part of my State, \nRome, GA, and saying, so far, I had read very little that adequately \ndescribed what the totality of the tax proposal was.\n  I have just come from a press conference in the Senate gallery with \nHouse and Senate Members. I was taken by the fact that of the six or \nseven Members there, they all spoke of this mischaracterization they \nwere struggling with when they initially got home. It was characterized \nas a very large tax bill that would disrupt Social Security and \nMedicare. There was very little understanding of the proposal, which is \nthis: It is proposed that over the next 10 years, there will be some $3 \ntrillion in surpluses.\n  Now, these surpluses are a product of the fact that over the last 4 \nyears, a majority of the U.S. Congress has argued for balanced budgets \nand for financial constraint. That has produced a very positive economy \nand, indeed, we are now seeing these numbers that suggest there could \nbe up to $3 trillion in surplus over the next 10 years. Well, what are \nWashington policymakers going to do about it?\n  At the end of July, the Congress passed this proposal. It said we \nwould take 60 percent of all the surpluses and set it aside for Social \nSecurity. It would either be used for Social Security reform or to pay \ndown debt. It assigned 17 percent of all these surpluses to Medicare, \neducation, and domestic priorities to make sure that we keep Medicare \nsound and whole. It takes 23 percent of the surpluses and returns it to \nAmerican workers--23 percent.\n  Now, Chairman Greenspan of the Federal Reserve is quoted all the time \non this. He said this is what he would do with it. If he had his first \nchoice, he would pay down the debt. Sixty percent of our proposal does \nthat. He said his second choice would be tax relief. Twenty-three \npercent of our proposal does that. He said the last thing he would do \nwould be to spend it; don't spend it, and even this proposal spends 17 \npercent of it.\n  So the debate we are having is over whether or not 23 percent of \nthose surpluses should be returned to American workers or left in \nWashington to be spent. As Americans have understood this proposal, \nthey have begun, in increasing numbers, to support it. A majority of \nAmericans now believe the President should sign the tax relief \nproposal. I don't know if that will compel him to do so, but America \nhas begun to understand that this is a very balanced, reasoned plan.\n  Why do we think this is so important? American workers today are \npaying the highest taxes they have paid since World War II. I will \nrepeat that. American workers are paying at the highest tax level they \nhave paid since World War II. About half of their paychecks are \nconsumed by a government at some level--local, State, and Federal. I \nhave said this before. If Thomas Jefferson were here today, he would \nfaint; and when he woke up, he would be very mad that we had ever come \nto a point that government was taking half of what labor produces. That \nis what we face today.\n  Economic opportunity is a fundamental component of what makes \nAmerican liberty work. It is a fact that Americans have had economic \nindependence and they have turned into a people who are so bold, so \nvisionary, so entrepreneurial, and so confident. We are a very \nconfident people. It goes all the way back to the Revolution. American \nworkers at that time were already the highest paid workers in the \nworld. Since that time, we have seen what happens to a people who have \ntheir own independence. We must never take that away from the American \npsyche and culture. If we do, we will threaten the way American liberty \nhas worked.\n  Therefore, this tax relief proposal is not some disjointed political \nventure. This tax relief proposal is instrumental in the nurturing of \none of the fundamental principles of American liberty, i.e., economic \nindependence. There is not a day in this town--and I have been here a \nlittle over 6 years, about the same time as the Presiding Officer--that \nsomebody hasn't bemoaned the fact that there was something American \nfamilies needed or ought to do that they can't: They don't have enough \ninsurance, or some of them don't have any; they don't have enough \nhousing; they don't have enough to pursue the educational purposes they \nseek.\n\n  If the government is taking half of the resources away from them, are \nwe surprised and shocked that these families don't have enough to \naccomplish the fundamental goals they seek, that they can't pay the \ninsurance premiums? If the government would leave the money with the \npersons who earned it, they could solve those problems.\n  There is not a wizard, wonk, or bureaucrat in this city who can more \nappropriately determine what a family\n\n[[Page S10717]]\n\nneeds to keep itself whole and healthy than the family itself. \nTherefore, there is no public policy that is more important than \nnurturing the economic liberty and keeping the checking accounts of \nAmerican workers healthy so they can do what they have done for the \nlast two-plus centuries.\n  Economic liberty is a fundamental component of American culture. That \nis what this tax relief proposal is about. It is about making sure more \nof those resources stay in those checking accounts.\n  When you take too much out of those checking accounts--which we have \nbeen historically doing now for about three decades-plus--you change \nthe way Americans function. We are not who we are because of our genes. \nWe are who we are because we have been free. When you reduce the \nresources American families have, you start seeing things you don't \nlike to see.\n  Let me give you a couple of examples. This year, for the first time \nsince the Great Depression, workers in the United States--our workers--\nwill have a negative savings rate. What is left to save after the \nGovernment marches through the checking account?\n  If an average family in America is making $50,000 or $55,000 a year, \nand you take half of it away, is there enough left to get the job done? \nThe answer is no. So there is nothing to save. So when there is a \ncrisis, there is no ability to respond to it or to prepare adequately \nfor retirement. If you leave the resources in those checking accounts, \nyou will see the savings go up. They will have the resources to do the \nkinds of things they are supposed to do, including saving for problems \nor retirement.\n  Here is another one. Bankruptcies are at an all-time high. Credit \ncard debt is at an all-time high. There are not enough resources in the \nchecking accounts and so the behavior of these families begins to move \nin directions that are not as appropriate. That is going to continue as \nlong as we continue to press and constrain and take too much out of the \ncheck of an American worker, an American family, and an American \nbusiness.\n  I see that the distinguished Senator from Idaho has arrived. I don't \nwant to infringe upon his time. I will yield the floor. Under the \nprevious order, each of us has up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10717-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10717-S10718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TAXES\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for coming \nto the floor this morning and asking his colleagues to come with him to \ndiscuss what is one of the most fundamental arguments and debates this \nSenate has had, and that is the debate over taxes and how much our \ngovernment should rightfully take from the American worker and the \nAmerican family to fund and finance the services of government.\n  When I first came to Congress in 1981, we were rapidly spending into \ndeficit, and I said at that time my goal would be to balance the \nFederal budget.\n  I well remember that some of the old-timers who had been in Congress \nthen for 30 or 40 years laughingly said, ``Not in your lifetime, young \nman.'' ``Not in your lifetime.'' They also repeated that it really \nwasn't in the character of our Government or in the good of the Nation \nthat we should ever balance the Federal budget and that deficit \nspending was appropriate and right for Government to stimulate the \neconomy. I was of a different school of thought, as were many.\n  In the early 1980s, I joined with Democrat and Republican who agreed \nwith me to introduce balanced budget amendments and to begin to educate \nAmericans that balancing the Federal budget--the annual operating \nbudget and keeping it balanced--would reap this country great \ndividends.\n  If you can flash back to the early 1980s, it was also at a time when \nour deficits were building in the Federal Reserve. At that time, Paul \nVolcker was saying to us: If you will get your fiscal house in order \nand I can get my monetary house in order, and we can keep them in \nbalance, we can diminish inflation, lower our interest rates, and cause \na tremendous economic growth in our economy.\n  Congress in those early days chose not to listen. We continued to \ndeficit spend. Paul Volcker, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, basically \ntook it on himself, as did the Federal Reserve, to kill inflation in \nthis economy. It was a very costly task. It threw thousands and \nthousands of people out of work. It bankrupted small companies. It \ndestroyed farming and ranching communities. It was a devastating thing \nto do. But it happened.\n  Some of us have already forgotten 21 percent interest rates at one \npoint and high levels of unemployment. Why? Because the fiscal and \nmonetary policy of this Nation's Government was out of sync. We \ncontinued to deficit spend. We continued to mount those deficits until \n1994. The American people said enough is enough, and we will listen to \na conservative Republican Congress, and we want you to balance the \nbudget. So they changed our country significantly by electing a more \nconservative Republican majority in Congress. The rest of the story is, \nwhile difficult at times, quite simple; that is, we balanced the \nbudget. We did so by restricting the growth of spending at a time when \nnew technologies in our economy were exploding on the scene. The \neconomy and the fiscal policy and monetary policy began to go into \nbalance. We have seen the most phenomenal economic renaissance \nliterally in the history of this country, if not the history of the \nworld.\n  Our economy today drags the rest of the world's economies with it. \nOur workforce has never had more options, generally speaking, and \nopportunity for employment in the history of our country, except, as \nthe Senator from Georgia knows, in rural agricultural communities and \nsome of our resource-based communities where agricultural policy or \nGovernment policy is not in sync at this moment, and where we have a \nunique phenomena around the world such that our biotechnology has \nexpanded around the world to the point of creating tremendous surplus \nbecause of the balanced budget.\n  Because of the fiscally responsible Congress, we are now experiencing \nthe politics of surplus--not deficit but surplus. The politics of that \nsurplus is really quite simple. For those who like to spend, they lick \ntheir chops and rub their hands and say, look at all we can do more \nthan we are doing for the American people.\n  For those of us who really believe we are doing enough and that the \nAmerican people best know, as the Senator from Georgia said, where and \nhow to spend their money on their families, the politics of surplus is \nthe opportunity to reward the American people for their wisdom in \nrequiring their Government to balance its budget and to return to the \nAmerican family the money that is rightfully theirs in the reality that \nwe are, in fact, overtaxing the American workforce for the amount of \nmoney necessary to run Government.\n  We knew coming to this session of Congress that what we wanted to do \nfor the American workforce and the American taxpayer in returning to \nthem their money would be a difficult task at best. The first sounding \nof the alarm came with the President's State of the Union Message when \nhe not only proposed in a time of surplus 80-some new spending programs \nbut even proposed a tax increase. I mean, my goodness, Bill. We are \ntalking about potentially hundreds of billions of dollars of surplus \nand the argument is that we are probably overtaxing the American people \nand you want more money and you want to tax more. That really was the \nbeginning of the battle that we have engaged in for about 7 long \nmonths.\n  It was also quite obvious from the very beginning this President \nwould have an ally. That ally would be the liberal press that, from the \nvery beginning, was always asking people such as me and the Senator \nfrom Georgia: Well, but what about the President's position? Don't you \nthink that is the right position?\n  In essence, they were saying: My goodness, you are surely not going \nto give back this money when you can spend it on all of these programs.\n  Here is how all of that refines itself into headlines. I was \nfascinated by it.\n  In February, I asked the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan \nGreenspan, who all of us respect greatly, to come to speak to the \nRepublican policy luncheon. He said: What do you want me to speak \nabout? Quite simply, I want to ask you one question: What do you do \nwith surplus? Alan Greenspan came. And he said: Let me suggest that\n\n[[Page S10718]]\n\nyou reduce marginal rates, you pay down debt, ``but, most importantly, \nyou don't spend it.''\n  ``Most importantly, you don't spend it.''\n  He said the reason is quite simple. Don't send a message to the \neconomy of this country that you are going to lift the caps and start \nspending money. He said it will be a most negative message because the \navailable resources of this country are now dedicated to growth and job \ncreation in the private marketplace. And if you suggest that you are \ngoing to increasingly take more of it and spend it in Government, you \nwill send a more negative signal. Don't do it.\n  Before the August recess, after we had shaped a tax bill and we were \nin the final days of debating it and getting ready to send it to the \nPresident, the headlines in the papers were ``Alan Greenspan not in \nfavor of tax cut.''\n  The reason I use that example is because it typifies what we knew \nvery early on--that we have many enemies out there as did the taxpayers \nhave in pushing this message. Enemy No. 1, Bill Clinton; No. 2, a \ncollective press that would not fairly write to the American people the \nbroad base of this argument.\n  Let me tell you what Alan Greenspan said that extrapolated itself \ninto headlines as ``not in favor of tax cut.'' He said, and I am not \ngoing to extrapolate; I am going to quote:\n\n       My first priority, if I were given such a priority, is to \n     let the surplus run. As I have said before, my second \n     priority is if you find that as a consequence of those \n     surpluses they tend to be spent--\n\n  In other words, Alan Greenspan is consistent with February and late \nJuly--\n\n       Then I would be more in the camp of cutting taxes because \n     the least desirable is using those surpluses to expand \n     outlays or to spend.\n\n  Greenspan continued:\n\n       I give great sympathy to those who wish to cut taxes now to \n     preempt that process, and, indeed, if it turns out that they \n     are right then I would say moving on the tax front makes a \n     good deal of sense to me.\n\n  Do you know that Alan Greenspan is right? Already the forces of the \nidea that the President will veto this package are at hand saying: Can \nwe have another $10, $15, or $20 billion?\n  Can we have all of the surplus that will be generated out of the \ngeneral fund and spend it because the priorities are so important?\n  If we send a signal to the American economy, and Bill Clinton helps \nit with a veto of this tax bill that will go to him next Tuesday, that \nwe are turning on the spending machine, I am not so sure that a year or \ntwo from now we will see near zero unemployment in our country; we will \nsee the vibrant economy; we will see the investment capital; we will \nsee the job creation that has given the American people more reason for \noptimism than anything we have done or we could do as a government in \nthe last good many decades.\n  I am suggesting what the Republican Congress has done in proposing a \nvery broad-based tax cut is responsible, consistent with our economy, \nfair, and it is intended to help people. It is intended to say to the \nAmerican family: Taxpayers are entitled to more than 50 percent of what \nthey earn, to save, to invest, to buy a new home or a car, to do what \nis truly a part of the American dream; and that is to not consistently \nhave government take away more of it. That has always been the great \nenergy of our society.\n  After Alan Greenspan was at the policy committee, I asked him about \nthis phenomenon in the stock market and this high-tech economy. I said: \nHow do you read this one, Mr. Greenspan? He said: I am not sure I can, \nother than to say the genius of the American people turned loose in a \nprivate marketplace is beyond imagination.\n  Today we have seen that genius simply because we have reduced the \nlevel of intensity of government upon that genius. And we want to \nreduce it a little more. Of all the surplus moneys that will come \nrolling into government over the next 10 years, we are saying, for \nevery dollar, we only want to give one quarter of it back--not all of \nit, one quarter of every dollar. Three quarters of it stays in \ngovernment to shore up Social Security, to reform Social Security, to \nprotect new and future Social Security recipients, to spend a little in \nselected areas when we find it necessary.\n  Yet one would think, from listening to folks on the other side of the \naisle, that this tax cut would destroy government as we know it. I \nheard a Democrat Senator the other day say it will destroy all the \nenvironmental programs; it will destroy all the educational programs; \nit will destroy all of the welfare programs. After listening to that, \nmy only thought was: Get a life. Where are you coming from?\n  We are talking surplus moneys, not current moneys. We are talking \nsurplus moneys. We are only talking about giving a quarter of it back \nout of every dollar and keeping three quarters of it to do much of what \nthat Senator was talking about.\n  The reason that Senator was in such an illogical, untruthful panic \nwas that over the August recess Republicans, led by the Senator from \nGeorgia, went home to hold town meetings and press conferences and to \nvisit with our taxpayers and our voters and explain the package. All of \na sudden, the numbers started shifting because the national media \ndidn't have control of the message. All of a sudden, the tax bill moved \nup into the high fifties and sixties as something the American people \nthought was probably the right thing to do. Still frustrated, they want \nthe debt paid down. But when they found out that over the course of the \nlife of this tax bill we pay down about $2 trillion in debt, they said \nthat is fair and reasonable.\n\n  Of course, when agricultural America, where the Senator from Georgia \nand I were visiting with our farmers, saw what we had done for them in \nfarming and in the tax package to help production agriculture, they \nsaid that makes sense, that gives us tools to survive and to be \nproductive.\n  I am absolutely amazed this President blindly, without listening, \nreading, or sensing the character of the American people, but only the \npolitics of his party, says ``veto'' from day 1, ``veto'' from day 2, \n``veto'' from day 3, instead of saying we have an opportunity to keep \nthis economy growing to allow the private sector to thrive, to hold \ndown the influence of government over the private sector, and, most \nimportantly, allow the American family to pursue its dream.\n  That is what this tax package is all about. It is all about the right \nthings. It is about fairness, responsibility, helping people, and \ncontrolling government.\n  I thank my colleague from Georgia for his leadership in this area, \nfor helping send the messages out unfettered, clear and simple, to the \nAmerican people so they can make up their own minds. They are making up \ntheir minds. It is very clear to me where they come down. They come \ndown on the ``no spending'' side, and they come down on the side of \nsplitting the differences between a tax cut and paying down the debt. \nThat is right and responsible. I hope the President will listen as that \nbill comes to him this coming week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have a series of requests that I will \nneed to make. I have notified the Democratic leadership that we will be \nmaking these requests, and I believe Senator Dorgan is here to respond \nand perhaps comment on them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10718-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10718-S10720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--MESSAGE ACCOMPANYING S. 1437\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Chair lay before \nthe Senate a message from the House to accompany S. 1437, the FAA \nreauthorization. I further ask consent the Senate disagree to the \namendments of the House, agree to the request for a conference with the \nHouse, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of \nthe Senate.\n  Before the question is put, I do want to say the FAA reauthorization \nis a very important piece of legislation, obviously. It never seems to \nbe easy getting it through the Congress. I remember in 1996 it was the \nlast bill that we\n\n[[Page S10719]]\n\npassed of the session, and it took an extra week of the session to get \nit through. Now we find, after a lot of work involving issues all the \nway from safety and improvements in airports and questions of slots at \nvarious airports--New York, Chicago, as well as what to do with Reagan \nNational Airport--the Senate has developed what I think is a good bill. \nThe House has passed a bill, but it has provisions in it that are of \ngreat concern to the chairman of the committee in the Senate and the \nchairman of the Budget Committee. So there are, once again, \ncomplications.\n  Because of the need to stay on the appropriations bills and fulfill \nour commitments, it is very difficult to schedule a lengthy debate on \nFAA reauthorization. I have spoken to Senator Daschle and said: Is \nthere some way we can work out an agreement to perhaps bring it up in a \nshort period of time so we get it done, even in the midst of all the \nappropriations bills? The other option is to go straight to conference \nwith the bill the Senate Commerce Committee reported and the bill the \nHouse has reported. That is what this would attempt to do so we could \nmove on with the process.\n  That effort was made during the latter part of July. We thought we \nhad it cleared a couple of times, and then we ran into objections. I do \nhave a list of proposed conferees who would come both from the Commerce \nCommittee and from another committee that is interested in this, the \nTransportation Appropriations Committee, I believe, Senator Shelby; and \nBudget, Senators Domenici and Grassley, and of course their \ncounterparts from the Democratic side.\n  I make that unanimous consent request at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nobject on behalf of Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader. But before \ndoing so, I would like to point out the Senate passed S. 1467, which is \na 60-day extension of the airport grant program. We have dealt with \nthis issue of the reauthorization act for some long while.\n  In fact, in the Commerce Committee on which I and the majority leader \nboth serve, we have passed S. 82. It has been waiting to be brought to \nthe floor of the Senate for debate. The process that is described by \nSenator Lott would, in effect, prohibit Senators from debating this \nissue on the floor of the Senate. Because the House passes an omnibus \nbill and attaches it to the 60-day extension, the Senate does not have \nthe opportunity to debate. It means people who have amendments they \nwould like to offer, perhaps, to the bill that we wrote in the Commerce \nCommittee will not have that opportunity. This will then be decided in \nconference. That is not appropriate and not something we could agree \nto.\n  But I do want to say, and I expect the majority leader probably \ndisagrees, this process has been abysmal. We have a system in this \ncountry with radical expansion of the number of people flying. The FAA \nis an organization that desperately needs some assistance and some \npredictability and consistency with a reauthorization they can count \non. We should have done this long ago. Passing 60-day extensions \ndoesn't serve anybody's interest.\n  Several days on the floor of the Senate would resolve this from the \nstandpoint of the larger reauthorization bill and move this process \nforward. I will be forced to object to the unanimous consent request \nfor those reasons, the request offered by the majority leader. I do so \nobject, and then I would like to offer a unanimous consent request on a \ndifferent way to accomplish the same result. But I object to the \nunanimous consent request by the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might ask the majority leader for the opportunity to \noffer a unanimous consent request?\n  I ask consent the Senate disagree to the House amendments so the \nmessage on this bill can be returned to the House this afternoon. That \nwould enable the House to recede from its amendment and send S. 1467, \nthe short-term extension bill the Senate passed on August 2, to the \nPresident immediately for his signature. This would ensure this process \nwould continue, local airports would be able to receive the estimated \n$290 million in funds due through the end of this fiscal year, and do \nthat until the Senate has had an opportunity to consider the FAA \nreauthorization bill. We should do that. Senators have that right. It \nought to be a priority. I hope we can accomplish that. I make this in \nthe form of a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would have to object at this time. \nHowever, I find some interest in the offer. But I would need to consult \nwith the chairman and the ranking member and make sure all Senators are \naware of that. I have a number of Senators who have put me on notice, \non both sides of the aisle, that before we agree to a further, or some \nother, agreement or unanimous consent, they would want to be notified. \nI know Senator Fitzgerald of Illinois was one of those. I believe one \nof the New York Senators had notified me to that effect also. So we \nwould need to clear it with a number of people.\n  I personally think the 60-day extension is the way to go and that is \nwhy I supported the 60-day extension before we went out. We had not \nbeen able to resolve the scheduling problems or resolve the substance \nof the issues, and while we were doing that, I thought the responsible \nthing to do was the 60-day extension, and I will continue to advance \nthe need for that. Unfortunately, the House didn't agree with that and \nthey took our 60-day extension and attached their bill to it and sent \nit back, which, in effect, meant that we did not have the extension \nbecause this was the final couple of days of the July recess.\n\n  There are disagreements on how to resolve the FAA reauthorization. I \nnoted we had a similar disagreement over a very narrow point back in \n1996 and the whole session was delayed an extra week because Senator \nKennedy had a point that he was concerned about. But we got it done, \nand I am determined we are going to get it done this time.\n  I must say to the Senator, if I could create an extra 10 days in a \nmonth, I would probably do that because it is very hard to accommodate \nwhat we must do and accommodate agreements that are reached so we can \nhave not 1 week but 2 weeks of debate on a juvenile justice bill. We \nfind many of our bills are taking longer because Senators offer 100 \namendments or a whole variety of things.\n  I am determined to get this done and I will continue to work with the \nchairmen and the ranking members on both sides of the aisle, in both \nHouses, and I will be pursuing the 60-day extension. I will get back to \nthe Democratic leadership about how we proceed with that.\n  Again, I note I did talk to Senator Daschle about trying to come up \nwith an agreement on a process where we could deal with this, even with \nthe limited time we have before us.\n  Mr. DORGAN. May I make just one comment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Further reserving the right to object, I yield to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I observe on March 8 the Commerce Committee took action \non S. 82, which is the reauthorization of the FAA. So we have had a \nsubstantial amount of time elapse. I think the Senator from Mississippi \nagrees with me that the number of people using the aviation system in \nthis country has expanded dramatically. The capacity is being \nsubstantially taxed in many ways, and we really do need to pass a \nreauthorization bill. It is critically important that we get at this \nbusiness. I respect the difficulty of time that a majority leader has \nto deal with, but this is a big issue, the issue of safety and \nprotecting the system by which we have an aviation transportation \nsystem in our country, one that we are very proud of but one that \ndesperately is waiting for and needs a reauthorization bill passed by \nthe Senate. We ought to have the opportunity to debate that in the \nSenate, get to conference, and we ought to make this a priority.\n  Mr. LOTT. Further reserving the right to object, if Senators will \nshow up, we can have work on Mondays and Fridays. If we do not have \nobjection to having a full day's work, such as this\n\n[[Page S10720]]\n\ncoming Monday, we can get more done. But I should note also, \ntransportation in general is important. Roads and ports and harbors, \nAmtrak, railroads, airlines--it is all important.\n  Yet, just yesterday, the Democrats insisted on blocking a maneuver to \nget to consideration of the Transportation appropriations bill. They \nthreatened to filibuster because they did not like one provision in the \nTransportation appropriations bill that will benefit two States, that \naffects two States. Therefore, we could not invoke cloture on the \nTransportation appropriations bill.\n  I agree, air safety is important but so is road safety. My father was \nkilled on an unsafe, narrow, two-lane highway. I get very excited and \ndetermined when it comes to transportation, whether it is an \nappropriations bill or transportation in general, and FAA \nreauthorization. I hope we can find a way to work together to move both \nthese bills. I am committed to that.\n  I object.\n  I will move to the next request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10720-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S.J.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nobject on behalf of Senator Daschle. I observe that Senator Daschle and \nSenator Lott had conversations about the specific language in the \nproposal. My understanding is there are meetings, in fact, scheduled \nmidday today to review the language. I expect there may be some \nopportunity to come to some common understanding on language that will \nbe acceptable. There has been no such agreement at this point. While \nthese discussions are ongoing, on behalf of Senator Daschle, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of Senator Dorgan \nwith regard to the possibility of trying to work out some language on \nwhich there can be agreement. Even though I will proceed to file a \ncloture motion, if we can come up with some language that expresses the \noutrage of the American people and the feelings of the Senate on both \nsides of the aisle, we will withdraw that cloture motion and will go to \nthe vote.\n  I note that just yesterday the House of Representatives debated a \nresolution on this issue. Over 300 voted for the resolution expressing \ncriticism of this clemency; 41 or so voted no; 70 voted ``present,'' \nwhich I think is a very curious thing. I do not recall the last time I \nhave seen as many as 70 vote ``present.'' The House has shown \nleadership in this area in a bipartisan way.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will note also this is an unusual \nprocedure. Let me just explain. We are on the Interior appropriations \nbill. There is an amendment pending. Because the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, is concerned she may lose on a vote on the \namendment, it is being filibustered, or there is the threat of a \nfilibuster. I think that is unusual.\n  We do have disagreements sometimes on how to proceed to a bill or \nwhether or not to even take up a bill, but it is a little unusual to \nhave this occur on an individual amendment.\n  Senator Daschle and I quite often talk about how we prefer not to do \nthis sort of thing to each other, at least on amendments. What we try \nto accommodate each other on is a debate, vote, somebody wins, somebody \nloses, and we move on. Sometimes individual Senators can exercise their \nright, and they have that right.\n  I hope we will not get into a pattern of doing this. It will make an \nalready cumbersome process even more difficult to complete important \nwork. The Interior appropriations bill, as all appropriations bills, is \nvery important for our country. It has a lot of important provisions, \nall the way from parks to land management, that we need to get \ncompleted. We certainly will work to do that, and that is why I filed \nthis cloture motion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10720-4", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10720-S10723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now\n\n[[Page S10721]]\n\nproceed to a period for morning business, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not object, \nbut I would like to make a couple of inquiries of the majority leader.\n  I ask the majority leader about the issue of scheduling the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty for debate in the Senate. While I have \nasked that, let me make an observation. The majority leader just \ndescribed the difficulties the leadership has, both the majority leader \nand the minority leader, in scheduling business before the Senate. I \nrespect that. I do not think he is crying wolf. It is a difficult \nproblem.\n  I once saw a juggler juggle a potato chip, a bowling ball, and a \nchain saw that was running. It occurred to me that one was light, one \nwas heavy, and one was dangerous. That is probably the kind of juggling \nact Senator Lott and Senator Daschle are required to do weekly and \nmonthly.\n  The distinction of understanding what is light and heavy and what is \ndangerous, for that matter, is a very important distinction. Let me \ndescribe something I think is very heavy in terms of a public issue and \npublic policy. That is the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty signed by 152 \ncountries and sent to this Senate 718 days ago without one hearing.\n  I believe so strongly--and I know the Senator from Mississippi knows \nI spoke earlier this week on the floor about it --that we have a \nresponsibility to provide leadership in the world on the issue of \nnonproliferation of nuclear weapons. This treaty is a baby step in that \ndirection.\n  So far, we have not been able to get even 1 day of hearings on this \ntreaty. I believe very strongly that this is one of those heavy public \npolicy issues which is important for our country and important for the \nworld. I want very much to have some assurance that we are going to \nhave an opportunity to debate and vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty at some point.\n  I inquire of the majority leader where we are with respect to that \ntreaty, why we have not been able to have hearings, and when we might \nexpect some action on the floor of the Senate with respect to the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, first of all, I emphasize, obviously this is \na very important issue. I think it is an extremely dangerous issue in a \ndangerous time. We see now uncertainty with regard to Russia and their \neconomic condition and what is happening with loans that have been made \nto them I guess through the IMF. We are concerned about their \ncontinuing nuclear capability. So it is an uncertain time. They have \nnot ratified SALT II in the Duma of Russia.  And we have not determined \nwhat we are going to do about revisiting the ABM Treaty.\n\n  I talked to the President's National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, \nthis past week about that event. I believe very strongly we are going \nto have to take another look at the ABM Treaty.\n  Then, in addition to that, you have the very dangerous situation with \nIraq. In today's newspaper, we have an indication that Iran may have \nthe capability to deliver nuclear weapons beyond what most people are \naware. And there is the ``scary,'' I believe is the way it was \ndescribed in the newspaper today, situation with regard to North Korea.\n  The countries that have signed that treaty, for the most part, are \ncountries that do not have nuclear capability, so they are perfectly \nhappy to sign it. But when you look at Russia, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, \nPakistan, and India, the world is still very dangerous.\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has indicated very \nstrongly there are a number of treaties that are necessarily tied \ntogether; what is going to be the situation with regard to the ABM \nTreaty; what is the situation with regard to Kyoto, the global warming \nissue; and the third leg of this stool is the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty.\n  I think the chairman has indicated he is willing to get into these \nthree areas. He will be taking a look at hearings. I have encouraged \nhim to do so, but I think everybody needs to understand that it would \ninvolve all three of these issues. And they are going to be dealt with.\n  I commend for the reading of the Senate today's editorial page \narticle by Charles Krauthammer. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthat article be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Washington Post, September 10, 1999]\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n                       A Test Ban That Disarms Us\n\n       When it comes to nuclear testing, nations will act in their \n     perceived self-interest.\n       Some debates just never go away. The Clinton administration \n     is back again pressing Congress for passage of the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). This is part of a \n     final-legacy push that includes a Middle East peace for just-\n     in-time delivery by September 2000.\n       The argument for the test ban is that it will prevent \n     nuclear proliferation. If countries cannot test nukes, they \n     will not build them because they won't know if they work. \n     Ratifying the CTBT is supposed to close the testing option \n     for would-be nuclear powers.\n       We sign. They desist. How exactly does this work?\n       As a Washington Post editorial explains, one of the ways to \n     ``induce would-be proliferators to get off the nuclear \n     track'' is ``if the nuclear powers showed themselves ready to \n     accept some increasing part of the discipline they are \n     calling on non-nuclear others to accept.'' The power of \n     example of the greatest nuclear country is expected to induce \n     other countries to follow suit.\n       History has not been kind to this argument. The most \n     dramatic counterexamples, of course, are rogue states such as \n     North Korea, Iraq and Iran. They don't sign treaties and, \n     even when they do, they set out to break them clandestinely \n     from the first day. Moral suasion does not sway them.\n       More interesting is the case of friendly countries such as \n     India and Pakistan. They are exactly the kind of countries \n     whose nuclear ambitions the American example of restraint is \n     supposed to mollify.\n       Well, then. The United States has not exploded a nuclear \n     bomb either above or below ground since 1992. In 1993, \n     President Clinton made it official by declaring a total \n     moratorium on U.S. testing. Then last year, India and \n     Pakistan went ahead and exploded a series of nuclear bombs. \n     So much for moral suasion. Why did they do it? Because of \n     this obvious, if inconvenient, truth: Nuclear weapons are the \n     supreme military asset. Not that they necessarily will be \n     used in warfare. But their very possession transforms the \n     geopolitical status of the possessor. The possessor acquires \n     not just aggressive power but, even more important, a \n     deterrent capacity as well.\n       Ask yourself: Would we have launched the Persian Gulf War \n     if Iraq had been bristling with nukes?\n       This truth is easy for Americans to forget because we have \n     so much conventional strength that our nuclear forces appear \n     superfluous, even vestigial. Lesser countries, however, \n     recognize the political and diplomatic power conveyed by \n     nuclear weapons.\n       They want the nuclear option. For good reason. And they \n     will not forgo it because they are moved by the moral example \n     of the United States. Nations follow their interests, not \n     norms.\n       Okay, say the test ban advocates. If not swayed by American \n     example, they will be swayed by the penalties for breaking an \n     international norm.\n       What penalties? China exploded test after test until it had \n     satisfied itself that its arsenal was in good shape, then \n     quit in 1996. India and Pakistan broke both the norm on \n     nuclear testing and nonproliferation. North Korea openly \n     flouted the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n       Were any of these countries sanctioned? North Korea was \n     actually rewarded with enormous diplomatic and financial \n     inducements--including billions of dollars in fuel and food \n     aid--to act nice. India and Pakistan got slapped on the wrist \n     for a couple of months.\n       That's it. Why? Because these countries are either too \n     important (India) or too scary (North Korea). Despite our \n     pretensions, for America too, interests trump norms.\n       Whether the United States signs a ban on nuclear testing \n     will not affect the course of proliferation. But it will \n     affect the nuclear status of the United States.\n       In the absence of testing, the American nuclear arsenal, \n     the most sophisticated on the globe and thus the most in need \n     of testing to ensure its safety and reliability, will degrade \n     over time. As its reliability declines, it become unusable. \n     For the United States, the unintended effect of a test ban is \n     gradual disarmament.\n       Well, maybe not so unintended. For the more extreme \n     advocates of the test ban, nonproliferation is the ostensible \n     argument, but disarmament is the real objective. The Ban the \n     Bomb and Nuclear Freeze movements have been discredited by \n     history, but their adherents have found a back door. A \n     nuclear test ban is that door, For them, the test ban is part \n     of a larger movement: the war against weapons. It finds \n     expression in such touching and useless exercises as the land \n     mine convention, the biological weapons convention, etc. The \n     test ban, unfortunately, is more than touching and useless. \n     It may actually work--to disarm not the North Koreas of the \n     world but the United States.\n\n\n[[Page S10722]]\n\n\n  Mr. LOTT. It is a very good article. He basically says that the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty is disarmament, unilateral nuclear \ndisarmament by the United States, because we would not be testing our \naging nuclear weapons and saying to the rest of the world: We have been \ngood guys, so we're going to have faith that you're going to be good. I \nam not prepared to put my grandson's future at risk in this way.\n  So that is how I wanted to respond. I do think hearings could be and \nshould be scheduled in a variety of ways. I hope the chairman will be \nworking on that. I will be talking to him about it, one. Two, I do \nthink this is a dangerous time to rush to judgment on such an important \nissue. Three, I do think it is the wrong thing to do. And four, if it \nis called up preemptively, without appropriate consideration and \nthought, it could be defeated.\n  I think that the advocates need to weigh the ramifications and the \nimplications of such an action.\n  So I know the interest of the Senator. I have already talked with him \nabout it. I will be glad to work with him and to work with the chairman \nto see what an appropriate time is and what an appropriate process is \nfor having hearings of these critical areas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Further reserving the right to object, and I shall not \nobject, but I do want to respond to a couple of the comments that were \nmade. We should not rush into this. No one would ever accuse the Senate \nof speeding on an issue such as this--718 days. It is very unusual that \nwe have not had an opportunity to act on this treaty after 718 days \nwithout even 1 day of hearings. So no one will accuse the Senate of \nrushing to judgment on this issue.\n  It is an uncertain and difficult world. That is precisely why it is \nimportant to address this issue. This country has no moral standing, or \nvery little moral suasion to be going to India and Pakistan and saying \nto them: Do not detonate additional nuclear weapons. Sign and ratify \nthis treaty. The fact is Russia and China, and others, wait on us.\n  The majority leader talked about a piece in today's newspaper written \nby Charles Krauthammer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Congressional Record a \nmuch better piece on this same subject that appeared two days ago in \nthe Washington Post in the form of an editorial supporting the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and reserve the right later to ask at \nsome time to include an even better piece that will be in response to \ntoday's Krauthammer article this morning that I and some others will \ntry to write for the Washington Post.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Why a Test Ban Treaty?\n\n       The proposed nuclear test ban treaty has been around so \n     long--for 50 years--and has been so shrouded in political \n     foliage that many people have forgotten just what it entails. \n     The current debate about it centers on the Clinton \n     administration's differences with the Russians on the one \n     hand and with the Republicans on the other. But in fact the \n     appeal of the treaty is a good deal simpler and more powerful \n     than the debate indicates. This treaty would put an end to \n     underground nuclear tests everywhere; tests above ground \n     already are proscribed either by treaty or by political \n     calculation. Its merits shine through.\n       Testing is the principal engine of nuclear proliferation. \n     Without tests, a would-be nuclear power cannot be sure enough \n     the thing would work to employ it as a reliable military and \n     political instrument. Leaving open the testing option means \n     leaving open the proliferation option--the very definition of \n     instability. The United States, which enjoys immense global \n     nuclear advantage, can only be the loser as additional \n     countries go nuclear or extend their nuclear reach. The \n     aspiring nuclear powers, whether they are anti-American rogue \n     states or friendly-to-America parties to regional disputes, \n     sow danger and uncertainty across a global landscape. No \n     nation possibly can gain more than we do from universal \n     acceptance of a test ban that helps close off others' \n     options.\n       At the moment, the treaty is hung up in the Senate by \n     Republicans desiring to use it as a hostage for a national \n     missile defense of their particular design. This is curious. \n     The obstructionists pride themselves in believing American \n     power to be the core of American security. Why then do they \n     support a test ban holdup that multiplies the mischief and \n     menace of proliferators and directly erodes American power? \n     The idea has spread that Americans must choose between a test \n     ban treaty and a missile defense. The idea is false. These \n     are two aspects of a single American security program, the \n     one being a first resort to restrain others' nuclear \n     ambitions and the other a last resort to limit the damage if \n     all else fails. No reasonable person would want to cast one \n     of these away, least of all over details of missile program \n     design. Those in the Senate who are forcing an either-or \n     choice owe it to the country to explain why we cannot employ \n     them both.\n       The old bugaboo of verification has arisen in the current \n     debate. There is no harm in conceding that verification of \n     low-yield tests might not be 100 percent. But the reasonable \n     measure of these things always has been whether the evasion \n     would make a difference. The answer has to be that cheating \n     so slight as to be undetectable by one or another American \n     intelligence means would not make much difference at all.\n       The trump card of those who believe the United States \n     should maintain a testing option is that computer \n     calculations alone cannot provide the degree of certitude \n     about the reliability of weapons in the American stockpile \n     that would prudently allow us to forgo tests. This is a \n     matter of continuing contention among the specialists. But \n     what seems to us much less in contention is the proposition \n     that, given American technological prowess, the risk of \n     weapons rotting in the American stockpile has got to be a \n     good deal less than the risk that other countries will test \n     their way to nuclear status.\n       The core question of proliferation remains what will induce \n     would-be proliferators to get off the nuclear track. \n     Certainly a ``mere'' signature on a piece of paper would not \n     stay the hand of a country driven by extreme nuclear fear or \n     ambition. Two things, however, could make a difference. One \n     is if the nuclear powers showed themselves ready to accept \n     some increasing part of the discipline they are calling on \n     non-nuclear others to accept, so that the treaty could not be \n     dismissed as punitive and discriminatory. The other is that \n     when you embrace the test ban and related restraints on \n     chemical and biological weapons, you are joining a global \n     order in which those who play by the agreed rules enjoy ever-\n     widening benefits and privileges and those who do not are \n     left out and behind.\n       President Clinton signed the test ban treaty, and achieving \n     Senate ratification is one of his prime foreign policy goals. \n     More important, ratification would make the world a safer \n     place for the United States. Much still has to be worked out \n     with the Republicans and the Russians, but that is detail \n     work. The larger gain is now within American reach.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I guess I heard the majority leader indicate the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty is tied up with several other treaties, \nand he equated it to a stool that has a bunch of legs to it--at lease \nthree legs. But I say this: this is not a stool and not legs that \nconnect. There is no connection between the Kyoto treaty and the \nComprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. The U.S. has already decided we \nare not testing nuclear weapons. We have not tested since the early \n1990s.\n  I would love to have a long debate about this. I feel strongly that \nthe treaty is needed in order to prevent others from testing and in \norder to prevent others from believing they have acquired nuclear \nweapons that work, because you cannot believe they work unless you have \ntested them. If we have a regime in which the world decides, through \nleadership from this country and others, that it will not test nuclear \nweapons any longer, we will have taken a step to prevent the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  We can have that debate and should have that debate. But we have not \neven had the first day of hearings. What I heard the Senator from \nMississippi say, I think, is that he has encouraged the chairman of the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations to hold hearings, to hold hearings on \nthis treaty.\n  The reason I ask the question is I don't want to add to your \nburdens--you have plenty--but I indicated earlier this week I certainly \nwill be prepared to add to your burdens and the burdens of Senator \nDaschle when you try to schedule this place because this is one of \nthose heavy issues, important issues. We ought to have the opportunity \nto consider this issue as a Senate.\n  So I ask the Senator from Mississippi, will we be able to expect \nhearings will be held in the Foreign Relations Committee on this \nsubject, and, if so, when?\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond, who has the time now? Is \nthis under a reservation?\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, at least Dr. Charles Krauthammer signed his \neditorial. We do not know who wrote the editorial in the Washington \nPost. But I would be willing to guess that Dr. Krauthammer knows more \nabout the subject than whoever at the White House wrote the article for \nthe Washington Post editorial page.\n\n[[Page S10723]]\n\n  If we want to compare capabilities and knowledge, I would be glad to \nget into that. I put my money with Krauthammer against anybody who \nwrites an editorial in the Washington Post.\n  Having said that, I have done what I can do at this point in terms of \nsuggesting that hearings be in order.\n  Mr. DORGAN. You have suggested.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have suggested that to the chairman. He has indicated, \nwhile he understands and will be working toward that, he has these \nother issues into which he wants hearings.\n  But I expect next week to get some feel from him exactly what the \nschedule would be. When I do talk to him, which will be, I presume, \nearly next week, I will be glad to get back to Senator Dorgan and give \nhim that information.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate that.\n  Let me say I have great respect for the chairman of the committee. We \nmight have disagreements about the policy, but he is the chairman. I \nhave respect for him and in no way denigrate his efforts and his \nbeliefs on these issues.\n  This is a very controversial matter but very important and one I \nbelieve the Senate ought to be entitled to debate. Based on the \nmajority leader's response, I will look forward to further discussing \nwith him next week.\n  Let me say I appreciate the fact he has initiated an effort to ask \nthat we have some hearings held in the Senate. I think that is \nmovement, and that is exactly what should happen.\n  Mr. LOTT. I cannot wait to hear how Jim Schlesinger describes the \nCTBT treaty. When he gets through damning it, they may not want more \nhearings.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. Schlesinger will be standing in a mighty small crowd. \nMost of the folks who are supporting this treaty are the folks who \nSenator Lott and I have the greatest respect for who have served this \ncountry as Republicans and Democrats, and military policy analysts for \nthree or four decades, going back to President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the time just consumed during \nthe leader's presentation of consent items not count against the \nCoverdell morning business time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I want to talk about the tax cut. But \nI can't help but comment, if only very briefly, about the fact that \nsome of the terrorists pardoned by the President are schedule to be \nreleased today. They were imprisoned for up to 90 years in response to \nthe convictions that were achieved following some 130 bombings in \nAmerica--the worst terrorist assault in the history of the United \nStates.\n  We are told by the White House that fighting terrorism is a No. 1 \npriority. But obviously it is not as important as politics.  It is \noutrageous that at a time when the greatest national security threat \nfacing America is terrorism, that the President of the United States is \npardoning radical Puerto Rican nationalists who helped carry out the \nworst wave of terrorist violence in the history of our country. I think \nit sends a terrible signal.\n\n  I notice the President was saying yesterday that among those who had \nrecommended to him that he pardon these terrorists was former President \nJimmy Carter. What an interesting paradox it is that this wave of \nterrorism, in fact, increased in intensity after then-President Carter \npardoned the terrorists who were in prison as a result of an attempt to \nkill President Truman and were in prison as a result of a shooting in \nthe Chamber of the House of Representatives where Members of Congress \nwere wounded. Those acts of violence were perpetrated in the name of \nthe same cause as that espoused by the terrorists who have now been \ngranted clemency by President Clinton.\n  I don't know how long it will take President Carter and President \nClinton to understand that terrorism is a threat to America and to \nevery American. When you pardon terrorists, you lower the cost for \ncommitting terrorist acts.\n  Our Democrat colleagues have objected for the second time to a simple \nresolution that condemns the President's actions in pardoning these \nconvicted terrorists. I don't know whether they intend to vote no or \nwhether they intend to vote present, but I don't think there is much \nconfusion. You either believe the President ought to be pardoning these \nconvicted terrorists, or you believe he shouldn't. I wish our Democrat \ncolleagues would let the Senate state its opinion on this important \nsubject as the House did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10723-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10723-S10725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE TAX ISSUE IN PERSPECTIVE\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, turning to the whole tax issue, I would \nlike to try to set it in perspective. Our President is a master of \ndefining an issue in such a way as to induce the public to support his \nposition. One of his secrets is, he doesn't always tell the truth. So I \nwill try to set this in perspective by trying to define why we believe \nthere should be a tax cut and then outlining the two options that we \nactually face.\n  I have several charts that I think will speed the process along. The \nfirst chart shows the 7 years in American history where the tax burden \non the American people has been highest. Interestingly enough, the \nhighest tax burden in American history, as one might expect, was under \nPresident Truman in 1945. National defense was taking 38 cents out of \nevery dollar earned by every American as we were winning World War II.\n  The second highest tax burden in American history is the tax burden \nwe'll have on Oct. 1. That tax burden is occurring, by the way, when \nnational defense is taking only about 3 cents out of every dollar \nearned by every American.\n  The third highest tax burden we have ever had in American history is \nright now under President Clinton. The fourth highest tax burden \noccurred last year under President Clinton. The fifth highest occurred \nin 1944 under President Roosevelt. National defense spending was 38 \npercent of the national economy.\n  The sixth highest tax level was in 1997, under President Clinton, and \nthe seventh highest tax level was the day President Reagan became \nPresident. As we all know, soon after his inauguration, we set about an \neffort, a successful effort, to cut taxes 25 percent across the board.\n  If you look at these 7 years, you will see that we are facing the \nsecond highest tax burden on working Americans in the history of the \nUnited States and we have never, except during World War II and under \nPresident Clinton, faced tax burdens that approached this level, the \nonly one that was close was the year that we initiated the 1981 tax \ncut.\n  As to my second point, while the President continues to talk about \nhow risky and dangerous it is to let working Americans keep  more of \nwhat they earn and why we shouldn't repeal the marriage tax penalty and \nthe death tax, the reality is as shown in this chart, which shows three \ncircumstances.\n\n  First, it shows the tax burden the day President Clinton came into \noffice. The day President Clinton became President, the Federal \nGovernment was taking 17.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every \nAmerican. Today, the Federal Government is taking 20.6 cents out of \nevery dollar earned by every American.\n  If we adopted a tax cut that took the entire non-Social Security \nsurplus,--and our tax cut is significantly less than the entire non-\nSocial Security surplus because we have finally reached an agreement, \nwhich the President initially opposed but finally was shamed into \naccepting, that we will not spend the Social Security surplus. But if \nyou took the whole non-Social Security surplus and gave it back in tax \ncuts, the tax burden, when that tax cut was fully implemented, would be \n18.8 cents out of every dollar earned by every American, which is still \nsubstantially above the tax burden that existed the day Bill Clinton \nbecame President. So the adoption of our\n\n[[Page S10724]]\n\nsmaller tax cut and its full implementation would still mean that \nduring the Clinton Presidency, the tax burden on the American people \nrose dramatically.\n  A final chart has to do with the part of the story that President \nClinton is not telling the American people. President Clinton, \ninterestingly, has it both ways. He says: Don't cut taxes; let's pay \ndown the debt. Then he says: But if you cut taxes--Senator Domenici has \nheard this; Senator Nickles has heard this--if you do cut taxes, it \nwill jeopardize all these spending programs.\n  I ask my colleagues: If the President's plan is to use the revenues \nthat we are not using to cut taxes and instead pay down debt, why does \nthat jeopardize spending programs? How is that possible? What the \nPresident is doing, interestingly enough, is he is getting credit with \nsome Americans for saying let's pay down the debt. He is getting credit \nwith other Americans for saying let me spend it, and in an incredible \nparadox, he can have it both ways.\n  But facts are stubborn things, and they don't lie. It is hard to \ncover up facts. I want to remind my colleagues, using the final chart \nhere, that earlier this year, in fact on July 21, the Congressional \nBudget Office, which is the nonpartisan budgeting arm of Congress, \nlooked at the President's budget and asked the question: How much does \nit propose to spend and how much would it pay down debt?\n  What the Congressional Budget Office found is that over the next 10 \nyears, the President is proposing spending a net new $1 trillion 33 \nbillion. The President, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nis proposing to spend every penny of the non-Social Security surplus, \nplus spend part of the Social Security surplus.\n  So when the President says: Don't give this money back to working \nAmericans in tax cuts, let's pay down the debt, he is saying something \nthat does not comport with his own budget because the reality is, the \nPresident's own budget calls for spending every penny of this surplus \non some 81 Government programs.\n  The reality we face is that the President, as he outlined in the \nState of the Union, has set out some 81 Government programs on which he \nwants to spend this non-Social Security surplus and part of the Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  The real choice is not do you want to buy down debt or do you want to \ngive a tax cut to working Americans. The real choice is, do you want to \nspend this surplus on 81 Government programs, or do you want to give \nthe money back to the American taxpayers.\n  If I could run the Government by myself, or if the Presiding Officer \nand I could run the Federal Government, I know exactly what we would \ndo. We would take every penny of the surplus and we would pay down the \ndebt. We would wait until after the election--I am no longer speaking \nfor the Presiding Officer but for myself; I believe my Governor is \ngoing to be elected President--and then we would set about doing a real \ntax cut.\n  The only reason I supported cutting taxes now is we are spending this \nsurplus as fast as we can spend it, and I am worried that it will be \ngone on 81 new Government programs before we can have an election and \nelect a new President and address this issue again.\n  So if it were up to me, I would do what President Clinton claims he \nis doing but something he is not doing; that is, I would stay with the \nspending caps which have already been broken. I would draw the absolute \nline and not let a penny of Social Security money be plundered. The \nPresident is already proposing to plunder it and is going to veto \nappropriation bills this year because we don't plunder Social Security \nmoney. Remember I made that prediction. I will remind you when it \nhappens.\n  So basically the proof of what I am saying is the following: When the \nPresident talks about his budget paying down debt and says our plan \ndoes not pay down as much debt, the truth is, when the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office looked at our tax cut, our budget, and \nlooked at the President's budget, CBO found that the President's \nbudget, for the next 10 years, actually pays down $219 billion less in \nthe debt that we owe as a nation than the Republican budget does even \nwith our tax cut.\n  Now, how is that possible? It is possible because the President \nproposes to spend $1.33 trillion on new spending programs, which is the \nentire non-Social Security surplus, plus part of Social Security money. \nSo that is the real choice. I think what the American people need to \nthink about next week when the President vetoes the tax bill is they \nneed to look at those 81 Government programs, and they need to look at \nour tax cut. Look at the 81 Government programs the President wants to \nexpand, or create and then look at our tax cut and decide which would \nbenefit their family more. I think if they benefit more from the \nGovernment spending, they ought to support the President and they ought \nto vote for a Democrat for President and Democrats to control Congress. \nBut if they believe they can spend their money better than the \nGovernment can spend it for them, I think they ought to vote for a \nRepublican President and for Republican Members of Congress.\n  Lest anybody has forgotten, let me conclude by simply going over what \nour tax cut does. Our tax cut repeals the marriage tax penalty. As many \nAmericans are aware, because a married couple has a lower standard \ndeduction than two single individuals, and since a married couple gets \ninto the 28-percent tax bracket quicker than two single individuals, \nthe average American couple actually pays the Federal Government $1,400 \na year for the privilege of being married.\n  Now, as I like to point out, I want to make it clear that my wife is \nworth $1,400 a year--a bargain at the price. But I think she ought to \nget the money and not the Government.\n  So that is the first thing our tax change does. It eliminates the \nmarriage tax penalty. Now, marriage may not be for everybody, but it is \nthe most powerful institution for human happiness and progress in \nhistory. I think having a Tax Code that discriminates against people \nwho get married is a bad mistake and ought to be corrected.\n  The second thing we do is lower tax rates. We lower each individual \nbracket by 1 percent, so that every person in that bracket is taxed 1 \npercentage point less. If you are being taxed at 15 percent, we lower \nit to 14. If it is 28 percent, we lower it to 27. If it is 31 percent, \nwe lower it to 30.\n  We repeal the death tax. We believe when Americans work a lifetime to \nbuild up a business, to build up a farm, and they pay taxes on every \npenny they earn, and then they invest their aftertax money in building \nup a family business or family farm, it is wrong for the Government to \nforce their children to sell that business or that farm in order to \ngive Government up to 55 cents out of every dollar that they built up \nin that farm or business in their working life.\n  I know we have Democrat colleagues who say, well, some rich people \nwill benefit. That may be true. But this tax is wrong. It is not right. \nIt is double taxation, and it is very harmful to force children to sell \noff farms and businesses to give the Government taxes when somebody \ndies. It is not right when your parents die that the first official \ncontact you get from the Government is from the Internal Revenue \nService, in essence, telling you that the lifetime work of your parents \nhas to be sold off to give the Government up to 55 cents out of every \ndollar that they have earned and set aside in their lives. It is not \nright.\n  Another provision of our bill is that we make health insurance tax \ndeductible for the self-employed and for those people who work for \ncompanies that don't provide health insurance. Why should health \ninsurance be tax deductible for General Motors but not for Joe Brown? \nWe think that is discrimination. We think everybody ought to be treated \nthe same.\n  Now, my final point. You have heard our Democrat colleagues and our \nPresident say that the Republican tax cut is unfair. Normally, what \nthey mean in saying it is unfair is something like: Do you realize that \nabout 30 percent of Americans will get no tax cut from the Republican \ntax cut? You hear that and you say that doesn't sound right. But what \nthey never point out is, roughly 30 percent of American families pay no \ntaxes. We are talking about cutting income taxes, and about a third of \nAmerican families pay no income tax.\n  Let me tell you how I feel about this. Taxes are for taxpayers. Tax \ncuts are\n\n[[Page S10725]]\n\nfor taxpayers. Everybody doesn't get Medicaid. Everybody doesn't get \nMedicare. Everybody doesn't get food stamps. Everybody doesn't get \nwelfare. You have to qualify for those programs by either paying money \nin, in the case of Medicare, or being poor, in the case of Medicaid, \nfood stamps, and welfare.\n  Republicans feel very strongly that tax cuts are for taxpayers. If \nyou don't pay taxes, you don't qualify for a tax cut. That brings me to \nthe final point I want to make. Some people say, well, maybe there \ncould be a compromise between Congress and the President. Let me tell \nyou why there can't and why there is not going to be. It looks as if \nthe President has proposed a $300 billion tax cut, we have proposed \nalmost $800 billion, and there is $500 billion between us. So it \ndoesn't take a genius to figure out you could end up somewhere in the \nmiddle.\n  Let me tell you why it is not going to happen. When the Congressional \nBudget Office looked at the President's tax plan, they found $245 \nbillion for USA accounts and concluded that it actually increases \nspending by $95 billion, net, over 10 years. Basically the President's \ntax cut is a set of subsidies that are given to people who by and large \ndo not pay taxes, so that it is really an expenditure instead of a tax \ncut.\n\n  Instead of being $500 billion apart, the plain truth is, we are \ncloser to $1 trillion apart. I think in this case, rather than fool \naround in trying to find some midpoint between minus $95 billion, which \nis a tax increase of $95 billion, and an $800 billion tax cut, the best \nthing to do when the President vetoes the tax cut is to let the veto \nstand. We don't have the votes to override the veto. The best thing to \ndo is to take it to the American voters and let the voters decide in \nNovember of next year what they want.\n  I don't think at this point that a compromise can be worked out. I \nthink basically we are going to have to make a decision as to what we \nwant. That is how democracy works. You make a decision when the \nAmerican people go to the polls. I think on this tax cut we are not \ngoing to find a middle ground. I think we are going to have to let the \nAmerican people move the middle ground in the election.\n  But I think there is something we have to do. I want to stay with the \nspending caps. It is clear now, when you count all the emergency \nspending, much of which is not emergency, when you get into all of the \nbookkeeping gimmicks that ultimately will be used, that we are not \ngoing to stay within the spending caps, that we are going to spend \nbeyond those caps. I am sorry about that. I think it is a mistake.\n  But there is one barrier we have not yet broken. It is a barrier \nwhere I believe, when the President vetoes the tax bill, we have to \ndraw the line. We have to draw the line in saying, Mr. President, we \ncan't make you give this money back to the American people but we can \nstop you from spending the Social Security surplus.\n  I hope Republicans will have courage enough to stand up and say no to \nany proposal that takes the Social Security surplus, plunders it, and \nspends it on general government. I can tell you that I intend to stand \nby that position. I am hopeful that Republicans in the Senate and the \nHouse will stand by it. It is not going to be easy.\n  Our appropriators in both the House and the Senate and the President \ntell us that unless we spend vast amounts of additional money, the \nworld is going to come to an end in one of a variety of ways.\n  I think the time has basically come to say to the President that we \ncan't make you cut taxes but we can stop you from spending this money.\n  That is what we want to do.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

Mr. President, I know the Senator from Maine is waiting \nto speak on the floor. Let me just take 2 or 3 minutes. I will be \nmercifully brief. I wanted to make a couple of comments, however, \nbefore we discontinue this session for the week, especially in light of \nthe comments that were just made by my distinguished colleague from \nTexas.\n  We have returned from an August recess in which most of us spent a \ngreat deal of time in our home States around America talking to our \nconstituents about their hopes and their dreams and their aspirations.\n  One of the things I found in North Dakota is that people believe very \nstrongly that if this country is blessed with better economic times--\nand we certainly have had good economic times in recent years--that \nproduce a budget surplus, we ought to as a country decide to use a \nsignificant part of that surplus to reduce the Federal debt. If during \nbad economic times you increase the Federal debt, during good economic \ntimes you ought to reduce the Federal debt.\n\n  We have a $5.7 trillion Federal debt. We have been very fortunate to \neliminate the yearly Federal budget deficit, but we still have this \ndebt that we have run up as a country over many years. It seems to me \nthat one of the best thing for America's future to use some of the \nexpected future surplus to reduce this debt.\n  But it is important in the context of a discussion of the type we \njust heard about tax cuts to understand the following: There is not yet \na surplus. There are only economists who estimate in the next 10 years \nwe will have a surplus. These are economists who don't know what will \nhappen in the future. They do not have the foggiest notion. They are \ngiving us an educated guess.\n  Prior to the last recession in America, 35 of the 40 leading \neconomists said in the next year we will have sustained economic \ngrowth. In fact, almost all of the leading economists were wrong. The \nnext year we had a recession.\n  A friend of my mine described the field of economics as psychology \npumped up with a little helium. That is probably a pretty good \ndescription. I, in fact, taught economics for a couple of years. \nEconomists are telling us that we will have 10 years of economic good \ntimes and therefore very large budget surpluses. On that basis, we have \npeople in this Congress who say: Well, if that is the case, let us \nenact a very sizable tax cut.\n  So the Congress enacted a $792 billion tax cut over 10 years, this \ndespite the fact that we don't yet have a budget surplus, we only have \nprojections of budget surpluses.\n  I voted against the $792 billion proposed tax cut. It is, in my \njudgment, unwise to cut taxes and therefore decrease revenues when we \ndon't have actual surpluses, only projections. There is plenty of time \nin the future to deal with surpluses, if in fact they exist. And if we \ncan't agree on how to deal with them and the best of all worlds will \noccur, it will mean that the Federal debt is reduced because Congress \ndoesn't decide what else to do with the surplus.\n  It is interesting that with all of this discussion in August back \nhome around the country, I think most Members of the Senate discovered \nthat their constituents believed that to rush to propose a very sizable \ntax cut with only an economic projection over the next 10 years was not \na very thoughtful or appropriate way to deal with this country's fiscal \npolicy.\n  We have had good fiscal policy in this country that has given some \npeople the confidence that we are doing the right things. Almost 7 \nyears ago, we had an enormous annual Federal budget deficit. It was \n$290 billion, and it was growing. Now it is gone. Why? Because this \nCongress had the courage to say we are not going to put up with that \nanymore. We are going to change direction and strategy. And we did. We \nhad a vote. By one vote in the Senate, we changed this country's fiscal \npolicy. It was a tough vote and a political vote. An easy vote would \nhave been to say: Don't count me in on that. It actually raised taxes \non income for some folks. Don't count me in on that. That is unpopular. \nWell, count me in. I voted for it. I am proud that I did. It was the \nright thing. This country was on the wrong track.\n  We changed the approach to fiscal policy and said to the American \npeople that we were willing to do tough things. We were willing to make \ntough decisions. Guess what happened. The American people, I think as a \nresult, have more confidence in the future. This entire economy rests \non the mattress of confidence. If they are confident, they do certain \nthings. If they are confident, they buy a car, they buy a home, they \ntake a vacation, and do\n\n[[Page S10726]]\n\nthe kind of things that move this economy along. If they are not \nconfident about the future, they decide not to make those decisions, \nthey decide to withhold this purchase, or that purchase, and it affects \nthe economy.\n  What we did about 7 years ago dramatically changed the fiscal policy \nof this country. This country has had unprecedented economic expansion, \nand a huge and growing Federal budget deficit is now eliminated.\n  What remains is the Federal debt that occurred from all of those \nyears of spending. The question is, What should we do about that? The \nanswer for many in this Senate who voted to pass a tax cut was to say \nwhat we should do about that is essentially ignore that; let's provide \na very large tax cut right now just based on projections by economists \nwho often cannot even remember their home address. That is not good \npolicy. I am pleased that I voted against it.\n  I think most Americans believe that the right approach for this \nCongress is to continue on this path we are on of good solid fiscal \npolicy, believing that if and when we have true, good economic times \nand significant budget surpluses, a major part of that ought to be used \nto reduce the Federal debt. What greater gift can we give to America's \nchildren than to eliminate the Federal debt of $5.7 trillion?\n\n  Let me thank my colleague from Maine. She has been most patient.

Mr. President, I rise today on an issue of the utmost \nimportance to Vermonters. I recently returned from a wonderful month in \nmy home State of Vermont. I visited farms and downtowns, talked to \nteachers, parents, and business men and women from all over our State, \nand enjoyed the beautiful Vermont summer. However, as I and countless \nof Americans know, nothing compares to Vermont in all of its autumn \nglory. I would like to read the following proclamation, that I received \nwhen I was visiting the picturesque town of Stowe, VT:\n\n                 Vermont Foliage Challenge Proclamation\n\n       Inasmuch as Vermont is acknowledged throughout the known \n     universe to be the home of the most spectacular fall foliage.\n       And inasmuch as certain ill informed media reports have \n     implied that Vermont's legendary foliage display this year \n     may be less spectacular than usual.\n       And inasmuch as Vermont's fall foliage display is always \n     the best and brightest on this planet or any other.\n       We, of the Green Mountain State, hereby issue a challenge, \n     open to all Senators, to wit:\n       That as of twelve noon on October 1, 1999, the fall foliage \n     in Vermont will be the most colorful, most spectacular, and \n     most photogenic of any venue on Earth.\n       And inasmuch as any challenge worth issuing deserves to be \n     honored with a prize, we of the Green Mountain State hereby \n     offer as proof of our challenge the quality of ten gallons of \n     last spring's Vermont's finest Grade A Fancy Maple Syrup from \n     Nebraska Knoll Sugar Farm of Stowe, Vermont, to be collected \n     in Stowe.\n       Respectfully tendered, the Stowe Area Association.\n\n  I don't know about where you come from, but 10 gallons of Vermont \nFancy Maple Syrup are worth their weight in gold! I would like to see \nanyone try and meet that challenge.\n  From Bennington to Derby Line, from Fair Haven to St. Johnsbury, in \nthe months of September and October Vermont's Green Mountains become a \npainter's palette of rich colors. Nothing refreshes the soul as we head \ninto the cold winter months like the invigorating rush one gets from a \nvisit to Vermont when she is decked out in prime foliage.\n  The brisk autumn weather and the breathtaking beauty of nature's fall \ncanvass are unparalled anywhere in the 50 States, or even anywhere in \nthe world. Come see for yourself.\n  Mr. President, before I came to the Chamber, I received word that my \nesteemed colleague from the State of New York, Senator Schumer, has \nrisen to the Vermont Foliage Challenge. Senator Schumer has offered 10 \ngallons of New York apple cider to our 10 gallons of Vermont Maple \nSyrup, stating that the foliage in the Empire State ``will outshine the \nchallenging leaves found in Vermont during this and every October.'' \nAnybody who has looked at apple leaves in the fall and maple leaves in \nthe fall realizes there is no way to compare them. I am sure he was not \nreferring to that. I am delighted to hear that the challenge has been \naccepted, and I am looking forward to enjoying a nice, tall, cold glass \nof New York apple cider later in the fall. I would like to mention that \n10 gallons of maple syrup is not quite comparable to 10 gallons of \napple cider, especially considering that it takes 40 gallons of sap to \nmake 1 gallon of maple syrup. But this evens the odds, as it is about a \nmillion-to-one chance that Vermont will come out on the short end of \nthe stick in this wager.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Schumer, who I think probably has some insecurity \nin making this challenge, whisked off to New York and is unable to be \nhere to give his statement. But to acknowledge his courage in accepting \nthe challenge, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Schumer's statement \nbe printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today my esteemed colleague from \nVermont stood in praise of the beauty of his fine State during the fall \nseason. Nothing, he argued, could compare with the sight of the Green \nMountain State's autumnal foliage. To that end, he reported a challenge \nissued by his fine constituents in Stowe; that on October 1 of this \nyear, the changing leaves of Vermont would reign supreme.\n  I represent a contender to this challenge whose autumn beauty is \ndestined to win any comparison with its bright flying colors of yellow, \nred, and orange. I am proud to represent the State of New York in this \nSenate, the Empire State, whose foliage will outshine the changing \nleaves found in Vermont during this and every October.\n  New York's fall splendor has been captured by a wide variety of \nartists, from the landscape painters of the Hudson River School to the \nsoulful jazz of Vernon Duke's ``Autumn in New York.'' I point to such \nrepresentations as proof of our superiority in this venue, and invite \nany skeptics to visit the Empire State themselves. They will enjoy the \nbreathtaking grandeur of the Catskills, or happily succumb to the \npeaceful serenity of an autumn day's drive along Interstate 87 in the \nAdirondack Mountains. From our wineries to our apple orchards, nothing \ncan compare to the glory of Upstate New York in the fall.\n  In fact, speaking of apples, I recall that my esteemed Vermont \ncolleague brought a prize to the table from which he issued his \nchallenge. To the State possessing the finest foliage on the first of \nOctober, he said, would go 10 gallons of Vermont Fancy Maple Syrup. Mr. \nPresident, it is only appropriate that the Empire State bring its own \nprize to this competition. To that end, I hereby offer as proof of our \ngreatness 10 gallons of New York's finest apple cider, gleaned from the \n25 million bushels produced by the Empire State every year. After all, \nwhile maple syrup is truly a product of Vermont's spring rejuvenation, \napple cider is evidence of the glory of New York's fine fall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10726-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10726-S10728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THERE IS NO SURPLUS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, yesterday the Republican majority \ncontinued to try and create a strategy to embarrass President Clinton \nand those Members of Congress that opposed the so-called tax-cut bill. \nI found their strategy quite ironic that while this country is less \nthan 20 days away from the end of a fiscal year when the U.S. \nGovernment will spend more than $100 billion than it takes in that the \nRepublicans are insisting on giving tax\n\n[[Page S10727]]\n\nbreaks to the rich that the country cannot afford.\n  William Greider, a former assistant managing editor of the Washington \nPost and now National Editor for Rolling Stone, explains the issue of \nthe phantom surplus very well in an article headlined ``The Surplus \nFallacy.''\n  Mr. Greider has done a great job in explaining that there is no \nsurplus, there is no money to give a tax break with, and more \nimportantly, this country spends more than it takes in each year. I \nthink this article should be required reading for any Member of \nCongress that has to vote on a federal budget in the next two months so \nthey may understand where this country really stands fiscally.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          The Surplus Fallacy\n\n                          (By William Greider)\n\n       Leaders of both parties are gleefully finding ways to spend \n     3 trillion extra tax dollars. The only problem is, the money \n     doesn't exist.\n       Fanciful claims and sly deception are common enough in \n     Washington politics, but this season, the level of gross \n     falsification on the question of the governorment's budget \n     surpluses--which were discovered this year--is awesome and \n     ominously bipartisan. It's as if the politicians, wearied by \n     nearly two decades of fighting horrendous deficits, are \n     deranged by the notion that at long last they have some loose \n     money to throw around.\n       Republicans swiftly proposed giving some of this supposed \n     windfall back to the people, but their $792 billion tax-cut \n     bill, passed in early August, actually delivers most of the \n     boodle to the very rich and to major corporations. President \n     Clinton, claiming the high ground of fiscal responsibility, \n     is certain to veto the GOP measure, yet he and the Democrats \n     have their own worthy plans for spending the extra money or \n     perhaps bargaining for a smaller tax cut.\n       One big idea animates both political parties: The federal \n     government, they tell us, will amass surplus revenues during \n     the next ten years totaling nearly $3 trillion--that is, $3 \n     trillion more will come in than be spent. Roughly two-thirds \n     of this will accumulate from Social Security payroll taxes, \n     but the other $1 trillion in surpluses is projected for the \n     government's general operating budget, which is made up of \n     personal and corporate income-tax revenues. This happy \n     prospect reflects the robust economy--more people working and \n     paying taxes--and the long campaign to contain the growth of \n     federal spending.\n       Even in Washington, $3 trillion is serious money. The air \n     is thick with self-congratulation. Reduce income-tax rates by \n     a point or two, cut capital gains again and repeal \n     inheritance taxes? No sweat. Increase the military's budget \n     by $40 billion or $60 billion? Let's do it. Suddenly, the \n     political horizon is aglow with feel-good opportunities.\n       Except for this: That one big idea is false. There is no $3 \n     trillion surplus ahead. In fact, the government's gross debt \n     will grow steadily over the next decade. Nor is any large \n     bonanza likely from the operating budget of the government, \n     though Clinton and Congress have made great progress in \n     eliminating the red ink. At the very most, instead of $1 \n     trillion, the operating budget might realistically develop a \n     surplus over ten years of no more than $100 billion or $200 \n     billion. But even that ``surplus'' will be money borrowed \n     from the government's other trust accounts.\n       As conservative commentator Kevin Phillips has noted of the \n     alleged surplus, this is not pie in the sky--it's pie in the \n     stratosphere.\n       Many smart players know better, and some say so aloud, but \n     dissent is brushed aside by that $3 trillion headline. A \n     careful reader of leading newspapers will find sidebar \n     stories explaining why the huge surpluses are far from \n     assured, but conventional wisdom wipes out complicated facts \n     and reasonable doubt. In this media age, mindless buzz shapes \n     the debate, and once the terms are set, both parties scurry \n     to prepare billboard slogans for the next campaign.\n       Both are now playing the politics of dipping into the \n     future--dispensing virtual money that will be available only \n     if Congress also imposes dramatic and continuing pain on many \n     citizens. But why spoil the fun by mentioning reality?\n       Republicans have reverted to the same feel-good assumptions \n     that Ronald Reagan introduced with his economic package back \n     in 1981. Reagan's combination of massive tax cuts and \n     mushrooming defense spending produced the runaway federal \n     deficits in the first place and eventually tripled the \n     national debt. Just when those deficits are finally \n     conquered, the GOP wants to try it all again.\n       The Democrats, meanwhile, have morphed into the party of \n     rectitude, scolding the Republicans for reckless tax \n     giveaways, just as Democrats were always pilloried as big-\n     government spendthrifts. This reversal in party values is \n     potentially significant, because it is really an argument \n     about the size and future of the federal government. If the \n     Democrats hold their ground and win in 2000, it could signal \n     an end to the long era of successful government bashing. If \n     Democrats yield to election-year temptations and join the \n     partying, the federal government may swiftly slide back into \n     an endless swamp of red ink.\n       The other danger is to prosperity. The GOP's reward-the-\n     wealthy tax bill may simply inflate the stock-market bubble \n     further and provide more stimulus to the economy just as \n     the Federal Reserve Board is trying to cool it down. That \n     could set up the same destructive collision between budget \n     policy and monetary policy that marked the Reagan era--the \n     Fed raises interest rates to counter the stimulative tax \n     cuts. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is pleading with his \n     fellow Republicans in Congress: Do nothing, please.\n       Right now, according to various opinion polls, the public \n     thinks the Democrats have got it right. By a margin of \n     twenty-one percent, people want the surpluses to be devoted \n     to ``unmet needs,'' from education to defense, instead of to \n     tax cuts. Among younger voters (between the ages of eighteen \n     and thirty-four) the majority favors applying surplus funds \n     to Medicare rather than to tax cuts, sixty-seven percent to \n     twenty-seven percent.\n       For that matter, half of the public doesn't believe the $3 \n     trillion headlines and doubts that any real surpluses will \n     actually materialize. Their skepticism is well founded.\n       Like any forecast of the distant future, the accuracy of \n     the official projections of vast surpluses depends upon \n     whether the forecasters are using plausible assumptions or \n     massaging the results. In this case, the Congressional Budget \n     Office, controlled by Republicans, and the White House's \n     Office of Management and Budget have produced similar \n     predictions, but both have also applied a self-indulgent \n     political spin on the future, not to mention various \n     accounting gimmicks.\n       The first premise is that the prosperous economy will sail \n     forward more or less uninterrupted. The CBO foresees no \n     recessions in the next ten years nor any dire surprises, like \n     a stock-market meltdown. The OMB assumes that above-average \n     growth in productivity will continue. But economic history \n     suggests that events never cooperate with blue-sky-forever \n     forecasts.\n       More important, the projections assume that while these \n     huge budget surpluses are piling up each year, Congress and \n     future presidents will continue to whack away at the size and \n     scope of the federal government. If deep cuts don't occur, \n     then the surplus in the operating budget shrinks to a mere \n     sliver. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates \n     that if Congress simply maintains spending at its present \n     dimensions--adjusted for inflation but with no real \n     increases--the trillion-dollar surplus will be $112 billion. \n     Nobody knows, of course, but the smaller number looks like \n     a better bet.\n       In fact, CBO and OMB presume an amazing reversal: They \n     claim that Congress will stick to the budget caps adopted in \n     1997 for all regular spending programs, even though those \n     caps have been bent and broken every year since they were put \n     in place. Last year Congress went over the ceilings by $21 \n     billion. This summer it's already over by $30 billion and \n     will likely go higher.\n       ``It's crazy,'' says Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, Ranking \n     Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee. ``The \n     Republicans pretend they're going to make all these budget \n     cuts. They're not going to do that, and they know they're \n     not. We're already $30 billion above the caps this year, \n     because they are stuffing so much defense stuff into the \n     emergency bills. If you assume defense keeps its present \n     share of gross domestic product, the all the rest of \n     government would have to be cut almost in half.''\n       Right now, domestic spending is about $1,100 per capita, \n     Obey explains, but is would fall to $640 per person under the \n     GOP vision and almost as much under Clinton's. If highways \n     and defense are to have growing budgets, as Congress has \n     already decreed, then everything else must get whacked even \n     harder, by at least twenty percent to thirty percent. It's \n     not going to happen, for reasons that are more practical than \n     ideological.\n       ``You can shrink the government,'' Obey says, ``but you \n     ain't going to shrink the country. This country is going to \n     have 20 million more people a decade from now. We will have 1 \n     million more young people in college, we'll have a fifty \n     percent increase in commercial-airline flights, 50 million \n     more people visiting the national parks every year. We have a \n     prosperous economy now because government has always invested \n     in science, in education and technology. Republicans are \n     pretending the country will not respond to any of this in the \n     future, that people would rather have the tax cut. The White \n     House is not nearly as bad, but they are being overly \n     optimistic as well. They're saying we can afford a tax cut of \n     $300 billion. That's true only if you assume government is \n     not going to respond to the growing population and economy.''\n       The Clinton administration nobly intends to ``pay down the \n     public debt'' with the nearly $2 trillion in surpluses that \n     the Social Security trust fund will accumulate during the \n     next decade. The Treasury secretary compares this to \n     refinancing your mortgage to get a lower interest rate, and \n     in theory that may be the result. But Sen. Fritz Hollings, \n     the blunt-spoken Democrat from South Carolina, offers a \n     challenging wager to his colleague in both parties. On \n     October 1st, when the new fiscal year begins, if the federal \n     government's gross debt actually goes\n\n[[Page S10728]]\n\n     down, he will jump off the Capitol dome. And they will jump \n     if it doesn't.\n       ``They claim we are paying down the debt, but that's \n     terribly misleading,'' Hollings complains. ``We are not \n     really paying down the debt, we're shifting it from one \n     account to another. Actually, we're looting the trust \n     funds so we can say the government's got a big surplus. \n     It's just not true.''\n       Hollings' argument takes us still deeper into the mysteries \n     of federal accounting, but he has uncovered an important and \n     widely believed myth about the new surpluses. His essential \n     point is confirmed in the president's own midyear budget \n     review. Its ten-hear projections show the federal government \n     steadily reducing its publicly held debts: the Treasury \n     bonds, notes and bills used to borrow money in financial \n     markets. Yet meanwhile, the federal government's total debt \n     obligations will continue to escalate over the decade--an \n     $485 billion increase by 2009.\n       So what happened to the $3 trillion surplus? It is \n     something of an accounting mirage--like borrowing from the \n     rent money to pay off your credit cards. Sooner or later, you \n     still have to come up with the rent.\n       In fact, aside from Social Security, the government's vast \n     borrowing from its other trust accounts--highways, military \n     and civil-service retirement, Medicare--provides the \n     underpinning for the supposed $1 trillion surplus in its \n     regular operating budget. Without those trust-fund loans, CBO \n     acknowledges, its forecast of a ten-year surplus of $996 \n     billion shrinks to only $250 billion. Someday someone has to \n     come up with that money too--or else stiff those lenders.\n       Social Security surpluses are not new at all: They have \n     been piling up since 1983, when the payroll tax was \n     substantially increased to prevent insolvency. This money \n     belongs to future retirees, not Congress or the White House, \n     but it was not locked away for them. Instead, it was spent \n     every year to cover the swollen deficits generated by the \n     rest of the government--and IOUs were given to the trust \n     fund. The government still owes all that money to the Social \n     Security trust fund, and it intends to borrow lots more.\n       All that is really new is the promise, now that budget \n     deficits are vanishing, that the government will stop using \n     Social Security money to pay its yearly operating costs and \n     instead use it only to pay back the public borrowings in \n     financial markets. That's admirable, but it doesn't pay off \n     the actual debt obligations of the government to Social \n     Security retirees. The Treasury is still giving more IOUs to \n     the trust fund--money it will have to pay back one day hence.\n       Some will insist that because the government is essentially \n     borrowing from itself, none of this matters. But it does. The \n     suggestion that any of Social Security's long-term financial \n     problems are somehow being remedied by these transactions is \n     utter fiction. A nasty day of reckoning remains ahead for \n     American taxpayers--when Social Security recipients expect to \n     get their money back and someone gets stuck with the burden.\n       The choices for a future president and Congress will be \n     stark: They can go back to the financial markets and borrow \n     trillions again. They can raise income taxes. Or they can cut \n     Social Security benefits and screw the retirees.\n       Such duplicitous evasions have prompted an angry Hollings \n     to denounce his colleagues. ``This a shameful sideshow out \n     here,'' he thundered in debate. ``There is no dignity left in \n     the Senate. No responsibility.''\n       Indeed, none of his colleagues has taken up Hollings' \n     proffered bet, though doubtless some of them would love to \n     see him jump off the Capitol dome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10728-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the interim payment system for home health services, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        the fairness in medicare home health access act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Feingold and Chafee in introducing the Fairness in Medicare \nHome Health Access Act of 1999. I am proud to say that the Governing \nBoard of the North Dakota Home Care Association, as well as the \nVisiting Nurse Association of America, have endorsed this legislation \nas a crucial step toward ensuring beneficiaries retain access to vital \nhome care services.\n  As you know, home health care has proven to be an important component \nof the Medicare package because it allows beneficiaries with acute \nneeds to receive care in their home rather than in other settings, such \nas a hospital or nursing home. In my state of North Dakota, home health \ncare has been particularly important because it has allowed seniors \nliving in remote, frontier areas to receive consistent, quality health \ncare without having to travel long distances to the nearest health care \nfacility.\n  Over the last three decades, we have witnessed significant increases \nin home health utilization as medical practices have shifted care from \nan inpatient to outpatient setting. To help address rising health care \nspending, the Congress included targeted measures in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 (BBA) to reduce costs and give providers incentives \nto become more efficient. In particular, the BBA directed the Health \nCare Financing Administration to implement an interim payment system \nfor home health care until which time a prospective payment system \ncould be instituted. While the interim payment system has allowed \nagencies to become more cost-effective, there are also concerns that it \nmay be having some unintended consequences on agencies' ability to \ndeliver quality, appropriate home care services to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, this legislation takes definitive steps to address \nvarious unintended consequences of the interim payment system and of \nthe BBA in general.\n  Home health providers serving rural beneficiaries have been \nparticularly affected by the interim payment system. As you know, home \nhealth care delivery is unique because unlike most other services, the \nhealth care provider must travel to the patient. Compared to urban \nagencies, rural home care providers must travel longer distances to \nserve beneficiaries and they often face poor weather and road \nconditions. Due to these constraints, agencies serving rural \nbeneficiaries must visit patients less frequently; but during an \nisolated visit aides tend to spend more time with beneficiaries to \nensure that they are receiving appropriate levels of care. \nUnfortunately, the per visit limits included in the interim payment \nsystem do not adequately account for the unique challenges of serving \nrural beneficiaries. This legislation revises the per visit cost limit \nto ensure agencies have the resources to deliver care to beneficiaries \nliving in rural and underserved areas.\n  It also appears that the interim payment system does not adequately \naccount for the needs of medically-complex beneficiaries. Various \nreports have\n\n[[Page S10730]]\n\nsuggested that the interim payment system has resulted in restricted \naccess to home health services for high-acuity, high-cost patients. In \na recent survey conducted by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \nnearly 40 percent of agencies reported that they are less likely to \nadmit patients identified as those with long-term or chronic needs. In \naddition, many beneficiary advocates have raised concerns that home \nhealth agencies are denying access to care because they believe \nMedicare will no longer cover the high costs of providing services to \nmedically complex individuals. When it is implemented, the prospective \npayment system will include a measure to account for the treatment of \nmedically-complex beneficiaries. In the interim, this legislation will \nallow agencies to receive more appropriate payments for treating high-\nacuity, high-cost beneficiaries.\n\n  In addition, this legislation includes provisions to further ensure \nhome care agencies have the appropriate resources to serve Medicare \nbeneficiaries. To help slow the growth of home health expenditures, the \nBBA includes a provision to reduce home health cost limits by 15 \npercent, beginning October 1, 2000. There is significant concern that \nthe timing and level of the scheduled 15 percent reduction will result \nin reduced beneficiary access to health care. To address this concern, \nvarious industry representatives have requested a complete elimination \nof the scheduled reduction; however the cost of this reduction is \nestimated to be nearly $17 billion over ten years. Against the backdrop \nof impending insolvency of the Medicare program and the overall needs \nof the health care community as a whole regarding BBA-related relief, \nit will not be possible to completely eliminate this scheduled \nreduction. For this reason, this legislation suggests a middle-ground \napproach to this issue to ensure the scheduled reduction does not \nresult in a reduction in beneficiary access.\n  Primarily, this legislation would ensure that agencies receive \nadequate reimbursement by delaying the scheduled 15 percent reduction \nuntil the prospective payment system is fully implemented. This means \nthat if implementation of the prospective payment system is delayed, \nthe scheduled reduction would be delayed accordingly. In addition, to \nallow agencies to transition to the prospective payment system, and \nensure they retain the necessary resources to serve beneficiaries, this \nlegislation would reduce the scheduled reduction to 10 percent and \nwould phase-in a further 5 percent reduction three years after the \nprospective payment system is implemented. These responsible measures \nwill provide home health agencies additional resources to continue \nserving Medicare beneficiaries.\n  In addition, this legislation would offer home health agencies relief \nfrom a particularly burdensome regulatory requirement. The BBA requires \nhome health agencies to record the length of time of home health visits \nin 15-minute increments. This requirement is burdensome for agencies \nbecause time for travel and administrative duties related to this \nrequirement are not compensated. Also, it is not clear that the \ncollection of this data has a defined use. This provision eliminates \nthe 15-minute reporting requirement and directs that any data \ncollection regarding direct patient care have a defined purpose and not \nbe unnecessary labor-intensive for home care providers.\n  This bill would also take steps to address concerns regarding the \nprovision of durable medical supplies to Medicare beneficiaries. The \nBBA requires implementation of consolidated billing for home health \nservices. As part of consolidated billing, the BBA requires home care \nproviders (rather than durable medical equipment suppliers) to provide \ndurable medical equipment (DME) to Medicare beneficiaries during any \nepisode of care by the home health provider. When a beneficiary seeks \nhome health care, there is concern that they may experience a break in \nthe continuum of care as they shift between receiving medical equipment \nfrom a DME supplier to receiving these supplies from a home health \nagency. In addition, many home health agencies are not currently \nequipped to provide and be reimbursed for the provision of durable \nmedical equipment. This provision would ensure beneficiaries do not \nexperience a break in serve with regard to durable medical equipment by \nallowing DME providers to continue delivering services to beneficiaries \nregardless of their home health status.\n  Lastly, this legislation includes a provision that directs the \nestablishment of a nationally uniform process to ensure that fiscal \nintermediaries have the training and ability to provide timely and \naccurate coverage and payment information to home health agencies and \nbeneficiaries. This provision will be particularly important to home \nhealth reimbursement transitions to a new prospective payment system.\n  I am confident that this legislation will ensure home health agencies \ncan continue providing critical health care services to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follow:\n\n                                S. 1574\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``The Fairness in Medicare \n     Home Health Access Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Home health care is a vital component of the medicare \n     program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act.\n       (2) Home health services provided under the medicare \n     program enable medicare beneficiaries who are homebound and \n     greatly risk costly institutionalized care to continue to \n     live in their own homes and communities.\n       (3) Implementation of the interim payment system for home \n     health services has inadvertently exacerbated payment \n     disparities for home health services among regions, \n     penalizing efficient, low-cost providers in rural areas and \n     providing insufficient compensation for the care of medicare \n     beneficiaries with acute, medically complex conditions.\n       (4) The combination of insufficient payments and new \n     administrative changes has reduced the access of medicare \n     beneficiaries to home health services in many areas by \n     forcing home health agencies to provide fewer services, to \n     shrink their service areas, or to limit the types of \n     conditions for which they provide treatment.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To improve access to care for medicare beneficiaries \n     with high medical needs by establishing a process for home \n     health agencies to exclude services provided to medicare \n     beneficiaries with acute, medically complex conditions from \n     payment limits and to receive payment based on the reasonable \n     costs of providing such services through a process that is \n     feasible for the Health Care Financing Administration to \n     administer.\n       (2) To ensure that the 15 percent contingency reduction in \n     medicare payments for home health services established under \n     the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 does not occur under the \n     interim payment system for home health services.\n       (3) To reduce the scheduled 15 percent reduction in the \n     cost limits and per beneficiary limits to 10 percent and to \n     phase-in the additional 5 percent reduction in such limits \n     after the initial 3 years of the prospective payment system \n     for home health services.\n       (4) To address the unique challenges of serving medicare \n     beneficiaries in rural and underserved areas by increasing \n     the per visit cost limit under the interim payment system for \n     home health services.\n       (5) To refine the home health consolidated billing \n     provision to ensure that medicare beneficiaries requiring \n     durable medical equipment services do not experience a break \n     in the continuum of care during episodes of home health care.\n       (6) To eliminate the requirement that home health agencies \n     identify the length of time of a service visit in 15 minute \n     increments.\n       (7) To express the sense of the Senate that the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services should establish a uniform \n     process for disseminating information to fiscal \n     intermediaries to ensure timely and accurate information to \n     home health agencies and beneficiaries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE TIMELINESS AND \n                   ACCURACY OF INTERMEDIARY COMMUNICATIONS TO HOME \n                   HEALTH AGENCIES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services should establish a nationally uniform \n     process that ensures that each fiscal intermediary (as \n     defined in section 1816(a) of the Social Security Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1395h(a))) and each carrier (as defined in section \n     1842(f) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395u(f))) has the training \n     and ability necessary to provide timely, accurate, and \n     consistent coverage and payment information to each home \n     health agency and to each individual eligible to have payment \n     made under the medicare program under title XVIII of such Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.).\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues \nSenator Conrad and Senator Chafee to introduce the Fairness in Medicare \nHome Health Access Act of 1999 to address some serious access problems \nin the Medicare home health care program. Our bill contains provisions \nto ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries who qualify for home health \nservices have real access to those services.\n  Mr. President, I have been working to promote the availability of \nhome care and other long-term care options for my entire public life \nbecause I believe strongly in the importance of enabling people to stay \nin their own homes. For seniors who are homebound and have skilled \nnursing needs, having access to home health services through the \nMedicare program is the difference between staying in their own home \nand moving into a nursing home. The availability of home health \nservices is integral to preserving independence, dignity and hope for \nmany beneficiaries. I feel strongly that where there is a choice, we \nshould do our best to allow patients to choose home health care. I \nthink seniors need and deserve that choice.\n  Mr. President, as you know, and as many of our colleagues know, the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 contained significant changes to the way \nthat Medicare pays for home health services. Perhaps the most \nsignificant change was a switch from cost-based reimbursement to an \nInterim Payment System, or IPS. IPS was intended as a cost-saving \ntransitional payment system to tide us over until the development and \nimplementation of a Prospective Payment System or PPS, for home health \npayments under Medicare. Unfortunately, the cuts went deeper than \nanyone--including CBO forecasters--anticipated, leaving many Medicare \nbeneficiaries without access to the services they need.\n  The IPS is based on past spending: agencies are paid the lowest of \nthree measures: (1) actual costs; (2) a per visit limit of 105% of the \nnational median; or (3) a per beneficiary annual limit, derived from a \nblend of 75% of an agency's costs and 25% regional costs.\n  These formulas get pretty technical, Mr. President, and I won't go \ninto too much detail about them. What is important is that the net \neffect of the Interim Payment System is that since IPS pays agencies \nthe lowest of the three measures, agencies in areas where costs are \nhistorically low will be disproportionately and unfairly affected. In \neffect, they are penalized for having kept their costs low in the past.\n  And, Mr. President, Wisconsin's Medicare home health spending has \nbeen very, very low, even before the advent of IPS. The 1999 edition of \nthe Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care described the variation in Medicare \nhome health reimbursements as ``extreme'': in 1996, the national \naverage Medicare home health expenditure per-enrollee was $532.00, but \nthe maximum and minimum ranged from a high of $3,090 in McAllen, Texas, \nto an unbelievable $81 in Appleton, Wisconsin, in my home state. Even \nthe area of Wisconsin with the highest reimbursements is only at $267 \nper beneficiary, about half of the national average. When you consider \nthat these figures are adjusted for age, sex, race, illness and price \nof services, the variation is truly astounding. Pegging reimbursement \nto past spending, as IPS does, simply magnifies the existing payment \ninequalities.\n\n  Mr. President, in Wisconsin, 29 Medicare home health providers have \nshut down since the implementation of IPS. Still more have shrunken \ntheir service areas, stopped accepting Medicare, or cannot accept \nassignment for high cost patients because the payments are simply too \nlow.\n  So, what do these changes mean for Medicare beneficiaries? Well, \nquite\n\n[[Page S10732]]\n\nfrankly, in many parts of Wisconsin, the changes mean the beneficiaries \nin certain areas or with certain diagnoses simply don't have access to \nhome health care. The IPS has created disincentives to treat patients \nwith expensive medical diagnoses. Few agencies, if any, can afford to \ncare for them.\n  Mr. President, I think that a letter I received from my constituents \nat the Douglas County Health Department does a great job of \nillustrating just how bad the access problem is, particularly in rural \nareas. The Douglas County Health Department operates a home health \nprogram in Superior, Wisconsin, in the northwestern corner of my state. \nAccording to their letter, as a result of IPS, the program will lose \napproximately $590,000. Let me read my colleagues a passage from their \nletter: ``The Douglas County Home Care [program] serves . . . about 400 \nresidents a year, [of which] 82% [are] Medicare covered . . . 33% of \nour patients live in rural areas not covered by other home care \nproviders. There are four other providers in our area. All have \ndiscontinued taking Medicare patients and/or have stopped serving rural \npatients due to the high cost and low reimbursement.''\n  The legislation we are introducing today contains several important \nprovisions to enable elderly and disabled homebound individuals to \nremain in their homes. The bill ensures by statute that by 15% across-\nthe-board cut for all home health providers cannot happen during the \nInterim Payment System and that it will only be 10% for the first three \nyears of PPS. The bill also makes special provisions for medically \ncomplex patients who have more expensive health care needs, and raises \nthe per visit limits to enable home care agencies to continue serving \npatients in rural areas, where travel times are longer. I think these \ntwo provisions are particularly significant because the present IPS \ndoes not adequately account for the care needs of homebound individuals \nin rural areas, and the absence of home care options essentially forces \nthese individuals into nursing homes or hospitals.\n  The bill provides some administrative relief from the 15 minute \nincrement reporting rule and asks HCFA to reexamine whether the cost \nassociated with the collection of data is worthwhile in terms of what \nthose data may yield. Finally, the bill expresses the sense of the \nSenate that HCFA should ensure that fiscal intermediaries receive and \nconvey accurate and consistent information to agencies.\n  These provisions all need to be in place in order to ensure that we \ndo not punish the most efficient and well-performing agencies as we \nseek to streamline and modernize the program.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I voted in favor of BBA '97 because I \nbelieved it contained meaningful provisions to balance the budget. I \nwant to emphasize that the goal was to balance the budget--it was not \nto punish home health agencies, and certainly not to deny Medicare \nbeneficiaries access to the home health services they need.\n\n  I believe we ought to take a serious look at what refinements and \nfine tuning need to occur to ensure that our homebound elderly and \ndisabled constituents--among the frailest and most vulnerable of our \npeople we serve--can receive the services they need.\n  Without that fine-tuning, I am quite certain that more home health \nagencies in Wisconsin and in other areas across our country will close, \nleaving some of our frailest Medicare beneficiaries without the choice \nto receive care at home. Again, I think Seniors need and deserve that \nchoice, and I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President. I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Conrad and Feingold, in introducing the Fairness in Medicare \nHome Health Access Act of 1999. This legislation is an important step \ntowards ensuring that our seniors retain access to medically necessary \nhome health care services.\n  The Fairness in Medicare Home Health Access Act contains several \ncritical provisions, carefully designed to achieve the twin goals of \ncontrolling Medicare spending (thereby preserving and protecting the \nprogram for future beneficiaries), and ensuring that current \nbeneficiaries continue to have access to crucial home health services.\n  These provisions will allow the home health agencies in my state of \nRhode Island, as well as agencies across the country, to continue \ndelivering high quality, cost-effective care to our most frail seniors.\n  Why are these provisions necessary? The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 \n(BBA) included many important reforms to the Medicare program. As a \nresult of these provisions, the program has been strengthened, and \nsolvency of the trust fund extended. However, it now appears that the \nreductions in home health payments may be limiting access to our \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  In Rhode Island the number of beneficiaries served by Medicare home \nhealth providers has decreased by 22 percent, services provided to \nbeneficiaries have decreased by 49 percent, and total payments to home \nhealth agencies have decreased by 47 percent. Agencies have had to lay \noff workers and some have even been forced to close.\n  On October 1st, 2000, an additional 15 percent reduction in Medicare \nreimbursements is scheduled to take effect. I am concerned that a cut \nof that level could jeopardize or restrict access to care. At the same \ntime, we must be mindful of the precarious financial situation of the \nMedicare program, and the limited resources available. The President \nhas proposed restoring $7.5 billion over the next decade to those \nprograms under Medicare which have been especially hard hit by the cost \ncontrol measures included in the BBA. In his proposal, these funds \nwould be available for changes to home health policies, as well as \nother components of the Medicare program which have been adversely \nimpacted by those new policies.\n\n  Therefore, while some of my colleagues have called for a repeal of \nthe scheduled 15 percent reduction, given resource constraints, I \nsimply do not believe that will be possible. To repeal that provision \noutright would cost $17.5 billion over the 10-year budget period. This \nrestoration alone would greatly exceed the $7.5 billion the President \nhas recommended to soften the impact of the BBA. Even in Congress, the \nmost I've heard discussed in the way of ``BBA add-backs'' is in the \nrange of $15 billion. Thus, while in an ideal world some may wish to \nspend $17.5 billion on this provision, it is clearly not possible.\n  I believe it is critical to address the very real problems facing \nhome health beneficiaries and agencies, but I also believe we must be \nrealistic in our goals and expectations, and make carefully targeted \nadjustments to the BBA policies. For that reason I am pleased to join \nwith Senators Conrad and Feingold in calling for a scaling-back of the \nscheduled reduction in home health reimbursements. Our bill would \nprovide much-needed relief by gradually phasing-in the 15 percent \nreduction; for the first three years, the reduction would be limited to \n10 percent. Furthermore, beneficiary access will be protected by tying \nthe reduction to implementation of the prospective payment system \n(PPS). Although I am confident the prospective payment system will be \nimplemented by October 1, 2000 as required under the BBA, in the event \nthe deadline is not met, our provision would ensure that no further \nreductions occur until the PPS is fully implemented.\n  In addition, the Conrad-Feingold-Chafee bill includes several other \nimportant provisions:\n  An ``outlier policy'' to ensure that patients with higher than \naverage medical costs do not face access barriers as a result of their \nintensive medical needs;\n  An increase in the interim payment system per visit cost limit to 112 \npercent of the national median;\n  A refinement to the consolidated billing policy by allowing durable \nmedical equipment suppliers to continue delivering services to \nbeneficiaries regardless of their home health status; and\n  Elimination of the 15-minute incremental reporting requirement.\n  The Medicare home health benefit provides vital services to our most \nvulnerable citizens. Patients receiving these services have lower \nincomes, are older, and have more serious functional impairments than \nthe general Medicare population. The availability of home health \nservices averts the need for even more costly institutional living \narrangements for the elderly and\n\n[[Page S10733]]\n\ndisabled who rely upon these services. It is these patients who are \nharmed when home health agencies are forced to close their doors or cut \nback on services.\n  It is my hope that we will pass this legislation and therefore \nprotect the beneficiaries who need our help the most. In that regard, I \nwill work for its incorporation into any Medicare legislation the \nSenate Finance Committee, of which I am a member, may consider in the \nfuture. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST:\n  S. 1575.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would establish a commission to study the impact of deregulation \nof the airline industry on small-town America. For too long, we have \nallowed small and medium-sized communities from Bangor, Maine to \nBillings, Montana to Bristol, Tennessee to weather the effects of \nairline deregulation without adequately assessing how deregulation has \naffected their economic development, the quality and availability of \nair transportation for their residents, and the long-term viability of \ntheir local airports. It is time to evaluate the effects of airline \nderegulation in a new, meaningful way.\n  The 1978 deregulation of the airline industry has dramatically shaped \nthe modern airline industry and the way Americans travel. The purpose \nof deregulation was to harness the market in order to foster \ncompetition that would improve service and lower costs for consumers. \nAccording to some measures, this market experiment has been a success. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Transportation, since the advent of \nderegulation, the average airfare in major hubs has been reduced by 35 \npercent. Economists at George Mason University and the Brookings \nInstitution estimate that the increased competition resulting from \nderegulation saves consumers billions of dollars.\n  Similarly, other studies conducted by the General Accounting Office \nhave shown that deregulation has ushered in an overall decline in \nairfares and an improvement in the quality of air service--although \nmany of us who fly frequently would take strong issue with the finding \nof improved quality.\n  For many large cities, this is as far as the story needs be told. But \nfor many smaller and medium-sized communities, several chapters remain. \nThe rest of the story tells us that deregulation's benefits are not \nevenly distributed throughout U.S. markets. Although a March 1999 GAO \nreport found that, on average, airfares declined about 21 percent from \n1990 to the second quarter of 1998, it also found that airports serving \nsmall communities have experienced the lowest average decline in \nairfare. Similarly, the Department of Transportation has found that the \ncompetition encouraged by deregulation has not made its way to all \nparts of our great nation. Indeed, the number of cities served by more \nthan two airlines has fallen 41 percent since 1989.\n  In short, there are signs that the airline deregulation story is not \ngood for smaller and medium-sized communities--like Presque Isle and \nBangor in my state. There are important areas of inquiry that, I \nbelieve, no one has yet explored, and that is why I am introducing this \nbill today.\n  We need to know more about how airline deregulation has affected \nsmaller and medium-sized communities, and we need to focus on the \nrelationship between access to affordable, quality airline service and \nthe economic development of America's smaller communities. As many \ncommunities continue to struggle to attract businesses, it is not \nenough for us report that airfares, in the aggregate, have decreased in \nconstant dollars. Nor is it sufficient to select certain proxies for \nquality air travel and to conclude that quality has improved. Just as \nnot all communities have benefitted equally from our recent prosperity, \nnot all can say that deregulation has enhanced their air \ntransportation. We need to evaluate how airline deregulation has \naffected these communities' ability to compete for business \ndevelopment, job creation, and economic expansion. In the process, we \nneed to differentiate between business and leisure travel, as each \nserves a very different set of needs in our communities. And we much \nask communities how they measure quality service, instead of making \nassumptions that may or may not apply to a given area.\n\n  What I am proposing is a thorough evaluation of the effects of \nairline deregulation on communities--an evaluation that has not yet \nbeen done, but would happen under the bill I introduce today.\n  Mr. President, during the past 20 years, air travel has become \nincreasingly linked to business development. Successful businesses \nexpect and need to be able to travel quickly over long distances. It is \nexpected that a region being considered for business location or \nexpansion should be reachable, conveniently, via airplane. Those areas \nwithout air access, or with access that is restricted by prohibitive \ncosts of travel, infrequent flights, or small,\n\n[[Page S10734]]\n\nslower planes are at a distinct disadvantage compared to those areas \nthat enjoy accessible, convenient, and economical air service.\n  This country's air infrastructure has grown to the point where it now \nrivals our ground transportation infrastructure in its importance to \nthe economic viability of communities. It has long been accepted that \nbuilding a highway creates an almost instant corridor of economic \nactivity of businesses eager to cut shipping and transportation costs \nby locating close to the stream of commerce. Like a community located \non an interstate versus one only reachable by back roads, a community \nwith a mid-size or small airport underserved by air carriers operates \nat a distinct disadvantage to one located near a large airport.\n  Bob Ziegelaar, Director of the Bangor, Maine International Airport, \nperhaps put it best. He tells me, ``Communities like Bangor are at risk \nof being left with service levels below what the market warrants both \nin terms of capacity and quality. The follow-on consequences is a \ndecreasing capacity to attract economic growth.''\n  This issue is of critical importance and has not received the \nattention it deserves. The legislation I have introduced will result in \na comprehensive examination of how this complicated issue affects the \neconomy of small town America. It would establish a commission of 15 \nmembers from all areas of the country, including at least five members \nfrom rural areas, to study and report on the effects of airline \nderegulation. The Commission will examine a vital component of the \nderegulated airline industry--the effects on economic development and \njob creation, particularly in areas that are underserved by air \ncarriers.\n  The Commission will also explore the broader effects of deregulation \non affordability, accessibility, availability, and the quality of air \ntransportation, nationally and in small-sized and medium-sized \ncommunities. It will explore deregulation's impact on the economical \nviability of smaller airports and the long-term configuration of the \nU.S. passenger air transportation system.\n  Mr. President, sometimes the best use we can make of the Senate's \nlegislative powers is to study the results of our previous actions. In \npassing airline deregulation, Congress unleashed the power of \ncompetition with many positive benefits for consumers who live in large \ncities. It is now time to evaluate the impact on residents living in \nsmall-town America.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this important measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1576\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the current situation in East Timor \nis spiraling dangerously out of control. Members of the international \ncommunity are meeting to discuss this issue in New Zealand as I speak, \nwhile violence is escalating in East Timor and uncertainty is rising in \nthe minds of many about the future of Indonesia as a whole. Indonesia's \nstrategic position in South East Asia, as well as its economic and \npolitical stability, are of utmost importance, not only to the United \nStates, but to the international community which has an interest in \nsecuring a stable and democratic future for South East Asia and a \nlasting peace for East Timor.\n  The Indonesian government holds the primary responsibility for \nrestoring peace and stability to East Timor. I concur wholeheartedly \nwith U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan that the Indonesian government \nhas so far failed to take adequate steps towards that end. The \nIndonesian government must move immediately to restore the portion of \nits credibility that was lost for not preparing adequately for the \nonslaught of civil strife that was predicted after the August 30 vote. \nThe government must reign in the military factions, disarm the \nmilitias, restore law and order on the ground in East Timor, and \nprovide for humanitarian assistance to the thousands of East Timorese \nwho have been displaced from their homes and are fleeing the region. If \nit cannot, or is unwilling to, then the Indonesian government must \naccept the international community's offer to send in a peacekeeping \nforce.\n  To his credit, President Habibie took an important step forward by \nallowing East Timor's political future to be decided democratically. It \ntruly was significant that for the first time in twenty four years, the \nIndonesian government made a ballot in East Timor possible. I have long \nbelieved that the government should take this action and I have \nsupported numerous pieces of legislation urging the Indonesian \ngovernment to that effect. However, the Habibie government, once having \nmade the decision to hold a consultation on the future status of East \nTimor, assumed responsibility for the security of its people during and \nafter the ballot was held.\n  The international community was watching closely as the May 5, 1999 \nagreement detailing how the ballot was to be conducted--was signed by \nthe governments of Indonesia and Portugal and the U.N. This agreement \nheld great promise that the future of East Timor could be determined \npeacefully. However, anti-independence militia leaders refused to sign \nand refused to disarm, vowing to oppose violently any steps to give the \nEast Timorese their independence. The militia groups have followed\n\n[[Page S10736]]\n\nthrough on their commitments, regrettably. The Indonesian government, I \nfear, has not.\n  The Indonesian government, in no uncertain terms, has the \nresponsibility to curb the violence now and work to create a peaceful \natmosphere so that the results of the ballot can be implemented. It \nmust also protect the humanitarian missions that remain in East Timor \nand secure the safe passage of humanitarian aid to the region. No \nreasonable justification exists for the Indonesian military cutting off \nthe water supply and electricity inside the U.N. Compound. That only \nleaves us with the question, who is really calling the shots?\n  Indeed, the history of the Indonesian military is far too bleak to \nhave given it free reign to operate under martial law. We have already \nseen evidence of the military directly firing on civilians, forcibly \nremoving them from their homes, or just turning a blind eye to the \nhavoc being unleashed on them by the paramilitary forces. I do not \nbelieve that martial law--which establishes curfews, enables the \nmilitary to shoot violators of the curfews on sight, and provides for \nunwarranted searches--is the step that the Indonesian government should \nhave taken if it wanted to stop the violence and re-establish \ncredibility for itself in the international community. Martial law has \nonly succeeded in unleashing more violence and greater terror. It is \nespecially problematic since many members of the Indonesian military \nremain inextricably linked to the militia forces or have joined radical \nmilitary splinter groups.\n\n  I do not believe that the Indonesian government has taken adequate \nsteps, if any at all, to disassociate itself from the civilian militias \nand to dismantle and disarm them when it became apparent that these \ngroups would not work to bring peace to the region. The human rights \nabuses they have committed over the years was only a prologue to the \ndevastation they are orchestrating today. The alarm bells were ringing \nmonths ago, but was anyone listening?\n  The Indonesian military's direct involvement in committing human \nrights abuses and perpetuating violence in Indonesia led me to support \na restriction on U.S. arms sales and International Military Education \nTraining (IMET) aid to Indonesia, which Congress initiated in 1993. I \nbelieve it is crucial to suspend all of the remaining U.S. military \ncontacts with the Indonesian armed forces and all arms sales to \nIndonesia.\n  The outcome of this crisis will have implications not only for East \nTimor but for Indonesia as a whole. We need to be responsive to the \ncrisis in East Timor, but we must carefully consider the implications \nof any action on the larger political, economic and social climate in \nIndonesia.\n  I believe it is vital for the Indonesian government to accept the \ninternational community's offer to send an international peacekeeping \nforce to East Timor and that force must be robust, with the capacity to \nrestore law and order on the ground. The U.S. must continue to work \nwith its allies in the region in order to urge the Indonesian \ngovernment to invite this force in. I am pleased that the Australian \ngovernment has taken the lead in this effort by offering up to 7,000 \npeacekeepers to operate in such a force and has sent war ships to the \nwaters off East Timor as a message to the Indonesian government that \nthe global community is serious.\n  The East Timor crisis will be, and indeed should be, the top priority \nfor discussion at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum \nthis weekend. There is no issue of greater importance to the region at \nthe moment. I believe that the U.S. must play a strong role in \ncoordinating the efforts of all APEC nations in order to formulate a \nstrong, multilateral response to the crisis. All members of APEC have a \ndirect interest in preventing the further escalation of violence and \npolitical instability.\n  I urge the Administration to continue to work aggressively with APEC \nnations to make it clear to the Indonesian government that the clock is \nticking on a resolution of this issue. In addition to the diplomatic \nefforts, we must take some steps to demonstrate our own disapproval of \nthe government's response to the situation to date. I support the \nAdministration's decision to cease our direct military-to-military \ncontacts with Indonesia. I believe we also should offer to send \nhumanitarian aid to both East Timor and governments in the region that \naccept refugees. There are other steps that we can take as well.\n  That is why I have joined my colleague Senator Russ Feingold in \nintroducing a bill to suspend international financial assistance to \nIndonesia pending resolution of the crisis in East Timor. Specifically, \nthis bill would suspend the remaining U.S. military assistance to \nIndonesia, require the United States to oppose the extension of \nfinancial support to Indonesia by international financial institutions \nsuch as the IMF, and require Congressional approval before any FY 2000 \nbilateral assistance to Indonesia may be allocated. I see the \nintroduction of this bill as a way to send a signal--not only to \nPresident Habibie, but to all of the players in Jakarta--that we regard \nthis issue very seriously.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about East Timor \nand I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10736-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10736]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MR. AND MRS. PETER AND PAT COOK PROCLAMATION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, It gives me great pleasure to rise \ntoday and honor two outstanding Republican visionaries and admired \ncivic leaders, Mr. and Mrs. Peter and Pat Cook, on the occasion of the \nGerald R. Ford Republican Women's Club, Annual Fall Reception on \nSeptember 13, 1999.\n  Peter Cook began his professional career with Import Motors Limited \nInc., where he was named President in 1954. In 1977, with his typical \nentrepreneurial spirit and innovative thinking, Peter Cook formed \nTransitional Motors Inc., also known as Mazda Great Lakes, where he \ncurrently sits as chairman of the board and majority stockholder. \nAdditionally, Mr. Cook serves on the boards for numerous companies, \nmost notably, Gospel Communications, Woodland International, Applied \nImage Technology and the new Van Andel Institute. In the past he served \nas chairman of the South Y.M.C.A. and the Kent County Republican \nFinance Committee.\n  Pat Cook has always been very supportive of her husband's career. In \nthe late 1950's she took it upon herself to help deliver some of the \nfirst Volkswagens to dealers in Midland and Detroit. After the birth of \ntheir two children, Tom and Steve, Mrs. Cook stayed at home and \ncontinued in a voluntary capacity to enrich her community. She has \nserved on the boards of Welcome Home for the Blind, Blodgett Hospital \nGuild and Porter Hills Ladies Auxiliary.\n  Perhaps what is most truly admirable and wonderful about Mr. and Mrs. \nCook is their dedication to helping the lives of others and the Grand \nRapids community. They made the leading gift establishing the Research \nand Education Institute of Butterworth Hospital. Mr. and Mrs. Cook are \nactive members of the Grace Reformed Church and much of their support \nis focused toward youth and Christian institutions. They have helped \nmake possible the construction of the carillon on the Grand Valley \nState University campus; they have worked with Aquinas College students \nin making a new Student Center; and they have also contributed greatly \nto the Hope College Student Housing Center and Cook Valley Estates for \nthe Porter Hills Presbyterian Village.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Cook lead their lives as an example to others by being \nstrong Christians, distinguished philanthropists, and dedicated \ncitizens. Their countless efforts and support will continue to benefit \nthe community for many years to come.\n  Mr. President it is with sincere joy and appreciation that I honor \nPeter and Pat Cook. Rarely do you see two people who have unselfishly \ndone so much to help others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10736-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10736-S10737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ARMOR PIERCING AMMUNITION\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, two of my colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives, Representative Blagojevich and Representative Waxman, \nasked the Office of Special Investigations within the General \nAccounting Office (GAO) to investigate the manufacture and distribution \nof fifty caliber armor piercing ammunition, some of the most\n\n[[Page S10737]]\n\npowerful and destructive ammunition available. This investigation made \npublic a little known program administered by the Department of Defense \nthat makes unserviceable, excess and obsolete military ammunition \navailable for civilian use.\n  Under the Conventional Demilitarization Program, military armor \npiercing ammunition is transferred through a U.S. Company to the \ncivilian market. This ammunition is powerful enough to penetrate metal, \nballistic or bullet-proof glass, even armored cars or helicopters. With \nuse of the fifty caliber sniper rifle, this ammunition can start fires \nand explosions and strike targets from extraordinary lengths. This is \nammunition that is in no way suitable for civilian use. According to \nJames Schmidt II, the President of Arizona Ammunition Inc. and a member \nof the Board of Directors for the Fifty Caliber Shooters Association, \n``the armor piercing, incendiary, and tracer type bullets are used by \nthe police and military. Those available to the consumer are generally \nsurplus. Our company does not sell these to the general public because \nthey have no sporting application.''\n  Yet, through the Conventional Demilitarization Program, the \nDepartment of Defense makes their surplus available to the general \npublic. The Department pays Talon Manufacturing Company $1 per ton to \ntake possession of its demilitarized armor piercing ammunition. A \npercentage of this ammunition is then reconstructed and resold by Talon \nto domestic and foreign militaries, and to civilian buyers. In one \nbusiness year, Talon sold 181,000 rounds of this refurbished military \nammunition to civilian customers.\n  Once available on the market, this extremely powerful ammunition is \nsubject to virtually no restriction. It is easier to purchase armor \npiercing ammunition capable of penetrating steel and exploding on \nimpact, than it is to buy a handgun. This deadly and incredibly \ndamaging ammunition can be sold to anyone over 18 and possessed by \nanyone of any age. No federal background check is necessary. Purchases \nmay be made easily by mail order, fax, or over the counter, and there \nare no federal requirements that dealers retain sales records. These \nloose restrictions make armor piercing ammunition highly popular among \nterrorists, drug traffickers and violent criminals.\n  Certainly, the U.S. Military is not responsible for all of the armor \npiercing ammunition on the civilian market, but they are responsible \nfor hundreds of thousands of armor piercing, incendiary and tracer \nrounds made available to the general public each year. I am an original \ncosponsor of legislation that would prohibit the Department of Defense \nfrom entering into contracts that permit demilitarized armor piercing \nammunition to be sold to the general public. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and put an end to this program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10737-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10737]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO DR. PAUL N. VAN de WATER\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Domenci, in bidding farewell to Dr. Paul N. Van de \nWater--a longstanding and highly respected member of the Congressional \nBudget Office (CBO) staff. Dr. Van de Water is leaving CBO at the end \nof this week after more than 18 years of service to the Congress. Paul \nwill join the Social Security Administration as the Senior Advisor to \nthe Deputy Commissioner for Policy.\n  Dr. Van de Water's departure from CBO represents an enormous loss for \nthe Congress. His ability to generate objective, timely, and unbiased \nanalyses exemplifies the finest tradition of nonpartisan public \nservice. Paul's work at CBO represents the essence of the agency's \nmission. He managed--during some very difficult years--to serve both \npolitical parties in a fair and effective manner. He leaves CBO with \nhis reputation for impartial analysis intact and his integrity \nunquestioned and unblemished.\n  During his tenure at CBO, Dr. Van de Water earned a reputation for \nbuilding a first rate staff and for ensuring that CBO's work was \nanalytically sound, unbiased, and clearly presented. During the dark \ndecades of runaway budget deficits, Paul worked tirelessly with Members \nand staff on every major budget summit, budget plan, and budget process \nreform initiative. Like most public servants he rarely received the \nformal recognition and thanks he deserved. I hope in some small measure \nto communicate our thanks and appreciation for these contributions \ntoday.\n  Dr. Van de Water began his career at CBO in 1981 as Chief of the \nProjections Unit. From there, he moved on to Deputy Assistant Director \nfor Budget Analysis and, in 1994, assumed his current position as \nAssistant Director for Budget Analysis. He is the author, coauthor, or \neditor of more than 50 articles and books on government finance and \nSocial Security and has testified before Congressional committees on \nnumerous occasions.\n  Dr. Van de Water's accomplishments beyond CBO include a Ph.D. in \nEconomics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and two \ndaughters--the first a senior majoring in physics at the College of \nWilliam and Mary (and former Valedictorian of T.C. Williams High School \nin Alexandria) and the second, an enthusiastic 7th grader. Clearly, \nPaul has managed to keep his work and home priorities straight during \nhis tenure at CBO.\n  Paul's first hand knowledge of the Congressional budget process as \nwell as the operations and traditions of CBO cannot be replaced. \nHowever, we take some solace from the fact that his contributions to \npublic policy will continue. In his new role with the Administration, I \nam certain that his work will inform and shape the debate on the future \nof the Social Security program. I know that all of my colleagues join \nwith me in wishing Paul the best of luck in his new endeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10737-2", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10737-S10738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING STANLEY J. WINKELMAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to honor Stanley J. Winkelman \nwho recently passed away. Stanley will of course be remembered for the \ndepartment stores which bore his family name, but it was his efforts in \nthe community which were most dear to him and for which he will be \nenshrined in the memory of our community.\n  Stanley Winkelman was born in 1922 in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, \nwhere his father operated a women's clothing store. In 1928, Stanley's \nfather moved the family to Detroit so that he could join his brother in \nforming Winkelman Brothers Apparel, Inc. As Stanley grew and matured, \nso did the family enterprise.\n  In 1943, Stanley Winkelman graduated from the University of Michigan \nwith a bachelor's degree in chemistry. That same year, Stanley married \nhis sweetheart, Margaret ``Peggy'' Wallace. The couple would go on to \nhave three wonderful children, Marjorie, Andra, and Roger. Following \ngraduation, Stanley worked as a research chemist at the California \nInstitute of Technology and served as a naval officer during World War \nII. After the war, Stanley returned to Detroit to take part in the \nfamily business, eventually rising to hold the positions of president, \nchairman of the board and CEO, and in the process, becoming the guiding \nforce of the company. At the peak of the company's success it owned a \nchain of 95 stores specializing in fashionable yet affordable clothing \nfor women. The Winkelman's chain was sold in 1983 and Stanley retired \nin 1984. However, Stanley's retirement did not slow his commitment and \nservice to the community.\n  Throughout his life, Stanley was intimately involved in issues \nsurrounding the city of Detroit. He took part in a 1963 Detroit \nCommission on Community Relations where he called upon the Detroit \nBoard of Education to speed up desegregation by hiring more black \nteachers. Following the 1967 Detroit riots, Stanley was the leader of a \nNew Detroit subcommittee on community services which called for a much \nneeded review of the Detroit Police Department. In the wake of the \nriots, Stanley displayed his steadfast commitment to the city of \nDetroit by keeping his stores in the city. Stanley Winkelman's sense of \nsocial responsibility has helped lay the foundation for the resurgence \nof downtown Detroit.\n  Throughout his life, Stanley was a strong supporter of education. He \nsupported his alma mater, the University of Michigan, with both his \ntime and money. He devoted much of his time to Detroit's education \nsystem, with particular attention given to the education of the poorest \namong us. Stanley also held positions of leadership in\n\n[[Page S10738]]\n\nDetroit's Metropolitan Fund, the Jewish Welfare League, United \nFoundation, and Temple Beth El.\n  Stanley Winkelman offered American shoppers value, but his real \nlasting legacy is the values he reflected and fought for to make his \ncommunity a better place to live. I know my colleagues will join me in \nhonoring Stanley Winkelman on the many great accomplishments of his \nlife as we mourn his passing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10738-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10738]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1999\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, Senator Harkin and I have just announced \na significant program on youth violence prevention, which I think is \nworthy of a comment or two on the Senate floor before we adjourn.\n  Next week, the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation will have a markup. Senator Harkin is ranking minority member \nof that subcommittee, and I chair it. We have worked through a program \non a youth violence prevention initiative where we are allocating \n$850.8 million; $330 million is new money and the balance is a \nreallocation of funds within the Departments which will be directed \ntoward preventing the scourge of youth violence of which we have seen \nso much in Littleton, CO, and so many other places.\n  The programs which we will be providing will involve counseling, \nliteracy grants, afterschool programs, drug-free schools, alcohol \ntherapy rehabilitation, mental health services, job training, character \neducation, and metal detectors to prevent guns from being taken into \nschools.\n  This program will be directed by the Surgeon General, recognizing \nthis as a national health crisis as articulated as long ago as 1982 by \nDr. C. Everett Koop who was then the Surgeon General.\n  When these terrible occurrences happen at places like Littleton, \nthere is a lot of hand wringing and a lot of finger pointing, but we \nhave yet to have a sustained coordinated effort on a long-term basis to \ndeal with the underlying causes and come to grips with those causes.\n  Senator Harkin and I convened three lengthy meetings among the \nprofessionals of the three Departments: the Department of Education, \nthe Department of Labor, the Department of Health and Human Services. \nThe experts who sat together said that was the first time they had been \nconvened in that kind of a session.\n  After the first session, they went back to the drawing boards, and \ndid so again after the second session and again after the third session \nand, in conjunction with our subcommittee staff, have worked out an \nextensive program which is comprehended in 11 pages of our proposed \nmarkup next week.\n  Included in this program is funding for the Surgeon General to pull \ntogether all the available information on the impact of movies, \ntelevision, and video game violence and to undertake whatever other \nstudies are necessary with appropriate methodology, with many in those \nindustries claiming that the existing studies do not really deal in a \nmethodological way that is accurate.\n  Next Tuesday, there will be a hearing of our subcommittee where the \nSecretaries of the three Departments, plus the Deputy Attorney General \nEric Holder will participate where we will be moving forward with the \nspecifics on this program.\n  This program has been coordinated with the President through his \nOffice of Domestic Policy. We think it could provide a very significant \nstep in dealing with youth violence prevention--a very major problem in \nAmerica today. This goes to the underlying causes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the 11-page text of our program be \nprinted in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Youth Violence Prevention Initiative\n\n       The shocking events surrounding the shootings at public \n     schools serve to highlight a problem that is neither new nor \n     predictable by way of demographics, region or economic \n     standing. Violent behavior on the part of young people is no \n     longer confined to inner-city street gangs. For all of the \n     hope and inspiration our young people give us, we now find \n     ourselves profoundly troubled by the behavior of some of the \n     younger generation.\n       An estimated 3 million crimes a year are committed in or \n     near the nation's 85,000 public schools. During the 1996-97 \n     school year alone, one-fifth of public high schools and \n     middle schools reported at least one violent crime incident, \n     such as murder, rape or robbery; more than half reported less \n     serious crimes. Homicide is now the third leading cause of \n     death for children age 10 to 14. For more than a decade it \n     has been the leading cause of death among minority youth \n     between the ages of 15 and 24. The trauma and anxiety that \n     violence begets in our children most certainly interferes \n     with their ability to learn and their teachers' ability to \n     teach: an increasing number of school-aged children say they \n     often fear for their own safety in and around their \n     classroom.\n       The Gun-Free Schools Act of 1994 requires states to pass \n     laws mandating school districts to expel any student who \n     brings a firearm to school. A recent study indicates that the \n     number of students carrying weapons to school dropped from \n     26.1 percent in 1991 to 18.3 percent in 1997. While this \n     trend is encouraging, the prevalence of youth violence is \n     still unacceptably high. Recent incidents clearly indicate \n     that much more needs to be done. Some of the funds provided \n     in this initiative will help state and local authorities to \n     purchase metal detectors and hire security officers to reduce \n     or eliminate the number of weapons brought into educational \n     settings.\n       Fault does not rest with one single factor. In another \n     time, society might have turned to government for the answer. \n     However, there is no easy solution, and total reliance\n\n[[Page S10739]]\n\n     on government would be a mistake. Youth violence has become a \n     public health problem that requires a national effort. \n     Certainly, our government at all levels--federal, state and \n     local--must play a role. But we must also enlist the energies \n     and resources of private organizations, businesses, \n     families and the children themselves.\n       The Committee is aware of the controversy regarding the \n     media's role in influencing in youth violence. The Committee \n     recognizes that some members of the entertainment industry \n     have challenged the methodology of studies conducted over the \n     past 3 decades which have linked movies, television programs, \n     song lyrics, and video games with violent behavior. The \n     Committee believes that any studies that determine causative \n     factors for youth violence should be based on sound \n     methodology which yields statistically significant and \n     replicable results. Despite disagreement over the media's \n     role, the Committee is encouraged by historic efforts of \n     various sectors of the entertainment industry to monitor and \n     discipline themselves and to regulate content. The industry's \n     self-imposed, voluntary ratings systems are steps in the \n     right direction. Further vigilance, however, is needed to \n     ensure that media products are distributed responsibly, and \n     that ratings systems are appropriate and informative so that \n     parents are empowered to monitor their youths' consumption of \n     movies, television programs, music and video games.\n       Many familial, psychological, biological and environmental \n     factors contribute to youths' propensity toward violence. The \n     youth violence prevention initiative contained in this bill \n     is built around these factors and seeks to be comprehensive \n     and to eliminate the conditions which cultivate violence.\n       Over the past several months, the Committee convened three \n     lengthy meetings with the Deputy Attorney General; the \n     Surgeon General; Assistant Secretary for Management and \n     Budget, DHHS; Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for \n     Elementary and Secondary Education and the Director of Safe \n     and Drug Free Schools; Assistant Secretary for Special \n     Education; Commissioner, Administration for Children and \n     Families; Director, National Institute of Mental Health; \n     Director of Policy, Employment and Training Administration; \n     Director of Program Development, Center for Mental Health \n     Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration; Director, Division of Violence Prevention, \n     National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers \n     for Disease Control; Assistant Surgeon General; Deputy \n     Assistant Secretary for Health; Acting Director, Office of \n     Victims of Crime, Department of Justice; Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary for Employment and Training, Department of Labor; \n     and the National Association of School Psychologists. These \n     officials expressed their appreciation for the opportunity to \n     discuss this issue with other agency administrators, and \n     share their particular programs' approaches to preventing \n     youth violence. The meeting participants enthusiastically \n     endorsed a coordinated interagency approach to the youth \n     violence problem, and discussed how best to efficiently \n     collaborate with other agencies and organizations across the \n     government and in the private sector.\n       Based on those three meetings and staff follow up, the \n     following action plan was developed.\n       The Committee has included $850,800,000 for a youth \n     violence prevention initiative. These funds together with \n     increases included for the National Institute of Mental \n     Health, National Institute of Drug Abuse, and the National \n     Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism will provide \n     increased resources to address school violence issues in a \n     comprehensive way. This coordinated approach will improve \n     research, prevention, education and treatment strategies to \n     address youth violence.\n\n\n             1. Office of the United States Surgeon General\n\n       A. Coordination by the United States Surgeon General.--The \n     Committee views youth violence as a public health problem, \n     and therefore directs the United States Surgeon General to \n     take the lead role in coordinating a federal initiative to \n     prevent youth violence. The Office of the Surgeon General \n     (OSG) within the Office of Public Health and Science shall be \n     responsible for the development and oversight of cross-\n     cutting initiatives within the Department of Health and Human \n     Services and with other Federal Agencies to coordinate \n     existing programs, some of which are outlined below, to \n     reduce the incidence of youth violence in the United States. \n     The Committee has included $4,000,000 directly to the OSG to \n     help in this coordination effort. Sufficient funds have been \n     included for a Surgeon General's report on youth violence. \n     This report, to be coordinated by the OSG should review the \n     biological, psychosocial and environmental determinants of \n     violence, including a comprehensive analysis of the effects \n     of the media, the internet, and video games on violent \n     behavior and the effectiveness of preventive interventions \n     for violent behavior, homicide, and suicide. The OSG shall \n     have lead responsibility for this report and its \n     implementation activities.\n       B. Federal Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of \n     Youth Violence.--The Committee also directs the Secretary of \n     HHS to establish a Federal Coordinating Committee on the \n     Prevention of Youth Violence. This Committee should be \n     chaired by the Surgeon General and co-chaired by a \n     representative from the OSG, within the Office of Public \n     Health and Science, the Departments of Justice, Education and \n     Labor to foster interdepartmental collaboration and \n     implementation of programs and initiatives to prevent youth \n     violence. The representative from the OSG within the Office \n     of Public Health and Science shall report directly to the \n     Surgeon General and shall coordinate this initiative.\n       C. National Academic Centers of Excellence on Youth \n     Violence Prevention.--The Committee has included $10,000,000 \n     to support the establishment of ten National Centers of \n     Excellence at academic health centers that will serve as \n     national models for the prevention of youth violence. These \n     Centers should: (1) develop and implement a multi-\n     disciplinary research agenda on the risk and protective \n     factors for youth violence, on the interaction of \n     environmental and individual risk factors, and on preventive \n     and therapeutic interventions; (2) develop and evaluate \n     preventive interventions for youth violence, establishing \n     strong linkages to the community, schools and with social \n     service and health organizations; (3) develop a community \n     response plan for youth violence, bringing together diverse \n     perspectives including health and mental health \n     professionals, educators, the media, parents, young people, \n     police, legislators, public health specialists, and business \n     leaders; and (4) develop a curriculum for the training of \n     health care professionals on violent behavior identification, \n     assessment and intervention with high risk youth, and \n     integrate this curriculum into medical, nursing and other \n     health professional training programs.\n       D. National Youth Violence Prevention Resource Center.--The \n     Committee has included $2,500,000 to establish a National \n     Resource Center on Youth Violence Prevention. This center \n     should establish a toll free number (in English and Spanish) \n     and an internet website, in coordination with existing \n     Federal web site resources, to provide accurate youth \n     violence prevention and intervention information produced by \n     the government and linked to private resources. Hundreds of \n     resources are now available on this issue including \n     statistics, brochures, monographs, descriptions of practices \n     that work, and manuals about how to implement effective \n     interventions. This Resource Center will provide a single, \n     user-friendly point of access to important, potentially life-\n     saving information about youth violence, and an explanation \n     about preventing youth violence and how to intervene. \n     Additionally, technical assistance on how to establish \n     programs in communities across the country by providing local \n     resources would also be made available through the National \n     Resource Center.\n       E. Health Care Professional Training.--The Committee has \n     included sufficient funds for the training of primary health \n     care providers, pediatricians and obstetricians/gynecologists \n     in detecting child and youth violence stemming from child \n     abuse.\n\n\n                 2. National Institute of Mental Health\n\n       A. Zero to Five.--Many risk factors are established early \n     in a child's life (0 to 5 years), including child abuse and \n     neglect. However, less dramatic problems that delay cognitive \n     and social and emotional development may also lead to later \n     serious conduct problems that are resistant to change. The \n     Committee encourages NIMH to address both of these types of \n     problems by supporting research to understand and prevent \n     abuse and neglect, by encouraging research on how to best \n     instruct parents and child care workers in appropriate \n     interventions, and by supporting research that develops and \n     evaluates interventions for early disruptive behavior in \n     diverse preschool and community settings. In addition, the \n     Institute should work to ensure that the goals of all \n     interventions include effectiveness and sustainability.\n       B. Five to twelve.--Attention Deficit Hyperactivity \n     Disorder (ADHD) and depression often emerge in the 5-12 year \n     age range. Comprehensive research-based programs have been \n     developed to provide such children with the mental health \n     services and behavioral interactions they need. The Committee \n     urges NIMH to continue its work toward the development and \n     evaluation of programs aimed at prevention, early \n     recognition, and intervention for depression and youth \n     suicide in diverse school and community settings to determine \n     their effectiveness and sustainability; to support the \n     development and evaluation of behavioral interventions for \n     home and classroom to manage ADHD; to identify through \n     research the most cost-effective features of proven \n     prevention programs for resource poor communities; and to \n     support multi-site clinical trials to establish safe and \n     effective treatment of acute and long-term depression and \n     ADHD.\n       C. 12 to 18.--Early adolescence is an important time to \n     stop the progression of violent behavior and delinquency. \n     Multisystemic therapy (MST), in which specially trained \n     individuals work with the youth and family in their homes, \n     schools and communities, have been found to reduce chronic \n     violent or delinquent behavior. Research has shown sustained \n     improvements for at least 4 years, and MST appears to be cost \n     effective when compared to conventional community treatment \n     programs in that it has proven to reduce hospitalization and \n     incarceration.\n       D. Behavioral and Psychosocial Therapies.--Therapeutic \n     Foster Care is an effective home based intervention for \n     chronically offending\n\n[[Page S10740]]\n\n     delinquents. Key elements of the program include providing \n     supervision, structure, consistency, discipline, and positive \n     reinforcement. This intervention results in fewer runaways \n     and program failures than other placements and is less \n     expensive. The Committee encourages NIMH to work in \n     collaboration with CDC, SAMHSA, and the Department of Justice \n     to implement effective model interventions for juvenile \n     offenders with conduct disorders in diverse populations and \n     settings. NIMH has initiated the nation's first large-scale \n     multi-site clinical trial for treatment of adolescent \n     depression, and the Committee supports additional research to \n     improve recognition of adolescent depression.\n       E. Public Health Research, Data Collection and Community-\n     based Interventions.--There are four cross-cutting areas in \n     need of further research action across all agencies: \n     community interventions, media, health provider training, and \n     information dissemination. The Committee directs NIMH to \n     ensure that research focuses on: examining the feasibility of \n     public health programs combining individual, family and \n     community level interventions to address violence and \n     identify best practices; developing curricula for health care \n     providers and educators to identify pediatric depression and \n     other risk factors for violent behavior; studying the impact \n     of the media, computer games, internet, etc., on violent \n     behavior; disseminating information to families, schools, and \n     communities to recognize childhood depression, suicide risk, \n     substance abuse, and ADHD and decreasing the stigma \n     associated with seeking mental health care. The Committee \n     also encourages NIMH to work in collaboration with CDC and \n     SAMHSA to create a system to provide technical assistance to \n     schools and communities to provide public health information \n     and best practices to schools and communities to work with \n     high risk youth. The Committee has included sufficient funds \n     to collect data on the number and percentage of students \n     engaged in violent behavior, incidents of serious violent \n     crime in schools, suicide attempts, and students suspended \n     and/or expelled from school.\n\n\n                  3. National Institute of Drug Abuse\n\n       Drug abuse is a risk factor for violent behavior. The \n     Committee encourages NIDA to support research on the \n     contribution of drug abuse including methamphetamine use, its \n     co-morbidity with mental illness, and treatment approaches to \n     prevent violent behavior.\n\n\n         4. National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism\n\n       The Committee encourages NIAAA to examine the relationship \n     of alcohol and youth violence with other mental disorders and \n     to test interventions to prevent alcohol abuse and its \n     consequences.\n\n\n                   5. Safe Schools, Healthy students\n\n       Mental Health Counselors/Community Support/Technical \n     Assistance and Education.--The Committee has included \n     $80,000,000, an increase of $40,000,000 over the fiscal year \n     1999 appropriation, to support the delivery and improvement \n     of mental health services, including school-based counselors, \n     in our nation's schools. These funds allow State and local \n     mental health counselors to work closely with schools and \n     communities to provide services to children with emotional, \n     behavioral, or social disorders. Some of these funds also \n     help train teachers, school administrators, and community \n     groups that work with youths to identify children with \n     emotional or behavioral disorders. The program is being \n     administered collaboratively by the Substance Abuse and \n     Mental Health Services Administration within the Department \n     of Health and Human Services and the Departments of Education \n     and Justice to help school districts implement a wide range \n     of early childhood development techniques, early intervention \n     and prevention strategies, suicide prevention, and increased \n     and improved mental health treatment services. Some of the \n     early childhood development services include effective \n     parenting programs and home visitations.\n\n\n             6. Parental responsibility/Early Intervention\n\n       Sociological and scientific studies show that the first \n     three years of a child's cognitive development sets the \n     foundation for life-long learning and can determine an \n     individual's emotional capabilities. Parents, having the \n     primary and strongest influence on their child, play a \n     pivotal role at this stage of development. Scientists have \n     found that parental relationships affect their child's brain \n     in many ways. A secure, highly interactive, and warm bond can \n     bolster the biological systems that help a child handle their \n     emotions. Research further indicates that a secure connection \n     with the parent will better equip a child to handle stressful \n     events throughout life. Statistics show that the parental \n     assistance program in particular has helped to lower the \n     incidence of child abuse and neglect, reduces placement of \n     children in special education programs, and involves parents \n     more actively throughout their child's school years. The \n     Committee recognizes that early intervention activities \n     conducted through the Department of Education's parent \n     information and resource centers program can make a critical \n     difference in addressing the national epidemic of youth \n     violence, and therefore includes an additional $3,000,000 to \n     expand its services to educate parents to work with \n     professionals in preventing and identifying violent \n     behavioral tendencies.\n\n\n                     7. Safe and Drug-Free Schools\n\n       A. National Programs.--The Committee remains extremely \n     concerned about the frequent and horrific occurrence of \n     violence in our Nation's schools. Last year, the Committee \n     provided $90,000,000 within this account for a school \n     violence prevention initiative. As part of an enhanced and \n     more comprehensive effort, the Committee has provided \n     $100,000,000 within the safe and drug-free schools and \n     communities program to support activities that promote safe \n     learning environments for students. Such activities should \n     include: targeted assistance, through competitive grants, to \n     local educational agencies for community-wide approaches to \n     creating safe and drug free schools; and training for \n     teachers and school security officers to help them identify \n     students who exhibit signs of violent behavior, and respond \n     to disruptive and violent behavior by students. The Committee \n     also encourages the Department to coordinate its efforts with \n     children's mental health programs.\n       B. Coordinator Initiative.--The Committee has included \n     $60,000,000, an increase of $25,000,000 over the fiscal year \n     1999 appropriation and $10,000,000 more than the budget \n     request. The Committee recommendation will enable the \n     Department of Education to provide assistance to local \n     educational agencies to recruit, hire, and train drug \n     prevention and school safety program coordinators in middle \n     schools with significant drug and school safety problems. \n     These coordinators will be responsible for developing, \n     conducting and analyzing assessments of their school's drug \n     and crime problems, and identifying promising research-based \n     drug and violence prevention strategies and programs to \n     address these problems.\n\n\n               8. 21st Century Community Learning Centers\n\n       The Committee has included $400,000,000 for the 21st \n     Century Community Learning Centers, an increase of \n     $200,000,000 over the fiscal year 1999 level. These funds are \n     intended to be used to reduce idleness and offer an \n     alternative to children when they conclude their school day, \n     at a time when they are typically unsupervised. Nationally, \n     each week, nearly 5 million children ages 5-14 are home alone \n     after school, which is when juvenile crime rates double. \n     According to the Department of Justice, 50 percent of all \n     juvenile crime occurs between the hours of 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. \n     during the week. Therefore, the Committee has included funds \n     to allow the Department of Education to support after-school \n     programs that emphasize safety, crime awareness, and drug \n     prevention.\n\n\n                 9. Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants\n\n       The Committee has included $80,000,000 for teacher quality \n     enhancement grants, an increase of $2,788,000, for \n     professional development of K-12 teachers, which is a \n     necessary component to addressing the epidemic of youth \n     violence. The Committee encourages the Department, in making \n     these grants, to give priority to partnerships that will \n     prepare new and existing teachers to identify students who \n     are having difficulty adapting to the school environment and \n     may be at-risk of violent behavior. Funds should also be used \n     to train teachers on how to detect, manage, and monitor the \n     warning signs of potentially destructive behavior in their \n     classrooms.\n\n\n                        10. Character Education\n\n       The Committee recommends $10,300,000 for character \n     education partnership grants. These funds will be used to \n     encourage states and school districts to develop pilot \n     projects that promote strong character, which is fundamental \n     to violence prevention. Character education programs should \n     be designed to equip young individuals with a greater sense \n     of responsibility, respect, trustworthiness, caring, civic \n     virtue, citizenship, justice and fairness, and a better \n     understanding of the consequences of their actions.\n\n\n                    11. Elementary School Counseling\n\n       The Committee is concerned about the inaccessibility of \n     school counselors for young children and therefore is \n     providing $20,000,000 for the Elementary School Counseling \n     Demonstration as a part of the youth violence prevention \n     initiative. Many students who are having a difficult time \n     handling the pressures of social and academic demands could \n     benefit from having mental health care readily available. The \n     Committee believes that increasing the visibility of school \n     counselors would legitimize their role as part of the \n     school's administrative framework, thereby, encouraging \n     students to seek assistance before resorting to violence.\n\n\n                          12. Civic education\n\n       Within the amounts provided, the Committee has included \n     $1,500,000 to continue the violence prevention initiative \n     begun in fiscal year 1999. The Committee encourages that \n     funds be used to conduct a five State violence prevention \n     demonstration program on public and private elementary, \n     middle, and secondary schools involving students, parents, \n     community leaders, volunteers, and public and private sector \n     agencies, such as law enforcement, courts, bar associations, \n     and community based organizations.\n\n\n                         13. Literacy programs\n\n       A. The Committee has included $21,500,000, an increase of \n     $3,500,000 for the Reading is Fundamental program to promote \n     literacy skills. Studies show that literacy promotion is one \n     tool to prevent youth violence. The Committee believes that \n     this program, which motivates children to read and increases \n     parental involvement is another way to prevent youth violence \n     at an early age.\n\n[[Page S10741]]\n\n       B. The Committee has included $19,000,000, an increase of \n     $2,277,000 for the State Grants for Incarcerated Youth \n     Offenders/Prisoner Literacy Programs. This program, which \n     assists states to encourage incarcerated youth to acquire \n     functional literacy, life and job skills, can also play a \n     role in reducing recidivism rates and violent behavior.\n       C. The Committee has included $42,000,000 for the Title I \n     Neglected and Delinquent/High Risk Youth program, an increase \n     of $1,689,000 over the fiscal year 1999 appropriation. These \n     funds will assist states to strengthen programs for neglected \n     and delinquent children to enhance youth violence prevention \n     programs in state-run institutions and for juveniles in adult \n     correctional facilities\n       These funds will be used to motivate youth to read and \n     enhance their academic achievement. Literacy promotion \n     encourages young individuals to pursue productive goals, such \n     as continued education and gainful employment.\n\n\n                   14. Youth Service delivery systems\n\n       The Committee is aware that the Workforce Investment Act \n     (WIA) brings new emphasis to the development of coherent, \n     comprehensive youth services that address the needs of low-\n     income youth over time. It believes that youth service \n     delivery systems under WIA integrate academic and work-based \n     learning opportunities, offer effective connections to the \n     job market and employers, and have intensive private-sector \n     involvement. Such effective systems can provide low-income, \n     disadvantaged youth with opportunities in our strong economy \n     as alternatives to youth violence and crime. The Committee \n     further recognizes the potential of Youth Councils for \n     creating the necessary collaboration of private and public \n     groups to create community strategies that improve \n     opportunities for youth to successfully transition to \n     adulthood, postsecondary education and training. Thus, the \n     Committee has included funds to continue investments in WIA \n     formula-funded youth training and employment activities, the \n     Youth Opportunities grant program, the Job Corps, and added \n     $15,000,000 to continue and expand the Youth Offender grant \n     program serving youth who are or have been under criminal \n     justice system supervision.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair for the time and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/09/10/senate-section/article/S10741-1", "month": "09", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1999\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
