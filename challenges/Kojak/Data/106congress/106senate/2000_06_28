Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 4577 which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4577) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and \n     Education, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 2001, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Harkin (for Daschle) amendment No. 3658, to fund a \n     coordinated national effort to prevent, detect, and educate \n     the public concerning Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal \n     Alcohol Effect and to identify effective interventions for \n     children, adolescents, and adults with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome \n     and Fetal Alcohol Effect.\n       Hutchison/Collins amendment No. 3619, to clarify that funds \n     appropriated under this Act to carry out innovative programs \n     under section 6301(b) of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 shall be available for same gender \n     schools.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Hutchison \namendment, which would allow local school districts to use Title VI \nfunds to establish same-gender schools if they so choose. I have \nopposed a similar amendment in the past because I have been concerned \nthat many of these ``separate but equal'' programs are sometimes not \nequal in reality. I am pleased that the Senator from Texas has made \nmodifications to her amendment that deal with these concerns, and \nensures that single-gender schools will not result in a system where \none gender is educationally disadvantaged.\n  I believe this amendment is another important step in our drive \ntoward more flexibility and local control in education. I am pleased to \nbe an original cosponsor of the Public Education Reinvestment, \nReinvention and Responsibility Act--better known as ``Three R's''--\nwhich would also provide school districts with the flexibility to \ndesign programs that best meets their needs. The Hutchison amendment, \nwhich allows local officials to make the decision to set up a single-\ngender school, is consistent with the ``Three R's'' philosophy. We must \ncontinue to move toward a public education system that gives States and \nlocal school districts--who are in the best position to know what their \neducational needs are--the ability to create innovative programs that \nallow all students to achieve to high standards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 9:40 \na.m. having arrived, there will be 4 minutes of debate prior to the \nvote on or in relation to the Hutchison amendment No. 3619.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if there is no one on the other side, \nwhich I believe is the case, I ask unanimous consent to give 2 minutes \nto Senator Collins, and then 2 minutes to myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Texas for her \nextraordinary leadership on this issue. She has been an advocate for \ngirls and women in so many different ways, and she truly is committed \nto ensuring that young girls growing up get the very best education \nthey deserve, and that they have every opportunity available to them. \nThe amendment that she has proposed, which I am proud to cosponsor, is \nin keeping with that commitment.\n  I commend her for her leadership on this very important issue.\n  I first became very interested in the issue of having same-gender \nclassrooms because of an experience of a high school all-girls math \nclass in northern Maine. This math class, which is an advanced math \nclass taught at Presque Isle High School, has been proven to be of \nenormous benefit to the young women who are enrolled in it. They do \nvery advanced math. It has been shown that their SAT scores soared.\n  Moreover, it gives them the confidence that they can handle advanced \nmath and science and other subjects that unfortunately women sometimes \nhave felt uneasy about, even though obviously girls and women have \nevery ability in the world to handle such subjects. This class has been \nan enormous success for the girls at Presque Isle High School.\n  Unfortunately, a few years ago, the Department of Education objected \nto this class despite the fact that it was showing such enormous \nresults for the young women who were enrolled in it. They were taught \nby a very gifted teacher, Donna Lisnik, who has subsequently gone on to \nbe the principal of a school in Aroostook County. But she was the one \nwho originated this course.\n  The Department of Education objected because it was a same-sex class. \nThey have been able to get around that. But that shouldn't require a \nwaiver or a circumvention of the law.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Texas would cure this situation.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins, the cosponsor \nof this amendment, who has worked with me because of the very example \nthat she just gave.\n  She has the situation in her State where this actually has curbed the \ncreativity of public schools in offering more options for parents who \nbelieve their adolescent boys or their young girls would do better in a \nsingle-sex setting. In fact, in Detroit, MI, there is a boys school \nthat has the same success that Senator Collins has just mentioned about \na girls class in Maine; the boys are able to have a single-sex \natmosphere. And sometimes it is shown by studies that adolescent boys \ndo better in that atmosphere.\n  We want public schools to have the same options and the Federal help \nthat are available in parochial and private schools for creative \napproaches and solutions to our education problems. We want options, \nnot mandates. But we want every child in this country to reach his or \nher full potential. We want that child to be given opportunities in a \nway that best fit that child's needs.\n  That is why I think this amendment is going to be overwhelmingly \naccepted in the Senate--just as these amendments have been in the past. \nIt will give the guidance to the Department of Education that will \nclarify the issue once and for all; that we want absolutely every \noption available in our public schools that will give every child in \nthis country the ability to succeed.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor and ask my colleagues for their support of the \nHutchison-Collins amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now occurs on the Hutchison \namendment numbered 3619.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3658\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 4 minutes for debate on the \nDaschle amendment No. 3658.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I offered this amendment on behalf of the \nthousands of individuals who have been impacted by prenatal exposure to \nalcohol, their families, and the estimated 12,000 children who will be \nborn with fetal alcohol syndrome, FAS, or fetal alcohol effects, FAE, \nduring the next year.\n  My amendment will provide $25 million to establish a competitive \ngrant program to fund prevention and treatment services to individuals \nwith FAS and FAE and their families. This grant program is absolutely \ncritical for several reasons.\n  FAS and FAE are 100 percent preventable. Despite this fact, the \nCenters for Disease Control have reported a six-fold increase in the \nincidence of babies born with FAS between 1960 and 1995. One in five \nwomen still drink during pregnancy.\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\n  Once a child has been born with FAS or FAE, there is still much we \ncan do to help prevent the secondary disabilities that often accompany \nthe disease.\n  For too long, we have treated the birth of an FAS or FAE child as the \nlosing end of a battle, rather than the beginning of one we can win. We \nhave neglected children with FAS and FAE at the peril of those \nindividuals, their families and their communities.\n  Let me illustrate this point with two real life examples--Karli \nSchrider and Lucy Klene.\n  Twenty-eight years ago, when Karli's mother, Kathy, was pregnant with \nKarli, it was not uncommon for expectant mothers to be told to ``drink \na beer a day for a fat, healthy baby.'' Women who were in danger of \nmiscarrying were sometimes hospitalized and given alcohol intravenously \nfor five or six hours in the mistaken belief it would prevent \nmiscarriage.\n  Back then, it never crossed Kathy's mind that her occasional glasses \nof wine might be harming her unborn child. Besides, just the year \nbefore, Kathy had had another baby who was perfectly healthy, and she \ndrank during that pregnancy too.\n  The first time Karli was misdiagnosed, she was an infant. A doctor \nattributed her developmental delays to chronic ear infections. When she \nwas 4 years old, a psychologist offered another explanation for Karli's \ndifficulties. He said she was being ``willfully disobedient.''\n  When Karli was 8, a team of specialists misdiagnosed her again--with \ncerebral palsy.\n  Eight years later, when Karli was 16, Kathy was training to be a \nsubstance abuse counselor. As part of her training, she attended a \nconference on ``crack babies.'' Sitting in the audience, she was \nstunned. Every characteristic of ``crack babies'' the lecturer \ndescribed, Karli had. But Kathy had never used crack.\n  She tracked down the few studies that had been done at that time on \nthe effects of alcohol on fetuses. Again, she saw the same list of \nsymptoms.\n  Years later, researchers would announce that most of the symptoms \nthey originally thought were the result of fetal exposure to crack were \nactually the result of fetal alcohol exposure, and that alcohol is much \nmore devastating to fetuses than crack--or any other drug.\n  Learning the real cause of Karli's special challenges has not \nlessened them. FAS and FAE are lifelong conditions. But, knowing the \ntruth has enabled Kathy--and others in Karli's life --to focus less on \nKarli's deficits, and more on her strengths.\n  One of those strengths is Karli's extraordinary kindness and empathy. \nIn addition to her volunteer work at NOFAS, Karli also volunteers to \nhelp people with cerebral palsy, and the elderly. Two years ago, she \nwas named one of America's ``Thousand Points of Light'' by former \nPresident Bush. She is an inspiration to everyone who meets her, and \none of the reasons I believe so deeply in advocating for children with \nFAS and FAE.\n  Another reason is a pint-sized girl named Lucy Klene. Lucy is 4 years \nold. She spent the first two years of her life in an orphanage in \nRussia. When she was 2, she was adopted by Stephan and Lydia Klene, of \nHerndon, Virginia. The Klenes also adopted a son from Russia, Paul, who \nis 3 years old and has no apparent fetal alcohol effects.\n  Within a month after bringing Lucy and Paul home, Stephan and Lydia \nbegan to suspect that Lucy had special challenges. Over the next 16 \nmonths, Lucy was evaluated eight times by pediatricians and other \nspecialists.\n  Not one of them recognized the symptoms of Lucy's fetal alcohol \neffects. Finally, scouring the Internet, Stephan stumbled on the truth. \nHe and Lydia took their research to Lucy's pediatrician, who read it \nand confirmed their hunch.\n  Today, Lucy is a talented little gymnast who attends special \neducation pre-school. And while it's still too early to know for sure, \nher doctor and parents think there is a good chance she will be able to \nlive an independent and productive life when she grows up.\n  Together, Karli and Lucy illustrate the challenges that families with \nFAS and FAE face and the need for expanded prevention, early detection \nand real support for FAS/FAE families. While we have certainly seen \nprogress--it took Karli's family 16 years to get a correct diagnosis \nand Lucy's family about 16 months--there is still much more that needs \nto be done.\n  A study recently released by Anne Streissguth at the University of \nWashington illustrates the importance of early intervention with \nindividuals with FAS and FAE:\n  94 percent of children and adults with FAS experience mental health \nproblems;\n  45 percent exhibit inappropriate sexual behavior;\n  43 percent have a disrupted school experience;\n  42 percent have trouble with the law;\n  Of the 90 adults studied, 83 percent do not live independently and 79 \npercent have problems with employment; and,\n  72 percent have been victims of physical or sexual abuse or domestic \nviolence.\n  This study also showed that the presence of protective factors such \nas an early diagnosis and a stable and nurturing home reduce secondary \ndisabilities. Even though early diagnosis is critical for preventing \nsecondary disabilities, only 11 percent of kids and adults studied were \ndiagnosed by age 6.\n  While intensive intervention is critical to enabling individuals with \nFAS and FAE to live productive, safe lives, there is still widespread \nignorance about this disease in the health care, scientific and \neducational communities. There is little advice available to families \non parenting skills or how to utilize outside resources.\n  Even when parents seek help from professionals, those teachers, \ncounselors or health care providers may not have the training to \nprovide necessary assistance or offer the right information.\n  Teachers often do not have the tools they need to serve these \nspecial-need students. Physicians frequently do not know which \nmedications to provide, if any. And, like Karli, many individuals with \nFAS and FAE still remain unidentified and mislabeled as noncompliant or \ndelinquent.\n  This amendment will fund a grant program within HHS to develop FAS \ntraining and treatment models that can be replicated around the \ncountry. The grant program was authorized by Congress in the fiscal \nyear 1999 appropriations bill. The program will provide much-needed \nassistance to families, who, in many cases, have been bearing the \nburden of this national public health problem unaided and alone.\n  The grant program will be directed by the Centers for Disease Control \nand the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. \nPortions of the funding for the grant will come from each of these \nagencies.\n  It is time for Congress to join those who have already dedicated time \nand resources to this effort. Particularly, I want to recognize the \nNational Organization of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome that has been aiding \nchildren and families and fighting for prevention for the last 10 \nyears. I would also like to thank the directors of the Family Resource \nInstitute, who have educated and been a voice for parents of children \nwith alcohol-related birth defects. I also greatly appreciate the work \nof those in my own state, including Judy Struck and those at the \nUniversity Affiliated Program, Charles Schaad, and the South Dakota \nMarch of Dimes.\n  The National Institute of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse, NIAAA, has \nbeen studying FAS and FAE for more than 20 years, and it has provided \nexcellent leadership with the Inter-Agency Coordinating Committee. The \nCenters for Disease Control and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Administration should also be commended for their growing \ndedication to this cause.\n  We have developed a model for dealing with FAS and FAE that will \nbring our nation's best scientists together with advocates, service \nproviders and families and will enable us to develop our knowledge of \nsuccessful prevention, diagnosis, early detection, and education. It is \nthe result of extensive consultation and input from experts in the \nfield. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this important \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, before I comment on the pending \namendment,\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\nthe ranking member of the subcommittee and I have conferred, as we have \nbeen trying to have all of the amendments submitted. We make a request \nat this time that any Senator who has an amendment to this bill, let us \nknow what it is by 11 o'clock. It is our intention, shortly thereafter, \nto propound a unanimous consent request that the amendments submitted \nto us at that time be the only amendments which will be considered on \nthe bill. That is by 11 o'clock.\n  Briefly, on the pending amendment offered by the Senator from South \nDakota, it is a very good amendment which allocates $25 million to \nfetal alcohol syndrome. Some $15 million is currently allocated. It may \nbe even a greater amount should be allocated for this very pressing \nproblem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from South Dakota \nfor bringing attention to this serious problem. Fetal alcohol syndrome \naffects 2,000 infants born every year. At the same time, we must keep \nin mind that birth defects generally are a major, even larger health \ncare problem in this country. Birth defects are the leading cause of \ninfant mortality, and about 150,000 children will be born with a major \nbirth defect annually.\n  This year, CDC is spending only $16.5 million total on all birth \ndefects, with an additional $2 million being spent on a folic acid \nawareness campaign for which I fought and worked with my colleagues in \nthis body to support. The $10 million for CDC to fight fetal alcohol \nsyndrome would be well spent. At the same time, we need to \nsignificantly increase our overall investment in the fight against \nbirth defects.\n  I look forward to working with the chairman and ranking member and \nSenator Daschle as we move forward to make sure this critical area of \nchildren's health is adequately addressed in this bill and in the work \nof the CDC in the coming year.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa and I had announced \npreviously our request that all Senators submit amendments by 11 a.m. \nthis morning. It is our intention, as soon thereafter as we can, to \ncompile a list and to ask unanimous consent that that be the exclusive \nlist for amendments to be considered on this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I fully support \nhim in that. At 11 o'clock, which is about 20 minutes from now, we hope \nto be informed of all amendments. I say to Senators on our side, please \nlet us know, either through the Cloakroom or directly, because shortly \nafter that, I will be joining with our chairman in propounding a \nunanimous consent request to make that a finite list.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nIowa. We had announced that between the votes, but we repeat it at this \ntime. We think we can conclude this bill today. If we have the \ncooperation of Senators on letting us know about their amendments, we \nwill be able to do that.\n  Mr. President, we are about to have an amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. This has been \nworked out, but I formally ask unanimous consent that time on the \namendment by Senator Kennedy be limited to 60 minutes equally divided \nwith no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment will be followed in \nsequence by an amendment by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd. \nThis has been cleared.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time on the Dodd amendment, prior to \nthe vote in relation to that amendment, be limited to 30 minutes \nequally divided with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor to Senator Kennedy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3661\n\n (Purpose: To provide an additional $202,000,000 to carry out title II \n                  of the Higher Education Act of 1965)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mr. Reed, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Murray, \n     Mr. Levin, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3661.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . TEACHER QUALITY ENHANCEMENT.\n\n       In addition to any other funds appropriated under this Act \n     to carry out title II of the Higher Education Act of 1965, \n     there are appropriated $202,000,000 to carry out such title.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I offer this amendment along with \nSenators Reed, Bingaman, Wellstone, Dodd, Murray, Levin, Schumer, and \nDurbin.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is one of the most important policy \nmatters that we are going to consider on this appropriation bill, and \nthat is whether we are going to provide adequate resources to train the \nneeded number of teachers for our classrooms and for children across \nthis country.\n  We believe--at least I do--that the funds that have been allocated in \nthe current bill are inadequate to do the job. I spelled out in my \nearlier comments that I know the Appropriations Committee received \nallocations. But, I don't believe those allocations given to the \ncommittee were adequate to really respond to the challenges we are \nfacing in education. It is as a result of the fact that the Republican \nleadership wants to have a tax break. It seems to me that these \npriorities take preference over that. I wish these priorities had been \ngiven additional funds. In\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\nspite of that, we ought to make an expression in the Senate about our \npriorities for the children of this country, particularly in the area \nof training teachers, so that we are going to have a well-trained \nteacher in every classroom in the country.\n  Mr. President, it was only in February of this year that the Wall \nStreet Journal had an article on the front page:\n\n         Schools Turn To Temp Agencies for Substitute Teachers.\n\n       Most school districts begin each day with a nerve-racking \n     hunt for substitutes to fill in for absent teachers. With a \n     tight labor market making the task especially tough, a few \n     are starting to outsource the job. Kelly Services Inc. \n     unveiled the first nationwide substitute teacher program four \n     months ago, and now handles screening and scheduling for 20 \n     schools in 10 States.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a national indictment of policy out of the \nlocal, State, and Federal level, where we are using the Kelly Services, \nwhich have provided professional secretaries and office assistants, and \nnow they are out there recruiting teachers to teach in the schools for \nthe children of this country. We have to be more serious about this \nissue. We know what needs to be done, and we ought to get about the \nbusiness of doing it.\n  We have a number of groups that support our amendment, which include \nthe American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, the \nAssociation of Community Colleges, American Council on Education, the \nNational Association of Independent Colleges, the NEA, the AFT, Council \nof Chief State School Officers, and others.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full list of those supporting the \nprogram be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Groups That Support the Kennedy Teacher Quality Amendment\n\n       American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education.\n       American Association of Collegiate Registrars and \n     Admissions Officers.\n       American Association of Community Colleges.\n       American Association of State Colleges and Universities.\n       American Council on Education.\n       American Federation of Teachers.\n       Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities.\n       Boston College.\n       National Association of College and University Business \n     Officers.\n       National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities.\n       National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant \n     Colleges.\n       National Education Association.\n       National PTA.\n       The California State University.\n       Clark University.\n       The College Board.\n       Council of Chief State School Officers.\n       Lesley College, School of Education.\n       University of California.\n       University of Massachusetts.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in 1996, what is basically the most \nimportant document that has been published on the need for getting \nhigh-quality teachers for the children of this country has been \npublished by the National Commission on Teaching in America's Future, \nin September of 1996--``What Matters Most: Teaching for America's \nFuture.'' There are many other studies and documents, but I think this \nis about as fine a document as we could have. In our Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, we relied on it very substantially, but \nnot completely. We had over 20 days of hearings on our elementary and \nsecondary education bill. Nonetheless, this document was, I thought, \nvery profound.\n  The problem in making recommendations is about how to address them. I \nwill take a moment to read the major flaws in teacher preparation:\n\n       For new teachers, improving standards begins with teacher \n     preparation. Prospective teachers learn just as other \n     students do: by studying, practicing, and reflecting; by \n     collaborating with others; by looking closely at students and \n     their work; and by sharing what they see. For prospective \n     teachers, this kind of learning cannot occur in college \n     classrooms divorced from schools or in schools divorced from \n     current research.\n       Yet, until recently, most teacher education programs taught \n     theory separately from application. Teachers were taught to \n     teach in lecture halls from texts and teachers who frequently \n     had not themselves ever practiced what they were teaching. \n     Students' courses on subject matter were disconnected from \n     their courses on teaching methods, which were in turn \n     disconnected from their courses on learning and development. \n     They often encountered entirely different ideas in their \n     student teaching, which made up a tiny taste of practice \n     added on, without connections, to the end of their course \n     work.\n\n  Mr. President, they made a series of recommendations about what we \nought to do. One was to reinvent teacher preparation and professional \ndevelopment. It included professional development in the schools \nthemselves. Also, it talked about the importance of mentoring. Those \nare two very important features which have been left out in terms of \nthis underlying appropriations bill which were included in our \nauthorization bill.\n  Then, further, it goes on and says:\n\n       . . . fix teacher recruitment and put qualified teachers in \n     every classroom.\n\n  That was one of the very strong commitments that we had in our \nDemocratic proposal, our Democratic commitment for the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act--a commitment to American families that we \nwould put a well-qualified teacher in every classroom in this country \nwithin 4 years.\n  Look at what happened last year across this country, where school \ndistricts hired 50,000 unqualified teachers. This isn't a problem of \njust 1996, this is a problem of the year 2000 and 2001. We have to \naddress it.\n  So where are we in terms of these recommendations that we took to \nheart in a very bipartisan way--which I will come back to--in terms of \nour Elementary and Secondary Education Act?\n  In this legislation, there is effectively no new money for teacher \npreparation. We are going to have level funding for title II of the \nHigher Education Act. This is what is requested; $98 million was \nrequested last year and $98 million for this year. So there is \nvirtually no increase. There will be absolutely no new Federal \nparticipation in working with States and local communities in terms of \nenhanced teacher recruitment--zero, none.\n  If you look at what is happening in this last year, as this money is \nbeing expended in 2000, where the grants are being made, now, it is \nonly the difference between $77 million and $98 million because about \n95 percent of the $77 million is carried through in 2- to 3-year \nprograms. So the current situation is that over a 2-year period, with \nthe demand for 2.2 million teachers, our Federal response has been to \nprovide $21 million to help States and local communities go out and \nrecruit teachers, when we have a need for 2.2 million of them. That is \neffectively wrong. We cannot do that. It is so important, and I will \ncome back to this.\n\n  Let me just show you here what happened. For the $77 million that we \nhad, we had 366 total applicants, but only 77 applications could be \nfunded. We had 5 times the number of applications for the number of \ngrants available. The desire is out there. The interest is out there. \nParents and local communities want this kind of help and assistance. We \nare funding one out of five. And this is what is happening, also: We \nare expecting $21 million in grants for this current year, zero for \nnext year. We expect that 11 applications will be funded out of 141 \ntotal applications. That is more than 12 times the number. People \nacross this country--States, educational centers, local communities--\nwant the help. One of the most important aspects of education is having \nwell-trained teachers. What I find so troublesome is the fact that we \nworked out a bipartisan effort in the Higher Education Act of 1998, \nwhich is basically what this is all about.\n  It is about funding the provisions in the 1998 Higher Education Act. \nWhen we authorized the Higher Education Act in 1998, we had strong \nbipartisan support. Efforts were led by Senators Reed, Bingaman, \nJeffords, and Gregg. Our goal was to create a program to address the \nNation's needs and to recruit better qualified teachers to enter the \nclassroom. Each day, we agreed on that basic principle.\n  I hope our colleagues will agree to give it the full support it \ndeserves.\n  Senator DeWine during the course of the debate on title II:\n\n       Really, there is nothing more important in regard to \n     education than the teacher. Our children deserve to be taught \n     by teachers who really understand their subject, understand \n     the subject matter.\n       I have worked hard to incorporate measures concerning good \n     teaching into this bill. I want to thank Chairman Jeffords \n     for the\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\n     assistance that he has given me and the cooperation in \n     getting these sections incorporated into this very good bill.\n\n  Senator Jeffords:\n\n       As its foundation, Title II embraces the notion that \n     investing in the preparation of our nation's teachers is a \n     good one. Well-prepared teachers play a key role in making it \n     possible for our students to achieve the standards required \n     to assure both their own well being and the ability of our \n     country to compete internationally.\n\n  Senator McCain on July 8:\n\n       Another important component of this bill is the \n     establishment of a comprehensive program promoting statewide \n     reforms to enhance the performance of teachers in the \n     classroom by improving the quality of teacher training. \n     Having professional, well-trained teachers is an essential \n     component for ensuring that our children achieve high \n     educational standards.\n\n  Senator Smith of Oregon:\n\n       By improving the quality of teacher training and \n     recruitment, increasing the purchasing power of students \n     through Pell grants and other forms of student assistance, \n     and by improving access to higher education for students with \n     disabilities, this legislation provides opportunity for the \n     young people of our Nation to seek a higher education.\n\n  The list goes on and on. It keeps going on, with the exception to \nstop when it comes to putting funding into these kinds of commitments.\n  These are efforts that have been made in a bipartisan way to try to \nget an effective program and partnership with the State and local \ncommunities. Effectively, we are zeroing this out. We had $21 million \nprovided for this last year. That is wrong.\n  Research shows that the national need for high-quality teachers is \ngrowing:\n  Doing What Matters Most: Investing in Quality Teaching, November \n1997:\n\n       Nationally, relatively few teachers have access to \n     sustained, intensive professional development about their \n     subject matter, teaching methods, or new technologies.\n\n  National Center for Education Services, The Baby Boom Echo Report, \n1998:\n\n       An estimated 2.2 million teachers will be needed over the \n     next 10 years to make up for a large number of teachers \n     nearing retirement and rapid enrollment growth.\n\n  One thing is for sure: They are not getting them in here. The Federal \nGovernment is AWOL on that issue of education.\n  What matters most is teaching for America's future.\n  The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future found that \nmore than 50,000 people who lack the training for the job enter \nteaching annually on emergency or provisional licenses. And, 30-50% of \nteachers leave within the first three to five years. In urban district, \nthe attrition rate can be 30-50% in the first year.\n  That is what is happening. You get them in there, and they leave, \nunless you have some very important changes, such as providing skills \nfor teachers who will be working with newer teachers in situations \ninvolving mentoring, where we have seen these figures change \ndramatically and where teachers will remain and work in these \ncommunities.\n  The Urban Teacher Challenge Report of January 2000:\n\n       One hundred percent of 40 urban school districts surveyed \n     have an urgent need for teachers in at least one subject \n     area. 95% of urban districts report a critical need for match \n     teachers; 98% report a critical need in science; and 97% \n     report a critical need in special education.\n\n  There it is. In urban areas across the country: No math, no science, \nno special education. We are asking ourselves: What can we do as a \nnation to try to make a difference for children in our country? I don't \nknow how many more studies we have to have. I am not saying if you just \npour buckets of money, it is going to solve the problem. But one thing \nwe know is that without the investment of resources in these areas, we \nare not going to solve it either.\n  My colleagues will speak about other aspects. But we need investment \nin terms of recruitment and professional development and in terms of \nmentoring.\n  Listen to the results of some of these studies.\n\n       ``Teacher Quality and Student Achievement'', Linda Darling-\n     Hammond, December 1999: The states that repeatedly lead the \n     nation in math and reading achievement have among the \n     nation's most highly qualified teachers and have made long-\n     standing investments in the quality of teaching. The top \n     scoring states--Minnesota, North Dakota, and Iowa, recently \n     joined by Wisconsin, Maine, and Montana--all have rigorous \n     standards for teaching that include requiring extensive study \n     of education plus a major in the field to be taught. By \n     contrast, states such as Georgia and South Carolina, where \n     reform initiatives across a comparable period focused on \n     curriculum and testing but invested less in teacher learning, \n     showed little success in raising student achievement within \n     this timeframe.\n\n  Do we have that? What are the conclusions? If you invest more in \nquality teachers and recruiting, and providing and keeping professional \nenhancement and mentoring, you are going to have the corresponding \nresults in enhanced academic achievement.\n  That is what these reports show. If you do not do this, and spend the \nmoney in other ways, which you could do with the general funds--which I \nwould call the block grant way--you find that you are failing the \nchildren in those particular areas.\n\n       1996 Mathematics Report Card for the Nation and the States, \n     and 1994 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States \n     (National Assessment of Education Progress): Over the last \n     decade of reform, North Carolina and Connecticut have made \n     sizable investments in major statewide increases in teacher \n     salaries and intensive recruitment efforts and initiatives to \n     improve preservice teacher education, licensing, beginning \n     teacher mentoring, and ongoing professional development. \n     Since then, North Carolina has posted among the largest \n     students achievement gains in math and reading of any state \n     in the nation, now scoring well above the national average in \n     4th grade reading and math, although it entered the 1990s \n     near the bottom of the state rankings. Connecticut has also \n     posted significant gains, becoming one of the top scoring \n     states in the nation in math and reading, despite an increase \n     in the proportion of students with special needs during that \n     time.\n\n  That has impacted many of our communities. Many of our communities \nare increasingly challenged with a wide expansion of diversity that \neventually, of course, adds such extraordinary value to these \ncommunities. But they initially put additional kinds of pressures on \neducation institutions and other institutions. That has been true in \nConnecticut, and it has been true in my own State of Massachusetts.\n  What does this report say? The report says that when you have sizable \ninvestments and intensive recruitment efforts and initiatives to \nimprove preservice teacher educating, licensing, beginning teacher \nmentoring, and ongoing professional development, you see dramatic \nincreases in the quality of education for these children.\n  I think that would be fairly self-evident for people in this Chamber \nto understand. We certainly understood it in the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions committee. It was understood there. As I pointed \nout, there is broad bipartisan support for those particular provisions.\n  We find that the various studies--I mentioned just a few of them--are \ncompelling and convincing, and those who wrote those studies made \npresentations which were compelling. Others, in response to those \nmeasures, indicated they were compelling.\n  I see Senator Reed. I understand I only have 10 minutes left. I yield \nmyself 3 more minutes.\n  Let me point out exactly what this amendment does.\n  My amendment increases the appropriation for the Teacher Quality \nEnhancement Grants from $98 million in the underlying FY2001 Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill to the \nfull authorization level of $300 million to enable much greater \nparticipation in this vital program to improve teacher preparation and \nrecruitment.\n  This increase in appropriations from $98 million to $300 million will \nhelp fund over 100 additional partnerships.\n  The Teacher Quality Enhancement Program provides three types of \ngrants to improve teacher training and recruitment:\n  One, local partnership grant to improve teacher training; two, State \ngrants are to implement statewide teacher reform efforts; and three, \nlocal partnerships for State grants to focus on innovative teacher \nrecruit programs.\n  The teacher quality enhancement grants support local partnerships \namong teachers, institutions, and local schools to help improve in many \nways the quality of teachers entering the classroom. By increasing the \ncooperation between college programs that prepare new teachers in the \nschools that hire the teachers, teachers obtain\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\nthe effective training they need to teach in classroom settings. The \nprospective teachers have more opportunities to observe successful \nveteran teachers and obtain feedback.\n  I urge the Senate to support this amendment to increase the funding \nfor this critical program so more of the Nation's schools and \ncommunities can improve teacher training programs. The Nation's \nchildren deserve no less.\n  Under the current proposal in the Senate, there is no new money for \nteacher preparation level for title II. There is minimal increase in \nthe Eisenhower program, which effectively had been block granted in the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, so it may disappear completely. \nThere are no funds for mentoring or recruitment. I think the bipartisan \nprogram that passed out of our human resources committee on higher \neducation considered these various measures and had bipartisan support. \nI think we ought to give life to those recommendations. That is what \nthis amendment does.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I prefer to hear the balance of the \nargument of the proponents of the amendment before responding.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 8 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 30 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank Senator Kennedy for yielding and for sponsoring \nthis amendment. He has grasped the most critical aspect of educational \nreform in the United States today--improving the quality of teachers. \nHe has simply brought forward the bipartisan, unanimous consent we \nreached in the Higher Education Act amendments of 1998 where, in the \nvote of 96-0, we passed the teacher quality enhancement grants program. \nWe authorized a magnificent program on a unanimous vote, but we have \nfailed to fully fund it. If we have the plan, but not the money, we are \nnot going to succeed.\n  Senator Kennedy is simply saying, we have a good plan, let's put the \nresources behind it.\n  We understand we need to have high-quality teachers to meet the \nchallenges of the 21st century classroom. These challenges are \ndifferent from 50, 30, 20, even 10 years ago. It is no longer \nsufficient for a student to go to a teacher college and learn about \npedagogy and then go into the classroom. They need to have clinical \nexposure. They must have real-life experiences in the classroom before \nthey become new teachers.\n  They also have to understand their subject matter. Technique is one \naspect, but it can't substitute for detailed knowledge of the subject--\nbe it science, history, or mathematics. They also have to understand \nhow to integrate technology, which is at the key of most of the \nbreakthroughs in education in the United States today.\n  They have to be able to deal with a diverse population of students, \nsome with limited English proficiency, some who are coming from \ncultures much different from the culture in which the teacher grew up.\n  All of this necessitates significant reform in our educational \npractice. That is why, in the Higher Education Act, I worked closely \nwith my colleague, Senator Kennedy, and others to develop partnerships \nbetween teacher colleges and elementary and secondary schools--real \npartnerships where aspiring teachers can get the clinical experience, \nand the other things necessary to be prepared for today's classrooms. \nIt is similar to the model of physician training. We would never send a \nphysician into an operating room simply with a few lectures on theory. \nIt is practice, practice, practice, before they are allowed to operate. \nIt should be the same for teachers.\n  We can't do that unless we fully fund the teacher quality grants. \nThey cover the spectrum. First, they provide the opportunity for these \npartnerships to develop. Second, they support statewide reforms. Third, \nthey allow for recruitment of teachers, particularly to reduce \nshortages of qualified teachers in high-need school districts.\n  We will need 2 million new teachers over the next 10 years because of \nthe changing population of teachers, retiring teachers who are leaving, \nand the increase of our student population entering first grade and \nkindergarten. Look at any urban school district in this country, and \nyou will see they are suffering severe teacher shortages. Recruitment \nis necessary.\n  We also need to stimulate partnerships that are so essential between \ncolleges of education and elementary and secondary schools.\n  Last year, $77 million was available for new grants. Mr. President, \n366 applications were received--a huge response--from States and local \nschool districts. This is a popular program. The Department of \nEducation could only fund 77: 25 local partnerships, 24 State grants, \nand 28 teacher recruitment grants. Rhode Island, I am proud to say, got \na State grant and is using it very well.\n  This year, however, only $21 million was available for new grants. \nThere were 141 applicants, but the Department of Education estimates \nthey will only be able to fund 11 grants--1 in 12. The need is there \nand the plan is there; the resources are lacking. That is why we are \nhere today.\n  We want to fully fund this program up to the authorized total of $300 \nmillion, creating an additional 100 partnerships, State and recruitment \ngrants. This will help meet the demand and do the one thing that is so \ncritical to education reform in this country, which is not questioned \nby anyone, evidenced by a 96-0 vote in this Chamber approving the \nprogram: We have to enhance the quality of teachers in this country. We \ncan't do it just with admonitions. We can't do it just with sentiments. \nWe have to do it with dollars.\n  We have a program that works. We have a popular program. We just \ndon't have the resources. Senator Kennedy's amendment, which I am proud \nto cosponsor, will give us the resources to do the job.\n  I thank the Senator. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the bill which has been reported out by \nthe Appropriations Committee appropriates some $40.2 billion to \neducation funding, an increase of $4.6 billion over last year. This \nbill has $100 million more than the President asked for. We have \nassessed the priorities as the subcommittee saw them and as the full \ncommittee saw them and have made very substantial increases in very \nmany important accounts.\n  For example, on the title I grants, there is an increase of $394 \nmillion, bringing the total to $8.3 billion. On the 21st Century \nAfterschool Program, there is an increase of $146 million, coming to \n$600 million. On special education, where we have made an extraordinary \neffort to try to have the Federal Government meet its obligation, we \nhave made an increase of $1.3 billion to $7.3 billion. On title VI \ninnovative education State grants, we had an increase--this was \nconsidered so important--from $400 million to $3.1 billion. On Pell \ngrants, we had an increase of $350, to $3,650, a very important grant \nprogram enabling people to go to college. On the higher education \nprograms, we had an increase of $165 million to $1.7 billion.\n  The amendment which the Senator from Massachusetts has offered is a \nvery worthwhile amendment. I do not deny that for a moment. If we had \nmore funding, I would be glad to see us increase the money in that \naccount by what the Senator from Massachusetts would like to have. But \nthe difficulty is that we have assessed the priorities. We have \nstretched the subcommittee allocation to $104.5 billion. That is the \nmaximum amount which could be obtained, consistent with the wishes of \nour caucus. In fact, that is stretching the matter.\n  Last year, we lost some 20 members of the Republican caucus of 55 \nbecause there was too much money in the bill as it was viewed on our \nside of the aisle. But we have come in here with $104.5 billion and \nmade allocations as we see fit, as we assessed the priorities.\n  Regrettably, I could not be on the floor yesterday to debate the \nWellstone amendment and the Bingaman amendment and the Murray amendment \nbecause I was busy on a Judiciary Committee hearing where I have the \nresponsibility to chair the subcommittee\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\non the Department of Justice oversight. If time permits today, I am \ngoing to talk a little bit about that. But when Senator Wellstone \noffered an amendment for $1.7 billion to increase title I funding, I \nwould, frankly, like to see that funding done. Title I is very \nimportant, but I had to vote against it because it is a matter of \nassessing the priorities.\n  When Senator Bingaman offered a $250 million increase, again on title \nI, it was very meritorious. There is no higher priority, in my opinion, \nthan education. The only priority which equals education is health \ncare.\n  The allocations which our subcommittee has made have to take into \naccount education and health care. We have increased the funding very \nmaterially on the National Institutes of Health and on drug \nrehabilitation programs and on school violence programs--all of which \nhave to come out of the overall funding of $104.5 billion.\n  Senator Murray offered an amendment on class size, wanting to add \n$350 million. She disagreed with what the committee has done on the \nsubcommittee recommendation, meeting the President's request for $1.4 \nbillion for teachers to reduce class size. But we added a provision, if \nthe local school districts want to use it for something else, they \ncould get their share somewhere else.\n  So we come now to the amendment which is pending. It was just \nauthorized in 1997-1998. There was no appropriation for support for \nteacher quality and professional development in 1998. In fiscal year \n1999, there was an allocation of $77 million. It went up last year to \n$98 million. It is true, the funding has leveled.\n  I heard the Senator from Massachusetts say this funding is an \nindictment. That is just a figure of speech, but if it is an \nindictment, the President is included as well as the Appropriations \nCommittee because that is the President's request. The President has \nalready issued a veto threat on the bill because he doesn't like our \nallocations and our priorities. But the last time I read the \nConstitution, the Congress has the appropriations responsibility. \nCertainly the President has to sign the bill, or we can have passage \nover the veto, but we have established the priorities. On this matter \nof teacher quality and professional development, we have met the \nPresident's figure.\n  I approached the Senator from Massachusetts for some light talk \nbefore the amendment was offered. I said: Senator Kennedy, how much \nmoney do we have to have in the bill so as to preclude a Kennedy \namendment to add money? I ask him that every year. I want to know what \nthe answer is next year, so we can bring a bill, hopefully, which would \nhave sufficient money. But if it is $1.4 billion for class size, \nsomeone is going to offer an amendment for more money. Senator Murray \ndid so, for $350 million more. Whatever the amount of money we put in, \nsomebody is going to offer an amendment for more money.\n  I said last year, in voting against the add-ons, that I had cast more \ndifficult votes that I did not like in the 4 days I managed this bill \nthan I had cast in the previous 18 years I had been in the Senate \nbecause I am a firm believer in education.\n\n  In the Specter household, my parents had very little. My mother went \nto the eighth grade; my father, an immigrant, had no formal education. \nMy brother and two sisters and I have been able to share in the \nAmerican dream because of educational opportunity. I have been on this \nsubcommittee for my entire tenure in the Senate, and I am doing \neverything I can to promote education in America so everybody has the \nmaximum opportunity.\n  I would like to spend more money on teacher recruitment, teacher \ndevelopment, but it cannot be done within the confines of the very \nenormous allocation we have at the present time.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have left on the 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 22 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments and \nhis explanation. But the fact remains, these allocations are within a \ncontext about how we are going to allocate resources in the Federal \nGovernment. This explanation we heard is in the context of a 10-year, \n$792 billion tax cut. If we did not have the $792 billion tax cut, we \nwould have the opportunity to do more.\n  I personally believe this is a higher priority. I think most of us on \nthis side of the aisle believe that it is a higher priority than having \na tax cut and putting on the squeeze, in terms of improving quality of \neducation. That is philosophical and that is decided in this body, \nwhere the majority are the Republicans and where they have had the \nvotes in order to be able to do that. But that is the harsh truth.\n  The fact is, in more recent years, between 1980 and 1999, we are \nfinding out the support for elementary and secondary education is \nfalling down, and in higher education it is falling down.\n  Against that background, we have the explosion of the number of \nchildren who are going on to schools, K-12 schools. These are the \nnumbers--54 million. I don't think we can do business as usual. I don't \nthink it is a matter of shifting priorities from here to there on this \nmatter, and shuffling the debt. I respect the Senator from \nPennsylvania's strong commitment to education and health. There is \nnobody in this body who doubts it. But we are talking about the broader \nissue, and that is, given the announcement yesterday that we are going \nto have a $750 billion surplus in addition to what was expected, \nwhether we are going to be able to find some $300 million to improve \nthe quality of education, and do it in a program that has strong \nbipartisan support, that is what this is about. That is really what is \nat issue.\n  With regard to our program, in the legislation, the national \ncommission, they say:\n\n       We recommend that colleges and schools work with the States \n     to redesign teacher education so that the 2 million teachers \n     hired in the next decade are adequately prepared.\n\n  Then they list the various criteria:\n\n       . . . stronger disciplinary preparation, greater focus on \n     learning, more knowledge about curricula, greater \n     understanding of special needs, multicultural competence, \n     preparation for collaboration, technological skills, and \n     strong emphasis on reflection.\n\n  Those have all been incorporated in our underlying amendment, which \nwe are trying to fund. That is why it had the strong bipartisan \nsupport. Without this amendment, we have, effectively, flat funding. In \nour appropriation priorities, we are saying to the American people that \nwe are not going to fund resources to provide the best teachers in the \nclassrooms of America. I think we ought to be able to do so.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 22 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, with respect to the argument on \neducation, it is a matter of priorities. We have a very extensive \nallocation of $104.5 billion. Much as I would like to see additional \nfunding for teacher training and teacher recruitment, it is simply a \nmatter of priorities. I am constrained to oppose the amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                          Independent Counsel\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in my remaining time, or at least in a \nportion of it, I think it worthwhile to comment on the very extensive \nhearing which was held by the Judiciary Committee yesterday on the \nissue of independent counsel because the matter is now pending before \nthe Attorney General of the United States as to whether independent \ncounsel ought to be appointed.\n  The subcommittee on the Department of Justice oversight has conducted \nextensive hearings. Even before the subcommittee began its hearing \nprocess, this is an issue which I raised with the Attorney General on \njudiciary oversight more than 3 years ago in April of 1997. At that \ntime, I raised the question of hard money and have consistently called \nfor an investigation. We had the Chairman and Vice Chairman of the \nFederal Election Commission testify a week ago today on current \ncomplaints which have been stated by Common Cause and by Century 21, \nthat both political parties ought to be investigated for abuses on soft \nmoney and for coordination of soft money with their campaign accounts. \nI have long contended that the investigations ought to be as to both \nparties\n\n[[Page S5949]]\n\non a bipartisan or on a nonpartisan basis.\n  The issue, as I say, was raised first in April of 1997. FBI Director \nFreeh then made a request for independent counsel. That recommendation \nto the Attorney General was in November of 1997. Charles LaBella, who \nwas appointed by the Attorney General as special counsel, made a \nsimilar request for independent counsel in July of 1998.\n  Within a week after the Freeh report was issued, I asked for a copy \nand was denied that. Within a week after the LaBella report was issued, \nI requested a copy and was denied that. We finally received those \ndocuments when Judiciary Committee subpoenas were issued, returnable on \nthe 20th of April.\n  Then it came to light when Vice President Gore announced that he had \nbeen questioned by the new chief of the task force, Robert Conrad, that \nthe matter was still open. Somehow, notwithstanding the fact that the \nVice President had been questioned on four prior occasions, no \nquestions were ever asked on two matters which had received very \nsubstantial publicity: the Hsi Lai Buddhist Temple fundraiser and the \nissue of coffees in the White House.\n  As a result of the investigation of the judiciary subcommittee, we \ndetermined that Mr. Conrad had made a recommendation to the Attorney \nGeneral again for independent counsel, just like the LaBella \nrecommendation, just like the Freeh recommendation. Mr. Conrad \ntestified before our subcommittee a week ago today and declined to \nrespond to questions about that matter. It was my judgment that it was \na matter for the public to know. The public had a right to know. There \nwas a necessity for the public to know if we were to have \naccountability by the Attorney General. As is the established custom as \na subcommittee chairman, I made that public disclosure which was in \naccordance with our practice and something where there was solid \njustification for doing so.\n  In the hearing which we had with the Attorney General yesterday, it \nhad been scheduled long before the disclosure was made that Mr. Conrad \nhad made a recommendation of independent counsel. We went over with the \nAttorney General quite a number of factors, starting with the \nstatements which Attorney General Reno had made during her confirmation \nhearing in 1993.\n  The Attorney General--then not the Attorney General but the district \nattorney of Dade County in Miami, FL--came in and asked for our support \nand our votes, and I voted for her in the Judiciary Committee and on \nthe floor, in part because of her strong stand that the Independent \nCounsel Act was an important act. She said this during her confirmation \nhearings:\n\n       It is absolutely essential for the public to have \n     confidence in the system, and you cannot do that when there \n     is a conflict or an appearance of conflict in the person who \n     is, in effect, the chief prosecutor.\n\n  The Attorney General serves at the pleasure of the President who \nappoints her and is obviously very close to the President and to the \nVice President.\n  Attorney General Reno further said at her confirmation hearing:\n\n       The credibility and public confidence engendered with the \n     fact that an independent and impartial outsider has examined \n     the evidence and concluded prosecution is not warranted \n     serves to clear a public official's name in a way that no \n     Justice Department investigation ever could.\n\n  She quoted from Archibald Cox who said:\n\n       The public could never feel easy about the vigor and \n     thoroughness with which the investigation was pursued. Some \n     outside person is absolutely essential.\n\n  It is in that context that the evidence was examined in our hearing \nyesterday as to whether independent counsel should have been appointed \nas to the Vice President and as to the President as well.\n  As to the Vice President, the issue arose about the veracity of \nstatements which he made about telephone calls raising hard money from \nthe White House. If the money was so-called soft money, it was not a \ncontribution and not covered by the act. But if it was hard money, then \nthere could be a violation of the act. The Vice President was \nquestioned about that and said he did not raise hard money, did not \nknow that hard money was to be raised.\n  I questioned the Attorney General at some length about the specifics \nwhich had been produced. For example, there were four witnesses who \ntestified that at a meeting on November 21, 1995, hard money was \ndiscussed, certainly probative raising the inference that if a Vice \nPresident is at a meeting where hard money is discussed, he knew he was \nraising hard money or that hard money was the objective.\n  Leon Panetta, White House Chief of Staff, was very blunt about his \ntestimony that the Vice President was there and listening and said the \npurpose of the meeting was ``to make sure they''--the President and \nVice President--``knew what the hell was going on.''\n  The Attorney General and I had a protracted discussion about the fact \nthat she discounted the evidence from David Strauss who was the deputy \nChief of Staff for the Vice President who had made contemporaneous \nnotes at this November 21, 1995, meeting: ``Sixty-five percent soft, 35 \npercent hard.''\n  Mr. Strauss said he could not remember. Notwithstanding that, the law \nof evidence is conclusive that if there is prior recollection recorded \nand a contemporaneous record made, that is evidence which can go before \na grand jury or before a court.\n  The attorney said he did not remember, even after he looked at his \nnotes. That raises an evidentiary report of prior recollection \nrefreshed, and that is evidence. Even if a person does not now \nremember, if they had notes and that refreshes their recollection, the \nperson may testify from the notes on the approach of current \nrecollection refreshed. It does not rule out what his notes had on \nprior recollection recorded, even though he could not remember it. That \nwas some very important evidence.\n  In addition, the Vice President received 13 memoranda from Harold \nIckes who was involved and running the campaign. Those 13 memoranda \nrecited hard money. The Vice President said he did not read the \nmemoranda. That is a question which would call for further \ninvestigation.\n  The memoranda were put in his in box. And a secretary testified that \nthe input was culled very carefully to keep out extraneous matters. But \nthe Ickes memoranda always went in.\n  Then the Vice President further said that: The subject matter of the \nmemoranda would have already been disclosed in his and the President's \npresence.\n  The Vice President further conceded, in interviews with the FBI--he \nacknowledged that he had ``been a candidate for 16 years and thought he \nhad a good understanding of hard and soft money.''\n  It is important to focus on the fact that the matters presented to \nthe Attorney General are not such that would warrant a prosecution, but \nonly that the matters call for further investigation.\n  The independent counsel statute is very carefully structured so that \nthe Department of Justice does not do very much. The Department of \nJustice only makes a preliminary inquiry, and then, in the language of \nthe statute, ``The Attorney General, on completion of a preliminary \ninvestigation, determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe \nthat further investigation is warranted.''\n  The others who were present at the meeting, who ``did not recall,'' \nshould have been called before a grand jury, which the Attorney General \ncannot do on her preliminary inquiry. That is to keep the Department of \nJustice really out of it, but to turn it over to an independent counsel \nat an early stage.\n  The Attorney General did say yesterday that they did not submit this \nto a grand jury. Certainly that is the next step. When witnesses are \nquestioned, it is one thing, but it is quite another to come into the \nformality of a grand jury, under oath, and to be asked questions. That \nis why there is the provision for further investigation.\n  The Attorney General testified yesterday, relying on her submission \nto the court declining the appointment of independent counsel, that \n``the Government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.'' That \nsaid, the standard for further investigation for appointment of \nindependent counsel does not involve proof beyond a reasonable doubt, \nit is only that there is reason to have a further investigation.\n  I shall not characterize the Attorney General or draw conclusions at \nthis\n\n[[Page S5950]]\n\nstage, but only lay out the facts and suggest that on the face of the \nvery substantial materials produced, further investigation was required \nand independent counsel should have been appointed.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the subject then arose as to what were \nthe factors related to the famous fundraiser at the Hsi Lai Buddhist \nTemple on April 29, 1996.\n  The Vice President had received an e-mail from his scheduler asking \nwhether there should be another stop on the April 29 itinerary on top \nof the ``two fundraisers in San Jose and LA.''\n  The Vice President responded:\n\n       If we have already booked the fundraisers, then we have to \n     decline.\n\n  But the Vice President said he did not know there were any \nfundraisers, that the Hsi Lai Temple was a fundraiser.\n  Then Harold Ickes sent the Vice President a memorandum on April 10 \nidentifying the Los Angeles fundraiser which would raise $250,000 and a \nsupplemental memorandum on April 25 saying the Los Angeles fundraiser \nwould raise up to $325,000. Within 24 hours of receiving this \nmemorandum, the Vice President was given briefing materials from the \nDemocratic National Committee informing him that the DNC luncheon he \nwould attend on April 29 was at the Buddhist temple.\n  During the course of the event, two of the guests who ate lunch with \nthe Vice President talked about fundraising. Witnesses there said--\n``One speaker commented that they had raised x amount of dollars.'' And \nanother witness at the luncheon said that a speaker took the podium and \nreassured the assembled guests that they had ``doubled checked'' and it \nwas ``OK to give contributions at the Buddhist temple.''\n\n  So here again, there are substantial indicators which certainly would \ncall for going forward with independent counsel.\n  Then the question was raised about the coffees which raised more than \n$26 million. When the Vice President was questioned about the coffees--\nand the Vice President released the transcript--he said:\n  Question:\n\n       In terms of a fundraising tool, what was the purpose of the \n     coffees?\n\n  His response was:\n\n       I don't know.\n\n  Then he was asked:\n\n       With respect to raising $108 million, did you have \n     discussions with anybody concerning the role coffees would \n     play in raising that type of money?\n\n  The answer of the Vice President:\n\n       Well, let me define the term ``raising.''\n\n  Shades of what ``is'' is.\n  Later, he was questioned:\n\n       You had indicated earlier you may have attended one coffee. \n     What were you talking about?\n\n  His response:\n\n       Although it was not my practice to go to any of these \n     coffees, there may have been one that I attended briefly.\n\n  The Vice President's lawyer then submitted a letter 2 days later, \nsaying:\n\n       As best we can determine from the Vice President's \n     schedule, he was designated to attend four White House \n     coffees. The Vice President hosted approximately 21 coffees \n     at the Old Executive Office Building.\n\n  Here again, those matters require further inquiry.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I raised a question with the Attorney \nGeneral as to why the Department of Justice went to ask the Vice \nPresident these questions on April 18. The apparent reason was that the \nsubcommittee had finally gotten subpoenas out to get the Freeh and \nLaBella memoranda returnable on April 20.\n  So the subcommittee would soon find out that the Vice President had \nnever been questioned about the Buddhist temple fundraiser or about the \ncoffee klatsches and that, in fact, the Department of Justice was \nembarrassed by that omission.\n  I believe the Attorney General did a substantial disservice to the \nVice President in failing to have these matters resolved one way or \nanother at an early stage.\n  I said at the outset, last Thursday, when I discussed the matter as \nto the Conrad recommendation for independent counsel, that there is a \nsharp distinction between the level of information evidenced to call \nfor an independent counsel's investigation and the level to return a \ncriminal prosecution.\n  I raised a question with the Attorney General yesterday that her \nfailure to act on these matters in 1997, and when Director Freeh called \nfor an independent counsel in 1998, and when LaBella called for an \nindependent counsel, has now put the 2000 Presidential elections in \nsome state of controversy. These matters should have been cleared up. \nWhy the questioning on April 18?\n  If independent counsel is appointed now, can there possibly be a \ndetermination to clear the Vice President before the Democratic \nconvention in August? It seems highly unlikely.\n  If independent counsel or special counsel is appointed now, is there \ntime to resolve the matter before the general election? It seems highly \nunlikely.\n  So that by delaying, it really is too late, at this point, to have \nspecial counsel. And that is a responsibility which falls squarely with \nthe Department of Justice and the Attorney General for failing to \nappoint independent counsel in a timely manner.\n  It is puzzling why the matter would be reinvestigated and re-inquired \ninto on April 18. The reason is obvious--so they would not be further \nembarrassed by not having asked about these two matters before. But \nwhat is to be done at this stage?\n  All of this leads to a conclusion that there ought to be some form of \njudicial review on the Attorney General's judgment on an independent \ncounsel. I had tried for a long time to have a mandamus action brought \nto take it for judicial review to see if an independent counsel should \nhave been appointed under the mandatory provisions of the statute or \nthe discretionary provisions where there was an abuse of discretion. \nThe problem was one of standing.\n  It would be my recommendation to the subcommittee that the \nsubcommittee recommend that there be provision for standing to the \nJudiciary Committee to bring an action for judicial review to have a \ncourt determine whether an independent counsel should be appointed \nbecause of an abuse of discretion by the Attorney General or because of \nmandatory provisions of a new statute. This will be a very constructive \nresult, so we do not find ourselves in a situation where these \nquestions linger for more than 3 years and cannot really be resolved \nbefore the conventions and so that the Democratic Party would know who \ntheir candidate ought to be or what baggage that candidate would have.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I follow boxing. When I was a younger man, I \ndid some boxing of my own.\n  One of the things I remember more than anything else regarding fights \nis when Evander Holyfield fought Mike Tyson. You remember the famous \nfight where they were in the ring and suddenly Mike Tyson was chewing \nand biting on Evander Holyfield's ear. That was unfair. It was \nunnecessary. Mills Lane, the referee, said: You shouldn't do that.\n  They come out again. He does it again.\n  I feel, with all due respect to my good friend from Pennsylvania, \nthat that is kind of what has happened here.\n  The two leaders want to speed up this very important bill. The \nminority will do everything we can. We have agreed to a time when the \namendments could be filed. We have agreed that I will work, as other \nmembers of this conference will, to have some of the amendments \ndisappear. The majority leader wants to finish this bill today.\n  Instead, we have an anti-Gore campaign speech coming from nowhere.\n  If we want to do something about campaign finance, why don't we do\n\n[[Page S5951]]\n\nsomething in the Senate Chamber such as trying to outlaw campaign soft \nmoney? That would be a good step to take. We have been trying for years \nto have campaign finance reform. We have narrowed the issues. We will \nnow just take doing away with soft money. We will take that. But, no, \nwe are prevented from having a vote on that. Why? Because the majority \nwon't let us vote on it. So we have an anti-Gore campaign speech today \nby the manager of this bill.\n  I don't serve on the Judiciary Committee. I can't answer all the \nquestions that have been asked. I read the newspapers.\n  We know that the Attorney General is an impeccably honest person. For \nexample, when she was the chief law enforcement officer of Dade County, \nMiami, she would go to a car dealership to buy a car and would pay only \nthe sticker price on the window. She didn't want anyone thinking she \nwas getting some kind of a special deal from the car dealership. No one \ncan question the veracity of Janet Reno. She is an honest woman and has \nbeen a good Attorney General and has called things the way she believes \nthey should be.\n  I don't know anything about Conrad, other than he donated money to \nJesse Helms. The only donation he has made in his life was to Jesse \nHelms. I also find it interesting that this came out as a result of a \nleak, a leak from supposedly secret information.\n  Then my friend from Pennsylvania has the audacity to talk about an \nindependent counsel. We have had our fill of independent counsels, \nmajority and minority. We don't want anymore. They have harassed and \nberated President Reagan, President Clinton. Independent counsel is \nout. Remember, we didn't reauthorize that. Of course, we can, because \nthe law was in effect about the period of time the Senator from \nPennsylvania was talking about. We could have another independent \ncounsel, and maybe they could break the record of some of the others. \nFor example, Walsh, he was at $50 million or thereabouts. We have had a \ntag team on the Whitewater stuff. We will probably break all records \nthere. It will probably be about $75 or $80 million by the time that is \nfinished. We all should be a little suspect that this great concern has \ntaken place 4 months before the election.\n  To advance campaign finance reform, the House, in a bipartisan \nfashion, as they did last year, passed a bipartisan campaign finance \nbill that we had buried over here; it went no place--late at night \npassed a campaign finance bill to outlaw 527s. These are the secret \ncommittees that are formed. You don't have to list how much money you \ngive, who gives it, or why they give it. You list nothing. They are \nsecret. The House, in a bipartisan fashion, outlawed that yesterday.\n  Why don't we do that same thing in the Senate before the Fourth of \nJuly recess? If we want to do something to help the political process, \nlet's do that, rather than gin up all this stuff that is so patently \npolitical from my friend from Pennsylvania that anybody could see \nthrough it.\n  This is simply an effort to hurt Al Gore in his election against \nGeorge W. Bush. That is all it is about. Let's call it the way it is. \nYou can dress it in all kinds of clothes and be very self-righteous \nabout all this, but the fact is, this a campaign speech and a campaign \neffort to hurt Vice President Gore.\n  Let's talk about Vice President Gore. He also is an honest man, has a \nwonderful family; he is a religious man.\n  Now we have the ``bite on the ear'' this morning. I don't know how \nmuch we can take over here. We have worked very hard to move along the \nappropriations bills. The majority leader said: Work with us on these \nappropriations bills. It would be the right thing to.\n  We believe it is the right thing to do also. But we need the majority \nto go halfway. Do we now want Senators coming in here all day debating \nthis? We have Senator Leahy. We could have him come. He is ranking \nmember on the Judiciary Committee. He would be happy to come over and \nspend an hour or two talking about what went on in the Judiciary \nCommittee. We could have Bob Torricelli come over and spend an hour or \ntwo. He is articulate; he could do that. Is that what we want to happen \ntoday or do we want to go ahead with the Labor-HHS bill, a very \nimportant bill for the country?\n  I know the Presiding Officer believes strongly in the defense of this \ncountry. We should do the Defense authorization bill. We can't do the \nDefense authorization bill because it is tied up with campaign finance \nreform. If we did 527s, Senators McCain and Feingold would be happy to \nmove on to another issue and allow us to complete the Defense \nauthorization bill. A lot of items could be completed in the Senate. \nThe minority needs a little help to move these things along. We can't \nbe burdened, come Thursday afternoon or Wednesday night late, with: Why \naren't we moving this bill along? We are not getting cooperation.\n  With regard to the work we have ahead of us on this bill, right now \nwe have 88 amendments on the Democratic side--I don't know how many on \nthe Republican side--to try to get rid of before we are able to \ncomplete the bill. That takes a lot of time. I don't think we should be \ndiverted with this phony campaign finance issue, an attempt to \ninterject it into the Presidential race 4 months before the election.\n  I think the majority leader has to make a decision. Are we going to \nspend the day on campaign finance? We would be happy to do that. What \nwent on in the Judiciary Committee, we will come over and talk about it \nif that is what they want to do. I see my friend from Illinois, a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee. I think he has something to say. I \nthink he spent some time in the last few days in the Judiciary \nCommittee. Is that fair?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I was on the Judiciary Committee \nassignment and Government Affairs assignment in the last Congress, and \nI sat through literally 1 whole year of this under Chairman Thompson.\n  Mr. REID. Well, I didn't. I can only comment on what I read in the \npapers. But I know when somebody's ear is bitten, as Tyson did to \nHolyfield, and it is unfair; that is what happened here today. I am not \na member of the Judiciary Committee, but I am not going to let this go \non being unannounced. We are on a Labor-HHS bill, and we are getting a \nlot of pressure to do something about it. Here we have a campaign \nspeech in the middle of this bill, and that isn't fair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I might address the Senator from Nevada \nthrough the Chair, the situation we saw yesterday is clear evidence \nthat we are in the campaign season. Instead of dealing with issues that \nmany of us think are critical for families, such as prescription drugs \nand gun safety legislation, we are instead talking about further \ninvestigations.\n  I think there is a point where this Congress is expected to legislate \nrather than investigate. The closer we get to the election, I think the \nmore the American people discount some of the rhetoric they are hearing \non this issue.\n  Mr. REID. Well, if we want to do some work on this issue, then we \nwill spend the day doing it on this issue, if that is what the majority \nwants. Or, as I say, I make an invitation: If we want to do something \nconstructive about campaign finance reform, let's pass what the House \ndid last night and do it before the Fourth of July recess. Let's make a \ngoal when we get back, in that 3-week period, that we get rid of soft \nmoney, that corrupting influence on political campaigns.\n  Early in this century, there was a decision made by the Congress that \nwe would not have soft money, corporate money, in Federal elections. \nThe Supreme Court turned that on its head and now soft money is the \nmoney of choice, putting millions of dollars in these Federal \nelections. That is the invitation I make to the majority. Let's do 527 \ntomorrow and do soft money when we get back.\n  I know my time is gone. I want to move on with this bill. But the \nchoice is that of the majority as to what we are going to do. Are we \ngoing to do appropriations bills? Are we going to debate what went on \nin the Judiciary Committee for the last several days?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I believe I have 30 seconds left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Parliamentarian says there is no way to \nreserve that 30 seconds of time. All time did expire.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute.\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, and I don't intend to \nobject, but I have an amendment on the bill, a relevant amendment. If \nit is going to be much longer, I will come back in an hour. If we can \nget to it, I would like to do that or let me go, so I can do something \nelse.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Within the confines of 30 seconds, simply to reply, we \nare taking the time that we had on this amendment and nothing more. \nThis is not a matter that has arisen in 4 months but 3\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the \nBudget Act, as amended, that the effect of adopting the amendment \nprovides budgetary authority in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation under the fiscal year 2001 concurrent resolution on the \nbudget and is not in order.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act for the \nconsideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 51, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 153 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Inouye\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote the yeas are 51, the nays are 48. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained, and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, just so we know what is happening here, \nafter the Senator from Connecticut offers his amendment--I don't see \nthe manager of the bill--there was an understanding that Senator Kerry \nfrom Massachusetts would offer the next amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3672\n\n(Purpose: To provide $1,000,000,000 for 21st Century Community Learning \n                                Centers)\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3672.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . 21ST CENTURY COMMUNITY LEARNING CENTERS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the total \n     amount appropriated under this Act to carry out part I of \n     title X of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     shall be $1,000,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, very briefly, this is an amendment on the \n21st Century Community Learning Centers program.\n  Before getting to the substance of this amendment, I want to take a \nminute to thank my colleague from Pennsylvania and my colleague from \nIowa for the work they have done on this bill in a number of areas--and \nin the are of child care in particular. Last year, when I offered an \namendment to increase the funding for the Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania reluctantly \nopposed that amendment. In so doing, he said he would make every effort \nto raise the level up in this year's appropriation, which he did. I am \nvery pleased with the level of funding that he has provided for child \ncare.\n  So, while I am offering an amendment on afterschool, which is related \nin some ways to child care, I want to express my gratitude to the \nchairman of the subcommittee for his commitment to this issue and to \nour nation's families and children. As a result of the efforts of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa and their \ncolleagues on the committee, 220,000 children will have access to \naffordable childcare next year who would not have had the increase in \nfunding not been provided by the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Second, I commend Senator Kennedy for his amendment on teacher \nquality. I am sorry it had a point of order raised against it. Similar \nmotions have been made other Democratic education amendments--against \nSenator Bingaman's amendment on accountability, Senator Murray's \namendment on class size, and Senator Wellstone's on title I.\n  I cannot let the moment pass without expressing my deep regrets that \nthese amendments were necessary because the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act has still not been considered. As many of you know, we \nonly deal with that bill once every 6 years. I know we are in a rush to \nget everything done, but once every 6 years to focus on the elementary \nand secondary education needs of 2.5 million children and their parents \nis not a great amount of time.\n  I am sorry I am offering this amendment on the Labor-HHS bill. I \nwould have liked to have considered this issue on the ESEA \nreauthorization. But, I know we are not going to have a chance to get \nback to the authorizing bill, so I am left with no alternative but to \noffer this amendment on afterschool programs on this bill. I express my \napologies to my colleagues for doing so. If my colleagues care about \nafterschool programs, as most Americans do, this may be our only chance \nto do something about it.\n  The committee did increase funding for afterschool programs in this \nbill. They have raised that amount from $453 million up to $600 \nmillion. There has been an increase. It is interesting to note, we \nappropriated only $1 million in 1997 for afterschool programs. The \ndemand has been so great by school districts across the country to fill \nthis need that we have watched this program grow tremendously.\n  I will show my colleagues why. People ask: Why do we need more \nafterschool funding? The answer is not difficult to understand. In \nfact, parents across the country will tell you this without looking at \nstatistics. You can go to any community in America, and around 3 \no'clock in the afternoon, you will find people who work will try to \nfind that 5, 10, 15 minutes to get to a phone if they do not have one \nat their own workstation, to call home to find out whether or not their \nchild has gotten home and is safe.\n  This is a huge concern for parents. Do my colleagues remember the old \nbumper sticker which said: ``It is 11 p.m. Do you know where your child \nis?'' Mr. President, the fact is that 11 p.m. is not the problem, the \nhours right after the school day ends are the problem.\n\n[[Page S5953]]\n\n  The statistics on this chart come from our major police \norganizations. They show that the peak period for serious violent \ncrimes is between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. That is the problem time.\n  Percent of robbery incidents for children under age 18: The peak \nperiod is 3 p.m., 4 p.m., 5 p.m., up to around 8 o'clock in the \nevening.\n  Percent of aggravated assault incidents for children under 18: The \npeak period is about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.\n  The first chart show when children are the perpetrators of crime. The \nsecond chart shows when children are at risk of being victims of crime. \nThe peak period is 3 to 4 o'clock in the afternoon.\n  As I said, parents know about this and care about it. Let me show you \nto what extent they care about it. Through the 21st Century program, we \nare now offering 310 afterschool programs around the country. Yet the \ndemand for these programs is much higher--in FY 2000, 2,252 schools \napplied for grants to provide afterschool services through this \nprogram. That demand is coming from the parents through the schools. \nAnd, frankly, we're not coming even close to meeting that demand with \nan increase in funding of $147 million. Increasing funding to $1 \nbillion, as this amendment would do, would allow us to triple the \nnumber of children serviced to 2.5 million.\n  Before he even says anything, I can tell you the chairman is not \ngoing to argue with me about whether or not we need to do this. The \nchairman is going to say: Where are the resources going to come from? \nWe are up against a wall on this.\n  It is a very difficult situation. If I want to find an offset for my \namendment, I have to raid health care or child care. With these budget \ncaps we have forced competition between programs that are serving the \nsame families.\n  I know we have budget caps, but, like most Americans, I believe if \npeople care enough about this, we will find a way to deal with it. We \nalways manage to on other issues. This certainly qualifies as a crisis, \nif not a natural disaster where the winds and fires have devastated \nareas, it is close to something of a natural disaster when we have the \nviolent crimes, the victimization of children, the fear that parents \nhave about who is watching their kids, and what are they doing when \nthey are home alone.\n  I will share with my colleagues, aside from the crime elements, what \nhappens to kids when they are home alone.\n  Drug abuse, alcohol, cigarettes all begin with these age groups when \nkids are unsupervised. Parents, as I said earlier, are not unmindful of \nthis. Eighty-five percent of the most recent study of voters think \n``afterschool programs are a necessity. More than a third of the voters \nbelieve the single biggest threat to their children today is being \nunsupervised after. Voters rank afterschool programs, along with parent \ninvolvement and reducing class size, as the most effective means of \nimproving academic performance.\n  Two months ago, I attended an event at the White House to release a \nreport by a group called Fight Crime: Invest in Kids. It is a coalition \nof over 700 police chiefs and prosecutors across the country. Many of \nthe individuals are conservative Republicans.\n  These police chiefs said: If you are going to address the issue of \njuvenile crime and the victimization of children, you have to focus on \nthe issue of after school. The parents get it; the police officers get \nit. The question is whether or not we are going to find some means to \ndo something about it, to support a program that can serve 2.5 million \nchildren of the 5 million who are home alone in the afterschool hours.\n  I mentioned earlier--and I will repeat it again today--that we spend \nless than one-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget on \nelementary and secondary education. I suspect that could be a great \ntrivia question. I suspect most Americans think that as a percentage of \nour Federal budget that we would spend something more than less than \none-half of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget on the 50 million \nchildren who attend public schools. Out of the 55 million children who \ngo to school every day in this country, 50 million of them go to a \npublic school. Five million children go to private, parochial schools.\n  Less than one-half of 1 percent of our budget goes to serve 50 \nmillion children. I suspect not one of us has been home in our states, \nregardless of the audience, where we do not find some way to talk about \neducation in our remarks. We do so because I think all of us in this \nChamber--regardless of party or political ideology--understand deeply \nhow important education is to the well-being of our Nation and the need \nto improve the quality of our public schools.\n  Shutting down failed schools may provide some quick satisfaction, but \ntoo often those kids in a rural school--in Nebraska or Connecticut--or \nan urban school--in Los Angeles or Chicago or Philadelphia--have no \nalternative if you shut down the school. There are not a lot of schools \naround where they can all of a sudden go the next day or the next week. \nAnd these are the very children we most need to help. We have to do a \nbetter job in trying to help these underserved kids, the ones who come \nfrom single-parent families, or where two parents are working because \nthey have to put food on the table.\n  Contributing only 7 cents out of the entire education dollar in the \ncountry, does not make the federal government a very good partner. Our \nlocal communities are strapped, our States are struggling to try to do \na better job on class size, teacher quality, accountability, and \nafterschool programs.\n  We are not measuring up, in my view, to the level of partnership that \nwe ought to provide. I am not suggesting we ought to assume all of the \nresponsibility for education. That would be ridiculous. But right now \nwe only contribute 7 cents on the dollar--$15 billion out of about $190 \nbillion--that is spent nationwide on elementary and secondary \neducation.\n  Again, here we are at the dawn of the 21st century. It is so obvious, \nit is so self-evident, that if we have hopes of succeeding as a people \nin this century, we must meet the educational needs of our children. \nThis is about as fundamental as it gets. This is the hub of the wheel. \nPeople always say kids represent 25 percent of the population but they \nare 100 percent of our future. We are the ones who will set the ground \nrules on whether or not they are going to have the chance to succeed \nand prosper in the years ahead.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my friend be \ngiven 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I was not able to hear his entire \npresentation, but he and I have worked together on afterschool \nprograms. We have made some progress because, frankly, in the first \nbudget fight that this President had, he put afterschool on the table, \nand he insisted we increase our participation.\n  I don't know if my friend went over the details of how many people in \nthis country really support what he is trying to do today. I wanted to \nmake sure my friend knew, in the last poll I saw, about 90 percent of \nthe people said: We need to do more for our children after school. I \nwonder if my friend knew that.\n  Mr. DODD. I did make that point. The Senator from California has been \na leader on this issue for a long time and on many other issues related \nto education. But I made the point about how many people care about \nthis issue and I shared the polling numbers with my colleagues.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy my friend did that.\n  We call ourselves representatives. What we are supposed to do is \nrepresent the hopes and the dreams and the needs of the people. We have \na bill that comes to the floor that is a cap bill. We understand that. \nBut my goodness, we know there are surpluses coming. If we can't do \nmore to meet this need, and get that 60 votes for the Senator in this \namendment, I think we are failing our children.\n  I thank my friend for his leadership.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n\n[[Page S5954]]\n\n  I suspect my time has expired, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DODD. Again, I urge my colleagues to vote to waive the budget \npoint of order that I know my friend from Pennsylvania will have to \nmake. I thank him again.\n  I will end where I began. He has been a very good friend on a lot of \nthese issues. I realize his objections to this are not on the policy \nissue as much as it is a problem financially.\n  But I wanted to offer this amendment because it is a critically \nimportant one. My hope is we get back to the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act and that we spend more time on that bill before this \nsession ends. We have a chance to address these kinds of policy \nquestions, on which I think more of my colleagues would like to be \nheard.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is not too much need for me to \nrespond to the Senator from Connecticut. I think he has already stated \nmy position in toto. I do think this afterschool program, which he has \nproposed to add to, is a worthwhile program. But it is beyond the \nlimits with which our subcommittee has to work. He is correct that I \nwill make a motion that it exceeds the allocation to our committee at \nthe appropriate time.\n  Afterschool is very important. It is sort of a twin brother to day \ncare. Last year, I agreed with the Senator from Connecticut to scrimp \nand save and use a sharp pencil to find $817 million more to bring day \ncare up to $2 billion, which we did. I thought that kind of an \nallocation might have satisfied the Senator from Connecticut for a \nyear. But it has not. So we will have to face this when it comes along.\n  He said to me: That is day care.\n  I said: Day care is very important. Bringing it up by more than $800 \nmillion to $2 billion was a tough job, Senator Dodd.\n  I called him Chris at the time.\n  We thought that being a twin brother to afterschool, we might have \navoided an amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I was as complimentary as I could be. But I will be even \nmore complimentary. I am deeply grateful to the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It is very tough being the manager of a bill that funds \nthe Department of Education because there is no priority higher than \neducation. The only one on a level with it is health care. And we have \nthe funding coming out of the same pool of money.\n  We made the allocations as best we could. I know of the devotion of \nthe Senator from Connecticut to this cause. He and I were elected at \nthe same time. He withstood the Reagan landslide in 1980 to be one of \ntwo Democrats elected to open seats, when 16 Republicans came in. And \nhe and I cochaired the Children's Caucus at that time.\n  In 1987, when he proposed family leave, I was his cosponsor, with a \nlot of turmoil just on this side of the aisle. We have worked together \nover the years for education and for children. I commend him for all \nthat he has done.\n  We have added to education some $4.6 billion. We are $100 million \nmore than the President in education this year.\n  We have increased funding tremendously for children and young people \nin America. The Head Start Program comes, curiously enough, under the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. There is an increase this year \nof $1 billion to Head Start, coming up to $6.2 billion. We have \nincreased special education by $1.3 billion, bringing it up to $7.3 \nbillion. We have increased innovative State grants by $2.7 billion for \nmore teachers, class size, and for school construction, with the \nproviso that it is limited. It is up to the local school district if \nthey decide to do something else with it.\n  When it comes to the program the Senator from Connecticut is talking \nabout, the 21st Century Learning Centers, we have added $146.6 million \nto bring the figure up to $600 million. In fiscal year 1999, it was \n$200 million. So we are moving right along on it to provide the maximum \namount of money we can.\n  It is not an easy matter to allocate $104.5 billion--as much money as \nthat is--for the National Institutes of Health and for drug programs \nand for school violence programs. We have done the best job we could. \nIt is with reluctance that I raise a point of order.\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator has 9 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have made the essential arguments which are relevant. \nIn the interest of moving the bill along and saving time, I make a \npoint of order under section 302(b) of the Budget Act, as amended, that \nthe effect of adopting the Dodd amendment provides budget authority in \nexcess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation under the fiscal year \n2001 concurrent resolution on the budget and is not in order.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor consideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as previously agreed to by unanimous \nconsent, the vote will be delayed to a time agreed upon by the leaders \nlater today. I yield back the remainder of my time so we may proceed \nwith the amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nis recognized.\n\n[[Page S5955]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 3659\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for the technology literacy challenge \n                                 fund)\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3659 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3659.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     the total amount made available under this title to carry out \n     the technology literacy challenge fund under section 3132 of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 shall be \n     $517,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time on the \nKerry amendment be 1 hour equally divided. We have already talked about \nthis. I understand there is agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nBingaman and Mikulski be added as original cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me pick up, if I may, on the comments \nmade by the Senator from Connecticut. There is a relationship between \nthese amendments that are proposed by Senator Kennedy, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Dodd, and myself. They are made with great respect \nfor the leadership of the appropriations subcommittee. I share the \nfeelings expressed by Senator Dodd that they are working within the \nconstraints that have been imposed on them by the Congress in a sense \nthrough the budgeting process.\n  What we are asking of our colleagues is to begin a process by which \nwe more accurately reflect the truth of the budgeting process and the \nchoices we as Senators face. The fact is, we have the ability to \nprovide 60 votes to waive and to proceed to make a statement as the \nSenate that we believe a specific priority is significant enough that \nwe ought to depart from the constraints. The constraints under which we \nare operating, that were very properly and articulately listed by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, are restraints imposed by a Budget Act and \nby allocations that do not reflect the reality of the budget choice we \nface as a country because of the level of surplus. Since those \nallocations were made, we have in fact learned that we have a \nsignificant amount of additional funds available to us to begin to \nchoose how we will reflect the priorities of our Nation.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, a lot of us on \nthis side of the aisle joined with them to put in place the fiscal \ndiscipline we all laud and believe is appropriate. It was a 1993 vote, \nin fact, that put in place the Deficit Reduction Act. Many of us are \npleased that we finally were able to set this country on a course where \nwe now have the current surpluses. We have to start to be smart about \nwhat kind of choices we are going to make.\n\n  I keep hearing colleagues on both sides of the aisle come to the \nfloor. They lament what is happening to children in America. They \nlament what is happening with respect to young people who are \nincreasingly feeding into the juvenile justice system of the Nation. We \nhear the cries of anguish about children having children out of \nwedlock, about the failure of marriage in this country. But we don't \nseem to connect our legislative actions to things that really might \nmake a difference in the lives of young people so they will choose a \nmore moral, traditional, affirmative course for their own life.\n  How do kids make those kinds of choices? Traditionally, in the \nAmerica we always hear Members talking about, we have family, which is \nthe best teacher of all, the most important connection of a child to \ntheir future. We have schools and teachers. History in America is \nreplete with great personalities who harken back to a particular \nteacher who affected their life. We hear less and less of those stories \nin modern America. Finally, there is organized religion. Organized \nreligion is the other great teaching entity. Not one that we are \nsupposed to, in this body, specifically legislate about, but it is \nproper to acknowledge the role that religion plays as one of those \nthree great teachers in the lives of children.\n  The truth is, in America today we have an awful lot of young children \nwho don't have contact with any one of those three teachers, not one. \nTheir teachers are the streets. Colin Powell talks about it in his \nAmerica's Promise, which appeals to people to make a voluntary \ncommitment to try to intervene in the lives of some of those children \nand replace the absence of those three great teachers.\n  What kids learn in the streets is not the real values of America; it \nis what I call ``coping skills.'' They learn how to get by. They learn \nhow to survive. They learn the sort of ``law of the jungle,'' as some \nused to call it. The fact is, we are not doing enough, we Senators are \nnot doing enough, to leverage those things that make a difference in \nthe absence of the three great teachers.\n  I ask any one of my colleagues: How do we break the cycle of a kid \nhaving a kid out of wedlock? How do we break the cycle of a child \nraised in an abusive household, whose role models in life are people \nwho beat up on each other, shoot drugs, get into trouble, such as the \nrole models for that 6-year-old kid who shot a 6-year-old classmate \nliving in a crack house with an uncle, a parent in jail, no one \nresponsible?\n  What is that child's future, unless adults make the decision to \nsomehow provide those positive forces that make a difference? What are \nthe positive forces? Well, the positive forces are often some of the \nfaith-based interventions, whether it is the Jewish Community Center or \na Baptist organization or the Catholic Charities; but there are those \nentities out there that have a wonderful, extraordinary capacity to \nbring kids back from the brink. And then there are those organized \nentities that also do it, such as the Boys and Girls Club; Big Brother/\nBig Sister; YMCA and YWCA; or a program in Boston called Youth Build, \nor City Year. All of these provide young people with alternatives and \nthe ability to have surrogate parenting, fundamentally. That is what is \nreally taking place. What is really taking place is those entities is \nproviding an alternative.\n  Now, we will debate in the Senate whether or not we are going to \nprovide 200,000 H-1B visas. I am for it. I think we ought to provide \nthat, or more, because we have an immediate need in this country to \nprovide skilled people in order to keep the economic boom going and \nprovide for critical technologies, to have good working people. But has \nit not occurred to my colleagues what an insult it is to our own system \nthat we have to go abroad and import skilled labor to the United \nStates, even as we are putting thousands of young kids into prison, \ninto the juvenile justice system, and out into the streets, as the \nSenator from Connecticut just said, because we don't have afterschool \nprograms? What are we going to do? We are going to import 200,000 \nskilled people to make up for the unskilled people whom we leave \nunskilled because we are unwilling to make the adult choices in the \nSenate that would make a difference in their lives.\n  How can we boast about the extraordinary surplus we have in this \ncountry, with the stock market climbing to record levels, the most \nextraordinary amounts of wealth ever created in the history of any \nnation on the planet right here in the United States, but poverty among \nchildren has increased by 50 percent and the number of kids who are at \nrisk has increased.\n  I don't believe in the Federal Government taking over these programs. \nI don't believe in Washington dictating the solutions. But I do believe \nin Washington leveraging the capacity of people at the local level to \nbe able to do what they know they need to do. So we are reduced to a \ndebate where the Senator from Pennsylvania has to say, well, oh, my \ngosh, under our 201(b) allocation--or whatever the appropriate section \nis--we don't have enough money to be able to allocate because we have a \ntotal cap that has no relationship to the reality of what we must do.\n  We keep saying, isn't it terrific that we have raised the amount of \nmoney--and it is terrific--when the real question is, are we doing what \nwe need to do to get the job done? That is the question we ought to be \nasking.\n  What is it going to take to guarantee that children in the United \nStates of\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\nAmerica are safe? What does it take to guarantee that we don't dump 5 \nmillion kids out into the streets in the afternoons, unsafe, and \nexposed to drug dealers and to all of the vagaries of the teenage years \nand all of the pressures that come with it in a modern society that \ndoesn't have parents around to be able to help those kids make a better \nchoice? We don't have to do that. We ought to make it the goal of the \nSenate to guarantee that every child in America is going to be safe and \nsecure between the hours when teachers stop teaching and when those \nparents are coming home. And we can ask 100,000 questions about why it \nis we are not providing arts and music and sports and libraries that \nare open full-time, and Internet access.\n\n  That is where my amendment comes in, Mr. President. Senator Kennedy \nhas an amendment on teacher quality, which is linked to the capacity of \nkids to fill those high tech jobs that we talk about. Senator Dodd has \nan amendment talking about making those kids safe after school. My \namendment seeks to increase the funding for the technology literacy \nchallenge fund, which is a critically important education program that \nhelps provide technology access, education, professional development, \nand instruction in elementary and secondary schools.\n  All we say is that to qualify for the money, States have to submit a \nstatewide technology plan that includes a strategy on how the States \nwill include private, State, local, and other entities in the continued \nfinancing and support of technology in schools.\n  There are two points that I can't stress enough. One is the \nimportance of providing young people with the opportunity to learn how \nto use technology. I am not one of those people. I don't want to \ncelebrate technology to the point of it being put up on a pedestal and \nit becomes an entity unto itself. Technology is not a god; it is not a \nphilosophy; it is not a way of life. Technology is a tool, a useful \ntool. It is a critical tool for the modern marketplace and the modern \nworld. But we are preordaining that we are going to have to have next \nyear's H-1B plan, and the next year's H-1B plan, and another prison, \nand another program to deal with a whole lot of young kids for whom the \ndigital divide becomes more and more real, who don't have accessability \nor the capacity to be able to gain the skills necessary to share in \nthis new world. The fact is that there are too many teachers who don't \nhave the ability to even teach; we have the schools wired; we have the \ne-rate.\n  We are beginning to get increased access to the Internet. But what do \nyou do with it? How many teachers know how to use the technology to \nreally be able to educate kids? How many kids are, in fact, having the \nbenefit of the opportunity of having teachers who have those skills so \nthat they can ultimately maximize their opportunities?\n  All we are suggesting is that we ought to be doing more to empower--\nnot to mandate, not to dictate, but to empower--those local communities \nthat desperately want to do this but don't have the tax base to be able \nto do it. Let's give them that ability. That is the best role the \nFederal Government can play--to leverage things that represent national \npriorities, leverage the things that represent the best goals and \naspirations of ourselves as a Nation. It is not micromanagement; it is, \nrather, putting in place a mechanism by which we have national \npriorities--to have good, strong families, to have kids who are \ncomputer literate, and to have more skilled workers. Those are national \npriorities. But if we turn our heads away and say the only priority in \nthis country is to sort of sequester this money for the senior \ngeneration in one form or another, without any regard to the generation \nthat is coming along that needs to fund Social Security, that needs to \nhave a high value-added job so they can pay into it and adequately \nprotect it, that is not Social Security protection.\n  We have gone from 13 workers paying in for every 1 that is taking \nout--13 workers paying into the system for every 1 worker taking out--\nto three paying in and one taking out. Now there are two paying in and \none taking out.\n  We have a vested interest as a nation in making sure those two paying \nin are capable of paying in; that they have a high value-added job that \nempowers them to pay in; when they pay in, it doesn't take so much of \ntheir income that they feel so oppressed by the system that they are \nnot able to invest in their own children and in their own future.\n  That is in our interest. That is a national priority.\n  If we don't begin in the Senate tomorrow to adequately reflect the \nneeds of our children in the money that we allocate, we will be \nseriously missing one of the greatest priorities the country faces.\n  All of us understand the degree to which there is an increase in the \ndigital divide of the country. The technology literacy challenge fund \nis a critical effort to try to provide those kids with an opportunity \nto close that gap.\n  Last year, my home State of Massachusetts received $8.1 million. Some \nof the programs it put in place are quite extraordinary. Let me share \nwith my colleagues one of the examples of this program that works so \neffectively. It is called the Lighthouse Technology Grant.\n  The Lighthouse Technology Grant incorporates new technologies into \nthe State curriculum framework so that it better motivates children to \nbe able to learn.\n  One of the schools in my State--the Lynn Woods Elementary School in \nLynn--is integrating technology into the classroom by virtue of this \ngrant. Fifth grade students at the Lynn Woods school are studying \nAustralia. They have been able to videoconference directly with \nAustralian students who are studying the Boston area.\n  You have students engaging in a very personal and direct way, all of \nwhich encourages their learning and enhances their interest in the \ntopic. They have also developed writing skills through special e-mail \npen pal programs with Australian students.\n  In addition, they have been able to connect more directly with the \nexperience of life, thereby asking very direct questions and engaging \nin a personal exchange that they never could have experienced before \nbecause of telephone rates and because of the difficulties of \ncommunication under any kind of telephone circumstance.\n  The Lighthouse Technology Grant is only one of eight programs funded \nby this challenge grant in Massachusetts. It also provides grants to a \nvirtual high school program which enables school districts to offer \nstudents Internet courses ranging from advanced academic courses to \ntechnical and specialized courses. Let me emphasize the importance of \nthat to my colleagues.\n  A few weeks ago, I visited a high school in Boston, an inner-city \nhigh school, Dorchester High. I found that in this high school of \nalmost 1,000 students in the inner city they are not able to provide \nadvanced placement courses. I ask everybody here to imagine a high \nschool that is supposed to be state of the art that doesn't have \nadvanced placement courses.\n  Yet, because of the virtual high school and because of the access to \nthe Internet, if we close the digital divide, we can in fact make it \naffordable and accessible for schools that today have difficulty \nfinding the teachers, affording the teachers, and providing the \ncurriculum--and be able to do so immediately.\n\n  That is the difference between somebody being able to go to college \nor being college ready or being able to go to college and advance \nrapidly in the kinds of curriculum and courses that will make even a \ngreater difference in their earning capacity and in their citizen-\ncontributing capacity at a later time. We need to recognize that unless \nwe encourage this to happen, the transformation could take a lot longer \nthan we want it to take.\n  For example, it has taken only 7 years for the Internet to be adopted \nby 30 percent of Americans. That is compared to 17 years for television \nto be adopted by 38 percent, and for the telephone, 38 percent during \nthe same amount of time.\n  The world of work is obviously so much different and at a faster \nrate. But if we leave kids behind for a longer period of time, we will \ngreatly restrain their learning capacity as well as our growth capacity \nas a country.\n  The technology literacy challenge fund has been funded under the \ncommittee's mark at about $425 million. The administration actually \nasked for $450 million. The House has set a figure\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\nof $517 million. I think that is more reflective of the level of \nfunding that is necessary in order to achieve the kind of transition \nthat we wish for in this country. Some might argue we could even do \nmore. But it is clear to me that by measuring the priorities as \nexpressed by other colleagues we can, in fact, do more if we will \nchallenge the system a little bit, if we will push the limits a little \nbit, and if we will look at the reality of the budget choices that the \nCongress faces.\n  I think nothing could be more important for all of us as Senators and \nas Congress this year. I hope my colleagues will embrace the notion \nthat we can in fact do an appropriate waiver of the budget and set this \nas a priority of the Senate.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, here again, there is little doubt that \ntechnology literacy is a very important matter for America. There is no \ndoubt about that at all. Here again, it is a matter of how our \nallocations are going to run.\n  We debated the Dodd amendment earlier today about afterschool \nprograms--again, a good program. There is a question about the amount \nof money and where the priorities are.\n  We debated the Kennedy amendment about teacher recruitment--another \ngood program.\n  We had to turn down amendments yesterday by Senator Wellstone who \nwanted more money for title I; Senator Bingaman, also more money for \ntitle I; Senator Murray asked for an additional $325 million on top of \n$1.4 billion which was supplied for class size. There is no doubt that \nso many of these programs are excellent programs.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts in offering this amendment noted the \nconstraints we are operating under with respect to how much money we \nhave in our allocation. We have established priorities. We have greatly \nincreased the education account by some $4.6 billion. That is a \ntremendous increase, coming to a total of $40.2 billion. In our \neducation account, we have $100 million more than the President asked \nfor.\n  I have already today gone over a long list of items where we have \nincreased funding on education on very important items. It is a matter \nof making the appropriate allocation and the setting of priorities.\n  I say to my colleague from Massachusetts that the House of \nRepresentatives has established a mark of $517 million in this account. \nIt is entirely plausible that the figure that is in the Senate bill \nwill be substantially increased.\n  We will certainly keep in mind the eloquence of Senator Kerry's \narguments. There is no doubt about technology and about the need for \nmore funding in technology.\n  I believe that a country with an $8 trillion gross national product \ncan do better on education. I said earlier today and have said many \ntimes on this floor that I am committed to education, coming from a \nfamily which emphasizes education so heavily, my parents having very \nlittle education and my siblings and I being able to succeed--I guess \nyou would call it success to come to the Senate--because of our \neducational opportunities.\n  That is the essence of our position. We have substantially more time.\n  I inquire of the Chair: How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 26 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Massachusetts has 8 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could direct a question to the manager \nof the bill, it is my understanding Senator Wellstone will offer one of \nhis amendments next.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is fine.\n  Mr. REID. I will also have Senator Wellstone agree to a time limit.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Speaking of the time limit with Senator Wellstone on the \nfloor, may we agree to 30 minutes equally divided, 20 minutes equally \ndivided, 15 minutes equally divided? How much time does Senator \nWellstone desire?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I did not hear the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggested a time agreement of 30 \nminutes equally divided, perhaps 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania, my guess is \nit will take me about 40 minutes on my side. I prefer not to agree to a \ntime limit. I don't think I will go more than that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Would the Senator from Minnesota be willing to enter a \ntime agreement of an hour, 40 minutes for the Senator from Minnesota, \nand 20 minutes for our side?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to do so.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent the time be set on the Wellstone \namendment at 1 hour, with the Senator from Minnesota having 40 minutes \nand our side having 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that no \nsecond-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. If the Senator from Pennsylvania wants to yield back time, \nI am prepared to do the same. I want to reserve one comment.\n  I appreciate everything the Senator has said. I appreciate his \ncomments. I know he wants to do more. Unless we in the Senate tackle \nthis beast called the allocation process, and unless we begin to \nchallenge the constraints within which we are now dealing, we are not \ndoing our job.\n  These votes are an opportunity to try to do that. My plea is to the \nSenator, the Appropriations Committee, and others, that we begin to try \nto change these shackles that are keeping us from responding to the \nreal needs of the country. The measurement should not be what we are \ndoing against a baseline set by us. The measurement should be, what \nwill it take to guarantee we can turn to Americans and say we are \naddressing the problem, we are getting the job done.\n  We need to close that gap.\n  I am happy to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the vote on the \nKerry amendment be deferred, to be stacked later today at a time to be \nmutually agreed upon by our respective leaders.\n  I raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the Budget Act, as \namended, that the effect of adopting the Kerry amendment provides \nbudget authority in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocations \nunder the fiscal year 2001 concurrent resolution on the budget, and is \nnot in order.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act, I move to waive the applicable section of \nthat act for consideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3644\n\n  (Purpose: To provide funds for the loan forgiveness for child care \n                   providers program, with an offset)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I call up amendment 3644.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3644.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 71, after line 25, add the following:\n       Sec. ____. (a) In addition to any amounts appropriated \n     under this title for the loan forgiveness for child care \n     providers program under section 428K of the Higher Education \n     Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1078-11), an additional $10,000,000 is \n     appropriated to carry out such program.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     amounts made available under titles I and II, and this title, \n     for salaries and expenses at the Departments of Labor, Health \n     and Human Services, and Education, respectively, shall be \n     reduced on a pro rata basis by $10,000,000.\n\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to offer a very \nsimple amendment. This amendment asks only that we appropriate an \nadditional $10 million to fund the loan forgiveness program which was \nauthorized under the Higher Education Act. This is a loan forgiveness \nprogram for women and men who go into child care work. This would be \ntaken from administrative expenses in the overall budget.\n  Despite the fact that we know that child care workers struggle to pay \nback their student loans, and that all too many of them earn poverty-\nlevel wages without benefits, which means in turn that many of them are \nforced to leave their work for higher paid work, we have yet to \nappropriate one penny for this forgiveness program.\n  I originally offered this amendment calling for loan forgiveness for \nthose men and women who go into the child care field with Senator \nDeWine. My thought was this is sacred work. This is important work. \nThis is work with small children. If people are going to be paid \nmiserably low wages--many having no health care benefits at all, and we \nunderstand the importance of early childhood development--then let's at \nleast have a loan forgiveness that will encourage men and women to go \ninto this area.\n  Right now the child care situation in the United States is critical. \nWe have a system in place where child care is prohibitively high for \nworking families. It is not uncommon for a family to be paying $6,000 \nper child, $12,000 per year, $10,000 per year. Maybe the family's \noverall income is $35,000 or $40,000.\n  At the same time, we have child care workers who are taking care of \nchildren during the most critical years of development and they don't \neven make poverty wages.\n  It seems counterintuitive. How can it be that on the one hand child \ncare is so expensive, but on the other hand those men and women who \nwork in this field are so underpaid?\n  The problems of the high costs and the low wages are inevitable under \nthe current system of child care delivery in the United States. \nColleagues, this amendment is just one vote, but this is a central \nissue of American politics. Talk to working families in this country \nand they will list child care as one of their top concerns. They are \nnot just talking about the cost of child care, but they are also saying \nwhen both parents work, or as a single parent working, they worry most \nof all that their child is receiving the best care--not custodial, not \nin front of a television for 8 hours, but developmental care.\n  On a personal note, I can remember as a student at the University of \nNorth Carolina, barely age 20, Sheila and I had our first child. I will \nnever forget, 6 weeks after David was born, Sheila had to go back to \nwork. That is all the time she could take off. Six weeks is not enough \ntime to bond with a child. We had hardly any money. We asked around and \nwe heard about a woman who took care of children. We took David over. \nAfter about 3 days of picking him up, every day he was listless. Before \nhe had gone to this child care, this home child care setting, he was \nengaged and lively. It was wonderful.\n  I was at school, I was working; Sheila was working. At 5 o'clock or \n5:30 we would come to pick him up and he was listless. Finally, after 3 \ndays I got concerned and I showed up at her home in the middle of the \nday. The problem was she had about 20 children she was trying to take \ncare of. Most of them were in playpens and she had stuck a pacifier in \ntheir mouth and they were receiving no real care. There was no real \ninteraction. Parents worry about this.\n  I argue today on the floor of the Senate, one of the keys to making \nsure there is decent developmental child care--not custodial child \ncare--is to have men and women working in this field being paid a \ndecent wage. Right now, we have a 40-percent turnover in this field. \nWho pays the price? The children.\n  I have said on the Senate floor before, when I was teaching at \nCarleton College as a college teacher for 20 years, I had conversations \nwith students who came to me and said: Look, don't take it personally. \nWe think you are a good teacher, Paul, and we really appreciate your \nwork as a teacher. But we would like to go into early childhood \ndevelopment. The problem is, when you make $8 an hour, with no health \ncare benefits, and you have a huge student loan to pay off, especially \nat a college like Carleton, you can't afford to do it. Some of the \npeople want to go into this field, which we say is so important, but \nthey can't afford to do it.\n  The least we could do is have a small loan forgiveness program.\n  The result of the system we have right now is poverty-level earnings \nfor the workforce.\n  By the way, who are the child care providers in the country today? \nMr. President, 98 percent of them are women, and one-third of them are \nwomen of color. We can do a lot better. We pay parking lot attendants \nand men and women who work at the zoos in America twice as much as we \npay those men and women who take care of our small children. Something \nis profoundly wrong when we pay people who care for our cars and our \npets more money than we do for those who care for our children.\n  Let me go over the facts. The average teacher based at a child care \ncenter earns roughly $7 an hour. Despite above average levels of \neducation, roughly one-third of the child care workers earn the minimum \nwage. Even those at the highest end of the pay scale, who are likely to \nhave a college degree and several years of experience, make about $10 \nan hour. Family child care providers--a lot of child care is in homes--\nmake even less money. People who care for small groups of children in \ntheir home make on average about $9,000 per year after all expenses are \nfigured in.\n  A recent study by the Center For The Childcare Workforce finds that \nfamily child care providers earn on the average, when you take into \naccount their costs, $3.84 an hour, given their typical 55-hour week. \nNot only that, but the majority of child care workers in our country \nreceive no health benefits, despite high exposure to illness. A lot of \nkids, when they come, have the flu and they pass it around. Fewer than \none-third of the child care providers in this country today have health \ninsurance, and an even smaller percentage of child care workers have \nany pension plan whatsoever. A recent study in my State of Minnesota \nfound that only 31 percent of child care centers offered full-time \nemployees fully paid health care.\n  The consequences of these dismal conditions are clear. Let me just \nput it into perspective for colleagues. In the White House Conference \non the Development of the Brain, they talked about how important it is \nthat we get it right for children in the very early years of their \nlives. The medical evidence is irrefutable and irreducible that these \nare the most critical years. We all want to have our pictures taken \nnext to children --the smaller the children are, the better. Yet at the \nsame time we have done so precious little to make a commitment to this \narea. We have child care workers, men and women who work in these \ncenters, who do not even make half of what people make who work in our \nzoos. I think work in the zoo is important, but I also think work with \nsmall children is important.\n  We have the vast majority of child care workers barely making minimum \nwage or a little bit above, only about a third at best having any \nhealth care coverage whatsoever.\n  Senator DeWine and I, several years ago, help pass a bill that \nauthorized some loan forgiveness so you would have men and women who \ncould go to college, with the idea they would go into this critically \nimportant field and their loans would be forgiven. What I am trying to \ndo, taking it out of administrative expenses, is just finally to get a \nlittle bit of appropriation; start out with $10 million so we finally \nset the precedent that we are willing to fund this. We have not put one \npenny into this program so far.\n\n  What happens is that we have this high turnover. As I said before, \nprobably about 40 percent or thereabouts of child care workers in any \ngiven year go from one job to another. That figure may be a little \nhigh, but it is a huge turnover. Who pays the price? The children pay \nthe price. As I look at my own figures, I guess it is about a third, a \nthird of this country's child care workforce leaves the job each year \nbecause they are looking for better work. This leads to a dangerous \ndecline in the quality of child care for our families. The most \ndangerous decline in quality is the care for toddlers, for infants.\n\n[[Page S5959]]\n\nThey are exposed to the poorest care of all.\n  We have not appropriated one cent for the loan forgiveness program we \nauthorized 2 years ago, and at the same time you have 33 percent of \nchild care workers every year leaving, and you don't have the \ncontinuity of care for our children, for families in this country. At \nthe same time, it is the infants and the toddlers who are the ones who \nare most in jeopardy. At the same time, we have not made any commitment \nwhatsoever to at least--at least, this doesn't change everything in the \nequation--make sure we have a loan forgiveness program.\n  Another thing that is happening is that as we begin to see a severe \nteacher shortage, a lot of child care workers are saying that they \ncan't make it on $8 an hour with no health care benefits. A lot of \nyounger people say they can't make it on $8 an hour with no health care \nbenefits and a big loan to pay off. They now become our elementary \nschool teachers or middle school teachers.\n  As a result, what you have is, at the same time the number of child \ncare providers is decreasing, the number of families who need good \nchild care for their children is dramatically increasing. That is not \njust because of the welfare bill, but because the reality of American \nfamilies today, for better or for worse--sometimes I wonder--is that \nyou just don't have one parent staying at home. In most families, both \nparents are working full time. This is a huge concern to families in \nthis country. We could help by passing this amendment.\n  I want to talk about one study in particular that I think, in a \ndramatic way, puts into focus what I am talking about. It was a recent \nstudy by the University of California at Berkeley and Yale University. \nThey found that a million more toddlers and preschoolers are now in \nchild care because of the welfare law. That wouldn't surprise anyone, \ngiven the emphasis on people going to work. So far, so good.\n  But they also found that many of these children are in low-quality \ncare, where they lag behind other children in developmental measures. \nThis was a study of 1,000 single mothers moving from welfare to work. \nThey wanted to know where were their children. What they found out was \ntheir children were, by and large, placed in child care settings where \nthey watched TV all the time, wandered aimlessly, and there was little \ninteraction with caregivers. Here is the tragedy of it. Many of these \ntoddlers from these families showed developmental delays.\n  Would anybody be surprised? Anyone who has spent any time with small \nchildren would not be surprised. When asked to point to a picture of a \nbook from among three different pictures, fewer than two in five of the \ntoddlers in the study pointed to the right picture compared to a \nnational norm of four out of five children.\n  One of the study's authors is quoted as saying:\n\n       We know that high quality child care can help children and \n     that poor children can benefit the most. So we hope that this \n     will be a wake-up call to do something about the quality of \n     child care in this country. The quality of daycare centers is \n     not great for middle class families, but it is surprising and \n     distressing to see the extent to which welfare families' \n     quality was even lower.\n\n  I simply want to point out that just because a family is a welfare \nfamily or just because a family is a poor family does not mean these \nsmall children are not as deserving of good child care. That is not the \nsituation today in the country.\n  Ironically, as we see the child care system deteriorating, we are now \nputting more and more emphasis on the importance of developmental child \ncare. We are saying at the same time that we want to make sure single \nparents work and families move from welfare to work. We are putting the \nemphasis on work, and more families have to work to make it.\n  The median income in our country today is about $40,000 a year. The \nincome profile is not that high. We know investment in early childhood \ndevelopment pays for itself many times over. We know good child care \nprograms dramatically increase the chances for children to do well in \nschool, for children to go on beyond K-12 and go to college and do well \nin their lives, and we know the lives of low-income families, in \nparticular, quite often lack some of the advantages other families in \nthis country have. Children from low-income families do not always have \nthe same vocabulary; there is not always the opportunity for a parent \nor parents to read to them. Therefore, the learning gap by kindergarten \nis wide. Some children start way behind, and then they fall further \nbehind.\n  I cite one study which began in the seventies on the effects of early \nchildhood intervention. Children who received comprehensive, quality, \nearly education did better on cognitive, reading and math tests than \nchildren who did not. This positive effect continues through age 21 and \nbeyond. Parents benefit as well. I do not understand where our \npriorities are. We should want to make a commitment to working families \nin this country and make a commitment to children.\n  I want to give some evidence from the State of Minnesota, and then I \nwill finish up at least with my first comments. This loan forgiveness \nprogram works. First, it gives people an opportunity to go to college \nwho want to become child care workers. Second, the turnover is reduced. \nThird, this means we get better people.\n  My own State of Minnesota has experimented. We have a State level \nloan forgiveness program. In 1998, we offered child care providers up \nto $1,500 in forgivable student loans for the first time. Fifty percent \nof the money was set aside for what we call the metro area, and 50 \npercent of the money was set aside for greater Minnesota, outside the \nmetro area. The money was awarded on a first come, first served basis. \nPeople began lining up on the first day. In the metro area, all the \nmoney was gone by 5 p.m. on the second day, and all of the money for \nrural Minnesota was awarded within 2 weeks.\n  This year, Minnesota has made over $900,000 available through their \nloan forgiveness program. They started accepting applications in March, \nand they have committed nearly half the money to family care providers \nand 50 percent to center-based providers. A lot of it goes to rural \nMinnesota and a lot of it goes to urban Minnesota.\n  I am saying to my colleagues, I am hoping I can win on this \namendment. I take it out of administrative expenses. We know the budget \nis going to be better for this Health and Human Services bill. We know \nwe do not have a good budget with which to work right now. We know the \ncap is going to go up. We know we are going to have more resources with \nwhich to work.\n  We all say we are committed to developmental child care.\n  It is one of the top issues of working families. It seems to me \nseveral years ago--I did this with Senator DeWine--we authorized \nlegislation that called for loan forgiveness to men and women who want \nto go into this critical area, and we have not appropriated one penny. \nWe can at least find it in our hearts and find our way to put some \nappropriations into this legislation. I am calling for $10 million as a \nstart.\n  I am saying to Senators today--and I do not think anybody can argue \nwith me--there is not one Senator who can dispute the clear set of \nfacts that we have to get it right for children. We have to get it \nright for them before age 3, much less before age 5. Nobody can argue \nwith that.\n  Nobody can argue these are not critical developmental years. Look at \nthe spark in their eyes. They are experiencing all the unnamed magic in \nthe world before them, as long as we encourage them. No one can argue \nthat for working families this is not a huge issue, both the expense of \nchild care, which I cannot deal with in this amendment, and the quality \nof the care for their children. If both parents are working or a single \nparent is working, there is nothing more important to them than making \nsure their child is receiving the best care. They do not want their \nchild warehoused. They do not want their child in front of a television \n8 hours a day. They want to make sure their child is stimulated. They \nwant to make sure there is nurturing for their child. They want to make \nsure there is interaction with their child.\n  I do not know how some of the people who work in the child care field \ndo it. They are saints; they do it out of love for children; but they \nshould not be the ones who subsidize this system. We are not going to \nhave good people in the child care field if they are making $8 an hour. \nWe are not going to have good people if they do not have any health\n\n[[Page S5960]]\n\ncare benefits. I cannot deal with that in this amendment, but I can \ndeal with one thing. I can call on my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, who say they are committed to good child care, who say \nthey are committed to family values. If they are committed to family \nvalues, what better way to value families than to make sure that when \npeople are working, their children are receiving good care? What better \nway to make sure that happens than to do something about the one-third \nturnover every year?\n  How can we best deal with the one-third turnover? We need to do a lot \nof things, but this amendment in its own small way helps. I am simply \nsaying we ought to at least put $10 million into this loan forgiveness \nprogram so we can encourage men and women--frankly, I would like to see \nmore men in this field; it is almost all women in this field. At least \nthey know their loan will be forgiven. That will make a huge \ndifference. That is all this amendment is about.\n  I also say to my colleagues, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator DeWine. I am so pleased Senator DeWine is a \ncosponsor. I have done a number of different bills and legislation with \nSenator DeWine. We did the Workforce Investment Act together, and we \ndid this authorization together. I do not think we are asking too much.\n  This is actually a crisis. The fact is, the studies that have come \nout about the quality of child care in this country are pretty \nfrightening. Sometimes it is downright dangerous, but almost always it \nis barely adequate, and we have to do something about it. One of the \nbest ways we can show we care is to at least begin putting some funding \ninto this loan forgiveness program.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time if, in fact, there is substantive \ndebate on this issue. Otherwise, I will make a few other points. I \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time on the amendment?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of the committee, we are \nprepared to accept this Wellstone amendment which provides $10 million \nfor loan forgiveness for child care providers. The program was \nauthorized by the Higher Education Amendment of 1998 and has never been \nfunded.\n  The administration did not request funding, I might add. A $10 \nmillion offset in administrative expenses will pay for this amendment.\n  If the Senator is agreeable, I will accept the amendment to forgive \nloans for child care providers who complete a degree in early childhood \neducation and obtain employment in a child care facility located in \nlow-income communities. That is acceptable to us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alaska. And \nif this is not presumptuous of me to say, normally I like to call for a \nrecorded vote, but I would be pleased to have a voice vote, if that is \nwhat my colleague wants. And there is one reason why. I can't get an \nironclad commitment from the Senator from Alaska, but I make a plea to \nhim to please try to help me keep it in conference. It would be a small \nstep toward getting funding for this. I know the Senator is very \neffective. I don't need to have a recorded vote if he can at least tell \nme he will certainly try.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator does not need a recorded vote. This \namendment probably applies to my State more than any other State in the \nUnion. I assure him I will be asserting his position in conference.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very glad to hear that. I think I \nwould be pleased to go forward with a voice vote.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we ask for the adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do both Senators yield back their time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I yield back our time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3644) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are awaiting clearance--I understand \nthere is a Kennedy amendment on job training. We would like to get a \ntime agreement on that. I would urge that we consider that at this \ntime.\n  Does the Senator wish the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the manager, the chairman of the \nfull committee, Senator Stevens, we would like to have Senator Reed of \nRhode Island offer the next amendment. He is on his way over to do \nthat.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is it possible to get a time agreement on that?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We would like to get time agreements so it would be \npossible to stack votes later, if that is possible. Is the Senator \nprepared to indicate how long it might be?\n  Mr. REID. We will wait until he gets here, but I don't think he will \ntake a lot of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I ask my colleagues, there is \nsome order here. There is going to be a Reed amendment--is that \ncorrect?--next, and then a Kennedy amendment. I have an amendment with \nSenator Reid that deals with mental health and suicide prevention. \nMight I add that I follow Senator Kennedy? I am ready to keep rolling.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am not prepared to agree to that yet. We are not sure \nSenator Kennedy wants to offer his amendment yet. We are prepared to \nenter into a time agreement on the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I might state for the information of the \nSenate, we are trying to arrange amendments from each side of the \naisle. We urge Members on the Republican side of the aisle to come \nforward with amendments if they wish to call them up today.\n  For the time being, I ask unanimous consent that on the amendment \noffered by Senator Reed of Rhode Island there be a time limit of 30 \nminutes equally divided, with no second-degree amendments prior to a \nvote on or in relation to that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We presume that there may be a Republican amendment \noffered after the Reed amendment. But in any event, the next Democratic \namendment to be offered would be that of Senator Kennedy, his job \ntraining amendment, and prior to that vote, there would be--let's put \nit this way, that time on that amendment be limited to 60 minutes \nequally divided, with no second-degree amendments prior to a vote.\n  It is my understanding there would be 2 minutes on each side. Is that \nthe procedure now prior to the vote? Is that correct, may I inquire? Is \nthat your desire?\n  Mr. REID. That is appropriate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask unanimous consent that on each of these consents \nthere be a 4-minute period prior to the vote to be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Can I ask my colleague in that sequence, that \nfollowing Senator Kennedy there be a Republican and then I be allowed--\n--\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding the third Democratic amendment to \nbe offered would be the amendment from Senator Wellstone. We are \nawaiting the Republican amendments to see. But it will be the Reed \namendment, then a Republican amendment, then the Kennedy amendment, \nthen a Republican amendment, and then the Wellstone amendment.\n\n[[Page S5961]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Wellstone has agreed to 1 hour evenly divided.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I don't know what the subject matter is.\n  Mr. REID. Mental health.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Suicides.\n  Mr. REID. It deals with suicides.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We haven't seen it, but we will be pleased to consider \nan hour on that amendment and get back to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. If you need more time, we don't care. If you decide you do, \nwe will add it on to ours.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Let's decide the time on that amendment once we have \nseen it.\n  Mr. President, while we are awaiting the next amendment, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3638\n\n          (Purpose: To provide funds for the GEAR UP Program)\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 3638, \nand I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, and Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3638.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . GEAR UP PROGRAM.\n\n       In addition to any other funds appropriated under this Act \n     to carry out chapter 2 of subpart 2 of part A of title IV of \n     the Higher Education Act of 1965, there are appropriated \n     $100,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment would increase funding for \nGEAR UP by $100 million. GEAR UP is a critical component of our efforts \nto provide disadvantaged young people a chance to go on to college. \nGEAR UP reaches out very early in their educational careers, giving \nthem the mentoring, the support, and the information necessary to \nsucceed, not only in high school but to go beyond, to enter and \ncomplete college.\n  I offer this amendment along with Senator Kennedy and Senator Murray. \nWe are offering it because we believe--as I am sure everyone in the \nChamber believes--that the opportunity to go on to postsecondary \neducation is central to our country and central to our aspirations in \nthe Senate.\n  This opportunity is particularly difficult to achieve if one is a \nlow-income student in the United States. The GEAR UP program is \nspecifically designed to reach out early in the career of a child, the \nsixth or seventh grade, and give them not only the skills but the \nconfidence and the expectation that they can succeed and can go on to \ncollege. Both these skills and information, together with the \nconfidence that they can succeed, are essential to their progress and \nto our progress as a Nation.\n  GEAR UP is based upon proven early intervention models such as the I \nHave a Dream Program and Project GRAD. These programs have succeeded in \nimproving low-income student achievement, high school graduation rates, \nand college enrollment rates. We are building on a successful set of \nmodels.\n  GEAR UP provides students with very specific services tailored to \nhelp them prepare for college. These services include tutoring, \nmentoring, and counseling. They are critical to ensure that students \nare equipped both academically and emotionally to succeed in college. \nWe often hear about the lack of opportunities available to low-income \nfamilies. This is particularly the case when we talk about entering and \nsucceeding in college. Low-income children are the least likely \nindividuals in the United States to attend college. In fact, if we look \nat high-achieving students from low-income schools and backgrounds, \nthey are five times less likely to attend college as comparable \nstudents in higher-income schools across this country. By focusing on \ncollege preparation for these needy students, GEAR UP is directly \ntargeted at eliminating this disparity.\n  There is something else that is important about GEAR UP. There are \nmany talented young people who, if they are the first child in their \nfamily to seriously contemplate college, do not have the advantage of \nparents who are knowledgeable about the system. Their parents often do \nnot have the information and the incentives to provide the kind of \nsupport and assistance these young people need. That, too, must be \naddressed, and GEAR UP does that.\n  In fact, GEAR UP addresses the needs not only of students but also of \nparents. In a recent survey, 70 percent of parents indicated they have \nvery little information or they want more information about which \ncourses their child should take to prepare for college. Eighty-nine \npercent of parents wanted more information about how to pay for \ncollege. This information disparity is particularly acute in low-income \nareas. Again, GEAR UP provides that type of information and assistance.\n  It is well documented that continuous programs that are integrated \ninto the daily school life of a child are the best types of programs to \nprovide for successful outcomes. That is exactly what GEAR UP does. It \nstarts early in a career, sixth and seventh grade, follows the child \nthrough their middle school years and into high school, and is \nintegrated with other subjects so there is both continuous support and \nan integrated approach to preparing a child for college.\n  GEAR UP does this through partnerships and collaborations among State \ndepartments of education, high-poverty school districts, institutions \nof higher education, businesses, and other private or non-profit \ncommunity organizations. GEAR UP is a college preparatory program, a \nFederal program that focuses on children in early grades. As such, the \nexistence of other programs such as TRIO does not eliminate the need to \nfully fund GEAR UP. We have to recognize that we have not only the \nresponsibility but also an opportunity to fully fund the GEAR UP \nprogram.\n  I commend Senator Harkin and Senator Specter. They have dealt with a \nvariety of educational issues in a budget that constrains their \nchoices--indeed, their desires--significantly. They have done \nremarkable work, including funding for the LEAP program, which provides \nlow-income students with funds to go to college. But if you don't have \nthe first piece, if you don't have a GEAR UP program that gives \nstudents the skills, the confidence, the insights to get into college, \nPell grants and LEAP grants are irrelevant because these deserving \nyoung students won't even be in the mix.\n\n  GEAR UP is important. It is fundamental. The budget that Senators \nSpecter and Harkin were dealing with did not give them the full range \nof choices they needed to ensure they could fund these important \npriorities. That is why we are here today, to provide a total of $325 \nmillion for GEAR UP, an increase of $100 million over what is in this \ncurrent appropriations bill. If we do this, it will allow every State \nto have a GEAR UP program. As a result of the additional $100 million, \nGEAR UP would serve over 1.4 million low-income students across the \ncountry. That would be a significant and commendable increase in our \nefforts.\n  If we don't provide this full $325 million, we will see over 400,000 \nneedy students denied essential academic services which are provided \nthrough GEAR UP. Without this amendment, the need for these types of \nskills and support systems will not be met.\n  Furthermore, the demand for GEAR UP is not being met. In 1999, GEAR \nUP received 678 partnership and State grant applications covering all \n50 States. However, due to limited resources, only one out of four \npartnerships and half of the State applications could be funded. \nClearly, the need is there. The demand is there. We must meet it with \nsufficient resources.\n  Today GEAR UP's reach is limited because of the constraints on our \nappropriations. We need to provide sufficient resources so we can do \nour best to\n\n[[Page S5962]]\n\nreach all the needy students in the United States.\n  My home State of Rhode Island was fortunate to be one of the States \nto receive GEAR UP funding. The current Rhode Island GEAR UP program is \ncomprised of a partnership of 21 nonprofit organizations known as the \nCollege Access Alliance of Rhode Island. They reach out to schools. \nThey reach out to homes. They provide community support, a network \nwhich helps these young students understand their potential and tells \nthem: Yes, you can go on to college; yes, you can succeed; yes, you can \nbe part of this great American economy and this great American country.\n  Providing these resources has helped countless young Rhode Islanders \nto reach their full academic potential. In just one year, Rhode Island \nGEAR UP has provided invaluable services. It has helped 1,300 students \nenroll and participate in summer academic programs. It has tracked the \nacademic progress of over 8,000 highly mobile, disadvantaged students. \nThey move many times from school to school, city to city. Rhode Island \nGEAR UP has been able to track these youngsters, keep in contact with \nthem, keep encouraging them, keep getting them ready to go on to \ncollege. It has also identified 1,000 low-income students in need of \nextra support. It has linked these students to academic tutoring and \nmentoring, the kind of help they need to succeed.\n  Although these are impressive numbers, because of limited resources \nwe currently cannot duplicate this type of effort in every State, in \nevery community across the country. I believe we should.\n  My amendment is cosponsored by Senators Kennedy and Murray. It is \nalso supported by a broad coalition of interested groups: the United \nStates Student Association, the California State University; the \nCollege Board, the National Association for College Admission \nCounseling, the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities, the \nAmerican Association of Community Colleges, the National Association of \nState Student Grant and Aid Programs, the American Association of \nUniversity Women, the American Counseling Association, the National \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals, the National Association of \nState Boards of Education, and the National PTA.\n  I have a letter representing their support. At this time, I ask \nunanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            United States Student Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2000.\n     Hon. Jack Reed,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reed: On behalf of the undersigned, I wish to \n     express my strong support and appreciation for your amendment \n     to provide $325 million for GEAR UP in FY 2001.\n       As you know, early intervention and mentoring programs \n     drastically increase the chances that low-income students \n     will attend and graduate from college. GEAR UP takes a unique \n     approach to early intervention. First, GEAR UP involves whole \n     cohorts of students, beginning in middle school and extending \n     throughout high school. Research clearly demonstrates that we \n     must help students to begin preparing for college no later \n     than the middle school grades.\n       Second, GEAR UP is sparking the development of university/\n     K-12 partnerships that often include businesses and \n     community-based organizations. In fact, more than 4,500 big \n     and small businesses, community-based organizations, \n     religious and civic organizations, chambers of commerce, and \n     others joined the states, universities, and middle schools \n     that submitted applications for the first round of GEAR UP \n     awards in 1999. Clearly, our nation's business and community \n     leaders recognize that the quality of tomorrow's workforce \n     depends, in large part, upon what we do today to prepare \n     middle and high school students for the rigors of college-\n     level work.\n       Because such programs are crucial to increasing access to \n     higher education, we believe that it is important to point \n     out that the undersigned strongly support all efforts to \n     increase access through early intervention programs, \n     including TRIO. Although the objectives of these programs are \n     similar, the approaches that TRIO and GEAR UP employ are \n     quite different. In view of the tremendous challenges we face \n     in breaking down the barriers to college attendance for \n     students from low-income families, we also support funding \n     the TRIO program at the highest possible level.\n       Some $231 million in FY01 funding is needed just to keep \n     year-one and year-two GEAR UP grantees on their current \n     trajectory. Should the Senate fail to adopt your amendment, \n     needy students in communities that have not yet received GEAR \n     UP grants will be denied the opportunity to gain the skills \n     and information essential for going to college.\n       Senator Reed, we thank you for all you are doing to ensure \n     that the door to higher education is opened wide to low-\n     income students in Rhode Island and throughout our nation.\n       With best regards,\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Kendra Fox-Davis,\n\n                                                        President,\n                            The United States Student Association.\n\n       This letter is sent on behalf of the following entities:\n     American Association of University Women\n     American Counseling Association\n     The California Community Colleges\n     The California State University\n     Chicago Education Alliance\n     Chicago Teachers' Center\n     Cincinnati Public Schools\n     Cincinnati State Technical and Community Colleges\n     Cincinnati Youth Collaborative\n     The College Board\n     Council of the Great City Schools\n     DePaul University\n     Gadsden State Community College\n     Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities\n     Loyola University\n     National Alliance of Black School Educators\n     National Association for College Admission Counseling\n     The National Association for Migrant Education\n     National Association of School Psychologists\n     National Association of Secondary School Principals\n     National Association of State Boards of Education\n     National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs\n     National Education Association\n     The National HEP-CAMP Association\n     National PTA\n     New York State Education Department\n     Northeastern Illinois University\n     Ohio Appalachian Center for Higher Education\n     Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education\n     Pennsylvania State System for Higher Education\n     Roosevelt University\n     Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey\n     Saint Olaf College\n     State Higher Education Executive Officers\n     State University System of Florida\n     United States Student Association\n     University of Cincinnati\n     University of North Carolina\n     University of Washington\n     Vermont Student Assistance Corporation\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, one of our primary educational goals should \nbe to ensure that all students with the skill, talent, and ambition to \ngo to college can go to college. In order to accomplish that goal, we \nhave to fund, of course, Pell grants; we have to fund the LEAP program. \nWe have to do many of the things Senators Specter and Harkin have \ninsisted upon in this bill. But we also have to do something which \nhelps students early on through the GEAR UP program, and give these \nyoung students the skills, the confidence, and the expectation that \nthey can and should go on to college. That is why I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no doubt that the GEAR UP \nprogram is a very fine program. It has been in existence for a fairly \nshort period of time. It originated with Congressman Chaka Fattah from \nPhiladelphia, who had the initial idea and took it to the President, \nwho agreed with it. It was put into effect just a few years ago. It \nstarted out at a funding level of $120 million. Last year, the \nPresident requested an increase, and we came up to some $200 million, \nand our Senate bill has $225 million in the program.\n  Coincidentally, I happened to attend the President's program where he \ndid one of his Saturday speeches on it. So I know the program \nthoroughly. In fact, with Congressman Chaka Fattah, I visited a school \nin west Philadelphia where this program was being used. Regrettably, \nthere is simply not enough money to accommodate all of the programs, \nwhich are good programs, which we would like to have. It is not \npossible to accommodate the program Senator Kerry of Massachusetts \noffered about technical training, or the Bingaman amendment on an extra \n$250 million for title I, or the Wellstone amendment of $1.7 billion.\n  We have put substantial money into job training programs. Job Corps \nis up to more than $650 million, with almost a $20 million increase. We \nhave structured a program on school safety as to\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\nviolence and a program as to drugs. These are programs we have \nstructured to do the best we can.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island has commented about what Senator Harkin \nand I have attempted to do in this bill, which is the maximum stretch, \nas I had said earlier, that can be accommodated on this side of the \naisle at $104.5 billion. Regrettably, the money is simply not present. \nI wish it were.\n  The House has $200 million, which is less than the $225 million we \nhave on the Senate side. We will do our best to maintain that kind of \nan increase, which would be $25 million, which is as far as we can \nrealistically go.\n  How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 and a half minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have 12 and a half minutes out of the 15?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have said what I had to say. I will not use all of my \ntime. How much time does the Senator from Rhode Island have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I intend to raise a point of order under section 302(f) \nof the Budget Act, as amended, that the effect of adopting the Reed \namendment would provide budget authority in excess of the \nsubcommittee's 302(b) allocation and therefore it is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair notes that the Senator from Rhode \nIsland still has time pending and the motion would not be in order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As I said, I intend to raise that point of order after \nhe has completed his statement.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I recognize Senator Specter's dilemma with \nthe budget resolution, as it fairly constrains his ability and the \nability of his colleagues on the committee to fund programs that are \nworthwhile. In fact, I note that GEAR UP is a program that evolved from \na model that was very popular in Pennsylvania, the I Have a Dream \nProgram, and others. The Senator is familiar with it and is supportive \nof it. My point is that this is one of those critical programs, and we \nhave to reach beyond this budget resolution and budget constraints and \ntry to find the resources.\n  It is particularly appropriate at this moment, as we are looking \nahead at significant surpluses that are growing--dividends from tough \nfiscal decisions we have made over several years--that we begin to \ndevelop a strategy to invest more and more into education. GEAR UP is a \nworthwhile program--eminently worthwhile. One could argue it is the \nfirst step in so much of what is included in this legislation, such as \nPell grants, LEAP, and all of those programs that actually give these \nyoungsters the money to go to college. But if they don't have the \nskill, motivation, and the confidence to try, those grants won't be \nuseful to them.\n  So I once again urge that we move forward with this amendment. I \nunderstand that the Senator from Pennsylvania will make a budget point \nof order. At that time, I will make a request to waive that applicable \nsection. If the Senator is ready to make the motion, I am happy to \nyield back all my time and then be recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I will just add one thing. I appreciate \nthe sincerity of the comments of the Senator from Rhode Island that \nthis is a more important program. That is what the proponents of all of \nthe amendments have had to say. If the Senator from Rhode Island could \nfind offsets within the budget resolution and tell me and Senator \nHarkin what programs are less important and have offsets, I would be \npleased to entertain that consideration. To add to the budget, it is \nthe same point that has been made repeatedly--that everybody's program \nis special. And I happen to agree with them; they are all special \nprograms. But if you made it more special than something already in the \nprogram and have an offset, we would not raise the rule.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the vote on the Reed amendment be \nstacked to occur later today at a time to be agreed upon by the \nleaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I yield back all time if the Senator from \nRhode Island is prepared to do the same.\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is now relevant to raise the point of \norder under section 302(f) of the Budget Act that the amendment would \nexceed the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation and therefore it is not in \norder.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of that act \nfor the consideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, sequencing now comes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy. Parliamentary inquiry: It is my \nunderstanding that there is a time agreement for 1 hour equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum on my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3678\n\n(Purpose: To adjust appropriations for workforce investment activities \n                        and related activities)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself, \n     Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Robb, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n     Reed, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n     Bayh, proposes an amendment numbered 3678.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 12, strike ``$2,990,141,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,889,387,000''.\n       On page 2, line 13, strike ``$1,718,801,000'' and insert \n     ``$2,239,547,000''.\n       On page 2, line 15, strike ``$1,250,965,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,629,465,000''.\n       On page 2, line 17, strike ``$1,000,965,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,254,465,000''.\n       On page 2, line 18, strike ``$250,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$375,000,000''.\n       On page 5, line 6, strike ``$153,452,000'' and insert \n     ``$197,452,000''.\n       On page 5, line 7, strike ``$3,095,978,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,196,746,000''.\n       On page 5, line 26, strike ``$153,452,000'' and insert \n     ``$197,452,000''.\n       On page 6, line 1, strike ``$763,283,000'' and insert \n     ``$788,283,000''.\n       On page 20, line 1, strike ``$19,800,000'' and insert \n     ``$22,300,000''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment is based upon a rather \nbasic and fundamental concept; that is, every worker who enters the job \nmarket is going to have seven or eight jobs over the course of his or \nher lifetime.\n  A number of years ago when I first entered the Senate many of the \nworkers in my own State got a job at the Fall River Shipyard, and their \nfather or mother had a job there, and many times their grandfather had \na job there, as well. They knew early in their lives that they would \nenter the same career as their family before them. They acquired their \nskills through training. They lived their lives more often than not \nwith only a high school diploma. They acquired their skills and \nupgraded their skills at the place of employment, but usually their job \nchanged very little. They were able to have a very useful and \nconstructive and satisfying life.\n  The job market has changed dramatically in recent years. It is \nchanging more every single day with the obvious globalization and the \nmove towards the information economy. New technologies are creating new \ncareers and new businesses, and many people are in jobs that didn't \nexist a generation ago. These new businesses are an important part of \nour new economy, and they also create many new jobs. But they have\n\n[[Page S5964]]\n\nalso created new challenges for our workers. Education has become \nincreasingly important to move up the ladder in the job market. And the \nidea of continuous skill development has become a critical part of \nworkplace success.\n  We have learned that continuing ongoing training has to be a lifetime \nexperience. We know that some companies are providing training \nprograms. More often than not, those training programs are directed to \nthose in the upper levels of the management of those companies. For too \nlong we have left behind those who have been the real backbone of so \nmany of these companies--the workers who often lack basic academic and \ntechnical skills.\n  These programs which have been included in the amendment that I have \noffered are basically to try to make sure we are going to offer more \nworkers the skills necessary in order to continue to be the world \nleader in terms of our economy.\n  I don't know how many others in this body go back home over the \nweekends and meet with various groups, including various business \ngroups. I find in my State of Massachusetts and generally throughout \nNew England that the first issue people raise is: When are we going to \ndo something about the H-1B issue? People who listen to talk about H-1B \nwonder what in the world it is. H-1B is a visa program. It permits \nimportation of highly skilled foreign nationals to work in our plants \nand corporations. That is a key question on the minds of those involved \nin so many of the expanding economies in this country.\n  I always say: Yes. We ought to move ahead. I hope we can move ahead \nand expand that program before we leave this Congress.\n  H-1B visa provides a temporary solution to a labor market shortage of \nhighly skilled workers. I think the answer to this is not only in the \ntemporary way to have an expansion of the highly skilled workers coming \nto the United States, but to develop the skills for American workers so \nthey can have those jobs in the future. Those are good jobs. They are \nwell-paying jobs. Americans ought to be qualified for those. The only \nthing that is between Americans gaining those jobs are the training \nprograms for upgrading their skills. We need to strengthen our \nsecondary education and provide better access to post-secondary \neducation for more students. And we have to improve the access to on-\nthe-job training for current workers, and provide the resources to \nsupport dislocated workers with training and re-employment services.\n  What happened in the Senate? It is almost as if this appropriations \nbill just fell off the ceiling. It has lacked, with all due respect, \nthe focus and attention to what we have tried to do in some of the \nauthorizing committees.\n  This fall, for the first time, we will put in place the Workforce \nInvestment Act, which I was proud to cosponsor with Senators Jeffords, \nDeWine and Wellstone, to consolidate the 126 different workforce \nprograms in 12 different agencies that too often are tied up with a \ngood deal of bureaucracy. We started working on that legislation with \nSenator Kassebaum and it took three years before we passed that \nprogram.\n  I had the opportunity on Monday of this last week to go out to \nWorcester, MA. There were 800 people gathered there interested in the \nwork training programs from all over New England. They are eager to \nknow how they are going to get the resources to try to put together \nthis consolidation of training programs in order to get the skills for \npeople in our region of the country. Workers know that they have to \nincrease their skills, especially in the area of computer technology, \nand they want to know how to access those programs. Those discussions \nare taking place in cities and towns all over the country.\n  Part of that consolidation was what we call one-stop shopping where a \nworker, for example, who has been dislocated or has lost their job, \nmaybe because of the merging of various industries, would be able to \ncome to one place to learn about all the options that they have for \ntraining. They would be able to have their skills assessed. They could \nget information on jobs that are available in their areas and the \nskills that they would need to compete for those jobs. And they would \nget an accurate assessment of their current skills.\n  They could see how long each training program takes, and a look at \nthe employment prospects. They also get information about how many \nformer participants in those programs did in the job market. How many \nof them got jobs right away, and at what salary? They also get a look \nat how many of those workers were still employed after a year, and how \nmany were able to move up in those jobs to better paying jobs with \ntheir companies.\n  The person can make up their mind. They can say: OK. I want to take \nthat particular program, and they are going to be able to go to that \nprogram and acquire the skills. It could be at a community college, a \nfour year college or at a private center. Wherever they choose, they \nare aware of how participants of that program performed in the \nworkplace.\n  That is what we attempted to do in a bipartisan way 3 years ago. \nThose programs are ready to go. What happens? The appropriations bill \npulls the rug out from under those programs.\n  Our amendment is trying to restore the funding at the President's \nrequest to make sure we are going to have the training programs that \nare necessary so American workers can get the skills to be able to \ncompete in the modern economy.\n  That is what this is all about. It may not be a ``front-page issue.'' \nIt may not be a ``first-10-pages issue.'' But as workers can tell you \nall over this country, skills are the defining issue as to what your \nfuture is going to be and what you are going to be able to provide for \nyour family.\n  This provides additional resources out of the surplus to be able to \nfund these programs in the way that the President has recommended.\n  There has been a lack of serious attention to the various programs \nwhich we mentioned. Tragically, I think the most dramatic has been in \nthe Summer Jobs Program.\n  Here is the story in the Wall Street Journal: ``Fewer youths get a \nshot at the Summer Jobs Program. This summer the Workforce Investment \nAct replaces the Nation's previous federally supported summer jobs.''\n  We tried to upgrade it and tighten it to eliminate some of the \nbureaucracy. We know that there needs to be a year-round connection to \nthe job experiences that young people have in the summer. What happens? \nThe minute we expand the mission of the Summer Jobs program, they cut \nout all of the funds for the Summer Jobs Programs for youth. We mandate \na year-round approach to getting some of the neediest youth equipped \nfor the world of work and we critically under-fund that effort. In \ndoing that we doom those young people to fail.\n\n  While local groups agree that the expansion will make the program \nmore effective, it will be more expensive. Washington hasn't provided \nthe funds. The Labor Department estimates participation will drop 25 \npercent to 50 percent from last year's 500,000 young people.\n  Dropping over 500,000 young people--most of them in the cities of \nthis country--and cutting them loose is probably about as shortsighted \nof a decision as could be made by this Congress.\n  At a time where we just had the announcement yesterday of surpluses \ngoing up through the roof, we are talking about today cutting out \neffectively the Summer Jobs Program for the most economically \nchallenged urban and rural areas of our country.\n  You can't talk to a mayor in any city of this country, large or \nsmall, who won't tell you that is the most shortsighted decision that \ncould possibly be made by the Congress today.\n  I know in my own city of Boston where they have anywhere from 10,000 \nto 12,000 Summer Jobs Programs, what happens? The private sector comes \nin and provides maybe 2,000 to 3,000 jobs. They try to build upon the \njobs program that existed in previous summers. High school students get \na chance to improve their academic skills and learn important workplace \nskills that enable them to get higher paying jobs in future summers. \nMany of them make business connections that give them employment \nopportunities throughout high school and college.\n  They will find children who have completed 1 year in the Summer Jobs\n\n[[Page S5965]]\n\nProgram, a second year in the Summer Jobs Program, and the third year \nthe private sector picks them up, and more often than not they get the \njob. If the young person is interested enough to continue the Summer \nJobs Program and acquire some skills, more often than not in my city of \nBoston they will be picked up and given a job to move ahead.\n  I wonder how many Members of this body have ever been with a young \nperson in the summer youth program the day they get their first \npaycheck and see the pride and satisfaction and joy of those young \npeople? They have a paycheck, many of them for the first time. They \nhave a sense of involvement, a sense of participation, a \nresponsibility, a willingness to stay the course.\n  We are saying to those young people: No way, we are cutting back. We \nhave record surpluses, but not for you, young America. Then we wonder \naround this body about violence in school, we wonder why young people \nare upset, disoriented, or out of touch with what is going on. We send \nthem back into the confusion of the inner city, send them out there \nwithout any supervision, send them out there without any sense of \ntraining or pride. That is what we are doing. We are basically \nabdicating our essential and important responsibility to the children \nof this country and abandoning our commitment to give workers help and \nassistance.\n  Soon the Senate will discuss the issue of expanded trade with China. \nThe votes are there to pass it. Many have pointed out that some are \nconcerned because some will benefit, and benefit considerably, while \nothers are going to sacrifice, and sacrifice considerably. We have \nheard those arguments about this providing new opportunities for many \naspects of our American economy. Many have said yes. But what about \nothers who will be laid off? They ought to get a little training to \nfind a future for themselves and their family.\n  What is happening now? We are closing the door for them. We are \ndenying them the right to have that kind of job training. We are \ndenying young people their first job experience and we are denying \nolder workers the training programs to give them job security. It is \nfine for those who will make the big fortunes. Increase the number of \nbillionaires in our society. What about those men and women who are \nlaid off? The only way they can survive is to get training in a \ndifferent job. That training will not be there with this budget.\n  Our amendment provides $1 billion additional dollars to the various \ntraining programs and the summer job programs. This is a tangible way \nto show Americans that we are going to provide the tools for them to \nfully participate in this growing, expanding, and global society. We \nneed to send a clear message that workers are the backbone of this \ncountry, the backbone of our economy, and every hard-working American \nis going to be able to gain skills to be useful and productive workers \nin the future in our society. This amendment ought to pass.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 6 minutes to each Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, \nSenator Kennedy, for yielding time. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of \nthe Democratic skills training amendment to the Labor-HHS-Education \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. This amendment further \nincreases our country's human capital by adding $1.05 billion to skills \ntraining programs at the U.S. Department of Labor.\n  Mr. President, while I commend the chairman and ranking member for \ntheir efforts in coming forward with a bill that avoids many of the \ndrastic cuts approved by the House of Representatives, there are still \na number of vital programs that continue to be seriously underfunded. \nThis amendment provides adequate funding for Federal skills training \nprograms to serve more individuals who are seeking to improve their \nability to contribute to the workplace. Today's global economy demands \nthat the United States do all it can to ensure that every member of our \nworkforce is prepared to meet new workplace chllenges. Unfortunately, \nthe gap between high-skilled and low-skilled workers continues to grow, \nleaving many at the lower end of the spectrum even farther behind.\n  One particular program I would like to mention is the Fathers Work, \nFamilies Win program. This important initiative improves the employment \npotential of certain low income individuals who generally have lower \nlevels of education and work experience. As a result, these individuals \nusually end up accepting jobs that pay relatively low wages and have \nfew benefits. They often have irregular track records in employment: \nthey hold several jobs at a time, work part-time or intermittently, or \nendure periods of unemployment. Many of these individuals have been on \nthe welfare rolls or are living under conditions that make them \nvulnerable to becoming dependent on Federal assistance.\n  We must not forget that these individuals have the potential to make \nmeaningful contributions to the economy and, given the opportunity, can \nbecome self-sufficient and successfully support their families. This is \none reason why I am interested in seeing the Fathers Work, Families Win \nprogram funded. The portion of the program entitled Families Win \nprovides $130 million in competitive grants for programs to help low \nincome parents stay employed, move up the career ladder, and remain off \nwelfare.\n  The program's Fathers Work component provides $125 million for \ncompetitive grants to help certain non-custodial parents find a job, \nmaintain employment, and advance on their career path. This is \nimportant because many fathers, rather than being ``deadbeat dads,'' \nare ``dead broke dads.'' They have the desire to support their families \nthrough child support payments and other means, but cannot do so \nbecause they cannot secure or maintain steady employment paying a \nliving wage.\n  Fathers Work, Families Win would build on the investments and \npartnerships started under the Workforce Investment Act and the \nWelfare-to-Work program. State and local Workforce Investment Boards \nare eligible applicants under both parts of Fathers Work, Families Win. \nThese boards have been implementing WIA [weeeea] across the country, \nreforming the way in which job training and job placement services are \nconducted. The competitive grant program funds enable the Boards to \nfurther integrate services for the population of low income workers \nunder programs such as WIA, Wagner-Peyser [wag-ner pie-zer] grants, \nWelfare-to-Work grants, and grants under the Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families program. This integrated approach will help to ensure \nthat many low income families will not fall through the cracks and will \nfind it easier to use the network of services at their disposal.\n  I continue to be a strong supporter of the Welfare-to-Work program. \nLast year, I introduced the Welfare-to-Work Amendments of 1999 which \nincluded provisions to reauthorize the program and to improve access to \nthe program for more low income individuals. The eligibility changes \nwere included in the consolidated appropriations bill for fiscal year \n2000, which I thank my colleagues for working on and supporting. \nHowever, the Welfare-to-Work program itself has not yet been renewed. \nWith eligibility changes taking effect for competitive grantees at the \nbeginning of 2000 and for formula grantees later this year, Welfare-to-\nWork efforts must be given more time to run. If the program is not \nreauthorized, worthwhile efforts at the State and local levels to help \nlow income families will be adversely impacted.\n  Because the Welfare-to-Work program has not been extended, many local \ncommunities are concerned because their efforts to help Welfare-to-Work \nparticipants have just begun. An abrupt end to the program would cause \nsignificant investments to go to waste. As the U.S. Conference of \nMayors states in a letter dated June 10, 2000, ``Without the extension \nof the Welfare-to-Work program, welfare reform will be dealt a serious \nset back in our nation's cities which are home to the highest \nconcentrations of people still on welfare.'' I ask unanimous consent \nthat this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5966]]\n\n\n                                                 The United States\n\n\n                                         Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2000.\n       Dear Member: The United States Conference of Mayors, \n     assembled in Seattle, is gravely concerned about the future \n     of the Welfare-to-Work Program. We urge you to extend the \n     Welfare-to-Work program as proposed in the Clinton FY 2001 \n     budget. Without the extension of the Welfare-to-Work program, \n     welfare reform will be dealt a serious set back in our \n     nation's cities which are home to the highest concentrations \n     of the people still on welfare.\n       Mayors are aware that some members of Congress have \n     legitimately raised concerns about the low expenditure rate \n     in the current Welfare-to-Work program. Unfortunately, a \n     large percentage of the funding did not reach the local level \n     until the last quarter of 1998. In addition, the initial \n     Welfare-to-Work eligibility requirements have excluded a \n     large segment of the hardest-to-serve welfare population and \n     thus inhibited the expenditure of the first $3 billion in \n     funding.\n       We were pleased that Congress made the necessary changes in \n     the eligibility requirements in the FY 2000 appropriations \n     bill. However, these eligibility changes were not effective \n     immediately. The changes are not effective for WTW formula \n     grant funds until October 1, 2000. For WTW competitive grant \n     funds, the changes became effective January 1, 2000.\n       We believe that the need for the extension of this funding \n     will become increasingly evident as the program becomes fully \n     operational and the eligibility changes are enacted. In fact, \n     indications from the U.S. Department of Labor's quarterly \n     reports on WTW spending are he expenditures for formula and \n     competitive grant funding have increased overall and that \n     expenditures for competitive grant funding has increased \n     significantly since January 1, 2000, when the eligibility \n     changes became effective. It is also expected that spend-out \n     rates will also increase significantly as larger numbers of \n     TANF recipients reach their time limits and lose eligibility \n     for cash assistance.\n       Mayors more than anyone else recognize that although \n     welfare roles have declined significantly across states, \n     great numbers of former welfare clients living in cities who \n     are in need of services still remain. Many of these \n     individuals who are still not working have little or no \n     skills, are unable to read and write beyond the 8th grade \n     level, and have no work experience. When they are able to go \n     to work, the jobs often pay below minimum wage, have no \n     health benefits and are insufficient to support the \n     individual, let alone his or her family.\n       As Mayors we realize that while many in the nation believe \n     the job of welfare reform is complete, we know that much work \n     remains to be done. The targeted and direct resources \n     provided by Welfare-to-Work are essential for us to address \n     the concentrated welfare caseloads in our cities and ensure \n     that those still on welfare make the transition into the \n     workforce. Discontinuing the Welfare to Work program at this \n     time would be a great disservice to those welfare recipients \n     still unable to find self-sustaining jobs.\n       The U.S. Conference of Mayors urges you to extend the \n     Welfare-to-Work program until we can honestly say that most \n     of those in need of these services are working in permanent, \n     self-sustaining jobs. Now is not the time to stop the \n     progress already made on Welfare Reform and Welfare-to-Work. \n     Now is the time to ensure that those remaining on the welfare \n     rolls who have the greatest challenges to employment are \n     served.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wellington E. Webb,\n       President Mayor of Denver.\n     Beverly O'Neill,\n       Chair, Jobs, Education and the Workforce Standing \n     Committee, Mayor of Long Beach.\n     H. Brent Coles,\n       Vice President, Mayor of Boise.\n     Marc H. Morial,\n       Chair, Advisory Board, Mayor of New Orleans.\n     David W. Moore,\n       Chair, Health and Human Services Standing Committee, Mayor \n     of Beaumont.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. The letter goes on to note that although welfare rolls \nhave decreased significantly across the country, ``great numbers of \nformer welfare clients living in cities who are in need of services \nstill remain.'' These are the hardest-to-help families who need our \ngreatest assistance. Furthermore, many of these individuals will be \nreaching their lifetime limit on welfare benefits imposed by the 1996 \nwelfare reform law and will no longer be able to rely on regular cash \nassistance to support their families. We cannot allow these families to \nbe left without any safety net and should continue pursuing efforts to \n``teach them how to fish''--this is what the amendment before us would \ndo.\n  While I am disappointed that the bill before us does not extend the \nWelfare-to-Work program, I hope that under the eligibility changes I \nhelped to pass last year, Welfare-to-Work program accomplishments will \ncontinue to grow and provide strong impetus for the program's \nreauthorization. In the meantime, I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport programs such as Fathers Work, Families Win for low income \nindividuals.\n  It is interesting to note that in 1998 and 1999, while the nation was \nexperiencing low unemployment, layoffs were still widespread. This \ntrend was mainly due to companies requiring new skills to meet the \ndemands of a new economy. Unfortunately, as we have seen by the \nannouncements of large-scale layoffs from companies such as Coca-Cola, \nJ.C. Penney Company, and Exxon Mobil Corporation, the situation is not \ngetting any better.\n  So, why are we in Congress looking at reducing or eliminating funding \nfor vital programs that empower former welfare recipients and low-wage \nworkers with the information and skills necessary to become viable \ncitizens in their communities? Skills Training programs are essential \nto ensure that displaced workers will be able to transition into \nanother trade. We must not forget that the Federal Reserve Board is \nreviewing the possibility of raising interest rates in an effort to \nslow down U.S. economic growth. This could negatively impact not only \nHawaii's economy, especially the construction industry that is one of \nHawaii's leading areas for job growth, but the nation as a whole. \nHawaii's economy is just recovering from a decade of economic \nstagnation and layoffs and cannot afford another recession without \nproviding the necessary funds for skills training programs.\n  The current and proposed funding levels for skills training programs \nare inadequate to ensure the availability of a trained workforce. We \nmust remain committed in our efforts to equip employers with an \nemployment system capable of addressing potential labor shortages. For \nthe State of Hawaii, eliminating all new funding for One Stop Career \nCenters/Labor Market Information will adversely impact Hawaii's ability \nto comply with the Workforce Investment Act. Hawaii will not be able to \ndevelop core employment statistics products used by employers, job \nseekers, educators, students, and others. More specifically, valuable \nlabor market information would no longer be provided to the public.\n  I commend Hawaii's Job Corps program for its successful placement \nrate of 70 percent. This is significant given Hawaii's fragile economy \nin recent years. The success of this program clearly illustrates the \npositive effect the skills training programs have on our communities. \nWe should not reduce or eliminate funding for these vital programs that \nenhance employment opportunities for individuals and their families.\n  The amendment offered by my distinguished colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, would address the potential \nshortcomings in funding as proposed in the House and Senate. This \namendment provides appropriate funding for the Department of Labor's \nYouth and Adult Employment and Training Programs, especially funding \nfor Dislocated Worker assistance, Youth Opportunity grants, Job Corps, \nand One Stop Career Centers. In addition, this amendment also provides \nappropriate funding for the Summer Jobs program resulting from \nimplementation of the Workforce Investment Act.\n  We must continue to improve our skills training program to ensure \nthat America's workforce remains competitive to the global economy. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have just learned within the last few \nminutes that a decision has been made on Capitol Hill to eliminate the \nSummer Jobs Program for this year. That decision was made by Republican \nleaders who have decided that it costs too much--$40 million.\n  We have to sit back, from time to time, and measure the relative cost \nof decisions we make. If we are going to say to literally tens of \nthousands of young people across America that there will not be a \nSummer Jobs Program, what price will we pay for that decision? For many \nof these kids, it\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\nmeans there will not be an opportunity for the first time in their \nlives to have a real job, a real learning experience in the workplace.\n  In this country we are prepared to pay whatever it takes when we \nsentence someone to prison. In Illinois, it costs about $30,000 a year \nto keep someone in prison. That failed life that led to crime and \nconviction ends up costing us $30,000 a year. Is it too much to pay? \nNo, we will pay it. But when it comes to jobs for kids during the \nsummer, the Republican leadership has decided it is too much to pay.\n  How about school dropouts? When kids drop out of school, they not \nonly ruin their own lives but often affect the communities in which \nthey live. These are the kids hanging out on the street corners. These \nare the ones who may never have a job. These are the ones who become \nchronic statistics in our society. We will pay for those statistics one \nway or the other. We have decided that is a cost we will pay. But when \nit comes to providing jobs in the summer for kids going to school, the \nRepublican leadership decided today it was too high a cost to pay. Of \ncourse, when we talk about tomorrow's workers, we realize that kids who \nare not put on the right track with the right values early in life may \nnot go on to finish school or to become the workforce of the 21st \ncentury for America. That is an expense to this country. It is \nobviously something the Republican leadership is willing to pay, rather \nthan pay for a Summer Jobs Program.\n  What does this program mean? In my home State of Illinois, the \ndecision today by the Republican leaders to take out the Summer Jobs \nProgram means that 10,000 kids coming out of schools in the Chicagoland \narea will not have a 6-week minimum wage summer job. Is that an \nimportant life experience? Boy, it sure was for me. Going to work meant \na lot for me. As my folks used to say: We want you to learn the value \nof a dollar. When I went to work, I understood the value of a dollar. I \nadded up every paycheck and how I was going to save it, how I was going \nto spend it. It also teaches you the value of hard work, the fact that \nyou do get up with the rest of the world and go to work and don't \nexpect somebody to hand you something. That is the value of a summer \njob, a value that will be denied to tens of thousands of kids because \nof a decision the Republican leadership made to kill the Summer Jobs \nProgram. The value of showing up on time to work, dressed properly, \nprepared to work with your coworkers, you cannot teach all that in \nschool. Some of that is a life experience. It is an experience I had \nand virtually everyone has on their way to a successful life. For tens \nof thousands of kids, they will be denied that opportunity because of \nthis decision by the Republican leadership.\n  Of course, for me and a lot of others, that summer job taught us the \nvalue of staying in school. How many times did I stop behind that \nshovel and think: I don't want to do this the rest of my life. I am \ngoing to go back to school. I am going to get my college degree and go \non. That is the value of a summer job, too.\n\n  Senator Kennedy is right. If we have the values, the same values of \nfamilies across America, we would be voting for this program and this \namendment he is proposing for summer jobs for kids so they can have a \nvaluable work experience. We would be voting for this amendment so \nthere will be job training for those dislocated from their jobs. We \ndon't want to give up on workers. I believe in free trade, but I know \nthat millions of workers in America lose their jobs each year because \nof technology and trade and change. We should be there with programs to \nhelp them move to the next job so they do not lose pace with the \neconomy and the quality of life they are used to.\n  This amendment gets to the heart of the values of the Members of the \nSenate. Senator Kennedy is right. I am happy to cosponsor it. The mayor \nof the city of Chicago said: The School Jobs Program keeps kids away \nfrom gangs, guns, and drugs. He hit the nail on the head. If we put \nmore and more kids into positive programs where they learn how to work \nand continue to learn in the workplace, their lives can be transformed. \nIf there is one value we share as Americans, it is the value of hard \nwork.\n  The decision by the Republican leadership to close down the Summer \nJobs Program is a decision that flies in the face of the values of this \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time? The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I welcome the superb statement made by my friend and \ncolleague from Illinois. The Commission for Economic Development says \nthat half of manufacturing companies nationwide do not offer any \ntraining programs. Nationally, all employer training programs equal \njust 1 percent of their payroll costs.\n  I have here this ``Opportunity Knocks,'' a study done as a Joint \nProject of Mellon New England and Massachusetts Institute for a New \nCommonwealth. It says:\n\n       Which workers get employer-provided job skills? For large \n     employers with 50 workers or more, 80 percent are management. \n     These employers are more likely to provide job skills \n     training for managers, computer technicians, and sales \n     workers that for production or service workers. How are these \n     lower skilled workers supposed to improve their skills and \n     move up the ladder? This really is the case. Companies are \n     doing more hiring and firing simultaneously than ever before. \n     Workers who need a new set of skills are often replaced \n     rather than retrained. We need to get workers the skills that \n     they need to compete in this information-age economy. That is \n     quite different from Europe, for example, where the companies \n     are required to provide a range of different skills training \n     so there is an investment in a company's workers. They value \n     the individual, and they know that continual, ongoing \n     training programs in each of those major industries makes \n     good business sense.\n\n  This study goes on to say that the poor odds of an employer offering \nany training is only part of the problem. Access to employer-provided \ntraining is by no means equal across categories of workers. Most \nbusinesses are unlikely to provide any training opportunities to \nclerical or production workers and when they do offer training it is in \nthe form of an orientation to their present job. There is no attention \nto up-grading the skills of those workers.\n  I want to mention, as we reach the end of this presentation, the \ncomments of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. He recently said:\n\n       [The] rapidity of innovation and unpredictability of the \n     directions it may take imply a need for considerable \n     investment in human capital.\n\n  Workers in almost every occupation are being asked to strengthen \ntheir skills to ensure long-term success in the workplace. The \ntechnical know-how that workers need to stay on the cutting edge is \nbeing redefined every day.\n  We are being told by the head of the Federal Reserve that this is \nwhat is necessary to keep America's economy strong. We are being told \nthat by the business community. We are being told that by workers. We \nare being urged to do that by the President of the United States. It \nmakes no sense to undermine that.\n  We have taken action in a bipartisan way to develop a workforce \ndevelopment system that will be effective. In the next month every \nstate will come on board to implement the new law. Without this \namendment we are effectively undermining this Nation's commitment to \nprovide important, necessary skills for America's workers so they will \nbe able to be full participants in the American economy of tomorrow.\n  It is wrong. I hope the Senate will accept my amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print letters from the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, National Association of Counties, and the Mayor \nof Boston.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                      The United States Conference\n\n\n                                                    of Mayors,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 27, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to express the strong \n     support of The U.S. Conference of Mayors for the Skills \n     Training Amendment that you will be offering to the Labor-\n     Health and Human Services and Education appropriations bill. \n     At our recent Annual Conference in Seattle, we sent a letter\n\n[[Page S5968]]\n\n     to Majority Leader Lott urging him to do just what your \n     amendment does--restore critical funding to the Department of \n     Labor for youth and skills training.\n       The U.S. Conference of Mayors just released a survey, \n     Examining Skills Shortages in America's Cities, which shows \n     that 86 percent of cities suffer shortages in technology \n     workers; 73 percent suffer shortages in health workers; 72 \n     percent lack enough construction workers to fill available \n     jobs; 71 percent lack manufacturing workers; and 50 percent \n     lack enough workers to fill retail and wholesale jobs. It is \n     imperative that we make the critical investment in our \n     nation's current and future workforce by supporting the \n     President's budget proposals and increasing year-round \n     funding for youth. It is crucial that sufficient resources \n     are provided to address the needs of our nation's youth and \n     the skills gap that seriously affects our nation's economy.\n       The funding level for the Summer Jobs and year-round youth \n     programs currently proposed in the FY 2001 appropriation bill \n     is unacceptable, especially as programs gear up under the \n     recently enacted Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (WIA). The \n     funding level of the Youth Opportunity Grant Program for out-\n     of-school youth is also short-sighted, as there are massive \n     unmet needs of unemployed, out-of-school youth in high \n     poverty areas.\n       We applaud your leadership in addressing these issues and \n     your efforts to restore this critical funding. We should be \n     investing in our current and our future workforce--the health \n     and vitality of our cities, and our nation, depend on it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                J. Thomas Cochran,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                                    June 28, 2000.\n     Subject: Sen. Kennedy's amendment to the Labor/H \n         appropriation to increase funding for skills training.\n\n       Dear Senator: The National Association of Counties (NACo), \n     the only organization representing America's counties in \n     Washington, DC, fully supports Senator Edward M. Kennedy's \n     amendment to increase appropriations for workforce investment \n     activities by $792 million for fiscal year 2001. NACo urges \n     the Senate to adopt this amendment to H.R. 4577, the Labor, \n     Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill.\n       NACo has identified increased funding for workforce \n     development programs as a critical funding priority for 2000. \n     Therefore, we will be tracking your vote on this amendment \n     and any related motion to waive the Budget Act. Your vote \n     will be recorded on our web site (www.naco.org) and the \n     information will be made available to county commissioners in \n     your state.\n       This amendment is of critical importance to America's \n     counties. Current and proposed funding levels for inadequate \n     to ensure that America's counties can effectively implement \n     the Workforce Investment Act. Sen. Kennedy's amendment would \n     address the substantial shortfall in funding currently \n     proposed in the House and Senate by addressing funding for \n     youth programs, incumbent and dislocated worker programs, and \n     one-stop career centers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry E. Naake,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           City of Boston, MA,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, June 27, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to express my outrage at \n     efforts to cut funding for summer jobs programs and other \n     youth and skills related programs. As you know, Boston \n     operates one of the nation's largest summer jobs programs. \n     While we are at record low unemployment levels nationally, \n     youth unemployment rates in our cities are still unacceptably \n     high. There is a crisis among our young people as evidenced \n     by the violence and despair among youth in many of our \n     cities. The move to strip summer jobs funding from the \n     Emergency Supplemental comes at a time when we should be \n     investing in our young people, not cutting the future out \n     from under them.\n       I applaud your efforts to restore critical funding to the \n     Department of Labor for our youth and our nation's workers. \n     The Skills Training Amendment you are offering to the Labor-\n     Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill \n     will do exactly what we need to be doing--providing \n     sufficient resources to address the needs of our nation's \n     youth and the skills gap that seriously affects our nation's \n     economy.\n       As always, thank you for your tremendous efforts on behalf \n     of our youth.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Thomas M. Menino,\n                                                  Mayor of Boston.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we start from the proposition that this \nbill, for various education and health care and job training efforts, \nis dramatically larger than the bill that was passed in this body last \nyear, to everyone's satisfaction, increasing at a rate far more rapid \nthan the pace of inflation or population growth in the United States.\n  Obscured in the debate so far is the fact that there is some $5.4 \nbillion in job training programs in this bill, at a time of record low \nunemployment. This represents an increase of more than $16 million over \nthe bill that is currently in effect for the present year. The greater \nincreases in the bill, of course, were for education and for biomedical \nresearch, both of which exceed the amounts requested by President \nClinton. Even so, the bill provides funding for two new programs \nrequested by the Clinton administration: Worker training and \nresponsible reintegration of youthful offenders, each at $30 and $20 \nmillion respectively, a 22-percent increase for dislocated workers in \nthe course of the last 4 years, and a 25-percent increase in the same \nperiod of time for the Job Corps.\n  The private sector, of course, now looking more than ever for \nqualified employees, has dramatically increased its own hiring and \ntraining programs. Of course, in comparison with the House bill, this \nrejects the $400 million cut in the House bill in that field.\n  As for summer training, the argument of the Senator from Illinois was \na peculiar one. The current law for summer jobs, a law passed last \nfall, of course, well after last summer was over, has $1 billion in it \nfor just exactly that purpose: $1 billion for summer jobs for youth.\n  We have another in a series of amendments that illustrates the \nproposition that no matter how generous this body is, even I may say in \nmany cases no matter how generous the administration is, some Members \nwill come to the floor and demand more, whatever its impact on the \nbudget.\n  To quote the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board implicitly as \nbeing in favor of programs such as this is to fly in the face of logic. \nIt is the clear position, often quoted by Members on the other side, \nthat the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board believes that the single \nmost important means to the goal of a stronger economy we can follow is \nnot to increase Federal spending and, in fact, to decrease it. He has \nconsistently, over the years, held to the position that for the economy \nas a whole, for future job growth, the best thing we can do is be \nmodest in our spending, not to increase it, I suspect, as much as it is \nincreased in this bill.\n  In any event, as has been the case with previous amendments of this \nnature, it will simply add millions, in some cases billions, of dollars \nto the bill. It is subject to a point of order under the Budget Act. At \nthe appropriate time, that budget point of order will be presented.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nexpress my enthusiastic support for the amendment offered by my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Kennedy. Mr. President, Labor Secretary \nHerman summed up the challenge of today's economy when she declared at \nthe National Skills Summit in April that in this country we have ``a \nskills shortage, not a labor shortage.''\n  Right now we have the lowest unemployment rate in this country in the \nlast 30 years. But even as we celebrate this remarkable feat--and it is \nremarkable--we must remember that there are still some 13 million \npeople in this country who want, but do not have, a full-time job. The \nKennedy amendment would make full-time employment a real possibility \nfor homeless veterans, young people, and for youths seeking summer \nemployment.\n  I appreciate that the Labor-HHS subcommittee's allocations were \ninadequate to fund at sufficient levels all of the programs in this \nlegislation and I think they have done a good job with what they had to \nwork with. But clearly Mr. President this bill retreats from our \ncommitment to fund many critical education, training, and health \nprograms. I am troubled that the bill before us does not adequately \nfund job training programs for homeless veterans. Veterans issues are \nespecially important to me, and I know it is of great importance to my \nfellow veterans here in the Senate. The Kennedy amendment would allow \n1,400 more veterans to receive employment placement and economic \nsecurity than does the bill put forth by the Republicans.\n  This appropriations bill severely under-funds many important \nprograms, but none more critical than the youth job programs like Job \nCorps, Youth Opportunity Grants program, and the Summer Jobs program.\n  Mr. President, Job Corps is the nation's largest residential \neducation and\n\n[[Page S5969]]\n\ntraining program for disadvantaged youth. This program takes head on \nthe issues and the people who have been left behind in this period of \neconomic expansion. While many Americans enjoy unprecedented \nprosperity, the nation's unemployment rate among African-American \nteenagers is 22%, almost double the national teenage unemployment rate. \nTwenty-six percent of those who dropped out of high school between \nOctober 1998-99 are unemployed. We cannot relegate these people to the \nmargins of our society, especially during this moment of great national \nwealth.\n  There are 120 Job Corps centers in 46 states, including three in my \nstate of Massachusetts. Since 1964, Job Corps has given 1.7 million \nyoung people in this country the academic and vocational training they \nneed to get good, entry-level jobs, join the military, or go to \ncollege. Job Corps offers GED or high school equivalency programs and \ntraining in various occupations, as well as advanced training and \nadditional support services. Graduates of Job Corps go on to work in \nevery field from automotive mechanics and repair, to business, and to \nhealth occupations. This amendment would allow Job Corps to serve more \nthan 70,000 additional students and reduce staff turnover by offering \nJob Corps employees a more competitive salary.\n\n  This amendment would also greatly increase funding for the Youth \nOpportunity Grants. These grants serve some of the poorest inner-city \nareas and Native American reservations in the country, where \nunemployment levels are well above the national average. Unfortunately, \nthe Republican legislation would not allow the Department of Labor to \nexpand this program. Last year, the Department of Labor was able to \nfund only 36 of 150 grants under the Youth Opportunity Grant program, \ntwo of which are in Boston and Brockton, Massachusetts. This amendment \nwould allow the Department of Labor to fund 15-20 new grants, allowing \nus to provide job skills and real work experience to people who live in \nareas that have only heard rumors about our nation's economic growth, \nbut have not seen it for themselves.\n  I would also like to voice my support for increasing funding by $254 \nmillion to restore cuts in the Summer Jobs program. In late March I met \nwith 20 members of the Boston Mayor's Youth Council, who raised money \nto travel to Washington. We met right outside this chamber on the \nSenate steps. The 20 young people that I met with spoke extremely \neloquently and passionately about their experiences in summer jobs \nprograms, and they asked me to speak on their behalf in Washington in \nsupport of the Summer Jobs program.\n  Well, Mr. President, I intend to speak on their behalf. Approximately \n85% of youths in the summer jobs program last year were between the \nages of 14-17. Teens in that age group typically do not find private-\nsector work. But these young people were afforded the opportunity to \nlearn job skills and responsibility. We have all heard teachers lament \nthat students often greet lessons with cries of ``When are we ever \ngoing to have to use this again?'' Summer jobs make education relevant \nto teenagers, helping to reduce drop-out rates and fostering an \ninterest in higher education.\n  The Workforce Investment Act consolidates the Summer Jobs program and \nyear-round jobs program into a comprehensive system of services for at-\nrisk, low-income youth. But under the bill before us, 13,000 teens will \nbe eliminated from this program. The Kennedy amendment would add back \n$254 million, allowing us the opportunity to provide summer jobs to \n152,400 low-income students, 85% of whom would not otherwise be able to \nfind summer employment.\n  In March I received a letter signed by 22 mayors in the State of \nMassachusetts, urging me to fight for Summer Jobs program funding. In \nthis letter, the mayors write ``The state has benefitted because with \nthe young people working, negative behaviors that often result from \nidleness are prevented.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthis letter be printed in the record following my statement. I know \nthese programs are important and are working. And I know they should \nreceive greater funding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I don't want to end today without pointing \nout the importance of this amendment to our national trade policy. I \nbelieve very strongly in free trade. I know that the Trade and \nDevelopment Act that we passed earlier this year and granting PNTR to \nChina--if we ever get the chance to debate it in the Senate--will grow \nMassachusetts's economy and produce long-term benefits for workers in \nMassachusetts and across the country. But the budget put forth by the \nRepublicans takes no responsibility for protecting those who are most \nat risk for being left behind. This amendment does claim that \nresponsibility. As we continue with our push to open new markets, we \nhave got to ensure those who lack the skills, the income or the \neducation to get quality jobs can have an opportunity to succeed in the \nnew economy. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n\n                          Massachusetts Municipal Association,\n\n                                       Boston, MA, March 22, 2000.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy and Kerry: We are writing to urge you \n     to advocate for summer jobs funding in the Emergency \n     Supplemental Appropriations bill currently before Congress.\n       As you are aware, the Workforce Development Act (WIA), \n     which was signed into law in August 1998, will become \n     effectively July 1st, 2000. While we certainly support the \n     WIA goal of offering more comprehensive services for youth on \n     a year-round basis, we are concerned that the additional \n     requirements of WIA and the lack of an increase in funding \n     for year-round youth programs will result in the \n     Commonwealth's inability to provide the number of jobs that \n     we need to serve our youth population this summer. Estimates \n     project that we may have to turn over half of the eligible \n     youth away this summer barring an increase in summer jobs \n     funding.\n       The summer jobs program in Massachusetts has been \n     phenomenally successful, both for our young people and the \n     state as a whole. The young people gain work experience (many \n     for the first time), earn a paycheck (which many contribute \n     to household expenses), and have the chance to gain academic \n     skills (as summer is often a time when young people slide \n     backwards academically). The state has benefited because with \n     the young people working, negative behaviors that often \n     result from idleness are prevented.\n       This year we face a double threat, as Governor Cellucci has \n     chosen not to fund the state summer jobs program in his \n     budget. We are working with the Legislature and others to \n     restore this funding to the state budget. We will certainly \n     have a major problem if we lose funding from both the federal \n     and state programs.\n       At its winter meeting in January, the U.S. Conference of \n     Mayors passed a resolution to support: (1) an emergency \n     appropriation to address the shortfall of funds needed to \n     serve youth this summer; and (2) increased funding in the \n     FY2001 budget to meet the projected doubling of program costs \n     resulting from the new requirements of the Workforce \n     Investment Act. A copy of the resolution is enclosed.\n       Please keep us updated on the efforts to include funding \n     for summer jobs in the emergency appropriation and increased \n     funding in the FY 2001 budget. Thank you for your continued \n     support and assistance on this high priority issue.\n           Sincerely,\n         Thomas Menino Mayor, Boston; Daniel Kelly Mayor, Gardner; \n           Mary Whitney Mayor, Fitchburg; Michael Tautznik Mayor, \n           Easthampton; Robert Dever Mayor, Woburn; William \n           Scanlon Mayor, Beverly; Mary Clare Higgins Mayor, \n           Northampton; Lisa Mead Mayor, Newburyport; John Yunits \n           Mayor, Brockton; Thomas Ambrosino Mayor, Revere; Ted \n           Strojny Mayor, Taunton; David Madden Mayor, Weymouth; \n           Edward Lambert, Jr. Mayor, Fall River; Gerald Doyle \n           Mayor, Pittsfield; Patrick Guerriero Mayor, Melrose; \n           Peter Torigian, Mayor, Peabody; James Rurak, Mayor, \n           Haverhill; John Barrett III Mayor, North Adams; Richard \n           A. Cohen Mayor, Agawam; David Ragucci Mayor, Everett; \n           Frederick Kalisz, Jr. Mayor, New Bedford; James A. \n           Sheets Mayor, Quincy.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the \namendment my good friend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, has \noffered to the Labor/HHS appropriations bill to restore critical \nfunding to skills training programs at the Department of Labor.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the work that Senators Specter and Harkin \nhave put into this bill. Finding the appropriate balance in this bill \nis particularly difficult. And, while I am disappointed with the \nfunding levels for\n\n[[Page S5970]]\n\nmany of the programs at the Department of Labor, I do understand that \nSenator Specter and Senator Harkin care deeply about the programs \naffected by this amendment.\n  There are several components of the amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy but I would like to take a minute to discuss one in particular \nthat is of critical importance to my state of New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, the amendment calls for an additional $181 million for \ndislocated worker assistance This additional funding would meet the \nPresident's request for fiscal year 2001.\n  When Congress passed the Workforce Investment Act a couple years ago, \nan important component was the funding stream for dislocated workers. \nWhile much of the Nation has prospered over the past eight years, many \nin my home state have not. I have seen plant closing from Roswell and \nCarlsbad in the east, to Las Cruces in the south, Albuquerque in the \nnorth and Cobre in the west. Thousands of high paying jobs have been \nlost, and especially hard hit has been the extractive industries. I \ndon't need to tell my colleagues how devastating a plant closing can be \non a community and families.\n  The Workforce Investment Act authorizes grants to States and local \nareas to provide core, intensive training and supportive services to \nlaid off workers with the aim being to help them return to work as \nquickly as possible at wages as close as possible to those received \nprior to the layoff. These funds are critically important as the nature \nof our economy has changed over the last decade from an industrial base \neconomy to a technologically based one. Workers who are laid off today, \nparticularly those who have been with the same company for a number of \nyears, are often unprepared to reenter the work place or for the new \neconomy they face. Training and retraining is critical to develop the \nskills they need to quickly find a decent paying job and get back on \ntheir feet.\n  Under President Clinton, dislocated worker funding has tripled from \n$517 million in Program Year 1993 to $1.589 billion in Program Year \n2000. Yet despite these increases, the need for these services has \nunfortunately kept pace with, and in some cases exceeded, the \navailability of funds. The President's budget for year 2001 continues \nthe commitment to dislocated worker programs by providing adequate \nfunding levels that will give dislocated workers the tools to compete \nin the new economy. This is the second installment of a five-year \nUniversal Reemployment Initiative. Under the Universal Reemployment \nInitiative, dislocated worker funding was to be increased each year to \nensure that by 2004 every dislocated worker would receive training and \nreemployment services if they want and need it, every unemployment \ninsurance claimant who loses their job through no fault of their own \nwould get the reemployment services they want and need, and every \nAmerican would have access to One-Stop Career Centers.\n  However, and unfortunately in my opinion, unless the level of funding \nin the Senate's Labor/HHS bill is not increased, this will be the first \nyear since 1994 that there will be no increase in these funds, and our \ncommitment to universal reemployment will be in serious jeopardy. \nSpecifically, this bill cuts over $181 million from the President's \nrequest which will mean the Department of Labor will be able to serve \n100,825 fewer recipients. While the bulk of this cut would fall on \nState/local formula funding, it is important to note that 20 percent of \nthe cut--over $36 million, would be in the Secretary's reserve funds, \nreducing her capacity to make National Emergency Grants to respond to \ndisasters and large scale layoffs.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues know, New Mexico has been through a \ncouple rough months. These funds for dislocated workers are extremely \nimportant and I urge my colleagues to support the Kennedy amendment to \nbring the level of funding for this, and many other important programs, \nup to the level of the President's request.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would also encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment because of the increased funding levels for \nYouth Opportunity Grants, the Summer Jobs Program, and for Job Corps, \namong others. These programs, and the funding levels contained in this \namendment are likewise critical to meeting the needs of young people in \nmy state.\n  Again, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will support this \namendment and commend my friend, Senator Kennedy, for his leadership on \nissues that are so important to families and working men and women \nthroughout this country.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Kennedy's \nskills training amendment. This amendment contains important measures \nto provide individuals with the necessary skills to succeed in the \nworkforce. The amendment addresses the need to provide employment \nskills training to noncustodial parents, particularly fathers. The \n``Fathers Work, Families Win'' initiative begins to address a very \ntroubling epidemic, fatherlessness.\n  The number of children living in households without fathers has \ntripled over the last forty years, from just over five million in 1960 \nto more than 17 million today. Although the work of single mothers is \ntruly heroic, father absence has caused unnecessary burdens on women \nand has forced millions of children to overcome difficult social \nhurdles. For example, children that live absent their biological \nfathers are five times more likely to live in poverty. They are more \nlikely to bring weapons and drugs into the classroom, to commit a \ncrime, to drop out of school, to be abused, to commit suicide, to abuse \nalcohol or drugs, and to become pregnant as teenagers. The $255 million \nrequested for this initiative is dwarfed in comparison by the amount of \nmoney the Federal Government spends on dealing with the consequences of \nfatherlessness.\n  There are several pieces to this puzzle, one of which is employment \nservices. Too many fathers are unable to provide financial support for \ntheir children. Although many of these fathers have the desire to take \nresponsibility for their children, they do not have the means. In \nshort, these fathers are not dead-beat, they are dead-broke. The \n``Fathers Work, Families Win'' initiative gives us a way to work \nthrough the current infrastructure to deliver employment services to \nfathers and noncustodial parents. Skill-building and employment \nservices will help to increase the employment rate among noncustodial \nfathers and therefore, increase child support payments.\n  Our challenge is to give fathers the tools necessary to be successful \nparents. While employment services for noncustodial parents is an \nessential component to making fathers responsible, it is not the only \nservice that is needed to ensure these fathers become good parents. \nSenator Domenici and I have introduced a comprehensive package designed \nto address the fatherlessness epidemic. S. 1364, the Responsible \nFatherhood Act of 1999 would provide states with funds to promote the \nmaintenance of married, two-parent families, strengthen fragile \nfamilies, and promote responsible fatherhood. In addition to the \nprogram grants available to states, states would receive funds for a \nmedia campaign. A media campaign would be an effective way to \ncommunicate the message of father responsibility across ethnic, racial, \nand income barriers. The bill also recognizes the need to remove \nfederal disincentives to pay child support.\n  We face a great challenge, but we must not let it overwhelm us. We \nmust instead begin to put the pieces of the puzzle together. I commend \nSenator Kennedy for including the ``Fathers Work, Families Win'' \ninitiative in his amendment. It is my hope that the Senate will enact \nthis legislation and continue to pursue other solutions to the epidemic \nof fatherlessness.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I'm here to speak about the Kennedy \nWorkforce Investment amendment restoring cuts to the Department of \nLabor's training funds.\n  This amendment is just plain common sense. The single best thing we \ncan do for our society, and for every working family, is to make sure \nthat every American who wants a decent paying job has the skills \nnecessary to obtain a decent paying job. By helping youths and adults \nget the job training they need, we help turn them into tax-paying \ncitizens who can purchase goods and services, buy homes and afford \nhealth care, and contribute to our growing economy.\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\n  This amendment, in a multitude of ways, tries to address the most \nbasic challenge facing our country: How do we help American workers \ndevelop the skills they need to excel in an increasingly complex and \nconstantly evolving economy?\n  First, our amendment helps by fully funding the Dislocated Worker \nAssistance Program. It restores $181 million in funding to a program \nthat has made a substantial difference in the lives of Rhode Island \nworkers. We, like many formerly industrial states, have suffered great \nworker dislocation as industries have left, often to go somewhere \noverseas where labor was cheaper. Restoring this funding to the \nPresident's request would allow 100,000 more workers, dislocated \nthrough no fault of their own, access to training, job search and re-\nemployment services.\n  Our amendment also grants the Administration's request for $44 \nmillion to improve access to One-Stop services for million of Americans \nand make the job search process less overwhelming and more efficient. \nThe Director of the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training \ninformed me that the current cuts to this program will ``seriously \nimpact'' the ability of our state to provide the services and \ninformation now required by the Workforce Investment Act for use by job \nseekers and employers.\n  In addition to fully funding adult worker skills programs, our \namendment would add $254 million to restore cuts in the Summer Jobs \nProgram resulting from implementation of the Workforce Investment Act. \nMany states, like my own, were unprepared for this dramatic change in \nthe federal funding stream. Thousands of kids in Rhode Island, \nespecially 14- and 15- year-olds, are now going without summer jobs. \nMany of these kids are from small towns, others are from inner city \nProvidence--both are limited by their age and the lack of job \nopportunities in their respective communities.\n  Giving young people job experience benefits the entire country. The \ndevelopment of good work habits and a respect for the virtues of labor \nalone are strong payoffs. Everyone in this Congress should be \nsupporting a restoration of these cuts.\n  Finally, our amendment would restore $29 million to the Job Corps \nprogram, one of the most effective programs in the country for kids \nbetween the ages of 16 and 24. A recent Mathematica Policy Research \nInc. study shows that 16- to 17-year-old youths who go through the Job \nCorps program are 80 percent more likely to earn a high school diploma \nor GED than a control group excluded from the program. This group also \nearned salaries that were 20 percent higher and had arrest rates that \nwere 14 percent lower. This program works, and we should be fully \nfunding it.\n  Strengthening our workforce strengthens our families, and ultimately \nmakes our entire country stronger. Adopting this skills training \namendment is good for both American business and American workers, and \nevery member of this Chamber should be in support of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute remaining. The Senator \nfrom Washington has 26 minutes remaining.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  The Chair notes there is time still pending on the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I raise a point of order under section 302(f) of the Budget Act, as \namended, that the effect of adopting the amendment provides budget \nauthority in excess of the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation under the \nfiscal year 2001 Concurrent Resolution on the Budget and, therefore, is \nnot in order.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of the Budget Act for \nconsideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the time \nbeing we lay aside the current amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nconclusion of the debate on the Wellstone amendment on the subject of \nsuicide, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the previously \ndebated amendments, with 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation. \nThose votes are as follows:\n  Dodd amendment No. 3672 on community learning centers;\n  Kerry of Massachusetts amendment No. 3659 on technology literacy;\n  Reed of Rhode Island amendment No. 3638 on the GEAR UP program; and \nKennedy amendment No. 3678 on workforce investment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Those votes, Mr. President, will start at about 3:30 \np.m., for the information of my colleagues.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3680\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for a certification program to improve the \n    effectiveness and responsiveness of suicide hotlines and crisis \n                                centers)\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for himself and Mr. \n     Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered 3680.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 34, line 17, insert before the period the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That within the amounts \n     provided herein, $3,000,000 shall be available for the Center \n     for Mental Health Services to support through grants a \n     certification program to improve and evaluate the \n     effectiveness and responsiveness of suicide hotlines and \n     crisis centers in the United States and to help support and \n     evaluate a national hotline and crisis center network''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding there are 30 minutes \nthat have been designated for the amendment being offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No formal time agreement has been entered \nregarding this amendment.\n  Mr. REID. If the Chair would be kind enough to advise me when I have \nused 15 minutes, I won't ask for a unanimous consent agreement, but \nthere was an agreement that there would be approximately a half hour on \nthis.\n  This amendment would provide $3 million to certified crisis centers. \nThis deals with the plague of suicide that is sweeping this country. \nEvery year in America, 31,000 people kill themselves. This is probably \nfar fewer than the actual number. It is something that is very \ndevastating to those who are survivors. But there is also a situation \nin this country that creates a tremendous loss of economic benefits for \neveryone concerned.\n  I offered this amendment on behalf of Senator Wellstone because I was \nasked to by his staff. Since Senator Wellstone is the prime sponsor of \nthis amendment and is now on the floor, I would like for him to \nproceed. I will be happy to proceed when the Senator has completed his \nremarks. The amendment has been offered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Is there any \npending business at the moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business before the Senate is \namendment No. 3680.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is that the amendment by the Senator from Minnesota?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe we were scheduled to vote at \n3:30 on four amendments. So I inquire of my colleague from Minnesota \nhow long he will be on this matter.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be quite brief. I apologize. I \ndidn't realize the amendment was coming up now. Senator Reid and I were \ndoing this together. Probably 10 minutes is what I will need. My \nunderstanding is that the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has been \nfocused on suicide prevention and trying to do better with mental \nhealth treatment, would accept\n\n[[Page S5972]]\n\nthe amendment. I think I can do this in 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was going to take 15 minutes, but 10 \nminutes would be fine.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nto the Wellstone amendment on a 10-minute time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises Senators that there is no \ntime agreement, unless we get this unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time on \nthe Wellstone amendment be divided with 7 minutes for Senator Wellstone \nand 3 minutes for this Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I haven't spoken yet. I have only spoken for 1 minute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I object. I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania, I \nhaven't been out here on the amendment. He knows that, and I don't want \nthe Senator from Nevada to only have a few moments. It is an important \nissue. I don't think we can do it in that time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I withdraw my request and suggest that we proceed.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we will move forward and not go through \nany unnecessary delay. This amendment would support a certification \nprogram to improve and evaluate the effectiveness and responsiveness of \nsuicide hotlines and crisis centers in the U.S. and to help support and \nevaluate a national hotline and crisis center network.\n  Let me go through these figures here on the chart.\n  Suicide facts for our country:\n  Every 42 seconds someone attempts suicide.\n  Each 16.9 minutes someone completes suicide.\n  Suicide is the eighth leading cause of all deaths.\n  Death rates from suicide are highest for those over age 75.\n  The incidence of suicide among 15- to 24-year-olds has tripled over \nthe past 40 years, making it the third leading killer in that age group \nof 15- to 24-year-olds.\n  In the State of Minnesota, it is the second leading killer of young \npeople from age 15 to 24. These statistics that deal with mental \nillness and suicides are disturbing. I point out to my colleagues that \none of the factors that makes it so disturbing is that so much of \nsuicide is connected to mental illness, especially depression or \nsubstance abuse, and so much of it is diagnosable. Frankly, it is \ntreatable.\n  Really, there should be a hue and cry in the country for corrective \naction. I do a lot of work with Senator Domenici, and I get to do this \nwork with Senator Reid and Senator Kennedy as well. There are a whole \nhost of issues that deal with our failure to provide decent mental \nhealth coverage for people.\n  I thank Surgeon General David Satcher for doing marvelous work. The \nSurgeon General's report, which came out recently, talks about 500,000 \npeople every year in our country requiring emergency room treatment as \na result of attempted suicide. In 1996, nearly 31,000 Americans took \ntheir own lives.\n  I think of Al and Mary Kluesner in the State of Minnesota who started \nthis organization called SAVE. They themselves have lost two children \nto suicide. Several of their other children have been unbelievably \nsuccessful in their lives. There has been, up until fairly recently, \nthis shame and people feeling as if it is their own moral failure. But \nit has so little to do with that.\n  I met a couple weeks ago with Dr. David Shaffer from Columbia \nUniversity and Kay Jamison from Johns Hopkins University. She has done \nsome of the most powerful writing. It was Dr. Jamison who said before \nSenator Specter's committee, ``The gap between what we know and what we \ndo is lethal.''\n  We know so much about the ways in which we can treat this illness and \nwe can prevent people from taking their lives, but we have not done \nnearly as much. We have many different organizations that support this \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nOrganizations Supporting the Wellstone-Reid-Kennedy Suicide Prevention \n        Amendment to the LHHS Appropriations Bill, June 28, 2000\n\n\n                            38 organizations\n\n       American Association of Suicidology (AAS).\n       American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP).\n       Suicide Prevention and Advocacy Network (SPAN).\n       Suicide Awareness/Voices of Education (SA/VE).\n       National Mental Health Association (NMHA).\n       National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI).\n       Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law.\n       American Psychiatric Association.\n       American Psychological Association.\n       National Mental Health Awareness Campaign.\n       Light for Life Foundation (Yellow Ribbon Campaign).\n       QPR Institute (Question/Persuade/Refer).\n       National Organization of People of Color Against Suicide \n     (NOPCAS).\n       National Institute for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender \n     (NIGLBT).\n       With One Voice.\n       Contact USA.\n       Crisis Support Services of Alameda County.\n       Contra Costa Crisis Center.\n       Didi Hirsch Community Mental Health Center.\n       San Mateo Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention \n     Center.\n       Pueblo Suicide Prevention Center.\n       Alachua County Crisis Center.\n       CrisisLine of Lantana.\n       Switchboard of Miami.\n       Cedar Rapids Foundation 2.\n       Prince George's County Hotline and Suicide Prevention \n     Center.\n       St. Louis Life Crisis Services.\n       Crisis Call Center, Reno, Nevada.\n       Covenant House.\n       Fargo HotLine.\n       HelpLine of Delaware County.\n       HelpLine of Morrow County.\n       CONTACT of Pittsburgh.\n       Sioux Falls, Volunteer Information Center HelpLine.\n       Nashville Crisis Intervention Center.\n       Houston Crisis Center.\n       Crisis Link of Northern Virginia.\n       Friends of Mental Health of Loudon County.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, what this amendment does is add $3 \nmillion to SAMHSA to support, through grants, a certification program \nthat would evaluate the effectiveness and responsiveness of crisis \ncenters and suicide hotlines across the United States.\n  It also helps to support a national hot line and crisis center \nnetwork. There are 750 such crisis services in place across the country \ntoday. These centers are documented in the directory kept by the \nAmerican Association of Suicidology.\n  To date, there has been little or no funding to help support the \ntraining and to improve the quality of guidance through these hot line \nand crisis services. This amendment does exactly that. These funds will \nbe used to improve the training and the skills of the staff at the \ncrisis hot lines for suicides. There will be a variety of ways in which \nwe can get the money to people so this work can be done.\n  In awarding these grants, I encourage the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to collect an experienced nonprofit organization with \nsignificant expertise to administer this program.\n  According to U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, approximately \n500,000 people each year require emergency room treatment as a result \nof attempted suicide. In 1996 alone, nearly 31,000 Americans took their \nown lives. In the U.S., suicide is the third leading cause of death of \npeople age 15-34. A suicide takes place in our country every 17 \nminutes.\n  In some parts of our country, including my own state of Minnesota, \nsuicide is the second leading cause of death for these young people. \nThree times the number of Minnesotans die from suicide than from \nhomicide.\n  We know, without a doubt, that 90 percent of all completed suicides \nare linked to untreated or inadequately treated mental illness or \naddiction. To prevent suicide requires an all-out public health effort \nthat will recognize this problem, and will educate our country that we \ncan no longer afford to turn our eyes away from the unthinkable reality \nthat our citizens, even our children, may want to die.\n  Dr. Satcher and other national mental health experts, such as Dr. \nSteve Hyman, Director of the National Institute of Mental Health, have \nhelped bring this issue forward, and to help us understand that, with \nproper treatment, this is one of the most preventable tragedies that we \nface as a country.\n\n[[Page S5973]]\n\n  In 1996, the World Health Organization also issued a report urging \nmembers worldwide to address the problem of suicide, and one result was \nthe creation of a public/private partnership to seek a national \nstrategy for the U.S., involving many government agencies and advocacy \ngroups. This is clearly a serious problem throughout the world.\n  For too long, mental illness has been stigmatized, or viewed as a \ncharacter flaw, rather than as the serious disease that it is. A cloak \nof secrecy has surrounded this disease, and people with mental illness \nare often ashamed and afraid to seek treatment, for fear that they will \nbe seen as admitting a weakness in character. For this reason, they may \ndelay treatment until their situation becomes so severe that they may \nfeel incapable of reaching out.\n  Although mental health research has well-established the biological, \ngenetic, and behavioral components of many of the forms of serious \nmental illness, the illness is still stigmatized as somehow less \nimportant or serious other than illnesses. Too often, we try to push \nthe problem away, deny coverage, or blame those with the illness for \nhaving the illness. We forget that someone with mental illness can look \njust like the person we see in the mirror, or the person who is sitting \nnext to us on a plane. It can be our mother, our brother, our son, or \ndaughter. It can be one of us. We have all known someone with a serious \nmental illness, within our families or our circle of friends, or in \npublic life. Many people have courageously come forward to speak about \ntheir personal experiences with their illness, to help us all \nunderstand better the effects of this illness on a person's life, and I \ncommend them for their courage.\n  The statistics concerning mental illness, and the state of health \ncare coverage for adults and children with this disease are startling, \nand disturbing.\n  One severe mental illness affecting millions of Americans is major \ndepression. The National Institute of Mental Health, an NIH research \ninstitute, within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, \ndescribes serious depression as a critical public health problem. More \nthan 18 million people in the United States will suffer from a \ndepressive illness this year, and many will be unnecessarily \nincapacitated for weeks or months, because their illness goes \nuntreated. Many will die.\n  I recently had the good fortune to meet with a group of some of the \nforemost experts on suicide prevention, including Dr. David Shaffer, \nfrom Columbia University, and Dr. Kay Jamison, from John \nHopkins University. They gave me an extraordinary overview of the many \ncritical points of intervention where suicide may be prevented, and it \nis my intention to develop a larger bill, in collaboration with Senator \nHarry Reid, and hopefully many of my colleagues, that will address many \nof these issues.\n\n  But this amendment will meet an important need right now, one that is \ntimely, and even with its modest funding can help save many lives. This \namendment has the support of Senators Reid and Kennedy, as well as the \nsupport of the national groups:\n  American Association of Suicidology,\n  American Foundation for Suicide Prevention,\n  SPAN (Suicide Prevention and Advocacy Network),\n  National Mental Health Association,\n  National Alliance for the Mentally Ill,\n  American Psychiatric Association,\n  American Psychological Association,\n  Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, and SA/VE, a group based in \nMinnesota (Suicide Awareness/Voices of Education), headed by Al and \nMary Kluesner.\n  My amendment will add $3 million to SAMHSA to support through grants \na certification program to improve and evaluate the effectiveness and \nresponsiveness of crisis centers and suicide hotlines across the United \nStates, and to help support a national hotline and crisis center \nnetwork. Although there are 750 such crisis services in place across \nour country--these centers are documented in the directory kept by the \nAmerican Association of Suicidology--to date there has been little or \nno funding to help support the training and improve the quality of the \nguidance that is provided through these hotline and crisis services.\n  This amendment will do exactly that. These funds will be used to help \nimprove the training and skills of the staff at crisis hotline \nsuicides, through guidance provided by the American Society of \nSuicidology, the Center for Mental Health Services, the National \nInstitute Mental Health, and other mental health professionals. It will \nalso help support the development of a national hotline and network of \ncertified crisis centers.\n  In the awarding of grants, I would encourage the Secretary of HHS to \nselect an experienced non-profit organization with significant \nexpertise in this area to administer the certification process, so that \nthis process of training can begin as quickly as possible.\n  Telephone hotlines are only one of the points of intervention, and \nare not and cannot be the only solution to those who suffer from severe \nmental illness and the extraordinary despair that leads to suicide. Our \ncountry also needs to ensure that Americans have fair access to medical \ncare, that the stigma associated with mental illness is reduced, and \nmore education and training for health care providers is made \navailable. But the hotline does provide a lifeline for those who need \nto reach out for help and have nowhere else to turn too when they reach \nthe point of despair.\n  The crisis centers that run suicide hotlines are often patched \ntogether through a variety of funding sources, and struggle to keep \ntheir staff trained and their services of the highest quality. Although \nsome centers are certified by the American Association of Suicidology, \nand some are connected through the Hope Line Network that is working to \nestablish a national network, this process has only just begun. These \ncenters perform a critically important service and would benefit \nenormously from a national certification process and regular staff \ntraining. The time is right to fund such a process.\n  Staff at crisis centers need to be trained to conduct a suicide risk \nassessment to determine the seriousness and urgency of someone who may \nbe contemplating suicide. They also need to know when to refer the \nindividual to a local community mental health provider if the person is \nnot in crisis. But most importantly, they need to know when to send the \npolice to the person's home or workplace if the staff person is \nconvinced that a suicide is about to take place.\n  Most people think that there is a national suicide hotline already in \nplace that links people throughout the country. But until recently, \nthis was not so. Crisis centers operated on their own, with volunteer \nhelp, and few resources. Recently, a national hotline number (1-800-\nSUICIDE) was established through the Hope Line Network, through the \nNational Mental Health Awareness Campaign. As an example of the \nincredible need for such a number, the national hotline found itself \nflooded with calls after recently advertising on MTV and Fox Family \nChannel. Additionally, 1.5 million Americans logged onto their website \nduring the 2 weeks after this advertising began. There are obviously \nmany people who are in need of this service. And it needs to be the \nbest possible service, and linked as best it can be to local help.\n  By improving the training and skills of crisis hotline operators, \nsuch contact can be of the highest quality. Certification would require \nrigorous on site training and visits, evaluation of operations, records \nreviews, verification of staff training and skills, and the like.\n  The Surgeon General is to be commended for bringing this issue of \nsuicide forward as a major public health crisis in his 1999 report, \nCall to Action to Prevent Suicide. In his report, he specifically cited \nthe need for instituting training programs concerning suicide risk \nassessment and recognition, treatment, management, and aftercare \nintervention. He also asked that community care resources be enhanced \nas referral points for mental health services. This amendment helps to \nsupport both of these requests.\n  I must emphasize that suicide is often linked to severe depression \nand other forms of mental illness. These illnesses are not the normal \nups and downs everyone experiences. They are illnesses that affect \nmood, body, behavior, and mind. Depressive disorders interfere with \nindividual and family functioning. Without treatment, the person with a \ndepressive disorder is\n\n[[Page S5974]]\n\noften unable to fulfill the responsibilities of spouse or parent, \nworker or employer, friend or neighbor. And far too often, without \ntreatment, a person can reach such a level of despair that they will \ntake their own life. This amendment will fund programs to help people \nget the treatment they need before it is too late. As Dr. Kay Redfield \nJamison stated in a recent Senate hearing on suicide, when it comes to \ntreatment for mental illness, ``the gap between what we know and what \nwe do is lethal.''\n  The issue of suicide prevention is one that we have discussed before, \nat a hearing held by Senator Specter, and during other discussions \nabout mental health research and treatment. I am proud of my colleagues \nwho have supported these efforts, including the cosponsors of this \namendment, Senator Reid and Senator Kennedy. I am proud to join them in \nbringing this amendment forward, and I ask you for your support.\n  There is a piece of legislation I have with Senator Domenici called \nthe Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act. We believe, especially when \nit comes to physician visits and days in hospitals, that people with a \nmental illness should be treated the same way as people with a physical \nillness. We think it is time to end this discrimination.\n  I have two other amendments that are included in other legislation \nwhich deal with the problem of suicide and mental health--especially \nwith young people--and ways of getting money to communities that can \nthen put the money to use, whether it be substance abuse treatment \nprograms, whether it be family counseling, or whether it be \npharmacological treatment, or you name it.\n  The amendment I introduced with Senator Reid is very basic. It is \nvery straightforward.\n  It basically provides the grants through a certification program to \nimprove the effectiveness of these suicide hot lines and crisis centers \nin the United States. It will help them support and evaluate a national \nhot line and crisis center network.\n  I say to my colleague from Nevada that this is really incremental. It \nis not the be all or the end all. But the additional resources will \nreally help SAMHSA. It will help us make sure these crisis hot lines \nare put to the very best use; that the people who are working there \nhave the best training; that people who will be working these lines \nwill do their very best in taking calls and know how to help people.\n  This is important. It is a network of support for people. It is one \nstep and only one step.\n  But I will finish my remarks and then hear from my colleague from \nNevada who really is taking the lead on this amendment.\n  Again, every 42 seconds someone in our country attempts suicide. \nEvery 16.9 minutes someone completes suicide. Suicide is the eighth \nleading cause of all deaths.\n  This one really gets to me. I admit that until I saw this--I believe \nI do a lot of work in the mental health area--I didn't realize the \nsuicide rates are highest for those over age 75. I didn't realize that. \nMy focus has really been on young people because in my State of \nMinnesota, for the age of 15 to 24, suicide is the second leading cause \nof death.\n  We need to do better. In this piece of legislation, we take this \nfunding from administrative services and put it into this program. I \nthink it will make a very positive difference.\n  I am delighted that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \ngoing to support this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, which \nis a long overdue attempt to deal more effectively with suicide, a \nserious public health threat in the United States.\n  In 1998, suicide was the cause of more than 29,000 deaths --nearly 60 \npercent higher than the number of homicides in that year. The nation's \nSurgeon General, Dr. David Satcher, issued a Call to Action to Prevent \nSuicide in 1999, in which he recommended a national strategy to reduce \nthe high toll that suicide takes. Our amendment will provide grants \nthrough the Center for Mental Health Services to help support a \nnational network of suicide hotlines and crisis centers, and to provide \na certification program for the staff members of the network. This \nprogram will ensure that people who seek help during a crisis will \nreceive an effective response from appropriately trained and certified \npersonnel.\n  In Massachusetts, the state's 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found \nthat one of every five adolescents had seriously considered suicide in \nthe previous year, and one in twelve--more than 20,000 teenagers--made \nan actual attempt. But this serious problem is not limited to young \nAmericans. It affects all age groups. In fact, suicide rates increase \nwith age, and are highest among men aged 75 years and older.\n  Suicide also affects all racial and ethnic groups. Between 1980 and \n1996, the rate of suicide among African-American male teenagers more \nthan doubled. Native American communities have long experienced high \nsuicide rates.\n  Suicide and suicide attempts affect both genders. Although males are \nfour times more likely to die of suicide, females are more likely to \nattempt suicide. Each year in the United States, half a million people \nrequire emergency room treatment for a suicide attempt.\n  But suicide and suicide attempts can be prevented. Ninety percent of \npeople who complete suicide have depression or another mental or \nsubstance abuse disorder. These disorders respond to effective \ntreatment.\n  The amendment we offer today will ensure that when a person is in \ncrisis anywhere in our nation, there is a network of hotlines and \ncrisis centers to call for help, and that a trained and certified staff \nmember will be available to intervene effectively. Every 17 minutes \nanother American completes suicide. We can do much more to prevent this \nnational tragedy. Our proposal is a small, but significant, step toward \npreventing the unnecessary loss of American lives, and I urge the \nSenate to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Minnesota has been a great \npartner on this issue. He has been very understanding. He is a very \ncaring person, as indicated by the work he has done. He has outlined \nvery generally and in many cases specifically the problems we have in \nAmerica today relating to suicide.\n  There is no question about it. Suicides occur more often in this \ncountry than can be calculated. As I have indicated, the statistics \nthat the Senator from Minnesota gave us are reported suicides. There \nare many deaths that appear to be accidents that are suicides, and they \ncannot be calculated.\n  The State of Nevada leads the Nation in suicide. It doesn't matter \nwhat age group it is. It doesn't matter whether they are teenagers or \nsenior citizens. The State of Nevada has the dubious distinction of \nleading the Nation in suicide. That is too bad.\n  This amendment is a step in the direction of helping people not only \nin Nevada but all over the country. The amendment offered by the \nSenator from Minnesota and the Senator from Nevada will set up a number \nof crisis centers. Today, we have about 78 crisis centers that are \ncertified. This would allow hundreds more to be certified.\n  What does this mean? It means that when you call 1-800-SUICIDE, which \nwas activated a little more than a year ago --people who are depressed \nor suicidal or those concerned about someone else who is depressed or \nsuicidal--you are automatically connected to someone who is at one of \nthese centers and who is trained. These calls are routed to the crisis \ncenter nearest to the person where the call is placed.\n  The crisis center calls are answered by certified counselors 24 hours \na day, 7 days a week--on Thanksgiving and on Christmas; it is sad to \nsay but Christmas is one of the biggest suicide days in this country.\n  In the event the nearest crisis center is at a maximum volume, the \ncall is routed to the next nearest center. There is never a busy \nsignal, or a voice mail. People in crisis usually reach a trained \ncounselor within two or three rings, or about 20 to 30 seconds from the \nmoment they dial 1-800-SUICIDE.\n  What does this suicide crisis line mean?\n  Let me read excerpts from a few letters.\n  This one is written to the Northern Virginia hot line. It says, among \nother things:\n\n[[Page S5975]]\n\n       I would like to name NVHL (Northern Virginia Hotline) as \n     one of my beneficiaries on my life insurance policy . . .\n       The reason for this act of kindness is to give back to your \n     organization what your organization has given to me. You see, \n     over the past twenty years I have used your listeners during \n     moments of crises in my life. When I had no one to turn to, I \n     could turn to your listeners for insight and support . . .\n       I want to give back to the organization that has been \n     responsible for helping me through many tough late nights \n     over the past twenty years.\n\n  We have a letter from the Catholic Newman Association in Houston, TX. \nIt is a three-paragraph letter. I will read only one paragraph.\n\n       I simply want to say that because of you, Karen, a girl \n     named ______ is alive today and has, for perhaps the first \n     time in her life, a real hope and desire to live. She called \n     you a few weeks ago, with a razor blade in her hand, and she \n     had already begun to cut her wrist. You talked to her for \n     almost an hour, though she tried to hang up a number of \n     times. You were able to get information about the fact that \n     she had recently talked to me, as well as where she lived. \n     You were able to keep her on the line while you had someone \n     contact me and I got to her apartment in time to keep her \n     from completing the suicide attempt. She has been \n     hospitalized and has undergone intensive therapy and is soon \n     to be released, with real hope that there are good reasons to \n     stay alive. You must have been very skillful, Karen because \n     she is a very sharp girl and it was a true suicide attempt \n     prevented only by the fact that she wanted to talk to one \n     human being--you--before killing herself. Because you took \n     her seriously, because you cared, because you knew what to \n     say and do, she is alive today and wants to continue to live.\n\n  We also have a letter addressed to Arlene, someone who works at one \nof these hot line centers.\n  Among other things, this woman says:\n\n       A member of my staff had come to me with some family \n     problems, both financial and emotional, which were causing \n     that person to be very despondent . . .\n       Fortunately, I was able to refer my employee to the \n     Hotline. I don't know the details of the conversations but I \n     can see the results. Having someone available to talk to, \n     combined with the follow-up counseling, has helped this \n     person to find a solution to problems which had seemed \n     overwhelming. I now have a valuable, productive employee and \n     the individual now feels in control of life and \n     circumstances.\n\n  Finally, I have a letter from the Fairfax County Police Department. \nThis is from Capt. Art Rudat. He is a commander in the McLean \nsubstation. He is writing a letter to say having this hotline helps the \npolice department, freeing them to do other things. He says:\n\n       Upon our arrival, we found the subject in his room and he \n     was extremely upset and agitated. He was holding a 4\" knife \n     to his jugular vein, threatening to kill himself. This threat \n     was not taken lightly because he had already cut his left \n     wrist and was bleeding. The atmosphere at the time was tense, \n     not knowing if anything that the officers would say would \n     further upset the subject. There was a moment, when the \n     subject stood up screaming and pressing the knife into his \n     throat almost cutting his jugular vein, that it was thought \n     the incident would have a tragic\n     ending. * * *\n       Even this was occurring, the subject was on the phone, \n     still deep in conversation with Miss Dicke. He would go from \n     being out of control to a very peaceful state. Slowly though, \n     he became less upset and eventually sat down and began \n     listening to Miss Dicke reason with him and win him over. Of \n     course, the officers didn't know what Miss Dicke was saying, \n     but it was enough for him to eventually give up his knife and \n     go to the hospital with rescue to receive much needed \n     assistance.\n       It is my understanding that of the nearly 18,000 calls that \n     are received at the hotline center per year, approximately \n     600 are suicide calls and only 5 involve weapons. We at \n     Fairfax County Police Department were quite fortunate to have \n     had both Miss Dicke and Miss Ross working that night. Without \n     their teamwork, tenaciousness and training, this incident \n     could have had a tragic end-\n     ing. * * *\n       Although hotlines do not historically receive the fanfare \n     and headlines that other public service groups do, we at the \n     Police Department realize what a tremendous resource you are \n     to us and the outstanding service which you provide to the \n     community.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Revenue Recovery Consultants, Inc.,\n\n                                     Fairfax, VA, October 8, 1998.\n     Ms. Arlene Krohmal,\n     Northern Virginia Hotline,\n     Arlington, VA.\n       Dear Arlene: I just wanted to take a moment to thank you \n     and to compliment the Hotline for the assistance your staff \n     provided to one of my employees recently.\n       A member of my staff had come to me with some family \n     problems, both financial and emotional, which were causing \n     that person to be very despondent. This attitude was \n     affecting the individual's work and life. An appointment with \n     a counselor had been set, but it was ten days away and it \n     seemed as if help was needed immediately. This person told me \n     that, if not for worry about two children, life wouldn't be \n     worth living.\n       Fortunately, I was able to refer my employee to the \n     Hotline. I don't know the details of the conversations but I \n     can see the results. Having someone available to talk to, \n     combined with the follow-up counseling, has helped this \n     person to find a solution to problems which had seemed \n     overwhelming. I now have a valuable, productive employee and \n     the individual now feels in control of life and \n     circumstances.\n       Thank you for providing a valuable service to the \n     community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Fran Fisher,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         Catholic Newman Association, Religion Center, University \n           of Houston,\n                                                      Houston, TX.\n       PEACE!\n       I am writing this letter simply out of my own need to \n     express gratitude, plus the fact that I am aware you likely \n     don't get much positive feedback for what you are doing. It \n     is addressed primarily to one of your people named ``Karen'' \n     whom I have been unable to contact personally, but really to \n     all of you because it could have been any one who happened to \n     answer the phone that day.\n       I simply want to say that because of you, Karen, a girl \n     named ______ is alive today and has, for perhaps the first \n     time in her life, a real hope and desire to live. She called \n     you a few weeks ago, with a razor blade in her hand, and she \n     had already begun to cut her wrist. You talked to her for \n     almost an hour, though she tried to hang up a number of \n     times. You were able to get information about the fact that \n     she had recently talked to me, as well as where she lived. \n     You were able to keep her on the line while you had someone \n     contact me and I got to her apartment in time to keep her \n     from completing the suicide attempt. She has been \n     hospitalized and has undergone intensive therapy and is soon \n     to be released, with real hope that there are good reasons to \n     stay alive. You must have been very skillful, Karen because \n     she is a very sharp girl and it was a true suicide attempt \n     prevented only by the fact that she wanted to talk to one \n     human being--you--before killing herself. Because you took \n     her seriously, because you cared, because you knew what to \n     say and do, she is alive today and wants to continue to live.\n       I am writing this, as I say, simply because I want to let \n     you know--and all of you who work at Crisis Hotline--that \n     what you are doing is beautiful as beautiful as life compared \n     to death, as beautiful as hope compared to depression, as \n     beautiful as loved compared to apathy. I realize, because of \n     my own life-work in this way that you often don't know the \n     effects of your listening, your caring, your loving, that you \n     very likely wonder sometimes if it's worth the time and \n     effort. All I can say is: ``Hey, today I saw the sun shine in \n     a girl's eyes!'' It's worth it!!!\n       Thank you, Karen, I love you,\n     Rev. Jim Barnett.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Ashburn, VA, June 14, 1999.\n     Arlene Krohmal,\n     Director, Northern Virginia Hotline,\n     Arlington, VA.\n       Dear Arlene, I have a request. Please send to me \n     information about your organization, for you see, I would \n     like to name NVHL (Northern Virginia Hotline) as one of my \n     beneficiaries on my life insurance policy. I need to know \n     exactly how to word NVHL as a beneficiary so that there would \n     be no loop holes for anyone to contest.\n       The reason for this act of kindness is to give back to your \n     organization what your organization has given to me. You see, \n     over the past twenty years I have used your listeners during \n     moments of crises in my lie. When I had no one to turn to, I \n     could turn to your listeners for insight and support.\n       I came to know about the benefit of your hotline due to \n     meeting the original director Bobby Schazenbach and hearing \n     her story why this wonderful and unique organization was set \n     up. I have very fond memories of Bobby and everytime I call \n     your hotline, I often think of her and wonder how she is \n     doing. Her creation of this hotline has been a link to my \n     survival for many years. I won't bother you with the details, \n     but I want to give back to the organization that has been \n     responsible for helping me through many tough late night over \n     the past twenty years.\n       Please sent to me any information on your organization that \n     might help facilitate in changing my beneficiary to your \n     organization. I also want you to know that I will be naming \n     the Loudoun Abused Women's Shelter as well.\n       Thank God for all of you and thank God for Bobby.\n           Fondly, and forever grateful, ------ ------\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Fairfax County Police Department,\n\n                                      Fairfax, VA, March 31, 1998.\n     Ms. Arlene Krohmal,\n     Northern Virginia Suicide Hotline,\n     Arlington, VA.\n       Dear Ms. Krohmal: I would like to bring to your attention, \n     the actions of two of your volunteers and the impact it had \n     upon a family's future. On March 7, 1998, at approximately \n     5:59 pm, officers from the McLean\n\n[[Page S5976]]\n\n     District Station responded to the Ritz Carlton, near Tysons \n     Corner, for a subject threatening to commit suicide with a \n     knife. The 911 call was made to the Fairfax County Police by \n     Miss Katie Ross, of the Northern Virginia Suicide Hotline, \n     who was assisting Miss Marilyn Dicke, also with the Suicide \n     Hotline, The information received was that the subject had \n     been involved in a continuing domestic dispute with his \n     parents and was at the end of his rope.\n       From the beginning, the information given to us by Miss \n     Ross was clear and concise and left little for us to wonder \n     about. This is a key element in our response to a complaint \n     and how the officers will handle the case from the onset. \n     Upon our arrival, we found the subject in his room and he was \n     extremely upset and agitated. He was holding a 4'' knife to \n     his jugular vein, threatening to kill himself. This threat \n     was not taken lightly because he had already cut his left \n     wrist and was bleeding. The atmosphere at the time was tense, \n     not knowing if anything that the officers would say would \n     further upset the subject. There was a moment, when the \n     subject stood up screaming and pressing the knife into his \n     throat almost cutting his jugular vein, that it was thought \n     the incident would have a tragic ending.\n       Even this was occurring, the subject was on the phone, \n     still deep in conversation with Miss Dicke. He would go from \n     being out of control to a very peaceful state. Slowly though, \n     he became less upset and eventually sat down and began \n     listening to Miss Dicke reason with him and win him over. Of \n     course, the officers didn't know what Miss Dicke was saying, \n     but it was enough for him to eventually give up his knife and \n     go to the hospital with rescue to receive much needed \n     assistance.\n       It is my understanding that of the nearly 18,000 calls that \n     are received at the hotline center per year, approximately \n     600 are suicide calls and only 5 involve weapons. We at \n     Fairfax County Police Department were quite fortunate to have \n     had both Miss Dicke and Miss Ross working that night. Without \n     their teamwork, tenaciousness and training, this incident \n     could have had a tragic ending.\n       This exemplifies how the citizens of Fairfax County and the \n     Police Department benefit from programs such as yours. \n     Although hotlines do not historically receive the fanfare and \n     headlines that other public service groups do, we at the \n     Police Department realize what a tremendous resource you are \n     to us and the outstanding service which you provide to the \n     community. It is without any reservation that I commend Miss \n     Dicke and Miss Ross for the outstanding job they did that \n     evening. They should be very proud of themselves and the \n     organization they are affiliated with.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Captain Art Rudat,\n                               Commander, McLean District Station.\n\n  Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support the legislation dealing with the \nissue of suicide. It is very important.\n  Many, many years ago, early one morning I came to an office and found \na coworker had taken his life. It was, of course, a morning I will \nremember the rest of my life, finding a coworker and a friend who had, \nover the nighttime hours, taken his life.\n  I suppose only those who have been acquainted with that circumstance \ncan barely imagine the kind of horrors that persuade someone to take \ntheir own life. I think anything we can do as a country in public \npolicy to reach out and say to those who are visited by those emotional \ndifficulties, those pressures and internal problems that persuade them \nto consider taking their life, anything we can do to reach out to them \nto say, here is some help, we ought to be able to do that.\n  This amendment is very small. Incrementally, it will be helpful.\n  I appreciate the work of Senator Wellstone and Senator Reid. I think \nsomeday--we may never know the name--adding these resources will help \nsomeone who is ravaged by these emotional difficulties and can be \nprevented from taking their own life, and we will be rewarded for \nhaving paid attention to this issue.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from South Dakota knows I had the misfortune of \nmy father committing suicide. As the Senator from North Dakota, I saw \nmy father lying there after having shot himself. This is something that \nnever leaves you.\n  People think suicide always happens to someone else, but it doesn't. \nI say to my friend from North Dakota, we could go around this room and \nwe would be surprised; almost everyone in this Senate Chamber has had a \nrelative, a neighbor, or a friend who committed suicide. It is \nremarkable and sad.\n  I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota sharing his story. The \nreason it is important he shares it is to recognize what a universal \nproblem this is, at 31,000 people a year. We know, as I indicated a \nnumber of other times on this floor, many more people commit suicide.\n  I think the mere fact that we talk about it is going to help the \nproblem. We now have this crisis hotline established. We also, of \ncourse, have support groups that we didn't have 15, 20 years ago. The \nproblem is not getting easier, but it is getting better with people \nbetter understanding the issue.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, two things. First, I thank the Senator \nfrom Nevada for his comments. Second, I say to Senator Specter, I am \nsure he remembers when Kay Jamison testified before his committee, \nsaying the gap between what we know and what we do is lethal. This is \njust a small step. I am hoping that the Senate--the sooner the better--\nwill embrace this issue and put some resources back to communities that \ncan put this money to work in terms of suicide prevention. Much of this \nis diagnosable and preventable.\n  We have some confusion. Before I agree, I say to Senator Reid, I want \nto suggest the absence of a quorum. We have a disagreement about how we \nwill deal with this amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me make a short statement. We are anxious to move \nahead with our votes scheduled at 3:30.\n  The amendment is acceptable. The subcommittee held a hearing on this \nmatter in February and had extraordinarily heartrending testimony from \nfamilies who had been touched directly by suicide. The hearing was held \nat the request of the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid. It was quite \ncompelling.\n  The subcommittee and the full committee allocated $662 million to the \nmental health services, an increase of $31 million over last year. A \nnumber of amendments have been offered seeking to reallocate the money \nin a variety of ways. I have responded that, unless they have offsets, \nwe have made the allocations as best we can.\n  I think the fact we have such a large sum of money in mental health \nservices on a relative basis, including a $31 million increase for this \nyear, is a testament to the propriety or the value judgments which have \ngone into the structure of this bill. The $3 million for the hotline \ncan be accommodated easily within the existing funds. We had already \nurged the mental health services to find ways through their research to \nprevent suicides--to find other means of communicating with people who \nwere emotionally stressed coming to grips with the issue, and \npreventing suicides. The substantial allocation the Appropriations \nCommittee has made is a testament to the value judgments and the \npriorities we have established.\n  I thank Senator Reid for sharing his own experiences. It is a very \ntelling matter. At his request, we had a very informative hearing in \nFebruary, with quite a few people coming forward, including Danielle \nSteel, the noted authoress who talked about her own son's experience. \nIt made quite an impact. I think it is true that while the C-SPAN 2 \naudience may not be enormous, people will hear what is being said and \nit can have a salutary effect.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. It was very difficult for the Senator to work this hearing \ninto the very busy schedule of this huge subcommittee. The Senator did \nthat. I think it has done so much good across the country to have \npeople such as Danielle Steel and Kay Jamison, who are experts, to come \nin and talk about their experiences. I am grateful to you for doing \nthis, as I think anyone is who has had the misfortune of having had \nsome connection with suicide. You are to be applauded for having done \nthis with schedule that was really a burden to you.\n\n  We appreciate this very much.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for those \nkind remarks. Perhaps we could move ahead to acceptance of the \namendment.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \nfor his genuine concern, and the ways in which, as the chair of this \ncommittee, he has supported this initiative. He cares about it deeply. \nI thank\n\n[[Page S5977]]\n\nhim. I am pleased he will accept the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3680) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3672\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \npending motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \nmotion to waive the Budget Act with regard to the Dodd amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Which is the first \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Dodd amendment No. 3672 on community \nlearning centers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the point of order has been raised \nbecause, although the Dodd amendment for afterschool programs takes up \na meritorious subject, we have already added approximately $150 million \nto that account, bringing it up to $600 million.\n  The program has been in effect for only a few years. We have provided \nfor additional funding in many similarly related situations. We believe \nthe priorities established were appropriate. Had there been a \nsuggestion for an offset, had the Senator from Connecticut made a \nsuggestion that this priority was more valuable than others, we would \nhave been willing to consider it. But it simply breaks the allocations \nand therefore the point of order has been raised. We urge it be \nsustained and not waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in favor of the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business before the Senate is a \nmotion, to the Senator's amendment, on the Budget Act.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as I understand it, I have 2 minutes to \nexplain the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was reduced to 2 minutes equally divided. \nThose opposed to the motion have already spoken. The Senator has 1 \nminute to speak.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, to my colleagues, very briefly, this \namendment is a carryforward to what has been offered by Senator \nKennedy, Senator Bingaman, Senator Wellstone, and Senator Murray, all \ntrying to improve the quality of public education in the country. One \nof the key issues is afterschool programs.\n  We know from parents all across the country the most dangerous period \nfor 5 million children unattended is between 3 and 6 in the afternoon. \nGood afterschool programs are meaningful. The country wants it. School \nboards have asked for it. But despite efforts, we have only funded 310 \nafterschool programs. Last year, there were 2,500, close to 3,000, \napplications for afterschool dollars. We could only meet the requests \nof 310 school districts.\n  It seems to me we must do something to improve the quality of \neducation with good afterschool programs, when children are most at \nrisk, most vulnerable, when they get involved with habits of smoking, \nand alcohol, of marijuana, when they are victimized. As we know by \nevery police study, afterschool programs work.\n  I realize there are budgetary concerns, but we spend less than one-\nhalf of 1 percent of the entire Federal budget on the quality of public \neducation in this country. That is a disgrace.\n  What we have offered in these series of amendments is to improve our \nFederal investment in education. This amendment is to improve the \nquality of afterschool programs for the 5 million children in America \nwho need that assistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion to waive the Budget Act in relation to amendment No. 3672. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Inouye) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 48, nays 51, as follows:--\n  The result was announced--yeas 48, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 154 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--48\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Byrd\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Inouye\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 48, the nays are \n51. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The amendment would increase budget authority and outlays scored \nagainst the allocation of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, and that \nsubcommittee has reached the limit of its allocations. Therefore, the \npoint of order is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next votes \nin the series be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think it is only fair to say to the \nMembers that we are going to try to enforce the more limited time on \nthese votes. I know we try to accommodate Senators on both sides when \nthey get delayed because of elevators or the subway or whatever. But it \nis also unfair to the managers and people trying to do the bill, when \nwe are all here, if we can't do the votes in the prescribed time. We \nwill push for that.\n  Secondly, I commend the managers for trying to begin to make some \nprogress. We have had a whole series of votes here in this grouping--\nfour, I guess. But we still have an awful lot of pending amendments. I \ndon't want to mention a number because it is too scary.\n  I can't complain about the Democratic side because there are almost \nas many amendments on the Republican side. When Members are asked to \ncome and either work out their amendments or offer them, they are too \nbusy to get it done. We need to get this Labor, HHS, and Education \nappropriations bill done tonight. In order to do that, it is going to \ntake an awful lot of work. The managers, or the whips, Harry Reid and \nDon Nickles, can't do it by themselves. Some are beginning to say how \nabout Thursday night. When we get Labor-HHS appropriations done, we are \ngoing to the Interior appropriations bill, plus we have the military \nconstruction conference report with the emergency provisions, providing \nfunds that we have been wanting to get completed for defense and for \ndisasters and\n\n[[Page S5978]]\n\nfor Colombia. We may not get that until late Thursday night, so that we \ncan't vote on it until Friday. We will have other votes on Friday. So \nwe have to complete this bill, the Interior appropriations bill, and \nthe MILCON conference report.\n\n  I thank Senator Daschle for his work in that effort and for his \nsupport as we try to complete this work. I know it is a lot to do in 3 \ndays, but I know we can do it if we really stick with it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join in the request made by the \nmajority leader to try to cooperate in a way to allow us closure on \nthis bill. He has proposed an aggressive agenda. At the very least, we \nhave to finish this bill. As he said, there are scores of amendments \nthat have to be addressed before we can complete our work. I want to \nfinish this bill this week. I want to be as cooperative and as forceful \nwith our colleagues on both sides of the aisle in accommodating that \nkind of schedule. We have been on this bill, and we have had a good \ndebate with good amendments and a lot of votes. There will be more \namendments and votes.\n  There comes a time when we have to try to bring this to a close. I \nwant to do it as soon as we can and still accommodate Senators who have \ngood amendments to offer. Please come to the floor and agree to time \nlimits for each amendment. Work with us to see if we can't winnow down \nthe list a little bit. We have had some cooperation, but it is going to \ntake a lot more cooperation if we, indeed, are going to get the bill \ndone on time.\n  I believe we are ready to vote, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3659\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \nmotion to waive the Budget Act with regard to the Kerry amendment. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the pending matter is the motion of the \nSenator from Massachusetts to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my amendment seeks to address the digital \ndivide that all of us are aware is significantly handicapping the \ncapacity of a lot of Americans to participate in the new marketplace. \nThe House of Representatives has recognized this problem to the tune of \n$517 million. In our budget, we are only at $425 million. We are going \nto vote in the Senate on the H-1B visa, allowing 200,000-plus people to \nbe imported into this country because of our lack of commitment to our \nown citizens in developing their skills for the new marketplace.\n  This is an opportunity to make it clear that, for teachers and their \nability to be able to teach, for virtual high school capacity to have \nadvanced placement, in order to enhance the ability of our young to \nlearn the new marketplace skills and to close the digital divide, we \nneed to make this commitment.\n  I think everybody in the Senate knows that with this surplus, with \nour ability to be able to make the choices we have in the budget, we \nhave allowed for a waiver of the budget precisely for this kind of \nmoment. I ask my colleagues to join me in saying the House of \nRepresentatives will not have a better sense of this priority than the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I call on our colleagues to oppose the \nwaiver. This bill has $4.5 billion more than last year's, $100 million \nover the President's request, and it is a matter of allocation of \npriorities.\n  There is no doubt that technical literacy is an important objective. \nWe have, in the Senate bill, $425 million. If the Senator from \nMassachusetts could establish its priority over others, and add \noffsets, that is something we would be glad to consider. I wish we had \nmore money to spend on things such as technical literacy, but we do \nnot. To accept this amendment would exceed our 302(b) allocations. \nTherefore, I ask my colleagues to vote no on the waiver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the budget act in relation to Amendment No. 3659. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

On this vote, the yeas are 48, and the nays \nare 51. Three-fifths of the Senators present and voting, not having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion to waive the Budget Act is not \nagreed to.\n  The amendment would increase the budget authority and outlays scored \nagainst the allocations of the Labor, Health, and Human Services, and \nEducation Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, and that \nsubcommittee has reached the limits of its allocation. Therefore, the \npoint of order is sustained and the amendment falls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3638\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes equally divided on \nthe motion to waive the Budget Act by the Senator from Rhode Island, \nMr. Reed.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment would add an additional $100 \nmillion to the appropriated funds for the GEAR UP program. GEAR UP is \nthe centerpiece of our efforts to reach out to disadvantaged students \nand give them both the skills and the confidence to go on to college. \nIt is particularly clear in low-income neighborhoods that young people \nand families do not have either the access to college or the kind of \nskills they need to make it all the way through high school into \ncollege.\n  This program does that. It complements the Pell grant. It complements \nother programs because it actually gives young people, starting the \nsixth or seventh grade, the tutoring, the mentoring, the confidence, \nthe ability to go through high school, and go on to college.\n  By voting for this amendment, we will say to scores of disadvantaged \nchildren: You can succeed; you can go to college; you can take your \nplace in American society as a college graduate. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support this incredibly important program, to make \nopportunities real in the lives of all of our citizens.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is no doubt this is a good program. \nIt has been in effect only since 1999 when we put in $120 million; last \nyear, up to $200 million; this year our figure is $225 million.\n  Again, it is a matter of priorities. This bill has $4.5 billion more \nthan last year's education bill. It is $100 million higher than the \nPresident's figure. When the Senator from Rhode Island argued the \nmatter as being a very special program, I posed a practical question: \nWhat should be offset? What is less important?\n  We think we have established the appropriate priorities. As much as \nwe\n\n[[Page S5979]]\n\nwant to have additional funds for a program of this sort, it simply \nisn't there. The extra million dollars would exceed our 302(b) \nallocation. Therefore, we ask our colleagues not to waive the Budget \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act in relation to amendment No. 3638.

There will be 2 minutes for debate on the \nKennedy amendment. Who yields time? The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment basically follows the \nPresident's recommendation, and that is to provide a cost-of-living \nincrease to the training programs for youth and adult workers in this \ncountry.\n  At the present time, half of all the employers in this country \nprovide no training whatsoever, the other half of the employers provide \n1 percent of payroll costs, and 80 percent of that training goes to \nmanagement level workers.\n  We have talked a good deal about H-1B visas and bringing into the \nUnited States those guest workers who have special skills, but I think \nwe have a basic responsibility to ensure continuing training programs \nfor America's workers as we continue to expand our economy and compete \nin the world.\n  That amendment provides an important increase for training programs. \nTwo years ago, along with Senator Jeffords, we consolidated the \ntraining programs. We now have an effective one-stop system that will \noffer real opportunities for workers.\n  Finally, this amendment also restores the Summer Jobs Program. \nWithout this amendment, there will be no Summer Jobs Program for the \nyouth of this country. I hope this amendment will be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as with so many of the pending \namendments, the objective is good if we had more funding. We have \nincreased the funding for the Department of Labor by $400 million. We \nhave funded two new programs requested by the administration: incumbent \nworker training for $30 million and responsible reintegration of \nyouthful offenders for $20 million.\n  Over the last 4 years, there has been a 32-percent increase for \ndislocated workers and a 25-percent increase for the Job Corps. If it \nwere possible to have additional funding, we would be glad to provide \nit. We think we have established the priorities in an appropriate order \nfor this complex bill.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing listed amendments be the only remaining first-degree \namendments in order to the pending Labor-HHS appropriations bill and \nthey be subject to relevant second-degree amendments.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that with respect to HMO-related \namendments, they be subject to second-degree amendments relating to the \nsubject matter of the conferenced HMO bill or the underlying Labor-HHS \nbill or the original first-degree language.\n  The list is Specter managers' amendment; Domenici 3561, telecom \ntraining center; Domenici 3662, telecom training center; Frist 3654, \neducation research; Jeffords 3655, IDEA; Jeffords 3656, medicine \nmanagement; Jeffords 3677, Public Health Service Act; Jeffords 3676, \nhigh school; Collins 3657, defibrillator----\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold for a moment? If I could \nrespectfully request, maybe we could just submit our two lists, \nDemocrat and Republicans lists. The staffs have looked at them. Unless \nthe Senator wants to read\n\n[[Page S5980]]\n\nthem for some reason, we have 80-some on our side that we don't want to \nread.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, that would be fine with me, Mr. President. The \nquestion would arise as to how we are going to get consent if Members \ndon't know what is on the list.\n  Mr. REID. We have made on our side numerous hotlines to Members. We \nhad the 11 o'clock time that we were going to submit the amendments. If \nthe Senator wants to read them, that is fine with me.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nlists be printed in the Record as they are. Senators knew there \nwas a time. They checked this list. Statements were made. I think it \nwould save some time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, I will object until I can \nget some understanding or we can get some understanding from the \nmajority leader as to when we are going to have a date set for a vote \non PNTR. This is an issue which transcends politics, if I might have \nthe attention of the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 2 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I know we are in a hurry. We are trying to \nget through with this bill. I think that is important work, and I am \nfor it. Let me make my point very succinctly.\n  This bill, in section 515, has a provision that changes current law \nand shifts the payment date for SSI, the Supplemental Security Income \nprogram, from October back to September. What that does is shift $2.4 \nbillion worth of spending out of the budget year for which we are \nwriting this appropriation back into the previous fiscal year. In the \nprocess, it allows $2.4 billion more to be spent this year by spending \n$2.4 billion in the previous fiscal year. This payment shift was \nspecifically debated during the budget resolution debate. It was \nrejected. Part of the agreement that was made that passed the budget \nwas that there would be no payment shift on SSI.\n  This provision is subject to a point of order because it violates the \nbudget agreement. It shifts spending into fiscal year 2000 and drives \nup spending in that year $2.4 billion above the level provided for in \nthe budget.\n  If we are going to write budgets, they have to have some meaning. \nThis is not just some minor provision. The debate on this issue was a \nkey element of the debate on that budget, and the Budget Committee and \nthe Senate specifically rejected this payment shift.\n  So on the basis of that, Mr. President, I make a point of order that \nsection 515 of the bill, as amended, violates section 311 of the Budget \nAct, since it would cause fiscal year 2000 budget authority and outlays \nto exceed the spending aggregates in the budget resolution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget \nAct, as amended, I move to waive section 311 of that act with respect \nto the consideration of this amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have just had a discussion with the \nSenator from Texas about setting this issue aside so that we can \nproceed with other matters and try to make a determination as to how we \ncan solve this issue.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, objection. Respectfully, I know how hard the \nSenator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa worked on this \nmeasure. But with this hanging over our heads, we might as well get \nthis resolved now. We have spent 3 or 4 days on this bill already. If \nthis prevails, we are all through here. So we believe this matter \nshould be resolved now.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it takes unanimous consent to set it \naside. I urge the Senator from Nevada to reconsider. We had an issue \nyesterday raised by the chairman of the Finance Committee, and there \nwas an agreement between the chairman of the Finance Committee and the \nchairman of the full Appropriations Committee as to what would happen \nin conference, that items would be taken out, and that we would seek an \nadditional allocation.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I want to remind \nmy colleagues that sustaining this point of order does not bring down \nthe bill. Under the unanimous consent agreement the bill is being \nconsidered under, sustaining this point of order would simply strike \nsection 515.\n  I am perfectly willing to let the Senate go on with other amendments. \nI am going to insist on this point of order at some point, and it will \nhave to come to a resolution. But if we can do other business while \nthis is being discussed, I think that is a good idea. The point of \norder is a very targeted point of order against section 515, not \nagainst the bill.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada will state it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the objection of the Senator from Nevada \nis withdrawn and another amendment is considered, would the Senator \nstill have the same right to object to any further proceedings after \nthis amendment that would be brought up next is disposed of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Normally, the point of order would occur after \nanother amendment had been disposed of.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \npropound a question under the reservation.\n  I am trying to understand the consequences of the amendment. Let me \nreserve the right to object while I ask the Senator from Texas and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania this: If the point of order is sustained, can \nwe get some notion of what consequences it will have on the spending in \nthis bill for education, labor, and other issues?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I might respond, if the point of order \nis sustained, we would lose $2.4 billion and there would be required an \nadjustment of the bill which would be catastrophic.\n  So it is my suggestion that we set it aside, taking the willingness \nof the Senator from Texas to do that, and then proceed with other \namendments so we can try to figure out what other allocation might be \npossible. We have an amendment ready by the Senator from Vermont and \none by the Senator from North Carolina. We have not had many Republican \namendments. It is my hope that we can proceed. We have to find a way \nout of this. If we have a little time, we have a chance to find our way \nout of it. So I hope we will proceed.\n\n  If I may have the attention of the Senator from Nevada, he will have \nthe opportunity to--we will have to set it aside, as I understand the \nparliamentary ruling, each time a new amendment is called up. Is that \ncorrect, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So I hope we will set it aside for the two amendments \nthat we now have lined up and ready to go.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, continuing to reserve the right to object, \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania talked about if this prevails, the \nrequirement of an adjustment to the bill would be ``catastrophic.'' \nThat was the word he used. I am trying to understand the consequences \nof that. What kind of adjustment would we be talking about with respect \nto this bill on Education and Labor?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I don't know how this percentage worked. \nI am advised that with this provision there would be an across-the-\nboard 6.75 percent cut to bring the bill under the allocation.\n  I am not sure of that math, although that is the representation made \nto me. If you take $2.4 billion out of $104.5 billion, that, it would \nseem to me, would be under 3 percent. But it would be very material.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is a \ncritically important piece of legislation. It is a funding bill for \neducation and labor\n\n[[Page S5981]]\n\nissues and a range of things that are very important. If the \nconsequence of the motion offered by the Senator from Texas would be to \nrequire a substantial across-the-board cut to this piece of \nlegislation, it is of significant interest to virtually every Member of \nthis body.\n  I don't believe we ought to go on. If the Senator from Nevada chooses \nnot to object, I shall object. But I will leave it to the Senator from \nNevada to comment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, before we break down in the tears and the \nshock that would come from not shifting spending from one year to \nanother to break the budget by $2.4 billion, let me remind my \ncolleagues that with this shift and with the entitlement changes that \nSenator Stevens has said we are not going to make, this bill will grow \nby 20.5 percent over last year. You can't find that growth rate even \ngoing as far back as the Carter administration. You have to go all the \nway back to when L.B.J. was President to find a bill growing that fast.\n  If the point of order is sustained eliminating the phony pay shift \nand an adjustment is made in spending, this bill will still be growing \nby 17.7 percent. Granted that we each look at the world through \ndifferent glasses. I don't see that as cataclysm; I see that as \nsomewhat of a movement toward fiscal restraint.\n  But the important point is this provision violates the Budget Act. We \nconsidered this payment shift in the budget. We specifically rejected \nit. We set out numbers that were meant to meet the targets for spending \nthat were agreed to. This provision violates the Budget Act, and it \nshould be stricken. I will insist on the point of order against it, but \nI am perfectly willing to let amendments move forward. If the minority \ndoesn't want amendments to be considered, it is up to them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am advised that the 17.7 percent would \nbe the across the board on outlays. I have heard what the Senator from \nTexas says about those percentages. I do not think they are accurate. \nWe will compute the percentages. That simply is not factually so. I \nmanaged last year's bill. But we will tally them up and make \nrepresentation on the floor at a later point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I believe the pending motion is the motion \nto waive the Budget Act. Is that not true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Is that not a debatable motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is a debatable motion.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, the figures we just heard from the Senator from Texas \nreally are quite phony. They include all kinds of advanced funding and \neverything else to come to that figure that the Senator threw out on \nthe 20 percent.\n  But you have to ask yourself: Why are we facing this now? What the \nSenator from Texas is trying to do is to save one day. It is one day, I \ntell my friend from North Dakota.\n  This provision was put in there not by me and not by the minority. It \nwas put in there by Senator Stevens in order to allow us to do the \nlegitimate work we have to do to meet the obligations we have in \neducation and in health and NIH, and all of the other things in this \nbill which has pretty wide support. It wasn't us. The chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee put it in.\n  The Senator from Texas--let's be clear about it--is moving the \noutlays for SSI paychecks from one day to the previous day--that is all \nhe is doing--one day. But that one day will cause about a 6-percent \nacross-the-board cut in NIH, cancer research, Alzheimer's research, \neducation funding, Pell grants, Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nIDEA, you name it--a 6-percent across-the-board cut because the Senator \nfrom Texas wants to move by one day the payment of SSI. He wants to \nmove it to one day later. Last year, we moved it one day forward. He \nwants to move it to one day later.\n  Who cares about one day? Why is it such a big deal to go from \nSeptember 30 to October 1? But if it means that it allows us to move \nforward with this bill and to have the adequate funding in this bill \nwhen we go to conference, it means a lot.\n  This really is a mischievous point of order because it really doesn't \ndo anything. It doesn't save us any money. The money we will spend on \nSSI will either go out September 30 or it will go out October 1. It is \ngoing out. The Senator from Texas is not stopping that money. It is \ngoing to go out. It is either going to go out on one day or the next \nday. He is not saving a nickel. But by doing this, he is causing all \nkinds of problems on this bill. That is why I say it is just simply a \nmischievous motion.\n  Of course, I support my colleague, the chairman, in the motion to \nwaive. Hopefully, we will hear from Senator Stevens on this. But there \nis really no substance. I guess what I am trying to say is that there \nis no substance to the motion--none. You don't save a nickel. You don't \nhelp anybody. You don't hurt anybody. You just move the payment from \none day to the next. That is all. But you sure hurt this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving my right to the floor, I will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield for a question, I wonder if the \nSenator recalls last year a technique similar to this used on the \nDepartment of Defense bill. I am just curious whether our colleague, \nthe Senator from Texas, came to the floor to make a point of order when \nit had to do with defense. I don't know the answer to that. I am \ncurious. It seems to me if there is a consistent point of order against \nthe deployment of this technique, one wouldn't just make it on \neducation issues, which, of course, to you, me, and others is very \nimportant. It is some of the most important spending we do. It is some \nof the most important investments we make in the country.\n\n  I ask the question, Does the Senator know whether a similar point of \norder was made by our colleague when it had to do with the Defense \nDepartment last year?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I don't know the answer to that question. I was not \ninvolved in the appropriations bill for defense. I will leave that to \nothers. I have no knowledge of that. I accept the Senator's insight \ninto that. I don't know the answer as to whether the Senator from Texas \nobjected to that. The Senator from Texas can certainly speak for \nhimself in that regard. But I guess the Record will show one way or the \nother.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might ask another question, the point here is this \nbill deals with the effort the Federal Government makes to respond to \nthe education needs in this country. Most of education funding, of \ncourse, comes from State and local governments. We provide some funding \nin a range of areas. We provide assistance in VA, health care, and a \nrange of other issues. This is a very important piece of legislation \nthat invests prominently in the lives of the people of this country.\n  The technique that is being objected to is not a new technique; it \nhas been employed before. That is the point I was making. Is it a good \ntechnique? I don't know. You could find other ways to adequately fund \nthese needed programs. Some in this Chamber may not want to fund these \nprograms. They may think they are not a priority perhaps. This is not a \nnew technique. But apparently when it comes to funding for VA, health \ncare, and education, we have people come to the floor to make a point \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. On another matter, Mr. President, I ask the Senator from \nIowa to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will yield, without losing my right to \nthe floor, for a question from my friend from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if I could consult with the good Senator \nfrom Iowa on a matter which I raised earlier, that is, the Senator from \nMississippi, the majority leader, asked unanimous consent for the \nSenate to take up a list of amendments on both sides and to have \nprinted that list of amendments with respect to the pending bill.\n\n[[Page S5982]]\n\n  I asked the majority leader if it might not be a good idea for the \nleader to set a date certain in July to bring up PNTR. I am not asking \nthe Senator for his view on the bill, but I ask the Senator if he \nthinks it is a good idea to bring the bill up and at least have a vote \non it, particularly in July. Wouldn't it be better to have a bill \nbrought up in July than, say, in September, given the fact that it has \npassed the House, given the fact that we will bring it up sometime this \nsession of Congress, and given the fact that delay is dangerous?\n  Does the Senator agree it would be a good idea to bring it up and \nhave a date certain, at least for insurance that we are going to vote \non it this year? The month of July would be the preferable month to \nvote on it rather than a subsequent month; does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Montana, who is a strong \nsupporter on the Finance Committee of the permanent normal trade \nrelations with China--and he has worked very hard on this issue--I know \nhe desires, as many others, to get on with that, debate it, have a vote \nand move on.\n  The Senator is asking this Senator a question on which I do not feel \nqualified to make an answer. I am not involved in this issue or on the \nFinance Committee. Right now my interest is getting this bill through. \nI am trying to help and do what I can to get the amendments through and \nget adequate funding for education, for NIH, for health care, for human \nservices, to try to educate our kids, and attend to the human needs of \nour people. We are trying to get this through.\n  I have not had time now to consider when the PNTR should be brought \nup. I know my friend from Montana is obviously well versed in this \nsubject. I probably would accede to his knowledge of this issue and \nwhen it ought to be brought up. As to my own view, I don't think this \nSenator is qualified to respond.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. I will not object to a unanimous \nconsent request on this bill today, but I do hope prior to recessing \nfor the July recess we can work out an agreement, that the majority \nleader will be able to make a statement, the result of which is to make \nit clear that the vote will come up in July.\n  I reserve my right as to what action I will take tomorrow. I thank \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, back to the point at hand, I want everyone \nto understand what this mischievous motion is all about. All it does, \nin order to save the money, is move the date from October 1 to \nSeptember 30. Last year, we moved it up to October 1; we moved it back \nto September 30.\n  The motion of the Senator from Texas says, no, you can't do it \nSeptember 30; you have to do it on October 1. In fairness and in \nreality, the SSI checks should go out at the end of the month. If the \nSenator has an objection, he should have filed it last year because we \nmoved it from September 30 to October 1. SSI checks are to go out the \nend of the month. All we are doing is bringing it back to where it \nreally ought to be, at the end of the month.\n  Be that as it may, we are only talking about 1 day. I don't think too \nmany people are hurt by 1 day. The Senator moves it back to October 1 \nwhen it ought to be September 30.\n  What does his motion do if it is upheld? We will have almost a $3 \nbillion cut in education, a $1.4 billion cut in NIH, a $210 million cut \nfrom the Centers for Disease Control, a $300 million cut from Head \nStart, a $77 million cut from community health centers.\n  I heard some talk earlier about going to conference and taking care \nof it there. The House bill is lower than ours. If we cut these numbers \nhere, when we go to conference, we will be locked into the lower \nnumbers. So it has a great impact.\n  We have a lot of amendments that have been filed--not only on the \nDemocratic side but the Republican side as well--from Senators Collins, \nDeWine, Smith, Lott, Hutchison, Coverdell, Ashcroft, Helms, Nickles, \nSmith, Gramm, and a whole bunch on our side, too.\n  How can we debate these amendments in any kind of a legitimate \nfashion, if, in fact, we don't even know what kind of money we are \ntalking about? Some of the amendments add money; Some take it away; \nSome modify.\n  If we go ahead and have the amendments, we don't know whether the \nmotion from the Senator from Texas is going to hold or whether it will \nbe waived, so we will be debating these amendments in a vacuum without \nthe full knowledge of exactly what dollar amounts we are looking at. \nAre we going to cut it by 6.75 percent across the board or not? We \ndon't know that yet.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In formulating this question as to whether we are going \nto cut it by 6.75 percent, may I suggest to the distinguished ranking \nmember and comanager that we will not cut funding by 6.75 percent.\n  What we are seeking to do now is to obtain a reallocation. \nDiscussions are underway with the chairman of the full committee to \nreallocate some funds to this bill from other bills, which delays the \nday of reckoning for the whole process. That is the way things are \ndone, not only around here but generally.\n  It is my hope we can accomplish that. The chairman of the full \ncommittee is now busy working on a supplemental, but he will be here in \na few minutes. I believe we will find a way on a reallocation to \nsatisfy the issue which has been raised by the Senator from Texas.\n  Unfortunately, we had three amendments queued up and ready to go to \nmake progress, but seeing the state of affairs on the floor, our \namendment offerers have dispersed. We are trying to find some more \namendments, and we have an amendment ready to be offered.\n  It is my hope that on the representation we are making progress on \nfinding an allocation, which will leave our bill at $104.5 billion, we \ntake the Senator from Texas up on his willingness to set his issue \naside so we can proceed with the bill.\n  Mr. REID. It sounds reasonable. We have one person who wanted me to \nprotect him. He is across the hall. I will see if I can get that taken \ncare of. We object for a little bit.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I reclaim the floor. I had yielded for a \nquestion. I hope we can get this clearance. I think we probably can \nmove ahead. From what my distinguished chairman said, I hope that can \nhappen in terms of reallocation and we can put this thing to bed.\n  An objection to laying the motion to waive aside holds right now \nuntil we can get clearance on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the comments \nmade by our colleague from Iowa. My point of order can be called many \nthings, but calling it mischievous--not that there is anything wrong \nwith being mischievous in defense of the public interest--but my point \nof order is anything but mischievous.\n  Our colleague from Iowa would have us believe that shifting SSI \npayments from fiscal year 2001 to 2000 does not increase spending. \nNothing could be further from the truth. Under current law, the \npayments for SSI will be made on October 2 and they will be part of the \n2001 budget. What this illegal--under the Budget Act--payment shift \ndoes is shift this payment back into fiscal year 2000 and raids the \nsurplus that we have all pledged to protect by a total of $2.4 billion, \nfreeing up $2.4 billion more to be spent next year. So the first point \nis, sustaining this point of order will mean we will spend $2.4 billion \nless.\n  Second, a point of order was not raised against the D.C. \nappropriations bill last year on the pay shift because there was no \npoint of order available. That pay shift did not violate the budget in \neffect at that time. This SSI payment shift was considered in the \nbudget and it was rejected, specifically rejected.\n  Let me explain exactly the arithmetic of where we are. In allocating \nspending for this fiscal year, the Appropriations Committee allocated \nto Labor-HHS appropriations, a subcommittee that funds many important \nprograms for America, a 13.5-percent increase in spending. That was far \nand away the largest increase in spending of any budget allocation. You \nwould\n\n[[Page S5983]]\n\nhave to go all the way back to when Jimmy Carter was President to find \nthat level of spending.\n  The first thing this committee did was it put some entitlement \nreforms in the bill, which the chairman of the committee has already \nsaid are not going to be made. They are going to be taken out in \nconference. But by claiming that they are going to be made, they \nmagically raised their increase in spending from 13.5 percent over last \nyear's level to 17.7 percent over last year's level. You are now in the \nrange where going back to when Jimmy Carter was President does not hold \nup. We are getting to the point where you have to go back to the time \nwhen Lyndon Johnson was President to find increases like that.\n  But even that was not enough. What they did was include a phony \npayment shift--by taking SSI payments, which by law are to be made on \nOctober 2, which is after the beginning of the new fiscal year, in \nother words, money they would have had to have funded in the 2001 \nbudget--by taking that payment and moving it into fiscal year 2000, \nthey can rob the surplus by $2.4 billion and spend $2.4 billion next \nyear. By doing that, they would then raise the increase in spending \nover last year's level to 20.5 percent.\n  These tears that are being shed about my point of order, which simply \ncalls on the Senate to live up to its budget, these tears are being \nshed because by doing that we could increase spending in this area only \nby 17.7 percent. By enforcing the budget, rather than increasing \nspending by 20.5 percent, we would increase spending by 17.7 percent. \nHow many working families have seen their income go up by 17.7 percent \nin the last year? I submit, not very many families.\n  So what I have done is simply said: When we adopted a budget we meant \nit. When we set out what we were going to spend in this coming year, we \nmeant for those constraints to be binding. What is literally happening \nin the Congress is that this surplus is burning a gigantic hole in our \npocket. We are seeing spending increases at levels that have not been \napproached since Lyndon Johnson was President of the United States. It \nis very dangerous for two reasons. No. 1, if we have a downturn, those \nsurpluses are not going to be there. Second, some of us had hoped that \nwe would repeal the marriage penalty, so we do not have to make people \nin America who fall in love and get married pay $1,400 a year \nin additional income taxes for that right. We had hoped to repeal the \ndeath tax so your family would not have to sell off your family farm or \nyour business that your parents worked a lifetime to build up, simply \nbecause they died. But if we are going to be increasing spending like \nthis and busting the budget, we are never going to have an opportunity \nto share the benefits of this prosperity with working Americans.\n\n  When our colleague says this point of order does not save money, that \nis simply not true. It saves $2.4 billion.\n  Second, I am going to raise a point of order on the supplemental \nappropriation for military construction. I am going to raise it because \nwhat we are doing is obscene in terms of spending, and the bill does \nviolate the Budget Act. I intend to raise the point of order.\n  Let me finally say that this point of order is important. In fact, we \nhave used it five times today to prevent new spending from being added. \nThe amazing thing is that we have before us an appropriations bill that \ngrows by one-fifth, over 20 percent, and yet we have spent all day long \nwhere the minority has been trying to add more and more and more \nspending. You begin to wonder when is it enough? Is there any \nappropriations bill that could have been written that would have been \nenough?\n  Yet with all this spending, we are all talking about locking away \nmoney for Social Security, locking away money for Medicare, but the \nspending goes on and on and on.\n  I raised the budget point of order. If Senator Stevens comes over and \nreallocates money and takes it away from another use so the total level \nof spending does not rise, he certainly has a right to do that. That \nwill mean this point of order will stand. This phony payment shift will \nbe stricken. But the money will be allocated to be spent on these \nprograms and taken away from something else. That is how the budget is \nsupposed to work. We are supposed to make decisions like American \nfamilies make decisions. If they want a new refrigerator they don't buy \na new washing machine. If they want to go on vacation, they don't buy a \nnew car. They set priorities.\n  Our problem is we never set priorities. So I think this point of \norder is important. This point of order is an enforcement of the \nbudget. We ought to be holding the line on spending. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Texas. I \nknow sometimes it upsets people when we come out and say: Wait a \nminute, we are breaking the budget.\n  I work with the Senator from Texas on the Budget Committee and he \nhappens to be right. I also compliment my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nwho is managing the bill. As the Senator from Texas mentioned, no \nmatter what is in this bill, many people--particularly on the other \nside--say it is never enough. No matter what is in there, it is never \nenough. The Senator from Pennsylvania put in more money than the \nPresident requested for education, and we have had four or five \namendments saying let's spend billions more. It is never enough. No \nmatter what, we more than matched the President.\n  The bill we have before us has outlays greater than the President \nrequested and it is still not enough.\n  I happen to be one who is, I don't want to say a wonk on numbers, but \nI am really picky on numbers. I think we ought to be accurate on \nnumbers. I asked people before, by how much does this bill grow? The \nSenator from Texas just says it grows by a fifth. He understates the \ngrowth by just a tad. The growth in this bill is 20.4 percent in budget \nauthority according to CBO. That is a lot of BA growth. Some people say \nwe are growing other areas of the budget, and that is true. No other \narea of the budget is growing nearly as fast. The Defense \nappropriations bill we already had before us and passed, if my memory \nserves me correctly, was growing at 7-point-some percent. That is a \nlot. It is a big increase. This is growing almost three times as much \nin budget authority.\n  People ask: What does that mean? It means the money we authorize to \nbe spent; we are committing the Government to spend that amount.\n  What are outlays? Sometimes outlays are easier to figure. The growth \npercentage in outlays is not quite as much. The growth percentage in \noutlays is 12 percent. The Senator from Texas wants to take off $2.4 \nbillion because that is an offset. That is, frankly, a faulty offset. \nIt is only in there so we can have more money in real growth in \noutlays, in budget authority, in commitment to growth spending.\n  There is actually $4.9 billion in outlay offsets. The Senator from \nTexas might have been able to do the full $4.9 billion. I know he can \ndo $2.4 billion, but there is $4.9 billion in offsets. I believe the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee said we will drop those \noffsets.\n  The real program growth--and this is what we are talking about in \nBA--is $104.1 billion. That compares to last year's $86.5 million in \nbudget authority. That is a growth of 20.4 percent. That is a lot.\n  If we adopt the amendment of the Senator from Texas, the growth will \nstill be in excess of 17 percent. Granted, I know it will cause some \nconsternation. I know the members of the committee will have to \nreshuffle and limit the growth of the spending in commitment to 17.5 \npercent. I happen to think that is doable. Maybe it is not the easiest \nthing in the world because we made commitments to grow spending more \nthan the President did in this area or that area. Certainly, 17-percent \ngrowth is adequate, sufficient, and responsible.\n  As to the bill before us, one can only say it complies with the \nbudget if they take into consideration $4.9 billion of offsets which, \nfrankly, will not happen.\n  Again, I compliment my colleague from Texas for his amendment. I will \nsubmit for the Record a chart I put together which shows budget \nauthority and outlays for the Labor-HHS bill for the last 10 years.\n  For my colleagues' information, in 1990, 10 years ago, budget \nauthority was\n\n[[Page S5984]]\n\n$43.9 billion. Last year, it was $86.5 billion. It basically doubled in \nthe last 10 years.\n  The bill before us is trying to grow at 20 percent. In other words, \nit will double in about 4 years at twice the rate of growth of what we \nhave done in the last 10 years. I think that would be a mistake.\n  I am not critical of anyone. I compliment my colleague from Texas. He \nhas a good amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the chart which shows the growth in this \nparticular area of the budget, the Labor-HHS budget, be printed in the \nRecord. It shows growth in outlays and in budget authority for the last \n10 years.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        LABOR/HHS APPROPRIATIONS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                    BA growth    Outlay\n                                Budget    Outlays                growth\n                              authority             (percent)  (percent)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1990........................       43.9       49.4  .........  .........\n1991........................       51.0       54.4       16.2       10.2\n1992........................       60.1       58.5       17.9        7.5\n1993........................       63.2       62.7        5.1        7.3\n1994........................       68.1       68.7        7.8        9.6\n1995........................       67.4       70.2       -1.0        2.1\n1996........................       63.4       69.1       -5.9       -1.6\n1997........................       71.0       71.9       11.9        4.1\n1998........................       80.7       76.2       13.7        6.1\n1999........................       85.1       80.2        5.4        5.2\n2000........................       86.5       86.3        1.6        7.7\n2001 House Net..............       97.2       91.1       12.4        5.5\n2001 House Gross*...........      101.8       94.3       17.8        9.2\n2001 Senate Net.............       98.1       93.1       13.5        7.9\n2001 Senate Gross*..........      104.1       96.7       20.4       12.0\n2001 President..............      105.8       94.6       22.3        9.6\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*=Gross spending levels do not include mandatory offsets, contingent\n  emergencies, or other adjustments.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will take a couple minutes. I heard the \nSenator from Texas talking about there is never enough. Of course, he \njust talked about Democrats on this side offering amendments to \nincrease funding. I thought what is good for the goose is good for the \ngander.\n  There are Senators on that side of the aisle who have amendments to \nincrease spending in this bill: Senator Cochran, Senator Collins, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Inhofe, Senator Jeffords. Those are the only \nones I have right now from their side that I know of who add money to \nthe bill. It is not only Democrats; Republicans, too. There are some on \nthat side of the aisle, as well as on this side of the aisle, who \nunderstand we have unmet needs in this country when it comes to dealing \nwith education, health, human services, and research.\n  I point out there is all this talk about how much this budget has \nincreased. It all depends on how you look at it. It depends on your \nbaseline. It depends on your numbers. The Senator from Texas probably \nknows that as well as anybody around here. So we can look at it a \ndifferent way.\n  Let's look at it this way, for example: Twenty years ago, the share \nof the dollar that went for elementary and secondary education in this \ncountry that came from the Federal Government was a little over 11 \ncents. In other words, 20 years ago, 11 cents out of every dollar that \nwas put into elementary and secondary education came from the Federal \nGovernment. Today, that is down to 7 cents. We are going backwards. We \nput the burden on our property taxpayers around the country. It is an \nunfair tax, a tax that can be highly regressive, especially in an area \nwhere there are a lot of elderly people who may not be working and live \non Social Security, but they still have to pay the property taxes. When \none looks at it that way, one can say we are shirking our \nresponsibility. If we had just kept up that 11-percent level for the \nlast 20 years, we would not be having all these amendments.\n  Second, the figures they are throwing out about a 20-percent increase \nis about as phony as the piece of paper it is written on because that \ntakes into account a lot of things that are not figured into how much \nwe are actually increasing programs. If one looks at the program \nincreases--education and the other program increases--this year over \nlast year, it comes in at a little over 9 percent, somewhere between 9 \nand 10 percent.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, 8.2 percent.\n  Mr. HARKIN. My chairman is always ahead of me on these things--8.2 \npercent. If one looks at the increases we are making next year over \nthis year, it comes to 8.2 percent, not 20 percent. I wanted to make \nthe record clear. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have one sentence in reply, and that \nis, we will provide the details as to increasing 8.2 percent instead of \nthe alleged 20.4 percent, but we want to do it at a later point so we \ncan move ahead with amendments.\n  We have two amendments lined up: one from the Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nVoinovich, and one from the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu. I ask \nunanimous consent that the pending amendments be set aside so we can \nproceed with the Voinovich amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Reserving the right to object, will I be next in line \nfor an amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe Voinovich amendment, we proceed to the Landrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           Amendment No 3641\n\n (Purpose: To permit appropriations to be used for programs under the \n              Individuals with Disabilities Education Act)\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Voinovich] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3641.\n       On page 59, line 10, insert ``; to carry out part B of the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 \n     et seq.);'' after ``qualified teachers''.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, before I speak on this amendment I sent \nto the desk, I would like to say just a couple of words in regard to \nthe point of order the Senator from Texas has just made.\n  I was one of the Members of the Senate who worked with the Senator \nfrom Texas to place in the budget resolution certain points of order \nwhich we believed we needed to have to make sure spending did not \nincrease more than what the budget resolution provided for.\n  His point of order is directed at exactly what we were concerned \nabout. It is what I might refer to, in all due respect, as a gimmick. \nIn considering the 2001 budget, money that was put into the FY 2001 \nbudget is being moved back into the 2000 budget in order to make \navailable $2.4 billion more than could be spent otherwise.\n  What does that mean? That means that when you shove the cost back \ninto the year 2000, you are going to use $2.4 billion of the on-budget \nsurplus that many of us recently voted to use to pay down the national \ndebt.\n  When we put a budget resolution together, at least--I thought it \nmeant something. One of the things that disturbed me last year was \nthat, at the end of the game, we did all kinds of things to exceed what \nwe had originally anticipated to spend. So here we are today, trying to \ndo the same kind of thing we did at the end of last year.\n  I think this Senate should sustain the point of order; that we ought \nto live by the budget resolution we agreed to earlier this year, and \nthat the committee should make the hard choices.\n  One of the things that was brought up is that in order to pay for \nmany of the new increases in spending in new programs, mandatory \nprograms were cut, mandatory programs that I think are fundamental. \nThings such as the social services block grant, things such as the CHIP \nprogram. I have been told they will be taken care of later on.\n  My belief is that if we have a budget resolution and we agree to \nspend a certain amount of money, we ought to live within that budget \nresolution. I hope we sustain the point of order.\n  Mr. President, few will dispute that each and every child in this \nNation deserves to be able to obtain a quality education, a fact \nCongress recognized 25 years ago when it passed the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act.\n  Since that time, IDEA has helped ensure that all students, regardless \nof their disability, are able to receive the educational services they \nneed in order to attend their local school.\n  In my State of Ohio, IDEA has helped thousands of young men and women \ngo beyond their disabilities and obtain a quality education.\n\n[[Page S5985]]\n\n  Thanks to IDEA, Ohio students with debilitating problems like \nCerebral Palsy and autism have been able to receive help in reading and \nwriting from special education teachers. They can use programs like \nDragon Dictate--a speech recognition program that can be used to \ncontrol a word processor-- in order to help them better understand \ntheir school work.\n  Before IDEA, these children would have been virtually forgotten \nelements in our education system. With IDEA, these children are in \nschool, they are learning and they are growing. And IDEA doesn't just \nhelp disabled students. Alexandra Shannon, a 16 year old student from \nBeavercreek, OH, believes that ``enhanced educational opportunities \nhelp everyone.'' In a meeting with one of my staff members just a few \nmonths ago, she told of her friend, Peter, who had learned to walk at \nschool with the help of his schoolmates. The entire school was brought \ncloser together by the experience that Alexandra called, the ``joy of \nthe year.''\n  However, even with all the success of IDEA across the Nation, the \nfact remains that the cost to implement this program is draining money \nfrom our schools and significantly impeding the ability of State and \nlocal educators to fund their own priorities--priorities that include \nsome of the items my colleagues here in the Senate think should be \nfunded at the Federal level.\n  The cost of serving a handicapped student is typically twice as much \nas the average amount spent per pupil, while in some school districts, \nthe cost is higher still. Think of this. In Centerville, OH, \nCenterville High School superintendent, Frank DePalma estimates that in \nhis school, special education services cost 4 to 5 times as much as do \nservices for nonhandicapped students. He said:\n\n       Costs for services such as occupational therapy, speech \n     therapy and physical therapy continue to skyrocket.\n\n  Indeed, the Cincinnati Post wrote in an editorial just 2 months ago \nthat the city's public schools spend:\n\n       $40.3 million a year on disabilities education. That's \n     nearly 11% of its $365 million budget.\n\n  That is 11 percent of their budget.\n  Many school districts recognize that students with disabilities \nrequire different, and often, expensive needs. They want to help their \nstudents, but they also need and want the financial help that the \nFederal Government has promised.\n  As many of my colleagues may recall, when IDEA was passed in 1975, \nCongress thought it was such a national priority, that it promised that \nthe Federal Government would pay up to 40 percent of the cost of this \nprogram.\n  To date, the most that Washington has provided to our school \ndistricts under IDEA is 12.6 percent of the educational costs for each \nhandicapped child; and that was in fiscal year 2000.\n  The remainder of the cost for IDEA still falls on State and local \ngovernments.\n  Because the Federal Government has not lived up to its commitment, \nIDEA amounts to a huge unfunded Federal mandate. When I was Governor of \nOhio, I fought hard for passage of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act in \n1995 so that circumstances like this could be avoided in the future.\n  And just how large an unfunded mandate has IDEA become?\n  In fiscal year 2000, Congress allocated almost $5 billion for special \neducation for school-age children. If we had funded IDEA at the 40 \npercent level that Congress had promised in 1975, we would have \nallocated $15.6 billion in fiscal year 2000 rather than $4.9 billion.\n  In essence, a $10.7 billion unfunded mandate was passed along to our \nState and local governments for IDEA. And that is on top of the 60 \npercent--or $23.3 billion--for which they are already responsible. So, \nfor a federally created program, our State and local governments' \n``share'' in this fiscal year will amount to $34 billion out of a total \nof $38.9 billion.\n  Indeed, Mr. R. Kirk Hamilton from Southwestern City School, Grove \nCity, OH has written to me, stating that IDEA is:\n\n       an enormous, unfunded mandate which is so expensive and so \n     cumbersome that the funds are not available to deliver needed \n     services to children.\n\n  Mr. President, that is just wrong.\n  For all programs under IDEA, the President of the United States \nassumes an expenditure of $6.3 billion in fiscal year 2001. That is \nonly a $332 million increase from the $6 billion level of funding in \nfiscal year 2000.\n  However, the President's fiscal year 2001 budget contained a whopping \n$40.1 billion in discretionary education spending. That is almost \ndouble the $21.1 billion in discretionary education spending allocated \nby the Federal Government just 10 years ago in fiscal year 1991, and \nnearly 5 times the $8.2 billion spent on discretionary education \nspending 25 years ago in 1976. Where is that money going? Think of \nthat. Where is it going?\n  It is important to understand that the White House and some of my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are very good at reading \npolls. They see that education is of high interest to the American \npeople.\n  Even though the Federal Government only provides 7 percent of the \nfunds for education in this country, the White House and these same \ncolleagues consider themselves, sometimes, I think, to be members of a \nnational school board.\n  They have other, new priorities that they believe Washington should \nfund instead of providing additional funding for the federally created \nIDEA--programs like school construction, afterschool programs, hiring \nmore teachers, improving technology and training in schools, and \ncreating community learning centers. They are all great ideas.\n  They are important initiatives, but they are the responsibility of \nour States and local communities. Of course, the politically expedient \nthing to do is to support funding for all these programs at the federal \nlevel; it makes us look as if we are ``for'' education. They are high \nin the polls. Nevertheless, I believe in the delineation of Federal and \nState responsibility, and increased funding for IDEA is a Federal \nresponsibility.\n  It is one that we mandated on the school districts. It is part of our \nresponsibility. We said we would pay for 40 percent of it. It is about \ntime we paid for 40 percent of it, rather than going off on a lot of \nnew initiatives.\n  During our debate on the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution, I \noffered, and this body adopted, by a vote of 53-47, an amendment \nstating that before we fund new education programs, we should make \nfunds available for IDEA.\n  The amendment that I am offering today makes good on the commitment \nwe made in the budget resolution.\n  Specifically, my amendment would give local education agencies the \nflexibility to take $2.7 billion of Federal money under title VI of \nthis appropriations bill and spend it on IDEA, if they choose. In other \nwords, we are saying that school districts, if they choose, can use new \nmoney for IDEA.\n  If the Federal Government was fully funding IDEA, most of the \neducation initiatives my colleagues are proposing--school construction, \nafterschool programs--could be and likely would be taken care of at the \nState and local level. That is how our State and local education \nleaders want it.\n  In February, with the help of the Ohio School Board Association and \nthe Buckeye Association of School Administrators, I contacted Ohio \nteachers, superintendents, and educational leaders from urban, \nsuburban, and rural districts in every part of Ohio to ask what they \nwould prefer: a full Federal commitment to IDEA or new Federal funding \ninitiatives.\n  More than 90 percent of the responses I received so far have shown \nthat Ohio's education community leaders prefer a full commitment to \nIDEA over new programs. I am confident this same poll conducted in \nother States would produce a similar result.\n  Let me read a few responses I received. Mr. Philip Warner, \nSuperintendent of Ravenna City School wrote:\n\n       I believe school districts would benefit the most if \n     Congress met its obligations under IDEA, therefore allowing \n     school districts to fund programs that would be specific in \n     each school district.\n\n  David VanLeer, Director of Pupil Services, Euclid City Schools, right \nacross the street from where I live:\n\n       Congress should honor that pledge to provide 40 percent of \n     the cost of IDEA before any new programs are funded.\n\n  Doreen Binnie, speech language pathologist at Colombia local School \nDistrict responded, ``Absolutely,'' to the\n\n[[Page S5986]]\n\nquestion of whether Congress should fund IDEA before new programs.\n  We must stop acting as if we are the Nation's school board, trying to \nfund every education program possible. The truth is, many of the \nprograms that Members of Congress and the President want to enact \nshould be funded at the State and local level. In my view, those \nprograms would have a better chance of being funded if State and local \ngovernments didn't have to divert such a large percentage of their \nfunds to pay for IDEA. The Federal Government has a commitment to IDEA \nand that commitment should be fully honored. I believe our State and \nlocal leaders should be given the flexibility they need to spend new \nFederal education dollars that are allocated under this bill to honor \nthe commitment of IDEA. I appreciate the fact that the appropriations \ncommittee provided increased money for IDEA in this budget.\n  The fact is, we should say to our local school districts that with \nthe $2.7 billion which is allocated in title VI one of the options we \nshould give them is to fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair. Under the unanimous consent \nagreement, I have the right to offer my amendment at this time.\n  Mr. REID. Not until we finish the Voinovich amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Voinovich amendment must be disposed of.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we have been consulting on the \ncomplexities of the bill. If I understand the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Ohio, it is that the title XI block grant of $2.7 billion, which \nis divided for class size and construction, may be used for other \npurposes at the discretion of the local boards. If they choose not to \nuse it for construction or class size, it could be used at their \ndiscretion. He wants to be sure those funds can be used for special \neducation.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. That is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That would be acceptable. It is our purpose that the \nlocal boards, having decided they do not want it for the other \npurposes--construction or reduction in class size--may use it as they \ndecide. We are prepared to accept the Voinovich amendment. We are also \nanxious to proceed with the bill.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the minority has reviewed the amendment. I \nhave spoken with Senator Harkin. We have no objection to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3641) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May we have a time agreement on the amendment of the \nSenator from Louisiana?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would need about 20 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May we have a time agreement of 30 minutes, 20 minutes \nfor the proponents of the measure and 10 minutes for the opponents, if \nthere are opponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3645\n\n(Purpose: To provide funding for targeted grants under section 1125 of \n   the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am hoping there will not be opponents \nbecause we think this amendment makes a lot of sense. We are happy to \nagree to a time limit because we are interested in moving this debate \nalong.\n  I agree with our distinguished colleague from Ohio. I think his is a \ngood amendment. I commend him for coming to the floor and bringing to \nthe Senate an issue that is very important to Louisiana, to our \neducators, teachers, superintendents, and parents who are very \ninterested in funding. I thank the Senator for continuing to advocate \nfor us to fulfill our commitment and meet our promises to our special \neducation students. I hope the leadership would consider accepting this \namendment, which I offer in good faith, because it does not add money \nto the budget. It simply provides greater flexibility.\n  I send my amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Ms. Landrieu] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3645.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 55, strike line 21 and all that follows through \n     page 56, line 8, and insert the following: ``Higher Education \n     Act of 1965, $9,586,800,000, of which $2,912,222,521 shall \n     become available on July 1, 2001, and shall remain available \n     through September 30, 2002, and of which $6,674,577,479 shall \n     become available on October 1, 2001, and shall remain \n     available through September 30, 2002, for academic year 2000-\n     2001: Provided, That $6,985,399,000 shall be available for \n     basic grants under section 1124: Provided further, That up to \n     $3,500,000 of these funds shall be available to the Secretary \n     on October 1, 2000, to obtain updated local educational \n     agency level census poverty data from the Bureau of the \n     Census: Provided further, That $1,200,400,000 shall be \n     available for concentration grants under section 1124A: \n     Provided further, That $750,000,000 shall be available for \n     targeted grants under section 1125 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965: Provided further, That grant \n     awards under sec-''.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this amendment will not require 60 votes \nbecause it does not seek to waive the Budget Act.\n  I am somewhat in agreement with what Senator Gramm said and our \nranking member, Senator Harkin, about the fact that we do need to be \nconcerned with the amount of spending. We need to be concerned about \nthe amount of spending for education, for health, for our military. We \nwant to make sure we are making smart and wise investments. We want to \nmake sure we are not getting back into the era of big Government or \nirresponsible Government with irresponsible tax breaks. I am much \ninclined to support many of the comments that were made.\n  This amendment fits that debate exactly. I am hoping the leadership \non both sides will see it that way.\n  Let me begin by telling my colleagues again what this amendment does \nnot do. It does not ask to waive the Budget Act. It does not add any \nmoney to this budget. It does not reduce one penny of title I money to \nany State in the Nation.\n  It simply attempts to redistribute the moneys within this budget to \nreflect a value about which we all speak on both sides of the aisle \neach day; that is, the value of trying to target the money in this \nbudget to those children, families, and communities that need the most \nhelp.\n  Many communities in Louisiana, California, New York, Michigan, and \nMississippi are struggling to meet their obligations to provide a \nquality education for all children, regardless of their race, religion, \nor what side of the track they were born on, or whether they have a lot \nof money in their household or little money.\n  We believe that in America every child deserves a quality education. \nWe say that on this floor over and over and over again. We speak these \nwords. We say this. But when it comes to writing our budget, which we \nare doing today, we don't do it. We don't do it. We have the power to \ndo it. Fifty votes, right now, could do this. But, unfortunately, I \ndon't think we may get more than maybe one or two or three or four \nbecause we are very good at talking about equality, fairness and \njustice, but when it comes to writing a budget, we don't do it.\n  As a Democrat, it is hard for me to say, but I have to be honest and \nsay I am not sure the President's budget reflects that value as closely \nas it should. I have to say the Republican budget doesn't reflect that \nvalue, and some of my own colleagues were not reflecting that value.\n  This amendment, with all due respect to the committee and to \neverybody who tried to work on this, attempts to say that with some \nportion of this increase, we should increase title I because it is the \nonly title that attempts\n\n[[Page S5987]]\n\nto send money out in a way to this Nation where the poor children, the \nneediest children, get the help and attention, giving complete \nflexibility to the local government to decide whether it is additional \nteachers, additional resources. Title I has great flexibility. There \nare few limitations, but it says let's help the poorest children, \nwhether it is in Louisiana or Arkansas or Mississippi or California, \nand there are many States that would benefit from this change.\n  All of the increases Senator Gramm talked about, whether it is a 20-\npercent increase or an 8-percent increase, for the purpose of my \namendment, are not really the issue because of all of the increase--\nwhether 20 percent or 8 percent--a small amount, a few tiny pennies, \nhave been devoted to title I. The poorest children in this Nation, who \nhave no lobbyists, no big and powerful agencies to represent them up \nhere, have literally been left out. In addition, the accountability \nmoney that was placed in this budget in past years to make sure the \nmoney was going to the poor districts, the middle-income districts, and \nthe wealthy districts has been totally taken out.\n\n  So this bill we are debating, that has either a 20-percent or 8-\npercent increase, literally underfunds the poor children of the Nation, \nthe moderate-income families, the lower income families, who are \nstruggling to make the American dream possible for themselves. Yet we \nall come here every day and talk about widening the circle of \nopportunity, how we want to share the great wealth of this Nation. But \nwhen it comes to funding education for the kids who need it the most, \nso they can have a chance, we say no, no, and no. That ``no'' is being \nsaid on the Democratic side, the Republican side and, frankly, from the \nWhite House.\n  This is one Senator who thinks it is wrong. If I am the only vote on \nthe bill, let it be so. I think there will be a few others. I don't \nthink this amendment will pass. I am sure it will be second degreed \nbecause when we can't agree, we offer a commission--I am sure someone \nis going to do that--to study the issue because we have to keep \nstudying the issue of how poor children are affected when their \neducation is at a disadvantage.\n  I will vote against a study. I am going to vote for this amendment \nbecause it will simply move within the confines of this bill $750 \nmillion, which is still a reasonable amount of money, from one title \ninto the title I.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this document be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n STATE ALLOCATIONS AT $738 MILLION (THROUGH BASIC, CONCEN.

Mr. President, this shows clearly that every State in \nthe Union will benefit. The poor children in every State will benefit \nsignificantly by this amendment. I will read specifically into the \nRecord the poorest States that will greatly benefit, and those States \nare: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, California, District of \nColumbia, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, \nTexas, and West Virginia.\n  Just to read out a few pretty startling numbers, let's take \nCalifornia. This amendment, without adding one penny to the budget, \nwill give California $80 million more because they have in certain \nareas a concentration of very poor children who need additional help. \nLouisiana will get an $18 million increase. Without this amendment, \nSenator Breaux and I will basically go home empty-handed to a State \nwhere a headline in one of our major newspapers this week was: \nLouisiana's Children Suffer.\n  The Kids Count Data Book just came out. It clearly demonstrates which \nStates need the help and which States could use the help. I don't \nbelieve in just throwing around new money. I am arguing for flexibility \nand accountability. But I am also arguing that we have an obligation to \ntarget our Federal resources better than we do. I am hoping my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will see the wisdom in this \namendment.\n  I am going to yield a few minutes of my time to my colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Lincoln, who has waited patiently to speak. I thank \nher for her support, her passion, and her interest in helping us make \nour point. At this point, I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nArkansas, and then I respectfully request the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I, too, join my colleague, Senator \nLandrieu, in applauding what our colleague from Ohio, Senator \nVoinovich, was doing previously in bringing up the importance of not \nonly the program of IDEA but also the importance for us to be able to \nmake good on commitments we have made, things we have asked our States \nand our localities to do and yet have not provided them the resources \nto do them.\n  This is just one of those requests. When we look at the targeted \ngrants for the title I dollars, it is a program that was authorized \nover 6 years ago and never has been funded. That is all the Senator \nfrom Louisiana is asking--that we make good on our obligation that came \nabout several years ago to target those dollars to the neediest of \nchildren across this Nation.\n  And to our colleague, Senator Gramm from Texas, who mentioned that \none of the most important things we need to do in this debate is to set \npriorities, I say: Exactly. Let's set the priorities of educating our \nchildren and understanding that we are only as strong as our weakest \nlink, and that devoting the resources we have obligated long ago to the \nneediest of children should be done.\n  So I rise in support of the amendment offered by my good friend from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, which would provide a modest increase in \ntitle I funding and target those additional resources to the neediest \npublic schools. As I have said on many occasions, I believe strongly \nthat we need to increase the Federal investment in public education to \nensure that all students have access to quality education. But spending \nmore money to help educators meet higher standards is only one part of \nthat solution. We also have to ensure that Federal dollars are spent \nresponsibly and that we allocate those resources where we can make a \nreal difference.\n\n  Right now, in those title I funds, there are three categories. These \ntargeted grants don't receive any of that funding. Eighty-five percent \ngoes to basic grants and 15 percent goes to concentration grants. \nStatistics consistently demonstrate that, on average, children who \nattend schools with a high concentration of low-income students lag \nbehind students from more affluent areas. This is certainly true in \nArkansas, where students in the delta region score lower on academic \nachievement tests than students in our more prosperous regions of the \nState.\n\n[[Page S5988]]\n\n  To me, these statistics are a clear indication that title I, which \nagain was created to aid the education of disadvantaged children, isn't \nworking as well as it should. We have diluted our title I program funds \nto so many different areas, until they have become less effective in \nthe areas where they are supposed to be directed--to the disadvantaged.\n  Congress recognized that problem back in 1994 when it created those \ntargeted grants for title I dollars. In the most recent ESEA \nReauthorization Act, unlike basic and concentrated grants, targeted \ngrants are designed so that school districts with a high percentage of \nlow-income students receive a greater share of title I funding.\n  I think we were on to something, but unbelievably these targeted \ngrants have never been funded.\n  This is unfortunate because these are the kids who need the Federal \nassistance the most, and it is where we could do the most good. Income \nstatus alone doesn't determine student achievement. It is the \nconcentration of economically disadvantaged students in a school that \nmakes the most difference.\n  After visiting dozens of schools and talking with hundreds of parents \nin my home State, I am convinced that we have to change our approach if \nwe want to maintain public confidence and support for a strong role in \neducation at the Federal level. In addition to more targeted funding, \nwe need tough accountability standards to ensure students are learning \ncore academic subjects, and more flexibility at the local level to \nallow school districts to meet their most pressing needs. Ultimately, \nwe have to account for the money we spend in Washington and show our \nconstituents results to sustain their support.\n  I also call on my colleagues to support an amendment Senator \nLieberman will be offering later which will address this issue. It \ncalls for a comprehensive GAO study of targeting under title I. At the \nvery least, I believe we have a responsibility to take a good, hard \nlook at the current system because the status quo isn't good enough.\n  This amendment is an important step in the right direction. I applaud \nmy colleague from Louisiana for the courage to stand up for what is \nright. Maybe it is not the most popular, but it is right.\n  I urge support for this proposal. This may not be a political issue, \nand this certainly may not be the most popular issue with those in this \nbody who want to keep the status quo, but it is the right issue. It is \nthe right decision to make, and it is the right amendment to support. \nIf nothing else, this body should support this amendment on behalf of \nthe neediest children in this Nation.\n  I applaud my colleague's courage, and I appreciate her leadership in \nthis effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I yield 4 of those minutes. But I ask \nfor an additional 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I have no objection.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield 5 of those minutes to my colleague from Connecticut, and I \nwould like 5 minutes to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom Louisiana.\n  Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from Louisiana, \nSenator Landrieu, and express my strong support for her amendment to \nbetter target our Federal education funding to the schools and children \nwho need it most. I know from our collaboration on our comprehensive \nnew Democrat education reform plan, the Three R's legislation, that \nSenator Landrieu's commitment to rescuing failing schools and providing \nevery child with a quality education is unsurpassed in this body.\n  I also want to thank my friend and colleague from Arkansas for her \ndevotion to this cause, and for her very eloquent statement on behalf \nof this amendment.\n  As Senator Landrieu and many others have rightly pointed out, we are \nfacing an educational crisis in our poorest urban and rural \ncommunities, where learning too often is languishing, where dysfunction \nis too often the norm, and where as a result too many children are \nbeing denied the promise of equal opportunity. It is just not right or \nacceptable that 35 years after the passage of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, that the average 17-year-old black and Latino \nstudent reads and performs math at the same level as the average 13-\nyear-old Caucasian American student. We must begin to respond to this \nemergency with a greater sense of urgency, and that is exactly what the \nLandrieu amendment aims to do, infusing $1 billion in new funding for \nFY 2001 into the Title I program for disadvantaged students and \nallocating those resources to the districts with the highest \nconcentrations of poverty.\n  We are currently spending $8 billion a year on Title I. No one in \nthis body questions the value or mission of Title I, which was enacted \nin 1965 to compensate for local funding inequities and help level the \nplaying field for low-income students. But the unpleasant truth is that \nthis well-intentioned program is not nearly as focused on serving poor \ncommunities as it is perceived to be, leaving many poor children \nwithout any aid or hope whatsoever.\n  According to the Department of Education, 58 percent of all schools \nreceived at least some Title I funding, including many suburban schools \nwith small pockets of low-income students. Of the 42 percent that don't \nreceive any Title I support, a disturbing number have high \nconcentrations of poor students. In fact, one out of every five schools \nwith poverty rates between 50 percent and 75 percent do not get a dime \nfrom Title I. Let me repeat that startling statistic, because the first \ntime I heard it I did not believe it--one of every five schools that \nhave half to three quarters of its children living in poverty receives \nno Title I funding. None.\n  How does this happen? The formulas we are using to allocate these \nfunds purposely spreads the money thin and wide. Any school district \nwith at least 2 percent of its students living below the poverty level \nqualifies for funding under Title I's Basic Grants formula, through \nwhich 85 percent of all Title I funding is distributed. The rest of the \nmoney is channeled through the Concentration Grant formula, which is \nonly marginally more targeted than the Basic formula, providing aid to \ndistricts with as few as 15 percent of their students at the poverty \nlevel. As a result, almost every school district in the country--9 out \nof every 10--receives some aid from this critical aid pool.\n  In fairness, Congress did make an effort to correct this imbalance in \n1994 through the last reauthorization of the ESA. We approved the \ncreation of a new Targeted formula, which puts a much heavier weight on \npoverty and therefore would direct a much higher percentage of funds to \nschools with higher concentrations of poor children. The key word \nthere, of course, is would. Congress has unfortunately never \nappropriated funding through the Target formula. Not a penny, Instead, \nwe have perpetuated a system that promises one thing and delivers \nanother, that succeeds in letting us bring home funding to each of our \ndistricts but fails to meet its fundamental goal of helping those most \nin need.\n  That is exactly what this amendment introduced by the junior Senator \nfrom Louisiana will do. Once again, I congratulate her on her \nleadership. This is an amendment which would put our money where the \nneeds generally are. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will try to be brief as I conclude my \nremarks on this important amendment.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut for his extraordinary \nleadership in the area of education. It is particularly wonderful and \nrefreshing to note that there are some Members of this body who will \ntake their time and give their energy to speak on an amendment on the \nprinciples because States benefit from this--and Connecticut most \ncertainly benefits from this. Connecticut is not one of the\n\n[[Page S5989]]\n\npoorer States in the Union. I thank my colleague for his extraordinary \nleadership and commitment, even though he doesn't come from a State \nwhere the per capita income is low. It is quite high. It makes his \nleadership on this issue all the more inspiring. I thank him for his \nhelp.\n  Connecticut will do well under this formula, as will many other \nStates. But it is the States that have poorer rural students and poorer \nurban students that will do the best because that is what the Federal \nGovernment should be doing with a portion of our education money, \nhelping to level the playing field.\n  We talk a lot about opportunities, and then we don't fund them.\n  We talk a lot about fairness, but we don't fund it. We talk a lot \nabout equality, but we don't fund it.\n  Mr. President, talk is cheap. Whether it comes from this side, that \nside, or down Pennsylvania Avenue, that is what this amendment is \nabout. That is why I am insisting on a vote. That is why, while a study \nmay be helpful, what really would be helpful is a vote for the poor \nkids of this Nation.\n  One of the great Presidents of one of our distinguished universities \nsaid: If you think education is expensive, try ignorance.\n  I offer to this body that there is not any way in this world, not \nwith any tax cut, not with any fancy new technology, not with any new \nprogram that anybody in this Chamber can think of, we can help sustain \nthis economic miracle of growth if we don't fund a quality education \nfor every child in this Nation.\n  Mr. President, this budget doesn't do it.\n  This amendment helps to target some money to the kids who need it the \nmost. We need to put back our accountability money, put our money where \nwe say our values are.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask for a vote on my amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I believe Senator \nReid was going to offer a second-degree amendment on this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). A second degree amendment \nwould not be in order until the time has been used.\n  Mr. LOTT. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 10 minutes \nand the Senator from Louisiana has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I renew the unanimous consent request with \nrespect to the limit of first-degree amendments to the pending bill and \nsend the list of amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senator from Louisiana has 2 minutes \nremaining. Does she wish to use that time or reserve it?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the distinguished leader. I have made my \nclosing arguments. If there is no one else to speak, I am happy to \nreceive a motion on the amendment so we can call for a vote.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have a very short statement to make.\n  I applaud the Senator from Louisiana for this amendment. I do believe \nit is a very good idea to target funds for disadvantaged children under \ntitle I. The difficulty is that the $600 million will be taken from \ntitle VI, where we have already allocated the principal sum of those \nfunds to meet the President's requirements for new school construction \nand for class size on the condition that local boards may use it for \nother purposes if they decide they do not need classroom construction \nor additional teachers.\n  When the Senator from Louisiana concludes, I will move to table the \namendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask the Senator, is it not true that there is a $1.5 \nbillion increase in title VI; yet there is a very small percentage or a \n$400 million increase for title I? If we are going to build schools or \nreduce class size, and this is a question, does the Senator think we \nshould try to do it for the poorer communities first and then we can do \nit for everyone else? That is what my amendment attempts to do. I ask \nthe Senator that.\n  Is that in the interest of the Nation, to do it for the poor schools \nfirst and then worry about everyone else?\n  Mr. SPECTER. If I may respond, my preference would be to move for the \npoor schools first.\n  In constructing this bill, there were many objections as to how the \nmoney was going to be allocated. The only way we could work through the \ncomplications was to put it in title VI. That was not my first choice, \nnor are the programs my first choice.\n  Working through a great many considerations, we ended up in title VI \nleaving the options to school districts, if they choose not to have \nconstruction, or if they choose not to have reduction in class size. \nThat is an accommodation to very many disparate views.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for his honesty, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, and this has \nbeen cleared on the other side, that the vote\n\n[[Page S5990]]\n\non the Landrieu amendment be set at 7:45.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could amend that request to ask consent \nthat votes occur on the pending amendments at 7:45 in the order which \nthey were debated, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to \nthe votes, and that there be 2 minutes for explanation prior to each \nvote.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, there will be a motion to \ntable on the Landrieu amendment. There will be a motion to table on the \nJeffords amendment. We would not want a right taken away, in case a \nmotion to table fails, to second degree.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is not limited by this.\n  I further ask consent that the time between now and 7:45 be equally \ndivided on the Jeffords amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3655\n\n     (Purpose: To increase the appropriations for carrying out the \n      Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, with an offset)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I now send amendment No. 3655 to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for himself, Mr. \n     Gregg, Mr. Frist, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Hutchinson, Ms. Collins, Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Brownback, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Santorum, \n     and Mr. Voinovich, proposes an amendment numbered 3655.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 58, line 15, strike ``$4,672,534,000'' and insert \n     ``$3,372,534,000''.\n       On page 58, line 17, strike ``$2,915,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,615,000,000''.\n       On page 58, line 22, strike ``$3,100,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,800,000,000''.\n       On page 58, line 26, strike ``$2,700,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,400,000,000''.\n       On page 60, line 16, strike ``$7,352,341,000'' and insert \n     ``$8,652,341,000''.\n       On page 60, line 19, strike ``$4,624,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$5,924,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nCoverdell and Chafee be added to the other cosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I begin by commending my colleague from \nPennsylvania for his leadership as chairman of the Labor, HHS, \nEducation, and related agencies subcommittee. His efforts to increase \nfunding for education and health care often receive too little \nattention. I offer him my thanks on behalf of all Members who share our \ndedication to education.\n  He has had a challenging job crafting appropriations bills that \nbalance the many real and competing needs of the Nation. He has been a \nstrong advocate for education funding and an even stronger advocate for \nthe funding of IDEA. He has been an equally strong advocate for more \nfunding for the National Institutes of Health. This year he has once \nagain taken up the challenge of balancing competing needs. The \nappropriations bill he brought to the Senate is a product of difficult \nnegotiations between competing viewpoints.\n  Because of my respect for my friend from Pennsylvania, I come to the \nfloor with an amendment only because of my conviction that there is an \nunmet Federal obligation that must now be met in full. Almost all the \nMembers of this body have gone on record in support of fully funding \nour commitment to our local schools. We should fully fund IDEA for \nspecial education.\n  I also commend my good friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, who has been \na tireless champion of education funding and health care funding.\n  I anticipate that the opponents of my amendment may argue that this \namendment should be defeated because it takes funds from one education \nprogram and provides it to another. I, too, support increased funding \nfor education, and have voted repeatedly over the past several days to \nwaive the Budget Act in order to secure additional funds for education. \nIt is clear, however, that this does not reflect the will of the \nSenate.\n  Because it is very clear that there is not sufficient support for an \namendment which would exceed the budget caps, we must make difficult \nchoices regarding which programs should be given priority. I have been \na longtime advocate for funding for the title VI block grant program. \nThis appropriations bill provides this program with a $2.7 billion \nincrease, while providing a $1.3 billion increase for IDEA. I believe, \nand this belief is held by every school board in Vermont, that IDEA \nshould be our very first priority.\n  In 1974 we made a commitment to fully fund IDEA. If 25 years later we \ncannot meet this commitment in an era of unprecedented economic \nprosperity and budgetary surpluses, when do we plan to keep this \npledge?\n  When I first arrived in Congress, one of the very first bills that I \nhad the privilege of working on was the Education of All Handicapped \nAct of 1975.\n  As a freshman Member of Congress, I was proud to sponsor that \nlegislation and to be name as a member of the House and Senate \nconference committee along with my chairman Johns Brademus and then \nVermont Senator Bob Stafford.\n  At that time, despite a clear Constitutional obligation to educate \nall children, regardless of disability, thousands of disabled students \nwere denied access to a free and appropriate public education. Passage \nof the Education of All Handicapped Act offered financial incentives to \nstates to fulfill this existing obligation.\n  Recognizing that the costs associated with educating these children \nwas more than many school districts could bear alone, we pledged to pay \n40 percent of these costs of educating students.\n  I know that there is some disagreement about whether or not a \ncommitment was made. I want to tell you as someone that was there at \nthe time that we made a pledge to fully fund this program.\n  I have in my hands a petition from every school board in my State. I \nurge all of my colleagues to come by my desk and look at these \npetitions. They know we made that commitment. Passing this amendment \nwill do more to help our school districts meet their obligation to \nimprove education in this country than nearly anything else we can do.\n  In 1997 Congress once again took up this landmark legislation. This a \ncomplex bill that has profound impact on classrooms across the Nation. \nWith the strong leadership of Senator Lott, Senator Frist, Senator \nGregg, Senator Kennedy, Senator Dodd, Senator Harkin, and many others, \nwe passed the first reauthorization of IDEA in 22 years. It is an \naccomplishment that many of us are very proud of.\n  At that time, we reaffirmed our commitment to pay 40 percent of the \ncosts of educating children. We made this pledge to families, to school \nboards and to the Governors of our States. Over the past 3 years, we \nhave made some progress.\n  But as my good friend from New Hampshire has pointed out several \ntimes over the past year, we are only supporting 13 percent of these \ncosts. In 1975, we made a pledge which we did not keep. In 1997 we made \nthat same pledge once again when we reauthorized IDEA.\n  In the 105th Congress we felt it important to reaffirm our commitment \nto full funding for IDEA. We added language to the fiscal year 1999 \nBudget that stated that IDEA should be fully funded as soon as \nfeasible. And it is feasible now. We know that. This language was \nadopted unanimously by the Senate. At that time, we still faced budget \ndeficits and it was argued that full funding was not feasible.\n  In the 106th Congress we continued to press for full funding for \nIDEA. The fiscal year 2000 appropriations provided a $600 million \nincrease in funding for IDEA. During the debate over the 2001 Budget \nResolution the Senate adopted language that I advocated calling for \nfull funding of IDEA as soon as feasible.\n  The appropriations bill that is before us raises funding for IDEA by \n$1.3 billion in fiscal year 2001. I commend Senator Specter and Senator \nHarkin for providing for this historic increase in funding for IDEA. \nNonetheless, this increase does not put us on the path toward fully \nfunding this program.\n  Our amendment is simple. It doubles the increase that is provided in \nthe bill\n\n[[Page S5991]]\n\nand provides IDEA with an increase that is comparable to the increase \nthat Senators Specter and Harkin have provided for the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  It provides a path by which we will achieve full funding for IDEA by \nfiscal year 2005. It sends a clear message to the Nation that we, as a \nbody, make good on the commitment we make.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment.\n  Good Lord, if we can't do it now with budget surpluses and the \neconomy we have, if not now, when will we do it? I do not believe \nanyone can rationally argue this is not the time to fulfill that \npromise. I intend to do all I can to make sure we do.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa controls 14 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my friend from Vermont. I want to make it clear I am not \nrising in opposition to his goal. Senator Jeffords' goal is the same \ngoal I have. We both want to do everything we can to fully fund, on the \nFederal level, our stated goal of paying 40% of the costs of special \neducation. We should do it. So I agree with the Senator on that. \nSenator Jeffords has been a stalwart supporter of that goal. I believe \nI have been, too. So I do not rise in opposition to what my friend from \nVermont is trying to do Just like me, he wants to educate kids with \ndisabilities and ensure the Federal Government meets its authorized \nfunding goal that was stated in the bill, in IDEA, when it was passed \n25 years ago.\n  I do, however, feel compelled to clarify once again, as I have every \nyear that this issue has come up, usually presented by the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, the terms of the 40 percent. The stated assumption that \nthe Federal Government is to fund 40 percent of the cost of educating \nchildren with disabilities is not correct. You must look at the \nlegislation. The authorizing legislation of 25 years ago authorized the \nmaximum award per State as being the number of children served times 40 \npercent of the national average per pupil expenditure. It was not 40 \npercent of the cost of educating kids with disabilities.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I did not say it was. I carefully deleted that and said \nit is the cost of educating a child.\n  Mr HARKIN. A child? Then the Senator is correct. Usually it is stated \nthe other way around. The Senator correctly stated the law.\n  But back to the point I wanted to make. Should we reach that 40-\npercent goal? Absolutely. We should have reached it a long time ago. I \nagree the Federal Government has fallen down on its effort to reach \nthat goal.\n  What I rise in opposition to is how my friend from Vermont does this. \nWhat my friend is doing is he is taking money out of title VI, which \nwas put in there for school construction and modernization--$1.3 \nbillion.\n  He is taking that money and saying it should be used to help meet our \ngoals on IDEA.\n  Again, it is a classic case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Do we have \na need for the Federal Government to educate kids with disabilities and \nmeet its goals to our States? Yes. We ought to fully fund IDEA.\n  Do we also have a responsibility to help States and our local school \ndistricts rebuild our dilapidated and crumbling schools? I believe the \nanswer to that is yes. The average school in America now is over 40 \nyears old. They are crumbling. They need to be modernized. They need to \nbe updated.\n  I say to my friend from Vermont--and he is my friend and he is a \ngreat supporter of education, I know that--but I ask my friend to \nconsider this: When we modernize schools and rebuild schools, one of \nthe biggest beneficiaries is a kid with a disability. I want the \nSenator to consider that because when many of our old schools were \nbuilt, they were not accessible. The doors are too narrow, the \nbathrooms are not accessible, and even the drinking fountains are not \naccessible, especially for someone who uses a wheelchair.\n  When we talk about school construction and modernization, we talk \nabout $1.3 billion, which is a mere pittance of what is required. What \nthe Senator from Vermont is actually doing by taking that money and \nputting it into IDEA, is penalizing kids with disabilities who need \nthese schools modernized and upgraded. But then the Senator proposes \nthat he is putting the money in IDEA to help kids with disabilities. \nPlease, someone make some sense out of that for me.\n  As I said, the Senator's intentions are very good and laudable to \nincrease funding for IDEA. If he were to do this in an open way and say \nwe ought to increase money for IDEA, I would be on his side, but not at \nthe expense of school modernization and construction because it is kids \nwith disabilities, maybe above all others, who need to have some of \nthese schools modernized, I say to my friend from Vermont.\n  Second, we just adopted an amendment offered by Senator Voinovich \nfrom Ohio. I said: Yes, we will accept it. The amendment of the Senator \nfrom Ohio says the schools can use title VI money, an allowable \nexpense, to meet the requirements of IDEA. I submit to my friend from \nVermont that the acceptance of the Voinovich amendment takes care of \nthat. It leaves the money in there for school modernization and \nconstruction. However, out of the total pot of title VI money, the \nVoinovich amendment says that one of the allowable uses would be to use \nit to meet the requirements of IDEA.\n  I hope that will satisfy the Senator from Vermont. It still leaves \nthe money in there for construction and modernization. I want to make \nthat clear. Because this is where I differ with my friend from Vermont. \nUnder his amendment we will have zero dollars for school construction \nand modernization. Zero. At least with the Voinovich amendment, they \nwill be able to decide what they want to do. They will have money in \nthere for school modernization and construction.\n  I hope the Senator from Vermont will perhaps reconsider this \namendment. I know the goal is laudable. Heck, I support that. We ought \nto fund IDEA, but not take it out of school construction and \nmodernization.\n  I hope we can move beyond this and meet our obligations to all our \nchildren in this country in education and not penalize one group to \nhelp another group. In this case, we penalize kids with disabilities to \nhelp kids with disabilities. That does not seem to make much sense to \nthis Senator. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest to the Senator from Iowa, \nperhaps we can add a phrase to this amendment that says the communities \nshould make it a high priority to fix any problems with access. Would \nhe then support this amendment?\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator asks me a legitimate question. As I \nunderstand it, under the Voinovich amendment, IDEA is an allowable use \nunder title VI. I believe that is well covered in the Voinovich \namendment.\n  Again, the Senator wants to restrict the use of the construction and \nmodernization money. A lot of it will be used for accessibility. Some \nmay not be. Some may be used to repair a ceiling. A ceiling is leaking, \nand they need to repair it. It might not just help kids with \ndisabilities, it would help all kids. I would not want to narrow it \nthis way.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Again, I want to point out that the people's \nunderstanding of our responsibilities are pretty clear in this case. If \nthere is a statutory obligation and a commitment to fully fund a \nprogram--as there is in IDEA--this should be our highest priority. And \nagain, I remind my colleague that this body has gone on record in vote \nafter vote that we should fully fund IDEA. To suggest that fully \nfunding IDEA should not be given higher priority than our desire to \ncreate a new construction program, is to abandon our original \ncommitment. Certainly, if you owe money to a bank, that is a first \npriority over putting money in your savings account.\n  We made these pledges. The people back home know that the best way to \nimprove education using Federal money is to have financial relief from \nthe pressures of IDEA. It should be obvious what our conscience is \ntelling us. We should fully fund the obligations we made back in 1975. \nThat should be our primary priority. We said it over and over again and \nnow we are turning our\n\n[[Page S5992]]\n\nback on our commitment. We say: No, we are going to use it for other \nthings, and we are going to use it for things for which we have not \nalready made a commitment, and that is to help with the construction of \nschools. School construction has always been a state and local \nresponsibility. Fully funding IDEA will allow local communities to fund \ntheir own priorities, including construction.\n  I urge my friends to recognize our commitment to fulfill the promise \nwe made and to use these funds to fund IDEA.\n  Look at these petitions from every single school board in my state. \nEvery school district in the state says that the first thing we should \ndo is fulfill our promise to fully fund IDEA.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 4 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just heard my friend from Vermont say some magical \nwords with which I totally agree. I wrote them down as he said them: \n``Take budget surpluses and meet our commitments.'' I agree with that.\n  Do you know what? Just this week we now found out we are going to \nhave $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years we didn't know we were going \nto have in surplus.\n  If my friend from Vermont wants to offer an amendment to fully fund \nIDEA, and to take it out of the surpluses, I am with him 100 percent of \nthe way because he would be right on. The Senator just said that: \n``Let's take our budget surpluses.'' I agree with that.\n  That is not what my friend is doing. He is taking it out of school \nmodernization and construction.\n  I say to my friend from Vermont, if you want to rewrite the amendment \nand take it out of surpluses in the future, I am with you.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If I may respond.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Sure.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I say to the Senator, as you know, I have voted that \nway. In fact, I offered the amendment to the budget resolution that \nwould have done that. My amendment would have made mandatory money \navailable for IDEA. But it was rejected. I agree with my friend from \nIowa that we should dedicate more of the surplus to fully funding IDEA. \nIt is the right route, but we were turned down by three votes. It \nfailed.\n  Now I am trying to use a different route. I am interested in offering \nan amendment that I hope will be supported by a simple majority of this \nbody. An amendment which funds education using the surplus is in \nviolation of the budget resolution and must be approved by a sixty vote \nmajority. The Senate has repeatedly voted to reject similar amendments.\n  This amendment is the one that has a chance to succeed in spite of \nthe limitations imposed by the budget resolution. We can take the money \nfrom a brand new program, which we are doing, and shift it over to IDEA \nwhere I believe it ought to be our first priority. That is something we \ncan do on this bill. We can't tap the surplus now, as I tried during \nthe budget resolution. That was turned down.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As the Senator knows, I supported that when he offered \nit.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That was on the budget. This is on appropriations.\n  I say to my friend, offer an amendment. The Senator can offer an \namendment right now to fully fund IDEA and take it out of budget \nsurpluses. I will support him on it right now.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. It will take 60 votes and fail.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Who knows if it will fail? Wouldn't it be nice to try?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Sure. If I fail, you can try. All right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. We should not be taking it out of school construction and \nmodernization--not at all. Our local school districts need this money. \nGo out and talk to your school districts. The people who are paying our \nproperty taxes are getting hit pretty darn hard. Ceilings are falling \ndown. They are leaking. They need this help from the Federal \nGovernment. We have the wherewithal to do it. And that is what we ought \nto stick with.\n  If the Senator wants to offer an amendment to fully fund IDEA, take \nit out of the $1.9 trillion budget surplus--``take it out of the budget \nsurpluses,'' as my friend said, I am in lockstep with him because that \nis what we ought to be doing with that surplus. We ought to be meeting \nthis basic goal of our Federal Government.\n  Of course, while I believe some of the surplus should be invested in \nquality education, we don't need to touch the surplus to meet the goal \nof fully funding IDEA. There are many savings we could achieve that \ncould more than pay for the investment.\n\n  For example, look at Medicare fraud, waste and abuse. While we've cut \nit over the last few years, the HHS IG testified before our \nSubcommittee this March that last year Medicare made $13.5 billion in \ninappropriate payments. Eliminating that waste alone would more than \npay for IDEA. Yet, the House passed Labor-HHS bill actually cuts \nfunding for auditors and investigators. That means we would lose \nhundreds of millions more to fraud and abuse.\n  In addition, I've introduced The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1999 to \npromote greater fiscal responsibility in the Federal government by \neliminating special interest tax loopholes, reducing corporate welfare, \neliminating unnecessary programs, reducing wasteful spending, enhancing \ngovernment efficiency and requiring greater accountability. This bill \nwould result in savings of approximately $20 billion this year and up \nto $140 billion over five years.\n  For example, by enhancing the government's ability to collect \ndefaulted student loans, the bill would save $1 billion over five \nyears. By ending tax deductions for tobacco promotions that entice our \nchildren to smoke, we'd save $10 billion. And by limiting the foreign \ntax credit that allows big oil and gas companies to escape paying their \nfair share of royalties, we'd save about $3.1 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, how much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 1 minute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Good.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 1 minute.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am willing to yield back my 1 minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator from Pennsylvania may want a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa yield back his \nminute?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to see if the chairman wants to say anything.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Vermont believes \nvery deeply about the importance of the IDEA program and the necessity \nand desirability of the Federal Government to fund it.\n  The difficulty is--and we wish we had more funds in the education \nbudget, although this budget has $4.5 billion more than last year, and \n$100 million more than the President's figure--but when it comes out of \nthe construction account, or any other account, they are very carefully \ncalibrated to provide the appropriate balance.\n  The construction account is one of the President's priorities. We \nhave met that, as with class size, subject to the discretion of the \nlocal school boards. If they make a finding they do not need additional \nbuildings or additional teachers, they may use it for what they choose. \nIt may be that they could use it for the purposes articulated by the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont. So it is with reluctance that we \nare opposing his amendment. And I move to table.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3645\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes for debate prior to the \nvote on the Landrieu amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, we would ask the proponent of \nthe amendment to step forward to debate.\n\n[[Page S5993]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Landrieu amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table has already been made on \nthe Landrieu amendment.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I just moved to \ntable the Landrieu amendment, and the Chair advised me a motion had \nalready been made to table. And I might ask, by whom was that made?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania, prior to the \nquorum call, made a motion to table.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the Senator from Pennsylvania, I believe the \nSenator from Pennsylvania was moving to table the Jeffords amendment \nand not the Landrieu amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 7:45, the Landrieu amendment was pending. \nThe motion to table was made.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I believe the hour of 7:45 had not arrived at that point, \nand that Senator Jeffords had made his remarks. I believe the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania was moving to table the Jeffords amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I moved to table, I withdraw the \nmotion and yield to the Senator from Iowa to make a motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, now I understand the Senator from \nLouisiana is here, and she wants a minute. I will make my motion to \ntable after her minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I was under the impression that perhaps \nthe other amendment would go first on the vote, but I thank my \ncolleagues for giving me a moment to get here.\n  I want to object, of course, to the tabling of this amendment. As I \ndescribed earlier, I believe very strongly, as do some others, that \nthis money should be better targeted. That is what this amendment does. \nIt does not add new money to this bill. It simply says, of the money \nthat we are going to spend--whether it is a 20-percent increase that \nSenator Gramm earlier spoke about, or an 8-percent increase--whatever \nthe increase, if we are going to increase funding in this bill, the \nmoney should go to help the poorer children first, the communities \naround this Nation that need the most help, whether they be in rural \nareas or urban areas.\n  Every State will gain. Every State will leave with additional money \nfor title I. The States that need the most help will get that help. \nThat is simply what this amendment does. I object to the tabling.\n  I thank the Senators for granting the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 1 minute has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table Landrieu amendment \nNo. 3645.

We have put the money into construction to meet requests \nwith the proviso that if the local boards do not need it for \nconstruction, or want it, they can use it as they choose. If we had \nadditional funds, I would be delighted to acknowledge Senator Jeffords' \nrequest.

Mr. President, I am extremely pleased we have reached \nan agreement to consider and almost certainly pass H.R. 4762, which \npassed the House last night by an overwhelming vote of 385-39. Tomorrow \nwill be a historic day. For the first time since 1979,\n\n[[Page S5995]]\n\nthe Congress is going to pass a campaign finance reform bill. The bill \nwe are going to pass is by no means a solution to all the problems of \nour campaign finance system, but it is a start--and an important \nstart--because it will close the loophole that was opened at the \nintersection of the tax laws and election laws that allows unlimited \namounts of completely secret contributions to flow into our campaign \nfinance system and influence our elections.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the initial leader on this issue, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for this bill, \nwhich contains nearly identical language to a bill I introduced earlier \nthis session and to an amendment Senators McCain, Feingold, and I \nsponsored to the Defense authorization bill. This bill deals with the \nproliferation of so-called stealth PACs operating under section 527 of \nthe Tax Code. These groups exploit a recently discovered loophole in \nthe tax code that allows organizations seeking to influence federal \nelections to fund their election work with undisclosed and unlimited \ncontributions at the same time as they claim exemption from both \nFederal taxation and the Federal election laws.\n  Section 527 of the Tax Code offers tax exemption to organizations \nprimarily involved in election-related activities, like campaign \ncommittees, party committees and PACs. It defines the type of \norganization it covers as one whose function is, among other things, \n``influencing or attempting to influence the selection, nomination, \nelection, or appointment of any individual to any Federal, State, or \nlocal public office. . . .'' Because the Federal Election Campaign Act, \n(FECA) uses near identical language to define the entities it \nregulates--organizations that spend or receive money ``for the purpose \nof influencing any election for Federal office''--section 527 formerly \nhad been generally understood to apply only to those organizations that \nregister as political committees under, and comply with, FECA, unless \nthey focus on State or local activities or do not meet certain other \nspecific FECA requirements.\n  Nevertheless, a number of groups engaged in what they term issue \nadvocacy campaigns and other election-related activity recently began \narguing that the near identical language of FECA and section 527 \nactually mean two different things. In their view, they can gain \nfreedom from taxation by claiming that they are seeking to influence \nthe election of individuals to Federal office, but may evade regulation \nunder FECA, by asserting that they are not seeking to influence an \nelection for Federal office. As a result--because, unlike other tax-\nexempt groups like 501(c)(3)s and (c)(4)s, section 527 groups do not \neven have to publicly disclose their existence--these groups gain both \nthe public subsidy of tax exemption and the ability to shield from the \nAmerican public the identity of those spending their money to try to \ninfluence our elections. Indeed, according to news reports, newly \nformed 527 organizations pushing the agenda of political parties are \nusing the ability to mask the identities of their contributors as a \nmeans of courting wealthy donors seeking anonymity in their efforts to \ninfluence our elections.\n  Because section 527 organizations are not required to publicly \ndisclose their existence, it is impossible to know the precise scope of \nthis problem. The IRS's private letter rulings, though, make clear that \norganizations intent on running what they call issue ad campaigns and \nengaging in other election-related activity are free to assert Section \n527 status, and news reports provide specific examples of groups taking \nadvantage of these rulings. Roll Call reported the early signs of this \nphenomenon in late 1997, when it published an article on the decision \nof Citizens for Reform and Citizens for the Republic Education Fund, \ntwo Triad Management Services organizations that ran $2 million issue \nad campaigns during the 1996 elections, to switch from 501(c)(4) \nstatus, which imposes limits on a group's political activity, to 527 \nstatus after the 1996 campaigns. A more recent Roll Call report \nrecounted the efforts of a team of GOP lawyers and consultants to shop \nan organization called Citizens for the Republican Congress to donors \nas a way to bankroll up to $35 million in pro-Republican issue ads in \nthe 30 most competitive House races. And Common Cause's recent report \nUnder The Radar: The Attack of The ``Stealth PACs'' On Our Nation's \nElections offers details on 527 groups set up by politicians, \nCongressmen J.C. Watts and Tom DeLay industry groups; the \npharmaceutical industry-funded Citizens for Better Medicare; and \nideological groups from all sides of the political spectrum, the Wyly \nBrothers' Republicans for Clean Air, Ben & Jerry's Business Leaders for \nSensible Priorities and a 527 set up by the Sierra Club. The advantages \nconferred by assuming the 527 form--the anonymity provided to both the \norganization and its donors, the ability to engage in unlimited \npolitical activity without losing tax-exempt status, and the exemption \nfrom the gift tax imposed on very large donors--leave no doubt that \nthese groups will proliferate as the November election approaches.\n\n  None of us should doubt that the proliferation of these groups--with \ntheir potential to serve as secret slush funds for candidates and \nparties, their ability to run difficult-to-trace attack ads, and their \npromise of anonymity to those seeking to spend huge amounts of money to \ninfluence our elections-- poses a real and significant threat to the \nintegrity and fairness of our elections. We all know that the identity \nof the messenger has a lot of influence on how we view a message. In \nthe case of a campaign, an ad or piece of direct mail attacking one \ncandidate or lauding another carries a lot more weight when it is run \nor sent by a group called ``Citizens for Good Government'' or \n``Committee for our Children'' than when a candidate, party or someone \nwith a financial stake in the election publicly acknowledges \nsponsorship of the ad or mailing. Without a rule requiring a group \ninvolved in elections to disclose who is behind it and where the group \ngets its money, the public is deprived of vital information that allows \nit to judge the group's credibility and its message, throwing into \ndoubt the very integrity of our elections. With this incredibly \npowerful tool in their hands, can anyone doubt that come November, we \nwill see more and more candidates, parties and groups with financial \ninterests in the outcome of our elections taking advantage of the 527 \nloophole to run more and more attack ads and issue more and more \nnegative mailings in the name of groups with innocuous-sounding names?\n  The risk posed by the 527 loophole goes even farther than depriving \nthe American people of critical information. I believe that it \nthreatens the very heart of our democratic political process. Allowing \nthese groups to operate in the shadows pose a real risk of corruption \nand makes it difficult for us to vigilantly guard against that risk. \nThe press has reported that a growing number of 527 groups have \nconnections to--or even have been set up by--candidates and elected \nofficials. Allowing wealthy individuals to give to these groups--and \nallowing elected officials to solicit money for these groups--without \never having to disclose their dealings to the public, at a minimum, \nleads to an appearance of corruption and sets the conditions that would \nallow actual corruption to thrive. If politicians are allowed to \ncontinue secretly seeking money--particularly sums of money that exceed \nwhat the average American makes in a year--there is no telling what \nwill be asked for in return.\n  The bill we are addressing today gives us hope for forestalling the \nconversion of yet another loophole into yet another sinkhole for the \nintegrity of our elections. The bill aims at forcing section 527 \norganizations to emerge from the shadows and let the public know who \nthey are, where they get their money and how they spend it. The bill \nwould require 527 organizations to disclose their existence to the IRS, \nto file publicly available tax returns and to file with the IRS and \nmake public reports specifying annual expenditures of at least $500 and \nidentifying those who contribute at least $200 annually to the \norganization. Although this won't solve the whole problem, at least it \nwill make sure that no group can hide in the shadows as it spends \nmillions to influence the way we vote and who we choose to run this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S5996]]\n\n  Opponents of this legislation claim that our proposal infringes on \ntheir First Amendment rights to free speech and association. Nothing in \nour bills infringes on those cherished freedoms in the slightest bit. \nTo begin with, the Supreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo made \nabsolutely clear that Congress may require organizations whose major \npurpose is to elect candidates to disclose information about their \ndonors and expenditures.\n  Even without that opinion, the constitutionality of this bill would \nbe clear for an entirely different reason. And that is that this bill \ndoes not prohibit anyone from speaking, nor does it force any group \nthat does not currently have to comply with FECA or disclose \ninformation about itself to do either of those things. Instead, the \nbill speaks only to what a group must do if it wants the public subsidy \nof tax exemption--something the Supreme Court has made clear no one has \na constitutional right to have. As the Court explained in Regan versus \nTaxation with Representation of Washington, 461 U.S. 540, 544, 545, 549 \n(1983), ``[b]oth tax exemptions and tax-deductibility are a form of \nsubsidy that is administered through the tax system,'' and \n``Congressional selection of particular entities or persons for \nentitlement to this sort of largesse is obviously a matter of policy \nand discretion . . .'' Under this bill, any group not wanting to \ndisclose information about itself or abide by the election laws would \nbe able to continue doing whatever it is doing now--it would just have \nto do so without the public subsidy of tax exemption conferred by \nsection 527.\n  Let me address one final issue: that it is somehow wrong to apply \nthis bill to 527s but not to other tax exempt groups. I believe deeply \nin the cleansing tide of disclosure, whether the contributing \norganization involved is a labor union, a business association, a for-\nprofit company or a tax-exempt organization. For that reason, I worked \nhard with a bipartisan bicameral group of reformers to come up with a \nfair proposal requiring across the board disclosure from all \norganizations that engage in election activity. I thought we had a good \nproposal, but we were unable to get enough support for it to see it \npass the House at this time. We should continue to work to enact such \ndisclosure, but we cannot let that goal stand in the way of passing \nthis urgently needed legislation now, because there are real \ndifferences between 527 organizations and other tax exempts, and these \ndifferences justify closing the loophole, even if we can't enact \nbroader reform.\n  First and foremost, section 527 organizations are different because \nthey are the only tax-exempts that exist primarily to influence \nelections. That is not my characterization. That is the statutory \ndefinition. 527s are not lobbying organizations. They are not public-\ninterest issue organizations. They are not labor organizations or \nbusiness organizations. They are election organizations, plain and \nsimple. You can't say the same about the AFL-CIO or the Chamber of \nCommerce, or Handgun Control or the NRA, whose primary purpose is to \nadvocate a policy position or to represent specific constituencies. So \nI say to anyone who claims these groups are just like other tax-\nexempts, ``Read the tax code.''\n  Just as importantly, there is a greater need for improved disclosure \nby 527 organizations than there is for disclosure by other tax exempts. \nWhen the AFL or the Chamber of Commerce runs an ad, we know exactly who \nis behind it and where their money came from: union member dues in the \ncase of the AFL, and business member dues in the case of the Chamber. \nThese groups provide the basic information the public needs to evaluate \nthe motivation of the messenger. The absolute opposite is the case with \n527s. The public can't know what hidden agenda may lie behind the \nmessage because so many 527s have unidentifiable names and are funded \nby sources no one knows anything about.\n  In the best of all possible worlds, all money supporting election-\nrelated activity would be disclosed. But we should not allow our \ninability to achieve that goal now to stand in the way of closing the \nmost egregious abuse of our hard-won campaign laws that we have seen \nduring this election cycle. We all agree the American people have an \nabsolute right to know the identity of those trying to influence their \nvote. So why let another day go by allowing these self-proclaimed \nelection groups to operate in the shadows. Let's work together, across \nparty lines, to close the 527 loophole.\n  We have become so used to our campaign finance system's long, slow \ndescent into the muck that it sometimes is hard to ignite the kind of \noutrage that should result when a new loophole starts to shred the \nspirit of yet another law aimed at protecting the integrity of our \nsystem, but this new 527 loophole should outrage us, and we must act to \nstop it. On June 8, a bipartisan majority of the Senate said that we \nstand ready to do so when we adopted nearly this precise language as an \namendment to the Defense authorization bill. An overwhelming majority \nof the House of Representatives did the same when it passed this bill \non June 28. We cannot retreat from what we have already said we are \nready to do. We must pass this bill now.\n  I am thrilled to support this bill. I pay appropriate tributes to \nSenators McCain and Feingold for their principled and persistent \nleadership of this movement to bring some sanity, openness, limits, and \ncontrol back to our campaign finance laws. I have been honored to work \nwith them in the front lines of this effort.\n  This is a turning point. The campaign finance laws of America adopted \nafter Watergate say very clearly that individuals cannot give more than \n$2,000 to a campaign. Corporations and unions are prohibited by law \nfrom giving anything. Yet we know that unlimited contributions have \nbeen given by individuals, corporations, and unions, but at least that \nsoft money, if anyone can say anything for it, is fully disclosed.\n  In this cycle, we have seen increasing use of the most egregious \nviolation of the clear intention of our campaign finance laws: So-\ncalled 527 organizations that not only invite unlimited contributions \nfrom corporations, unions, and individuals, but keep them a secret.\n  Finally, we have come to a point in the abuse of our campaign finance \nlaws that Members can no longer defend the indefensible. This is a \nvictory for common sense, for our democracy, for the public's right to \nknow. It has value in itself. But I hope it will also be a turning \npoint that will lead us to further reform of our campaign finance laws.\n  I will say this: In the battle that has brought us to the eve of this \nvictory--that we will enjoy tomorrow, I am confident--we have put \ntogether a broad bipartisan, bicameral group committed to cleaning up \nour election laws, our campaign finance laws.\n  I hope and believe the debate tonight and the vote tomorrow are the \nbeginning of finally returning some limitation, some sanity, some \ndisclosure, some public confidence to our campaign finance laws.\n  I thank the Chair and thank the leaders in this effort--Senator \nMcCain and Senator Feingold--and am proud to walk behind them in this.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am delighted to yield 4 minutes to our fearless \nleader on this issue, the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that we are about to pass and send to the \nPresident the first piece of campaign finance legislation in 21 long \nyears. This bill is simple, just, and the right thing to do in order to \nensure that our electoral system is not further debased.\n  My friend from Wisconsin and my friend from Connecticut have \ndescribed the details of the bill. I just want to point out again that \nmaking these requirements a contingency for certain tax credit status \nensures that these requirements are clearly constitutional. The \nConstitution guarantees freedom of speech and association, not an \nentitlement to tax-exempt status. Further, because of the simplicity of \nthis approach, no vagueness problems will arise and compliance will be \neasy.\n  What could be more American? What could be more democratic?\n  Before I go further, I want to take a moment to thank my colleagues \nin arms who fought so hard to bring this issue forward. I thank Senator \nSnowe and Senator Levin for their hard work.\n\n[[Page S5997]]\n\nI thank my colleagues from the House: Congressmen Chris Shays, Marty \nMeehan, Mike Castle, Lindsey Graham, Amo Houghton, and others. Without \ntheir courage to stand up and demand to do what is right, we would not \nbe here tonight and on the verge of the vote tomorrow.\n  I especially thank Senators Feingold and Lieberman. Senator Lieberman \nwas the author of legislation mandating 527 disclosure. It was his bill \nthat served as the basis for this debate. And, of course, I must again \nthank Senator Feingold for all the courage he has shown in fighting for \nreform at any cost. I sincerely appreciate his efforts.\n  Just yesterday, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly voted in \nfavor of this modest reform by a vote of 385-39. I hope the Senate vote \nwill be equally overwhelming.\n  Would I have liked to accomplish more? Absolutely. Will I continue \nthe fight, along with my good friend from Wisconsin, to enact more \nsweeping reform? I absolutely promise to do so. Will we continue to do \nwhatever is necessary to restore the public's confidence in an \nelectoral system perceived by many, if not most, to be corrupt? You can \nbe assured of it.\n  But tomorrow--I say to all those across this great land who want \nreform--will be a great first step. It will, indeed, be a great day for \ndemocracy and a government accountable to the governed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes of our time to the \nother co-initiator of this issue, Senator Levin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first, I commend the real leaders in this \neffort, Senators McCain and Feingold. They have been extraordinary in \ntheir tenacity. We look forward to their continuing tenacity to close \ntwo egregious loopholes--the one we are closing through this bill, and \nthe other one is the soft money loophole.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for his leadership in terms of the 527 \nloophole itself. We are about to take a step on a long journey. It is a \njourney to bring back some limits on campaign contributions. Those \nlimits have been destroyed by two loopholes: The soft money loophole \nand the so-called 527 loophole.\n  We are about to shed some light, pour some sunshine on the 527 \nloophole. And the public will respond, I believe, when they see just \nhow egregious this loophole is. When the disclosure required by this \nbill becomes law--as it will--the public will respond to the unlimited \ncontributions which are also hidden. That disclosure, I believe, will \nlead to the closure of this loophole. And for that, we commend the \nleaders in this effort.\n  It is an ongoing struggle. It can only be said to be successful when \nthe soft money loophole is closed, and when the 527 loophole is not \njust brought out into the sunshine but, hopefully, when it shrivels \naway and is closed because the public wants the restoration of limits \non campaign contributions. They want them disclosed, but they want them \nlimited.\n  We have taken the important step of disclosure relative to one of \nthose loopholes, and for that we have to thank Senators McCain, \nFeingold, and Lieberman. I very much express the gratitude of a \nbipartisan coalition to all of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to make just a few \ncomments about the legislation that is before the Senate.\n  First, everyone in the Senate supports disclosure by any group that: \ncontributes to a federal candidate, or expressly advocates the election \nor defeat of a federal candidate. And, I might add that currently every \norganization set up under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code that \ncontributes to federal candidates, or expressly advocates the election \nor defeat of a federal candidate does, in fact, publicly disclose their \ncontributions and expenditures.\n  So, let's be clear: nearly every 527 organization in America publicly \ndiscloses its donors and its expenditures.\n  Second, the narrow legislation before this body would target a \nhandful of tax-exempt organizations established under section 527 of \nthe tax code that do not make contributions to candidates, or engage in \nexpress advocacy, and thus, are not required to publicly disclose \ncontributors or expenditures.\n  Although these 527 groups are small and few, the constitutional \nquestions are real. The caselaw demonstrates that there are serious \nquestions as to whether the government can require public donor \ndisclosure of groups that are not engaging in express advocacy. In \nfact, the Supreme Court has rejected public disclosure of membership \nlists and contributors to issue groups as a violation of the First \nAmendment in landmark cases like Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 80 \n(1976) and NAACP v. Alabama, 357 U.S. 449, 462 (1958). And, less than \ntwo weeks ago, yet another federal court--the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit--struck down an attempt to regulate \ngroups that do not engage in express advocacy. I would like to have two \nitems printed in the Record that explain in detail the constitutional \nconcerns with this legislation. The first item is a letter from the \nAmerican Civil Liberties Union, and the second item is testimony by \nelection law expert, James Bopp, Jr., of the James Madison Center for \nFree Speech. Mr. Bopp's testimony from a Senate Rules Committee hearing \nthis year cites a long string of court decisions striking down this \ntype of regulation over the past quarter century.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the material be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: I am writing to communicate the American \n     Civil Liberties Union's opposition to the McCain Amendment \n     No. 3214 concerning disclosure by organizations covered by \n     Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code.\n       The American Civil Liberties Union supports certain methods \n     of disclosure for tax exempt issue organizations and for \n     organizations that engage in express advocacy. However, \n     different methods of disclosure are appropriate for express \n     advocacy groups that are not appropriate for groups that \n     engage in issue advocacy. It is appropriate to require a 527 \n     group to provide the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) with the \n     name and address of the organization, the purpose of the \n     organization and other information that is now required of \n     other issue advocacy organizations such as 501(c)(4)s, \n     501(c)(3)s and 501(c)(5)s.\n       However, it is certainly inappropriate and unconstitutional \n     to require issue organizations to report donor lists and \n     membership lists to the IRS, as they would be required to do \n     under the McCain Amendment. This is not about protecting \n     secrecy, this is about preserving the rights of all people to \n     express their opinions on issues without requiring them to \n     report to the government in order to do so. By participating \n     in groups that elevate a particular issue, citizens are \n     exercising their much cherished free speech rights. It would \n     greatly chill free expression if the IRS or the Federal \n     Election Commission (FEC) required donor lists of groups that \n     represent unpopular viewpoints, minority viewpoints or views \n     that are highly critical of government policies.\n\n\n                        this is not a new issue\n\n       Three years after it passed the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act of 1971, Congress amended the Act to require the \n     disclosure to the Federal Election Commission of any group or \n     individual engaged in: any act directed to the public for the \n     purpose of influencing the outcome of an election, or . . . \n     [who] publishes or broadcasts to the public any material \n     referring to a candidate (by name, description, or other \n     reference . . . setting forth the candidate's position on any \n     public issue, [the candidate's] voting record, or other \n     official acts . . . or [is] otherwise designed to influence \n     individuals to cast their votes for or against such \n     candidates or to withhold their votes from such candidates.\n       Such issue advocacy groups would have been required to \n     disclose to the FEC in the same manner as a political \n     committee or PAC. They would have to make available every \n     source of funds that were used in accomplishing such acts. \n     This unconstitutional regulatory scheme is the template for \n     the McCain amendment now before you.\n       The ACLU challenged this provision of the 1974 amendments \n     as part of the Buckley v. Valeo case. When the challenge came \n     before the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, the law \n     was unanimously struck down because it was vague and imposed \n     an undue burden on groups engaged in activity that is, and \n     should be, protected by the First Amendment. The DC Circuit \n     Court ruling stated: to be sure, any discussion of important \n     public questions can possibly expert some influence\n\n[[Page S5998]]\n\n     on the outcome of an election . . . But unlike contributions \n     and expenditures made solely with a view to influencing the \n     nomination or election of a candidate, issue discussions \n     unwedded to the cause of a particular candidate hardly \n     threaten the purity of the elections. Moreover, and very \n     importantly, such discussions are vital and indispensable to \n     a free society and an informed electorate. Thus the interest \n     group engaging in nonpartisan discussions ascends to a high \n     plane, while the governmental interest in disclosure \n     correspondingly diminishes.\n       Because of the Court's unanimous and unambiguous ruling, \n     the FEC did not even attempt to appeal this aspect of the \n     courts ruling concerning issue group regulation disclosure, \n     and that defective section of the Act was allowed to die.\n       The ACLU urges members of the Senate to vote against \n     Amendment No. 3214, the McCain Amendment on 527 group \n     disclosure.\n           Sincerly,\n                                                  Laura W. Murphy,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Testimony of James Bopp, Jr., April 26, 2000, Senate Rules Committee\n\n\nthe reformers' attack on issue advocacy has another front--section 527 \n                      of the internal revenue code\n\n       There is another bill that I want to discuss today that is \n     also part of the unrelenting attack on citizens' ability to \n     participate in public discourse. Not content with a frontal \n     assault through the FECA, reformers have turned their \n     attention to the Internal Revenue Code. HR 4168 proposes to \n     amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require that \n     federal election rules apply to groups formed under Sec. 527 \n     of the Internal Revenue Code.\n       Before I talk about the specific effects of House \n     Resolution 4168, some clarifying background information about \n     Sec. 527 and the FECA is necessary. Section 527 was added to \n     the Internal Revenue Code in 1974 to resolve long-standing \n     issues relating to inclusion of political contributions in \n     the gross income of candidates. Drafters were concerned that \n     candidates would use their campaign committees to earn \n     investment income free of tax, and so a tax on investment \n     earnings became the major limitation on the exemption \n     available under Sec. 527.\n       Section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code provides an \n     exemption from corporate income taxes for political \n     organizations that are organized primarily to intervene in \n     political campaigns. Thus, to qualify for the tax exemption, \n     the organization must be a ``political organization'' that \n     meets both the organizational and operational tests under \n     Sec. 527.\n       A ``political organization'' is a party, committee, \n     association, fund, or other organization organized primarily \n     for the purpose of directly or indirectly accepting \n     contributions or making expenditures for an exempt function \n     activity. Section 527(e)(1) of the Code defines the term \n     ``exempt function'' to mean, in relevant part, the function \n     of influencing or attempting to influence the selection, \n     nomination, election, or appointment of any individual to any \n     Federal, State, or local public office or office in a \n     political organization, or the election of Presidential or \n     Vice-Presidential electors, whether or not such individual or \n     electors are selected, nominated, elected or appointed. A \n     ``political organization'' meets the organizational test if \n     its articles of incorporation provide that the primary \n     purpose of the organization is to influence elections. Under \n     the operational test, a ``political organization'' must \n     primarily engage in activities that influence elections but \n     it need not do so exclusively.\n       The IRS has issued no precedential guidance in this area, \n     but it has issued private letter rulings which provide an \n     indication of what constitutes evidence of political \n     intervention for purposes of Sec. 527. Activities that are \n     intended to influence, or attempt to influence, the election \n     of individuals to public office may include encouraging \n     support among the general public for certain issues, policies \n     and programs being advocated by candidates and Members of \n     Congress.\n       Thus, the IRS has found that expenditures for issue \n     advocacy could qualify as intervention in a political \n     campaign within the meaning of Sec. 527(e)(2). Moreover, the \n     distinction between issue advocacy activities that were \n     educational within the meaning of Sec.  501(c)(3) and issue \n     advocacy activities that were not educational and \n     therefore qualified as Sec. 527(e)(2) expenditures \n     intended to influence the outcome of elections, was not \n     based on major differences in the nature of conduct of the \n     activities. The IRS instead pointed to the targeting of \n     the activities to particular areas, the timing of them to \n     coincide with the election, and the selection of issues \n     based on an agenda. As will be discussed in a moment, \n     these factors have been rejected by the courts as \n     irrelevant to any determination of whether an \n     organization's speech, regardless of its tax status, is \n     express advocacy.\n       In a recent private letter ruling to an organization under \n     Sec. 527, made public on June 25, 1999, the IRS determined \n     that a wide range of programs qualified as ``exempt \n     functions'' for a Sec. 527 political organization. The IRS \n     found a political nexus even though some of the materials to \n     be distributed, and techniques to be used, resembled issue \n     advocacy and other materials and techniques often used in the \n     past by charitable organizations without violating section \n     501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, because the \n     materials and techniques were designed to serve a primarily \n     political purpose and would be inextricably linked to the \n     political process, the political nexus was substantiated.\n       Of particular interest is the IRS's conclusion that voter \n     education, which may include dissemination of voter guides \n     and voting records, grass roots lobbying messages, telephone \n     banks, public meetings, rallies, media events, and other \n     forms of direct contact with the public, can be apolitical \n     intervention when it links issues with candidates. Whether an \n     organization is participating or intervening, directly or \n     indirectly, in a political campaign, however, depends, in the \n     view of the IRS, upon all of the facts and circumstances. \n     Thus, while voter education may be both factual and \n     educational, the selective content of the material, and the \n     manner in which it is presented, is intended to influence \n     voters to consider particular issues when casting their \n     ballots. This intent was seen by the evident bias on the \n     issues, the selection of issues, the language used in \n     characterizing the issues, and in the format. The targeting \n     and timing of the distribution was aimed at influencing the \n     public's judgment about the positions of candidates on issues \n     at the heart of the organization's legislative agenda. These \n     activities are partisan in the sense that they are intended \n     to increase the election prospects of certain candidates and, \n     therefore, would appear to qualify under Sec. 527(e)(2).\n       It is the perceived intersection between the Internal \n     Revenue Code and the FECA that reformers want to regulate. \n     Section 527 organizations must convince the IRS that they are \n     organized and operated for the exempt function of influencing \n     elections as required under Sec.  527(e)(2). However, because \n     the organization is engaged in only issue advocacy and does \n     not make contributions to candidates or engage in express \n     advocacy, the organization is not subject to the FECA. \n     However, H.R. 4168 would treat them as if they engaged in \n     such activities and require them to register as PACs under \n     the FECA.\n       However, the Supreme Court has made it clear that an \n     organization cannot be treated as a PAC because it engages in \n     issue advocacy--which was one of the purposes of the express \n     advocacy test in the first place. The Supreme Court, in one \n     of its most oft-quoted footnotes, has provided an \n     illustrative list of which terms could be ``express words \n     of advocacy:'' ``vote for,' `elect,' `support,' `cast your \n     ballot for,' `Smith for Congress,' `vote against,' \n     `defeat,' `reject.' '' Since the Court's ruling in \n     Buckley, district and federal courts of appeal have \n     followed this strict interpretation of the express \n     advocacy test and have struck down any state or federal \n     regulation purporting to regulate based on intent or \n     purpose to influence an election. These courts have \n     unanimously required express words of advocacy in the \n     communication itself before government may regulate such \n     speech.\n       Furthermore, the organizations ``major purpose'' must be \n     making contributions and express advocacy communications to \n     be treated as a PAC. The FECA defines a ``political \n     committee'' as ``any committee, club, association, or other \n     group of persons which receives contributions aggregating in \n     excess of $1,000 during a calendar year or which makes \n     expenditures aggregating in excess of $1,000 during a \n     calendar year. In Buckley, the U.S. Supreme Court narrowly \n     construed this definition, holding that under the FECA's \n     definition of political committee, an entity is a political \n     committee only if its major purpose is the nomination or \n     election of a candidate.\n       An organization's ``major purpose'' may be evidenced by its \n     public statements of its purpose or by other means, such as \n     its expenditures in cash or in kind to or for the benefit of \n     a particular candidate or candidates. Even if the \n     organization's major purpose is the election of a federal \n     candidate(s), the organization does not become a political \n     committee unless or until it makes expenditures in cash or in \n     kind to support a person who has decided to become a \n     candidate for federal office.\n       Recently, the Fourth Circuit found a definition of \n     ``political committee,'' that included both entities that \n     have as a primary or incidental purpose engaging in express \n     advocacy, and those that merely wish to influence an election \n     (engage in issue advocacy), as being overbroad and \n     unconstitutional. The court found that the definition of \n     ``political committee'' could not encompass groups that \n     engage only in issue advocacy and groups that only \n     incidentally engage in express advocacy.\n       Thus, only an organization that engages primarily in excess \n     advocacy triggers FECA reporting and disclosure requirements. \n     Issue advocacy in the context of electoral politics does not \n     cause an organization to be deemed a political committee. \n     Merely attempting to influence the result of an election is \n     not enough. This classic form of issue advocacy, influencing \n     an election without express words of advocacy, does not cause \n     an entity to be subject to the reporting and disclosure \n     requirements of political committees under the FECA. Only \n     those expenditures that expressly advocate the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate do so.\n       Thus, it is perfectly consistent that an organization may \n     qualify for exemption under Sec. 527 of the Internal Revenue \n     Code yet not qualify as a PAC under the FECA. Tax law \n     provides for exemption from corporate tax and a shield \n     against disclosure of contributors. Election law mandates \n     PACs to report all their contributors and expenses, subjects \n     them to contribution limits, and prohibits\n\n[[Page S5999]]\n\n     them from receiving corporate or labor union contributions. \n     These burdens on a PAC cannot be constitutionally applied to \n     an issue advocacy organization.\n       Therefore, as discussed above, Sec. 527 casts a wider net \n     than does the FECA. The FECA bases its requirements on \n     narrowly defined activities, not on tax status. Thus, \n     activities deemed political by the Internal Revenue Service, \n     for purposes of determining tax exempt status, are \n     not considered ``political'' under the FECA when there is \n     no express advocacy of the election or defeat of a federal \n     candidate.\n       With this background of how the provisions of Sec. 527 and \n     the FECA work, it is apparent that the reformers are yet \n     again attempting to regulate citizen participation in the \n     form of protected issue advocacy. As a result of the IRS's \n     amorphous definitions of ``social and welfare activities'' \n     and ``political intervention,'' many Sec. 501(c)(4) \n     organizations are now forced to organize under Sec. 527 for \n     tax purposes. In fact, the Christian Coalition has filed suit \n     against the IRS challenging its overbroad interpretation of \n     what is political intervention which caused it to be denied \n     its Sec. 501(c)(4) exemption.\n       House Resolution 4168, however, would require issue \n     advocacy organizations exempt under Sec. 527 to be treated as \n     PACs under the FECA. However, it is unconstitutional to \n     require issue advocacy groups to register as PACs. What the \n     government may not do directly, it may also not do indirectly \n     by bootstrapping onto the Internal Revenue Code a requirement \n     of ``political committee'' registration and reporting \n     requirements. In other words, Congress may not condition a \n     tax exempt status on reporting and disclosure requirements of \n     issue advocacy when it may not constitutionally require in \n     the first instance.\n       The fact that issue advocacy groups may engage in \n     activities which influence an election, or even admit that \n     their purpose is to influence an election, is totally \n     irrelevant to the analysis. What is pertinent is whether \n     these groups engage in any express advocacy. The Buckley \n     Court left intact, as constitutionally protected, speech that \n     influences an election.\n       To make it clear that speech that only influences an \n     election, but does not contain express words of advocacy, is \n     completely free from regulation, the Supreme court explicitly \n     stated this both positively and negatively. First, the Court \n     stated that ``[s]o long as persons and groups eschew \n     expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to \n     spend as much as they want to promote the candidate and his \n     views. Second, the Court explained that the FECA did ``not \n     reach all partisan discussion for it only requires disclosure \n     of those expenditures that expressly advocate a particular \n     election result.\n       Therefore, in order to protect speech, especially speech \n     that may influence an election, the Court drew a bright-line \n     so that the speaker would know exactly when he crossed into \n     regulable territory--the express advocacy realm. Anything on \n     the other side of the line, speech that may influence an \n     election, whether intentionally or not, was to be protected \n     from government regulation so as to promote the free \n     discussion of issues and candidates. Thus, speech free from \n     explicit words of advocacy, whether made with the intent to \n     influence an election or not, is perfectly appropriate and \n     legitimate.\n       This is not to say that Congress is completely without \n     power to lawfully regulate Sec. 527 organizations. The Joint \n     Committee on Taxation's recommendation that Sec. 527 \n     organizations should be required to disclose tax returns \n     (except for donor information) would create parity between \n     Sec. 527 organizations and Sec. 501(c)(3) and Sec. 501(c)(4) \n     organizations. However, any disclosure that goes beyond the \n     public disclosure of tax returns violates the constitutional \n     protection of issue advocacy.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senate has precious few legislative days this year \nto finish the important business of the American people, and there is \nno time for a meaningful debate on campaign finance reform. I think \nthat even my colleagues on the other side would concede that there are \nnot sixty votes on substantive issues like the antiquated hard money \nlimits and the soft money question. In fact, after two weeks of \ndiscussions, neither the House nor the Senate could cobble together a \nmajority for broad and meaningful disclosure.\n  But I do commend Senator Gordon Smith for his efforts to find a \nreasonable middle ground. His bill, the Tax-Exempt Political Disclosure \nAct, sought a compromise between the McCain-Lieberman 527-only bill and \nthe broad bill reported out of the House Ways and Means Committee that \nwent so far as to cover tax-exempt social welfare organizations like \nthe AARP, the NAACP, and the Disabled American Veterans.\n  The Smith bill targeted the key tax-exempt groups in America: labor \nand business organizations set up under sections 501(c)(5) and (c)(6) \nof the tax code, like the Chamber of Commerce, the Teamsters and the \nNational Education Association. Recent news stories underscored the \nneed for meaningful disclosure of tax-exempt labor and business \norganizations. Documents reviewed by the Associated Press demonstrate \nthat the National Education Association has spent millions of tax-\nexempt dollars to influence elections while simultaneously reporting to \nthe IRS that the organization has spent no money on political \nactivities. This gross reporting disparity has prompted the filing of \nformal complaints with the IRS and the Federal Election Commission \nagainst the NEA. And, I think we all can agree to the obvious: neither \nthe National Education Association nor any labor union will be covered \nor affected in any way by this legislation. They can continue to spend \nmillions of dollars on political activity with no meaningful \ndisclosure.\n\n  Nevertheless, I have chosen to allow this matter to move forward for \na vote without offering amendments or extended debate. The Senate needs \nto focus on the important business of the American people and return to \nour first priority of ensuring that all of our appropriation bills are \npassed on time.\n  I plan to vote against this legislation because I believe that the \nbest and most constitutionally sound solution is to require 527 issue \nadvocacy organizations to file public returns with the IRS similar to \nthose filed by issue advocacy organizations organized under section \n501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. Such public returns would \ninclude, among other things: the name and address of the organization, \nincluding an electronic mailing address; the purpose of the \norganization; the names and addresses of officers, highly-compensated \nemployees, members of its Board of Directors, a contact person and a \ncustodian of records; and the name and address of any related entities.\n  I also would require the Secretary of the Treasury to make this \ninformation publicly available on the Internet within 5 business days \nafter receiving the information. However, Mr. President, I would not \ncross the constitutional line of requiring that the organizations' \nconfidential donor lists be made public.\n  Again, Mr. President, I think this is an important debate, but \nrespectfully disagree with my colleagues on the constitutional \npropriety of requiring public disclosure of confidential donor lists \nfor groups that do not contribute to federal candidates or engage in \nexpress advocacy.\n  With that, I yield back the remaining amount of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky said that \nnearly every 527 publicly discloses their contributors and \nexpenditures. I don't know how the Senator from Kentucky can make that \nclaim because he doesn't know. No one knows how many 527 organizations \nthere are. They currently don't file any reports whatsoever, so we \ncan't know that. They currently don't even notify the IRS that they \nexist. That is exactly what this bill will change.\n  I now yield 2 minutes to one of our strongest allies on this issue \nand on the entire issue of campaign finance reform, the Senator from \nNew York, Mr. Schumer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for yielding.\n  Both to the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin, \nkudos on their exemplary leadership on this issue and the general issue \nof campaign finance reform, as well as my colleagues from Connecticut, \nMichigan, and Maine who have been such reform leaders.\n  A Chinese proverb says that a trip of 1,000 miles begins with the \nfirst step. This is the first step, but we do have 1,000 miles to go. \nIt is the first step, and it is a significant one. Until this proposal \nbecomes law, organized crime, drug lords, and other various bottom \ncrawlers in society unknown to any of us could influence the political \nprocess by contributing money and running ads that we all know are, for \nall practical purposes, political ads. To have no disclosure, let alone \nno limits, on these kinds of activities puts a dagger in the heart of \ndemocracy. Sunlight is the disinfectant we need. Sunlight is the \ndisinfectant provided by this provision. It does no less; it does no \nmore.\n  We have many more miles to go. The distinction between hard money and\n\n[[Page S6000]]\n\nsoft money, the fact that these days candidates don't have to worry \nabout a $1,000 limit because soft money is so prevalent and so \navailable and because of, in my judgment, recent misguided Supreme \nCourt decisions that allow political parties to do political ads--we \nall know they are political ads; simply because they don't say vote for \ncandidate X, they are not classified as political ads--makes our system \na joke, makes our system a mockery.\n  What we are doing here is simply returning to the status quo of a \nyear ago before these 527 accounts were founded. We have a very long \nway to go. The only confidence I have is that we do have leaders such \nas the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin to help us \nmove forward.\n\n  If we were to rest on our laurels, if we were to think we had now \ncleaned up the system because we passed this legislation, we would be \nsadly mistaken. It is very much need because this is the part of \ncampaign finance that remains under a rock with all the worms and \ncritters crawling undiscovered. At the same time, we need to go much, \nmuch further. I will be glad to follow the banner of Senators McCain \nand Feingold to try to help make that a reality.\n  I thank the Chair and the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \neverything he has done on this matter. I ask the Chair how much time \nremains on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me note that there is no \nconstitutional argument against this bill because these organizations \nreceive a tax exemption. The public is entitled to this information in \nexchange for the substantial tax benefit these groups receive. I am so \npleased this matter will be demonstrated in the courts because this \nbill is going to actually become law.\n  I would like to use the remaining time to remind my colleagues and \nthe public of the scope of the loophole we are about to get rid of. \nThis has been called the ``mother of all loopholes.'' If left \nunchecked, literally millions upon millions of dollars originating from \nforeign governments, foreign companies, and even, theoretically, \norganized crime could be spent in our elections without a single \nsolitary bit of reporting and accountability--totally secret money in \nunlimited amounts, and no one would know where the money was coming \nfrom. It is hard to imagine anything that would be worse for the health \nof our democracy.\n  We have a chart here containing, word for word, what is essentially \nan advertisement by one of these groups. It is as plain as day. This \ngroup solicits contributions from extremely wealthy individuals and \ngroups. Contributions, it says, can be given in unlimited amounts. They \ncan be from any source. They are not political contributions and are \nnot a matter of public record. They are not reported to the FEC, to any \nState agency, or to the IRS.\n  Today, we are wiping out what might be the most important part of \nthis advertisement, that the contributions are not a matter of public \nrecord. From now on, these groups will disclose their contribution to \nthe IRS. The public will be able to see where their money is coming \nfrom and understand what is behind the message.\n  I do want to mention a number of people who have been central to this \neffort. Of course, my friend and colleague, Senator McCain, deserves a \nhuge amount of the credit for putting forward our original amendment to \nthe DOD bill and tenaciously continuing to push until it became law. \nSenators Lieberman and Levin developed the original bill on 527s, \nrecognizing the huge threat these stealth PACs posed. Their work over \nthe past few weeks to make sure we finish the job has been \nextraordinary. Senator Snowe, who has long been concerned about getting \ndisclosure of phony issue ads run in the last days before an election, \nwas a key supporter, as was Senator Schumer and many others. On the \nHouse side, Representative Shays, who is in the Chamber now, as well as \nRepresentatives Meehan, Houghton, Castle, Doggett, and Moore were \ncrucial to getting the bill passed there, over the strong opposition of \nthe House leadership. I am proud of how we worked in a bipartisan and \nbicameral fashion to get the bill done and close this loophole. This \neffort bodes well for the future of campaign finance reform.\n\n  This is my final point, Mr. President. This is not the end of the \nfight, as we have said. It is just the beginning. Now that we have \ncracked the wall of resistance to any reform at all, I think we are \nready to move forward on truly cleaning up the corrupt campaign finance \nsystem. Now that we have disclosure of the unlimited amounts that are \ngoing to outside groups, I think we are ready to address the unlimited \ncontributions from corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals that \nthe soft money loophole permits to be given to the political parties.\n  Mr. President, I should have also mentioned Senator Jeffords, who is \npresent in the Chamber, for his help on this issue.\n  I know that many of my colleagues want to clean up this system and \nare willing to work in good faith to find a way that we can do that.\n  In the few seconds I have remaining, I thank a number of staff for \ntheir incredibly hard work and dedication to the campaign finance issue \nand to this 527 disclosure will. We have not had many wins, and they \nare the ones responsible for keeping us in this fight. Mark Buse, Ann \nChoinere, Lloyd Ator of Senator McCain's staff, Laurie Rubenstein of \nSenator Lieberman's staff, Linda Gustitus with Senator Levin, Jane \nCalderwood and John Richter from Senator Snowe's staff, Andrea LaRue \nwith Senator Daschle, and Bob Schiff of my own staff worked very long \nhours to make sure that we got to this point, and we appreciate all of \ntheir efforts and look forward to future victories together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield back his remaining \ntime?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is before the Senate and open to \namendment. If there be no amendment to be proposed, the question is on \nthe third reading and passage of the bill.\n  The bill (H.R. 4762) was ordered to a third reading and was read the \nthird time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/28/senate-section/article/S6000-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6000-S6003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE DEPARTMENTS OF LABOR, HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, AND EDUCATION, AND \n             RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS, 2001--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that a vote will be \nscheduled on my amendment tomorrow morning. Therefore, I now ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise tonight to offer an amendment that I \nthink goes to the heart of so many of our debates here on the Senate \nfloor regarding education. My amendment would fully fund the Department \nof Education's share of the Interagency Education Research Initiative \n(IERI)--a collaborative effort of the Department of Education's \nresearch arm--the Office of Educational Research and Improvement \n(OERI)--the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the National \nInstitute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). The primary \nobjective of the IERI is to support the development and wide \ndissemination of research-proven, technology-enabled educational \nstrategies that improve K-12 education.\n  We debate many new program ideas here in the Senate that have little \nto no research to back up them up. Members offer new program after new \nprogram in a mad attempt to cure what ails American education. I ask my \ncolleagues, ``wouldn't it be better to know what works before we spend \nbillions of dollars trying out things that may, in fact, not only not \nwork, but harm student achievement?'' Reading is a good example of \nthis. We tried many fads before the scientifically-based research \nevidence came in that you've got to have phonics.\n  As we all know, advances in education, as in most other areas, depend \nin no small part on vigorous and sustained research and development. \nIndeed, state and local policymakers, as well as school level \nadministrators, are clamoring for information about ``what works'' to \nguide their decisions. However, historic investments in such \neducational research have been woefully inadequate, and the small \nfederal investments that have been made through the Department of \nEducation have not always resulted in the high-quality, scientifically \ncredible research that we have come to expect from many other research \nagencies. Much of research that has come out of the Department of \nEducation in years past has been politically driven and not always of \nthe highest quality. IERI is a first step on the road to changing that. \nTeaming up with highly respected research institutions like NSF and \nNICHD, OERI is improving its research processes. In the 1997 PCAST \n``Report to the President on the Use of Technology to Strengthen K-12 \nEducation,'' an advisory panel of technology, business, and education \nleaders strongly urged that a significant Federal research investment \nbe undertaken in education, with a focus on educational technology. The \nreport pointed out that in 1997, we invested less than 0.1 percent of \nthe more than $300 billion spent on K-12 public education each year to \nexamine and improve educational practice; by contrast, the \npharmaceutical industry invests nearly a quarter of its expenditures on \nthe development and testing of new drugs. In addition to the \nPresident's 1997 Technology Advisory Report, the Budget Committee Task \nForce on Education's Interim Report, and this year's Republican Main \nStreet Partnership Paper on ``Defining the Federal Role in Education, A \nRepublican Perspective.'' both call for more spending on Education R \nAt our Budget Committee Task Force on Education hearing on education \nresearch, we learned that one of our main Federally funded research \ninstitutions was operating with a budget that was smaller than what a \nseed company expended in a facility devoted solely to breeding petunias \ndown the road.\n\n  Dr. Robert Slavin, the Co-Director of the Center for Research on the \nEducation of Students Placed At-Risk (CRESPAR), one of the Department \nof Education's research centers, likened our current expenditures in \nfederal education research to health research that was limited to \n``basic research and descriptions of how sick people are, but never \nproduced any cures for anything.'' Additionally, another proponent of \neducation research warns that ``poor research often leaves us with \ninadequately tested and replicated fads, masquerading as innovations, \npenetrating the system, frustrating the teachers, administrators, \nparents and, most importantly, the children, and leaving us all worse \noff than before.'' Unfortunately, it is often difficult to discern good \nresearch from bad.\n  The precursor to the Office of Educational Research and Improvement \n(OERI) was the National Institute of Education (NIE). Modeled after the \nNational Institutes of Health, which is widely respected, the NIE never \nrealized the same success as its role model. A Budget Committee \nEducation Task Force heard in 1998 that progress at OERI was stymied by \ninadequate peer-review processes and a lack of good quality control \nmeasures. Recognizing these problems, OERI--most recently under Dr. \nKent McGuire's leadership--has embarked on a number of promising \nreforms, including an overhaul of its peer review system in partnership \nwith NIH. However, it is clear we must do more.\n  In response to the calls of practitioners and experts, the Federal \ngovernment launched the Interagency Education Research Initiative \n(IERI) in FY1999. The ultimate objective of the IERI is to accelerate \nthe translation of robust research findings into concrete lessons for \neducators to improve student achievement in preK-12 reading, \nmathematics, and science. To achieve this goal, the National Science \nFoundation, Department of Education, and National Institute of Child \nHealth and Human Development are supporting a fundamentally new \ncharacter of research in education that builds on the research \nportfolios of each agency while filling a gap no one agency could \naddress alone. This research features interdisciplinary collaborations \nacross learning-related disciplines, is substantively focused on key \naspects of preK-12 education, and is conducted on a scale large enough \nto learn generalizable lessons about what works and why. Witnesses at \nhearings related to educational research in both the Senate and the \nHouse over the past year (e.g., June 1999 in the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, and October 1999 in the House \nBasic Science Subcommittee) have urged the Congress to build upon and \nsupport the IERI model.\n  Calls for all levels of the educational system to be accountable for \nstudent learning are escalating at the same time that technologies \noffer exciting new ways to help all students meet high standards of \nexcellence. Now more than ever is the time to elevate the role of \nrigorous, peer-reviewed educational research--with a focus on \ntechnology--in addressing the urgent challenges of educational reform. \nWith $30 million in FY1999 funds, the IERI team has already laid the \ngroundwork for this innovative research program with 14 new research \nawards averaging $2 million per year. Another joint program \nsolicitation for $38 million in FY2000 funds has recently been \nreleased. My amendment will fully fund the Department of Education's \nshare in order to continue to grow the IERI to leverage potentially \nvast gains in student achievement with a relatively modest investment \nin finding out ``what works.''\n  Education R is a young discipline. While the taxonomy for medicine \nhas been in development for millennia, engineering for centuries, and \nbiology for a few hundred years, the widespread public education of \nchildren has occurred for barely more than a century. Consequently, \neducation R is even younger than that.\n  The Interagency Education Research Initiative will help expand our \nknowledge base and will be money well spent.\n  The amendment is fully offset, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthis very worthwhile investment in our children's education.\n\n[[Page S6002]]\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, a majority of this body--myself included--\njust voted to table both the Landrieu and Jeffords amendments, each of \nwhich have the laudable goals of increasing funding for disadvantaged \nand special education students. The problem with both amendments is \nthat they rob Peter to pay Paul. Both amendments reduce the amount of \nfunding in Title VI, which has been substantially increased this year. \nThe distinguished Chairman, the Senator from Pennsylvania, has \nindicated that the $2.7 billion allocated for Title VI this year is for \nthe continuation of our class size reduction efforts and for funding, \nfor the first time since the 1950's, a massive school modernization \neffort. The effect of these amendments is simply to reduce the number \nof new teachers schools can hire or reduce the money they'll have \navailable to fix fire code violations or upgrade old schools with new \ntechnology. That's not the answer. What we ought to be doing is making \na greater overall investment in public education.\n  I have co-sponsored a bill to increase the amount of Title I funding \nfrom $8 billion to $12 billion in this year alone, and I have co-\nsponsored a bill that puts us on track to fully fund our federal \ncommitment to IDEA within ten years. Our economically disadvantaged and \nspecial needs students deserve more of a commitment from the federal \nlevel, but they also deserve small class sizes and safe, modern \nschools. It's simply wrong to pit these objectives against each other, \nbecause in the end, our children are the ones that suffer and that is \nwhy I voted to table two amendments that I would otherwise support.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ndisappointment that this bill does not provide $125 million for \nsupportive services for caregivers under the Older Americans Act (OAA). \nAs an appropriator, I understand the difficult funding constraints \nunder which Senator Specter and Senator Harkin operate. However, I also \nknow that providing and funding supportive services for caregivers has \nstrong bipartisan support and would meet a compelling human need.\n  Many of us have had personal experiences caring for parents or other \nloved ones and understand firsthand the stresses and strains caregivers \nface. Last year, the Subcommittee on Aging heard the compelling \ntestimony of Carolyn Erwin-Johnson, a family caregiver in Baltimore, \nMaryland. Ms. Johnson has been caring for her mother who has Multiple \nSclerosis for sixteen years. She left Chicago and her work on a second \nMasters degree to come to Baltimore and care for her mother at home, \nrather than put her mother in a nursing home. She found a community-\nbased care system that was fragmented, underfunded, and overburdened. \nAfter months of frustration and trying to find help, Ms. Johnson took \nto hiring nursing aides off the street and training them to care for \nher mother while she worked a forty hour work week. Even then, she \ncould only afford to pay for eight hours of help when her mother needed \n24-hour care. She and her mother ended up paying on average between \n$17,000 and $20,000 annually in out-of-pocket costs to care for her \nmother at home.\n  Caregiving has taken its toll on Ms. Johnson. Today, she has been \ndiagnosed with two incurable, stress-related illnesses, changed jobs, \nand seen her income drop to levels that mean she can no longer afford \nto hire private aides. Ms. Johnson is helped by the 164 hours of \nrespite care she receives annually from the Alzheimer's Respite Care \nProgram. In the words of Ms. Johnson, ``Respite care programs are the \nkey to the survival and longevity of family caregivers.''\n  Mr. President, currently about 12.8 million adults need assistance \nfrom others to carry out activities of daily living, such as bathing \nand feeding. One in four adults currently provides care for an adult \nwith a chronic health condition. Many caregivers struggle with \ncompeting demands of paid employment, raising a family, and caring for \na parent or other relative. Caregiving can take an emotional, physical, \nmental, and financial toll. A recent study found that on average, \nworkers who take care of older relatives lose $659,139 in wages, \npension benefits, and Social Security over a lifetime. Further, the \nestimated national economic value of informal caregiving was $196 \nbillion in 1997.\n  The National Family Caregiver Support Program, originally proposed by \nthe President, would provide respite care, information and assistance, \ncaregiver counseling, training and peer support, and supplemental \nservices to caregivers and their families. Full funding of $125 million \nwould provide services to about 250,000 families. Senators Daschle, \nGrassley and Breaux, DeWine, and I have all sponsored legislation in \nthis Congress to establish this program. Twenty four Senators joined me \nearlier this year in urging the Labor/HHS Appropriations Subcommittee \nto fully fund these supportive services for caregivers. I know other \ncolleagues of mine have also voiced support for funding these \nworthwhile services. This is truly a step we can take that will meet a \ncompelling human need. It gets behind our Nation's families and helps \nthose who practice self-help.\n  As this bill moves to conference, I strongly urge the conferees to \nre-evaluate the current decision not to fund caregiver support \nservices. As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Aging, I am \nworking with my colleagues on the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee to reauthorize the OAA this year. I hope that we are \nable to reach agreement on outstanding issues to reauthorize the OAA \nthis year. While we are working on reauthorization, I believe that we \nmust also move forward on funding caregiver support services. American \nfamilies are counting on us to act.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr, President, as many of my colleagues are aware, cancer \nhas played a prominent role in my family's history. Some in our \nfamily--me, my wife Priscilla, our daughter Debbie--have been lucky \nenough to have fought cancer and won. Others in our family have not \nbeen so lucky. My father died of esophageal cancer, my mother died of \nkidney cancer and my younger brother Michael died of melanoma at the \nvery young age of thirty-five.\n  As a result, Priscilla and I have become very active in the fight \nagainst cancer and in spreading the message that early detection saves \nlives. It's a part of who we are as a family.\n  And there are other families with their own stories. Michael J. Fox \nand his family are waging war against Parkinson's disease. Mary Tyler \nMoore and her family are fighting diabetes. Christopher Reeve and his \nfamily are searching for a cure to paralysis. And millions of other \nfamilies across the United States are fighting their own battles \nagainst AIDS, sickle-cell anemia, Lou Gehrig's disease, Alzheimer's and \nthe many, many other diseases that take our loved ones away from us.\n  What I've come to realize in my fight against cancer is the crucial \nrole the federal government plays in funding basic medical research at \nthe National Institutes of Health, and how important basic research is \nto finding breakthroughs not just for cancer but for all of the \ndiseases which affect our families.\n  For several years now, doubling funding at NIH has been a primary \ngoal of mine in the Senate. The Federal Government, mainly through the \nNIH, funds about 36 percent of all biomedical research in this country, \nand plays an especially large role in basic research.\n  Recently, the Joint Economic Committee, released a first-of-its kind \nstudy: ``The Benefits of Medical Research and the Role of the NIH,'' \nwhich examines how funding for the NIH cuts the high economic costs of \ndisease, reduces suffering from illness, and helps Americans live \nlonger, healthier lives. And I'd like to take a moment, Mr. President, \nto share with my colleagues some of the findings in this extensive \nreport.\n  According to the JEC, the economic costs of illness in the U.S. are \nhuge--approximately $3 trillion annually, or 31 percent of the nation's \nGDP. This includes the costs of public and private health care \nspending, and productivity losses from illness. Medical research can \nreduce these high costs. But, the NIH is fighting this $3 trillion \nbattle with a budget of $16 billion. That's just half of a percent of \nthe total economic cost of disease in the United States.\n\n  In addition to lowering the economic costs of illness, advances in \nmedical research greatly help people live longer and healthier lives. A \nrecent study found that longevity increases have created ``value of \nlife'' gains to Americans of about $2.4 trillion every year. A\n\n[[Page S6003]]\n\nsignificant portion of these longevity gains stem from NIH-funded \nresearch in areas such as heart disease, stroke and cancer. If just 10 \npercent of the value of longevity increases, $240 billion, resulted \nfrom NIH research, that would mean a return of $15 for every $1 \ninvested in NIH.\n  Also according to the JEC, NIH-funded research helped lead to the \ndevelopment of one-third of the top 21 drugs introduced over the last \nfew decades. These drugs treat patients with ovarian cancer, AIDS, \nhypertension, depression, herpes, various cancers, and anemia. Future \ndrug research holds great promise for curing many diseases and lowering \nthe costs of illness by reducing hospital stays and invasive surgeries. \nIn fact, one study found that a $1 increase in drug expenditures \nreduces hospital costs by about $3.65.\n  We know that past medical advances have dramatically reduced health \ncare costs for such illnesses as tuberculosis, polio, peptic ulcers, \nand schizophrenia. For example, the savings from the polio vaccine, \nwhich was introduced in 1955, still produces a $30 billion savings per \nyear, every year.\n  Medical advances will help cut costs by reducing lost economic output \nfrom disability and premature death. For example, new treatments for \nAIDS--some developed with NIH-funded research--caused the mortality \nrate from AIDS to drop over 60 percent in the mid-1990s, thus allowing \ntens of thousands of Americans to continue contributing to our society \nand economy.\n  And medical research spending isn't just about reducing the enormous \ncurrent burdens of illness. The costs of illness may grow even higher \nif we fail to push ahead with further research. Infectious diseases, in \nparticular, are continually creating new health costs. The recent \nemergence of Lyme disease, E. coli, and hantavirus, for example, show \nhow nature continues to evolve new threats to health. In addition, \ndangerous bacteria are evolving at an alarming rate and grow resistant \nto every new round of antibiotics.\n  This report extensively shows the benefits of medical research and \nreaffirms the enormous benefits we achieve from funding the National \nInstitutes of Health in our fight against disease. But there is still a \nlot more work to be done. I am hopeful my colleagues will take a few \nmoments to look at this report and recognize the important work done by \nthe scientists and researchers at the NIH. It can be read in its \nentirety on the JEC website at: jec.senate.gov.\n  Funding for NIH is really about-- hope and opportunity. The challenge \nbefore us is great, but America has always responded when our people \nare behind the challenge. America landed a man on the moon. We \npioneered computer technology. America won the Cold War. Now it is time \nto win the war against the diseases that plague our society. We have \nthe knowledge. We have the technology. Most important, we have the \nsupport of the American people.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in the effort to double funding for \nthe National Institutes of Health. It's good economic policy, it's good \npublic policy, and most importantly, it's good for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/28/senate-section/article/S6003-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FRIST.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor my friend John \nChafee. On Sunday June 25, 2000, an article appeared in Parade Magazine \nentitled, ``Let Us Salute Those Who Served''. The article chronicled \nJohn's service in the Korean War. I ask that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             He Was The Most Admirable Man I've Ever Known\n\n                            (By James Brady)\n\n       (The author, a Marine who served in the Korean War, \n     remembers his comrades in arms--and one extraordinary young \n     leader in particular.)\n       Is Korea really America's ``forgotten war?''\n       Not if you ask the foot soldiers who fought there, Marines \n     and Army both. How could any infantryman ever forget the \n     ridgelines and the hills, the stunning cold, the wind out of \n     Siberia, the blizzards off the Sea of Japan? How do you \n     forget fighting--and stopping--the Chinese Army, 40 divisions \n     of them against a half-dozen U.S. divisions, plus the Brits \n     and some gallant others? And how can anyone forget the \n     thousands upon thousands of Americans who died there in three \n     years, in that small but bloody war?\n       Korea began 50 years ago today--a brutal, primitive war in \n     what Genghis Khan called ``the land of the Mongols,'' a war \n     in which I served under the most admirable man I've ever \n     known, a 29-year-old Marine captain named John Chafee.\n       Most of us who fought the Korean War were reservists: Some, \n     like me, were green kids just out of college. Others were \n     combat-hardened, savvy veterans blooded by fighting against \n     the Japanese only five years before--men like Chafee, my \n     rifle-company commander, who would become a role model for \n     life. I can see him still on that first November morning, \n     squinting in the sun that bounced off the mountain snow as he \n     welcomed a couple of replacement second lieutenants. Mack \n     Allen and me, to Dog Company. He was tall, lean, ruddy-faced \n     and physically tireless, a rather cool Rhode Islander from a \n     patrician background with a luxuriant dark-brown mustache. \n     ``We're a trifle understrength at the moment,'' he said, a \n     half-smile playing on his face. ``We're two officers short.'' \n     I was too awed to ask what happened to them.\n       Chafee didn't seem to carry a weapon, just a long alpine \n     stave that he used as he loped, his long legs covering the \n     rough ground in great strides. ``Got to stay in the trench \n     from here on,'' he said as he showed us along the front line. \n     This sector of ridge was jointly held by us and the North \n     Koreans, the trenches less than a football field apart. \n     Chafee questioned the Marines we passed--not idle chat but \n     about enemy activity, addressing each man by his last name, \n     the troops calling him ``Skipper.'' No one was uptight in the \n     captain's presence, and the men spoke right up in answering. \n     When enemy infantry are that close, both the questions and \n     answers are important.\n       When I got there as a replacement rifle-platoon leader on \n     Thanksgiving weekend of 1951, the 1st Marine Division was \n     hanging on to a mountainous corner of North Korea along the \n     Musan Ridge, about 3000 feet high. It took us a couple of \n     hours to hike uphill, lugging rifles and packs along a \n     narrow, icy footpath to where the rifle companies were dug \n     in. As fresh meat, not knowing the terrain and nervous about \n     mines, we followed close on the heels of Marines returning to \n     duty after being hit in the hard fighting to take Hill 749 in \n     September. In Korea they didn't send you home with wounds. \n     Not if they could patch you up to fight again. These Marines, \n     tough boys, understandably weren't thrilled to be going back. \n     But they went. Dog Company of the 7th Marine Regiment needed \n     them. There was already a foot of snow on the ground. When I \n     think of Korea, it is always of the cold and the snow.\n       Yet the fighting began in summer on a Sunday morning--June \n     25, 1950--when the Soviet-backed army of Communist North \n     Korea smashed across the 38th Parallel to attack the \n     marginally democratic Republic of Korea with its U.S. trained \n     and equipped (and not very good) army. Early in the war, Gen. \n     Douglas MacArthur had bragged: ``The boys could be home for \n     Christmas,'' But ``the boys' would be in Korea three \n     Christmases--courtesy of the Chinese Army.\n       Every soldier thinks his own war was unique. But Korea did \n     have its moments: proving a UN army could fight: ending \n     MacArthur's career with a farewell address to Congress (``Old \n     soldiers never die. They just fade away. . . . ''): helping \n     elect Eisenhower, who pledged in '52, ``I will go to Korea''; \n     demonstrating that Red China's huge army could be stopped; \n     insulating Japan from attack; and enabling the South Korean \n     economic miracle. But the war's lack of a clear-cut winner \n     and loser may have set the stage for Vietnam.\n       As a junior officer, I had little grasp of such strategic \n     matters. I commanded 40 Marines, combat veterans who had \n     fought both the Chinese and the North Koreans. Captain Chafee \n     led us: Red Philips was his No. 2; Bob Simonis, Mack Allen \n     and I were his three rifle-platoon leaders.\n       Guided by Chafee, I saw my first combat. Mostly it was \n     small firefights, patrols and ambushes, usually by night. I \n     learned about staying cool and not doing stupid things. When \n     darkness fell, we sent patrols through the barbed wire and \n     down the ridgeline across a stream, the Soyang-Gang, trying \n     to grab a prisoner or to kill North Koreans. Meanwhile, they \n     came up Hill 749 and tried to kill us.\n       The second or third night I was there, the Koreans hit us \n     with hundreds of mortar shells, then came swarming against \n     the barbed wire, where our machine guns caught them. At dawn \n     there were six dead Koreans hanging on the wire. Except for \n     Catholic wakes at home, I'd never seen a dead man. That \n     morning we tracked wounded Koreans from their blood in the \n     snow. The following day, a single incoming mortar hit some \n     Marines lazing in the sun. Two died; one lost his legs. I \n     hadn't been in Korea a week.\n       Sergeants like Stoneking, Wooten, and Fitzgerald, and a \n     commanding officer like\n\n[[Page S6004]]\n\n     Chafee, got a scared boy through those early days. When I \n     tripped a mine in deep snow the morning of January 13, 1952, \n     and blew up Sergeant Fitzgerald and myself, the first man I \n     saw as they hauled up out by rope was Captain Chafee. We \n     fought the North Koreans into spring and then, when the snow \n     melted and the Chinese threatened to retake Seoul, the \n     Marines shifted west to fight the Chinese again.\n       In July 1953, the fighting finally ended--not in peace but \n     in an uneasy truce. So uneasy that even today some 35,000 \n     American troops are dug in, defending the same ridgelines and \n     hilltops that we did a half-century ago.\n       If you've seen combat in any war, you have memories. Also a \n     duty to remember absent friends. And if, like me, you become \n     a writer, you have a duty to write about the dead, \n     memorializing them: young men like Wild Horse Callan, off his \n     daddy's New Mexico ranch; Doug Brandlee, the big, red-haired \n     Harvard tackle who wanted to teach; handsome Dick Brennan, \n     who worked in a Madison Avenue ad agency; Mack Allen, the \n     engineer from the Virginia Military Institute, Bob Bjornsen, \n     the giant forest ranger, and Carly Rand of the Rand McNally \n     clan.\n       As the survivors grow older, we stay in touch: Jack Rowe, \n     who won a Navy Cross and lost an eye, teaches school and has \n     10 children; Taffy Sceva, still back-packing in the High \n     Sierra; my pal Bob Simonis, retired as a colonel; Joe Owens, \n     who fought at the ``frozen Chosin'' Reservoir; John \n     Fitzgerald, the Michigan cop, twice wounded on Hill 749. Each \n     of us appreciates how fortunate we are to have fought the \n     good fight and returned. No heroic posturing. Just another \n     dirty job the country wanted done, and maybe a million of us \n     went. If we got lucky, a John Chafee was there to lead us.\n       Chafee later carved out a brilliant political career, \n     including governor of Rhode Island, Secretary of the Navy and \n     four terms as a U.S. Senator from Rhode Island. I had dinner \n     with John and his wife, Ginnie, last fall: a meal, a little \n     wine, laughter and good talk, a few memories. I'm glad we did \n     that. Because John Chafee won't be marking today's \n     anniversary. Last Oct. 24, still serving as a Senator, \n     Captain Chafee died, 57 years after he first left Yale to \n     fight for his country.\n       The funeral was in Providence, and my daughter Fiona, and I \n     drove up. The President and First Lady were there and 51 \n     Senators, as well as Pentagon chief Bill Cohen, the \n     Commandant of the Marine Corps, a marine honor guard, people \n     from Yale and just plain citizens, Chafee's five children and \n     12 grandkids, and a few guys like me who served under him in \n     war. His son Zechariah began the eulogy on a note not of \n     grief but of joyous pride:\n       ``What a man! What a life!''\n       So, when you think today of that small war long ago in a \n     distant country, remember the dead, those thousands of \n     Americans. And the thousands of U.S. troops still there, \n     ready to confront a new invasion. Think too of the Skipper--\n     my friend. Capt. John Chafee.\n\n\n                    the heroic career of john chafee\n\n       I didn't know it at the time, but John Chafee already was a \n     kind of legend when I met him. A college wrestling star, he \n     dropped out of Yale at 19 to join the Marines after Pearl \n     Harbor, fighting on Guadalcanal as a private, then made \n     officers candidate school and fought on Okinawa as a \n     lieutenant. He went back to Yale (and the wrestling team), \n     was tapped by Skull and Bones, the honor society, and took a \n     law degree at Harvard. Then as a married man (to Virginia \n     Coates) with a child on the way, he went back to commanding \n     riflemen in combat. A man with money and connections (his \n     great-grandfather and great-uncle both had served as \n     governor), he never took the easy out.\n       Chafee went on to become governor of Rhode Island, \n     Secretary of the Navy and a four-term Senator--a Republican \n     elected in one of our most Democratic states. He died last \n     Oct. 14.\n\n\n                               in memory\n\n       In the 37 months that the Korean War raged, thousands of \n     Americans died. (For years, the number was thought to be \n     54,000 but recently was revised to 36,900.) More than 8000 \n     are still missing. Yet only in 1995 was a national memorial \n     finally dedicated. It includes a black granite wall with \n     murals and stainless-steel statues of infantrymen slogging up \n     a Korean hill. You can visit it at the National Mall in \n     Washington, D.C.\n       The Korean War began on June 25, 1950, when the Soviet-\n     backed army of North Korea smashed across the 38th Parallel \n     to attack the marginally democratic Republic of Korea. With \n     UN approval, the U.S. intervened, halting the Communists at \n     the Naktong River. Then came Gen. Douglas MacArthur's \n     brilliant end run at Inchon, the recapture of Seoul and the \n     sprint north. But as winter approached, with temperatures at \n     -20 deg.F, about half a million Chinese came south, \n     prolonging the fighting. The war ended with an armistice on \n     July 27, 1953. It was an uneasy truce: Today, 35,000 American \n     troops still are dug in, their weapons pointing north.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/28/senate-section/article/S6004-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6004-S6006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SEPARATING FACTS, FROM PARTISAN SMOKE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Attorney General of the United States \ntestified yesterday for almost 4 hours before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to answer yet more questions about campaign finance \ninvestigations and independent counsel decisions. She did so with her \ntypical candor and integrity.\n  Not willing to settle for the fact that this hearing revealed nothing \nnew, certain Republican Members have today sought to muddy the waters \nand twist the facts. I would like to cut through this political haze \nand set the record straight.\n  These are rumored recommendation to appoint a special counsel.\n  It is not the ``established custom'' and ``practice'' of the \nJudiciary Committee or its subcommittees to announce publicly \nconfidential Justice Department information relating to pending \nmatters. Although Senator Specter did so this past week when he held a \npress conference and spoke on national television about a reported \nrecommendation of the Justice Department's Campaign Finance Task Force \nChief Robert Conrad, that disclosure was highly unusual. Although the \nSenator has characterized this information as obtained by way of \n``official investigation,'' such information nor its source has been \nshared with me or, to my knowledge, with any Democratic Member of the \nCommittee or the Senate.\n  The only public statements of Mr. Conrad were made at a Judiciary \nSubcommittee hearing on June 21, 2000. In response to questions from \nSenator Specter regarding recommendations to the Attorney General with \nrespect to a special prosecutor, Mr. Conrad stated, ``That, I don't \nfeel comfortable discussing in public. I would perceive whether I have \ndone that or not as something that pertains to an ongoing \ninvestigation.'' (Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts, ``Oversight Hearing on 1996 Campaign Finance Investigations''). \nSenator Specter pressed him to discuss the matter in private, to which \nMr. Conrad responded a firm, ``no, I am not suggesting that. I am \nsuggesting that my obligations as a prosecutor would prevent me from \ndiscussing that.''\n  At the Judiciary Committee hearing yesterday, the Attorney General \nalso declined to respond to any questions on recommendations that may \nor may not have been made regarding appointment of a special counsel. \nShe said, ``With respect to the present matter, as I said at the \noutset, I am not going to comment on pending investigations . . . I \nthink it imperative for justice to be done that an investigation be \nconducted without public discussion so that it can be done the right \nway.''\n  Other than the Attorney General and Mr. Conrad's public refusals to \nconfirm or deny the existence of any recommendation, or to reveal the \nsubject matter of any such recommendation, we have only Senator \nSpecter's representation of information purportedly obtained from \nunknown sources and press accounts from unidentified ``government \nofficials'' that Mr. Conrad has made any recommendation to the Attorney \nGeneral about appointment of a special counsel. We have no confirmation \nfrom the principals involved that such a recommendation has actually \nbeen made nor of the subject matter of any such recommendation. Before \nMembers of Congress invite the American public to think the worst about \nthe Vice President and put him in the position of trying to prove his \ninnocence of allegations, which even the anonymous sources have not \ndetailed, we should heed the advise of the Attorney General to ``be \ncareful as you comment that you have the facts.''\n  Despite the fact that the Attorney General has appointed seven \nindependent counsels to investigate matters involving the President and \nvarious Cabinet Officers, and appointed a special counsel to \ninvestigate the tragic events at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, \nTexas, Republican Members continue to press the charge that Attorney \nGeneral Reno refused to appoint an independent counsel for campaign \nfinance matters for some illegitimate reason. This charge is unfounded \nand refuted even by those people who disagreed with the Attorney \nGeneral's decisions not to seek appointment of independent counsels for \ncampaign finance matters, including the following.\n\n       I do not believe for one moment that any of her decisions, \n     but particularly her decisions in this matter, have been \n     motivated by\n\n[[Page S6005]]\n\n     anything other than the facts and the law which she is \n     obligated to follow.\n\n  Quoting FBI Director Louis Freeh, August 4, 1998.\n\n       At the end of the process, I was completely comfortable \n     with [the Attorney General's] decision not to seek an \n     independent counsel and with the process by which she reached \n     that decision.\n\n  Quoting Charles La Bella, Former Campaign Finance Task Force \nSupervisory Attorney, May 3, 1998.\n  The integrity and the independence of the Attorney General are \n``beyond reproach,'' quoting Charles La Bella, Former Campaign Finance \nTask Force Supervisory Attorney, August 4, 2000.\n  The Attorney General ``made no decisions to protect anyone,'' quoting \nCharles La Bella, Former Campaign Finance Task Force Supervisory \nAttorney, May 2, 2000.\n\n       [A]ll of the Attorney General's decisions were made solely \n     on the merits, after full--indeed exhaustive--consideration \n     of the factual and legal issues involved and without any \n     political influence at all.\n\n  Quoting Robert Litt, Former Principal Associate Deputy Attorney \nGeneral, June 21, 2000.\n  In response to whether he had any doubt about Attorney General Reno's \nintegrity: ``No, I do not,'' said Larry Parkinson, FBI General Counsel, \nMay 24, 2000.\n  The only political pressure on the Attorney General has come from the \nRepublican majority. I believe that it was on March 4, 1997 that \nSenator Lott first introduced a Senate resolution proposing a sense of \nthe Congress that the Attorney General should apply for the appointment \nof another independent counsel to investigate illegal fund-raising in \nthe 1996 presidential election campaign.\n  Within 48 hours, on March 6, 1997, Senator Hatch had his own \nresolution to this effect added to the Judiciary Committee agenda. \nIronically, Chairman Hatch made clear that we would not ask for an \nindependent counsel to investigate the Vice President and telephone \ncalls made from his White House office. He characterized the criticism \nof the Vice President as ``scurrilous criticism.'' He said that he did \n``not think that the speculation surrounding the Vice President is as \nserious as some would make it'' and indicated that he would not \nparticipate in making a big deal out of it. Even assuming that he had \nbeen engaged in a technical violation, the Chairman said that he would \nnot call in an independent counsel to investigate those matters.\n  Rather than act in a fair, balanced and bipartisan way, on March 13, \n1997, the ten Republican Senators on the Judiciary Committee served a \nletter on the Attorney General requesting the appointment of an \nindependent counsel to investigate possible fund-raising violations.\n  The very next day, March 14, 1997, we were called upon to debate on \nthe Senate floor the Republican Senate resolution that the Attorney \nGeneral should call for the appointment of an independent counsel. \nDuring the five days of Senate debate, Senator Bennett observed that he \nviewed the coffees at the White House as inappropriate but not illegal:\n\n       [C]learly, it does not call for the appointment of an \n     independent counsel. It is something we can talk about in the \n     political arena. It is on the legal side of the line.\n\n  Nonetheless, when the time came to vote on the resolution the \nRepublicans adopted it on a straight party-line vote. They then \nproceeded to table an alternative resolution, S.J. Res. 23, that would \nhave called upon the Attorney General to exercise her best professional \njudgment, without regard to political pressures and in accordance with \nthe standards of the law and the established policies of the Department \nof Justice to determine whether the independent counsel process should \nbe invoked. That more even-handed language that did not prejudge the \noutcome or tell the Attorney General what to do was, likewise, opposed \nby every Republican Senator.\n  Thus, by their votes on March 14, 1997, every Republican Senator had \nevidenced that his or her mind was made up on these issues and as a \nparty they marched lockstep to the conclusion that an independent \ncounsel should be appointed. The House Republicans then refused to \nconsider the resolution and it died without final action. Even after \nthe multimillion dollar investigation by the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee chaired by Senator Thompson into allegations of campaign \nfinance, and the investigations by the Burton committee and in spite of \nthe 20 convictions achieved by the Campaign Finance Task Force within \nthe Department of Justice, the Specter investigation is now revisiting \ncertain events from 1996.\n  The American people know a partisan endeavor when they see one. The \nAmerican people know that the upcoming nomination and election of the \nnext President of the United States are no justification for dragging \nthese matters back into the Senate for more politics of personal \ndestruction and innuendo and leaks and partisan investigating for \nshort-term political gain. I had hoped that we had our fill of these \nefforts when the Senate rejected the efforts by Kenneth Starr and the \nHouse Republicans to force President Clinton out of the office to which \nhe was twice elected by the American people. Regrettably, I was wrong \nand, apparently, some on this Committee are still engaged in \ndestructive partisanship.\n  The Pendleton Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 607, prohibits the solicitation of \ncampaign contributions, as defined by the Federal Election Campaign \nAct, on federal property. The Department of Justice has exercised a \npolicy--through both Democratic and Republican Administrations--of \ndeclining to prosecute violations of section 607 that do not have some \nsort of aggravating factors like coercion of involuntary political \ndonations. Indeed, the uncontroverted record of enforcement of the \nPendleton Act demonstrates that both Republican and Democratic Justice \nDepartments have applied this policy and declined to take action \nrepeatedly over the past decades. By way of example, in 1976, the \nJustice Department declined to prosecute officials responsible for \nsending letters signed by President Ford to federal employees at their \nworkplaces soliciting contributions on behalf of Republican \ncongressional candidates. In 1988, prosecution was declined when two \nRepublican Senators sent solicitation letters as part of a computerized \ndirect-mailing to employees of the Criminal Division of the Justice \nDepartment. In response to my question at the hearing yesterday, the \nAttorney General confirmed that this remained the Justice Department's \npolicy.\n  There is no evidence that fund-raising telephone calls, which the \nVice President has acknowledged making from the White House, implicated \nany ``aggravating factors'' warranting prosecutorial attention. \nNevertheless, and in the absence of such evidence, some have claimed \nthat because a hard money component of the DNC media fund used to pay \nfor television advertising in 1995 and 1996 may have been discussed at \na meeting attended by the Vice President and fourteen others on \nNovember 21, 1995, the Vice President's statements two years later that \nhe believed the media fund to be entirely of soft money were false. \nYet, as the Attorney General testified yesterday, only two \nparticipants--not four as Senator Specter stated this morning--even \nrecalled that the hard money component of the media fund had been \nmentioned at the 1995 meeting.\n\n  The Attorney General testified that thirteen participants did not \nrecall any such discussion and:\n\n     [w]hile the Vice President was present at the meeting, there \n     is no evidence that he heard the statements or understood \n     their implications so as to suggest the falsity of his \n     statements 2 years later that he believed the media fund was \n     entirely soft money, nor does anyone recall the Vice \n     President asking any questions or making any comments at the \n     meeting about the media fund, much less questions or comments \n     indicating an understanding of the issues of the blend of \n     hard and soft money needed for DNC media expenditures.\n\n     The Attorney General explained that the Justice Department \n     lawyers had:\n\n       concluded in this instance--that the range of impressions \n     and vague misunderstandings among all the meeting attendees \n     is striking and undercuts any reasonable inference that a \n     mere attendance at the meeting should have served to \n     communicate to the Vice President an accurate understanding \n     of the facts.\n\n  The Attorney General did not ``discount'' the information provided by \nDavid Strauss, who was present at the time of the November 21, 1995 \nmeeting in considering whether to appoint an independent counsel to \ninvestigate the Vice President and his knowledge of the hard money \ncomponent of the\n\n[[Page S6006]]\n\nmedia fund. Rather, as the Attorney General patiently explained \nyesterday, she fully considered the notes and the fact that Strauss \nhimself believed the media campaign had been financed entirely with \nsoft money. Indeed, this issue is discussed in full in the \n``Notification to the Court Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 592(b) of Results of \nPreliminary Investigation'' publicly filed on November 24, 1998.\n  As the Attorney General explained, the fact that Strauss's \ncontemporaneous notes reflect discussion of the hard/soft money split, \ndoes not bear on the Vice President's recollection of the matter. Any \ndiscussion about ``recorded recollection'' misses the boat. Federal \nRule of Evidence 803(5) states that a:\n\n     memorandum or record concerning a matter about which a \n     witness once had knowledge but now has insufficient \n     recollection to enable the witness to testify fully and \n     accurately, shown to have been made or adopted by this \n     witness when the matter was fresh in the witness' memory and \n     to reflect that knowledge correctly\n\nWill not be considered hearsay. However, regardless of whether \nStrauss's notes could be admissible at a hypothetical trial, the fact \nremains that they are irrelevant on the question of what the Vice \nPresident, not Strauss, knew or heard.\n  Although it was insinuated that thirteen memoranda from Harold Ickes \nare evidence as to the Vice President's knowledge of the hard money \ncomponent of the media fund, as the Attorney General testified \nyesterday, only six or seven of those memoranda predated the telephone \ncalls. In addition, as set forth in publicly filed court documents, \nthere was no evidence that the Vice President had read them and the \nAttorney General testified that the Vice President's staff \n``corroborated his statement that he did not, as a matter of practice, \nread Ickes' memos.''\n\n  As to the Standard of Proof to Move from a Preliminary Investigation \nto Independent Counsel, Republicans have repeatedly suggested that an \nindependent counsel should have been appointed for the Vice President \nand have focused on whether there was ``specific and credible \ninformation'' regarding wrongdoing. This is a mischaracterization of \nthe applicable standard under the now-lapsed Independent Counsel law. \nAs the Attorney General clarified yesterday, that standard is only \nrelevant to whether a preliminary investigation within the Justice \nDepartment should be commenced. Indeed, such an inquiry was conducted, \nand concluded, with regard to the Vice President on two occasions. The \nAttorney General also testified accurately that in order to seek an \nindependent counsel following the conclusion of a preliminary \ninvestigation, she needed ``reasonable grounds to believe that further \ninvestigation is warranted'' of the matters that had been under \ninvestigation. This standard was also accurately reflected in the \nAttorney General's notifications to the court on this issue, in which \nshe found no such ``reasonable grounds'' as to the Vice President.\n  Regarding the Hsi Lai Temple Matter, Republican Members questioned \nthe Attorney General about the Vice President's visit on April 29, 1996 \nto the Hsi Lai Temple in Los Angeles and speculated that he was not \nfully forthcoming about his understanding of the nature of the event. \nThe Vice President has consistently insisted that he was not aware this \nevent was a fundraiser. Senator Smith observed yesterday:\n\n       I don't understand for the life of me why any individual \n     would deny that he or she attended a fundraiser. Attending a \n     fundraiser is not a bad thing.\n\n  Perhaps, the answer is as simple as this: that the Vice President did \nnot know the temple event was a fund-raiser, just as he says.\n  The record is clear that the Vice President was initially scheduled \nto attend a fund-raising luncheon at a restaurant in Los Angeles on \nApril 29, 1996, and that after the lunch, he was supposed to go to the \ntemple, about 20 minutes away, for a community outreach event. No \ntickets were to be sold and no fund-raising was to take place at the \ntemple. A few weeks before the events, the Vice President's schedulers \ndetermined there was not enough time for two events. The guests \npreviously invited to the restaurant luncheon were told they could \nattend a luncheon at the temple dining hall after the formal \nceremonies.\n  Although the luncheon at the temple was a DNC-sponsored event, no \ntickets were sold, no campaign materials were displayed, no table was \nset up to solicit or accept contributions, and the Vice President spoke \nabout brotherhood and religious tolerance, not fund-raising. Attendees \nincluded a Republican member of the Los Angeles County Commission.\n  Notwithstanding these facts, Republican Senators have insisted that \nan email from an aide to the Vice President on March 15, 1996, suggests \nthat the Vice President knew the Hsi Lai Temple event was a fund-\nraiser. This conclusion is wrong and ignores relevant facts. First, the \noriginal plan had been for the Vice President to participate both in a \nfund-raiser at a restaurant and a visit to the temple on April 29, \n1996. Later that day he was to attend another fund-raiser at a private \nhome in San Jose. The email to which the Republicans referred at the \nhearing, dated March 15, 1996, is from an aide and states in relevant \npart: ``we've confirmed the fundraisers for Monday, April 29th. The \nquestion is whether you wish to seriously consider [another invitation \nin New York.].'' The Vice President replied by email that ``if we have \nalready booked the fundraisers then we have to decline.'' Obviously, \nthe fund-raisers to which these emails refer are the one fundraiser \noriginally scheduled at a restaurant in Los Angeles, later cancelled, \nand the fundraiser in San Jose. They do not refer to the Hsi Lai temple \nvisit.\n  Regarding oversight of the Peter Lee case, Senator Specter has \nclaimed that the Peter Lee case is a closed matter and that it was \nsomehow appropriate to interview the district court judge in that case. \nThe record should be clear that the Lee case is in fact pending in at \nleast two respects. First, Lee filed a motion to terminate his \nprobation on September 28, 1999. Opposition to the motion was filed by \nthe government on October 6, 1999. A decision on that motion had not \nyet been rendered at the time of the Senator's interview of the judge \nin February 1999 and may remain pending today. In addition, until \neither this motion is granted or Lee's term of probation expires, Lee \nwill remain under the supervision of the court and the Probation \nDepartment. Should he commit any violations, his probation could be \nrevoked by the judge and he could be sentenced to a term of \nimprisonment.\n  Concerning the idea that Judiciary Committee Senators should have \nstanding in independent counsel matters, I have heard the suggestion \nthat the Judiciary Committee should have standing to seek judicial \nreview of the Attorney General's decisions on special counsel matters. \nThis proposal seeks yet again to politicize the integrity of the \nprocess. It also ignores the fact that the independent counsel law is \nno longer in effect. The special counsel process is simply governed by \nAttorney General regulations. Surely this Committee should not have \nstanding to intervene in the application of internal Justice Department \nregulations.\n  I have expressed concern about the damage that can be done to the \nintegrity of the criminal justice system if the majority in Congress \npoliticizes prosecutorial decision-making, including by interfering in \nongoing criminal matters and pending investigations. Authorizing the \nmajority of a standing Congressional Committee to initiate a criminal \ninvestigation is a bad idea.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/28/senate-section/article/S6006-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6006-S6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I wish to voice my concern about the \ndeteriorating human rights situation in Russia. A decade after the \nbreak-up of the Soviet Union, Russia still faces enormous obstacles to \nbecoming a stable and prosperous nation. Russia's GDP is less than half \nof what it was before the break-up, with much of its population \nimpoverished and uncertain about its future. Russia's medical system is \nin near collapse, and both life expectancy birthrates have declined \nsharply. Crime is escalating, and corruption is widespread.\n  This is a scenario that would challenge any government. It will \nrequire great leadership to turn things around in order to move Russia \ntowards greater freedom and prosperity. But recent events have made me \nfearful that, rather than leading Russia forward, President Putin and \nhis government are leading their country back into the regrettable \npast.\n  The apparently baseless arrest of Vladimir Gusinsky raises new \nconcerns about President Putin's commitment to an independent media, \nparticularly in light of his government's abuse of Radio Liberty \njournalist Andrey Babitsky in retaliation for critical reporting from \nChechnya. The Russian government has not heeded international calls for \nan independent investigation into reports of escalating human rights \nabuses allegedly committed by Russian troops against Chechen civilians. \nThe reported harassment by the Putin government against some religious \nminorities, including pressure placed on a prominent Jewish group, is \nalso extremely troubling.\n  Mr. President, a Russia that is democratic and free and follows the \nrule of law will be a strong and prosperity country, a source of pride \nto its people, and an ally respected by all nations. I call on Congress \nand the Administration to do all that is possible to ensure that \nPresident Putin moves his country towards this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/28/senate-section/article/S6007-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nAmerican National Committee for Tyre and the International Association \nto Save Tyre for all the good work they are doing to raise awareness on \nthe issue of preserving this great historical site. As many may know, \nTyre, Lebanon was one of the most important cities in the classical \nera. It served as an administrative center of life for the people of \nthe Mediterranean region, and was the birthplace for the modern day \nalphabet and democracy. If restored to its original beauty, and its \nantiquities are carefully unearthed and preserved, Tyre could become a \nworld center for cultural education of past civilizations.\n  I am pleased to serve as the Honorary Chairman of the American \nNational Committee and I am honored to work with my colleague and \nfriend, Senator Claiborne Pell, whose previous 20 years of leadership \non this issue remains invaluable.\n  There is no dispute that underneath the present day soil of Tyre lies \nthe great archeological treasures of eight successive civilizations: \nthe Phoenician, Persian, Roman, Greek, Byzantine, Arab, and Ottoman, as \nwell as that of the Crusaders. Many attempts have been made to unearth \nthese treasures, but present day realities have made it very difficult \nto implement a full fledged plan to discover these antiquities.\n  Tyre has been designated as a World Heritage site, and as such, \nshould be treated with great respect for the education of future \ngenerations. The Government of Lebanon is searching for ways to protect \nthe archeological sites while planning realistically for economic \nexpansion and tourism. However there are problems.\n  The Lebanese Government recently approved building the southern \nextension of the coastal highway near many of the archeological \ntreasures. The government has also permitted some of the coastal sea \narea to be refilled for the construction of parking lots. In addition, \nthere has been damaging activity surrounding Tell El-Mashouk.\n  It is my hope that the Lebanese government will institute a master \nplan, cultural resources assessment, and a management plan for Tyre \nwhich will clearly map out the best approach at uncovering, preserving, \nand displaying these vast treasures. I do hope that the government will \ncease it present activity in the area until it can develop a workable \nand enforceable plan.\n  It seems a particularly appropriate time for the Lebanese Government \nto be planning their approach to the city of Tyre. With the Israeli \nwithdrawal from the South of Lebanon, and peace close at hand, Lebanon \ncan begin the process of rebuilding through tourism. It is my hope that \npart of the agenda to rebuild Southern Lebanon includes the \npreservation of the great city of Tyre and its surroundings, and I \noffer my assistance to do what I can in the United States to help the \ngovernment of Lebanon achieve this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/28/senate-section/article/S6007-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6007-S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WAYNE SHACKELFORD\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a \nconstituent, a distinguished public servant, and a friend--Wayne \nShackelford, who recently retired as Commissioner of the Georgia \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  During his tenure, Commissioner Shackelford presided over the \nreshaping of Georgia's transportation network, helping build up our \nstate's infrastructure for the 21st century. As one of the fastest \ngrowing states in the Union, with a population rapidly approaching 8 \nmillion, Georgia will face many challenges in the coming decades. We \nare well prepared to meet those challenges in large part thanks to the \nvision and leadership of Wayne Shackelford.\n  Since taking office in 1991, he has overseen the construction of more \nthan 5,000 miles of new roads throughout the state, while stewarding \nsuch innovations as Georgia's first express lanes for buses and car \npools and a computer system to monitor and manage traffic movement. In \nfact, Georgia DOT's Advanced Transportation Management System, \nNAVIGATOR, is the most complete model of an urban transportation \nmanagement system in the United States and is being studied by \ntransportation leaders worldwide.\n  Commissioner Shackelford is recognized for his interest in multimodal \nand intermodal transportation issues. He has refocused the efforts of \nGeorgia DOT on the movement of people and goods, not just vehicles, and \nhas looked beyond roads by initiating the development of passenger rail \nservice and expanding rural airports to accommodate commuter aircraft.\n  His leadership extends to regional and national transportation policy \ndevelopment. He served as President of the Southeastern Association of \nState Highway and Transportation Officials in 1993 and was President of \nthe American Association of State Highway and\n\n[[Page S6008]]\n\nTransportation Officials in 1995. He was also Chairman of the Board of \nDirectors of the Intelligent Transportation Society of America from \n1998 to 1999 and continues to serve on the Board. In addition, he \nbecame Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Transportation \nResearch Board of the National Research Council in January, 1999 and \nwas a member of the President's Council on Year 2000 Conversion.\n  He has earned many national and state awards, including the Key \nCitizen of 1996 Award from the Georgia Municipal Association. In \nSeptember, 1997, the State Transportation Board dedicated the \nTransportation Management Center in Atlanta as the Wayne Shackelford \nBuilding.\n  The Georgia DOT has also won many top national awards under \nCommissioner Shackelford's leadership, including the top national \nawards for asphalt and concrete paving for 1996 and the top quality \nconstruction awards from the National Asphalt Paving Association in \n1997 and 1998. Georgia has been rated for two consecutive years--and \nfor many of the past 15 years--as having the best-maintained roads in \nthe nation.\n  For these and many other achievements it is my great pleasure to \ncommend Commissioner Shackelford, to thank him for his many years of \nhard work and dedication on behalf of the people of Georgia, and to \nwish him well in all his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/28/senate-section/article/S6008-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR. NANCY FOSTER\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it is with the most heartfelt \nsadness that I rise today to commemorate the life of Dr. Nancy Foster, \nwho passed away Tuesday at her home in Baltimore, Maryland. As I stand \nhere today I recall that only a year ago I spoke to you about Dr. \nFoster's outstanding work as head of the National Ocean Service at the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The news of her \npassing was bitter pill. Not only was Dr. Foster a dedicated and \nvisionary public servant, but she was also universally admired and \nloved. I know that her creativity, boundless energy, and compassion \nwill be sorely missed both here and at NOAA. Dr. Foster's efforts in my \nhome state of South Carolina both as head of NOS and then at NOAA's \nFisheries Service were testaments to her skill at bringing groups \ntogether to solve incredibly complex coastal problems, from protecting \nour sea turtles to conserving and understanding our precious coastal \nresources. The world is a better place for her having served here with \nus.\n  Dr. Foster came to NOAA in 1977 and spent her career promoting \nprograms to explore, map, protect and develop sustainably our Nation's \ncoastal and fishery resources. She helped create the National Marine \nSanctuary Program and Estuarine Research Reserve Program. These \nprograms preserve America's near shore and offshore marine environments \nin the same manner as do the better known national parks and wildlife \nrefuges on land. Nancy went on to serve as the Director of Protected \nResources at NOAA's Fisheries Service, where she managed the \nGovernment's programs to protect and conserve whales, dolphins, sea \nturtles and other endangered and protected species. After that, Dr. \nFoster was named the Deputy Director of the Fisheries Service, where \nshe forged alliances between fishing and conservation groups to ensure \nboth the protection of our living marine resources and the \nsustainability of our human resources. I particularly recall her \nspecial efforts in South Carolina, where she worked hand in hand with \nour shrimpers to help them devise ways of keeping sea turtles out of \ntheir nets.\n  In 1977, Commerce Secretary Bill Daley and NOAA Under Secretary Jim \nBaker tapped Nancy to take over the National Ocean Service. Not only \nwas she the first woman to direct a NOAA line office, but she was given \none of the most senior levels a career professional can achieve; in \nother agencies or bureaus, such a position would be reserved for at \nleast an Assistant Secretary-level official. NOS has the longest \nrunning mission of all the NOAA line offices--coastal mapping traces \nits lineage back to 1807--and she pioneered a reinvention effort that \nhas made the Ocean Service one of the most modern and effective of the \nline offices. A proven innovator, she directed the total modernization \nof NOAA's essential nautical mapping and charting programs. In \naddition, along with Dr. Sylvia Earle she created a ground-breaking \npartnership with the National Geographic Society to launch a 5-year \nundersea exploration program called `Sustainable Seas Expedition.' to \nrekindle our nation's interest in the oceans, and especially the \nnational marine sanctuaries. This effort has sparked the kind of \nenthusiasm about the oceans that Jacques Cousteau created when I first \ncame to the Senate.\n  While the Federal Government frequently recognized Dr. Foster's \ncontributions through numerous important awards, she was also a person \nwhom the rank and file employees at NOAA--the marine biologists, \nresearchers, and managers--trusted and admired. She was a strong and \nenthusiastic mentor to young people and a staunch ally to her \ncolleagues. She has, and always will, serve as a role model for \nprofessional women everywhere, especially those who work in the \nsciences. Nancy Foster was that rare official whom we in the Congress \nlooked to for leadership, candor, and sensitivity, and we will all feel \nher loss deeply for years to come. I would like to offer my deepest \nappreciation for Dr. Foster's outstanding contribution to the Nation \nand send my sincerest condolences to her family and friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/28/senate-section/article/S6008-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6008-S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL DAY OF PRAYER\n\n Mr. ALLARD.

I'm not going to tell you \n     who they are because I don't want you to go up to them and \n     ask them how I really was at fifteen or sixteen years old. \n     But it's awfully nice to back here--home in Denver.\n       I bring you greetings from my family. My parents and I \n     moved to Denver when I was twelve years old, and this is just \n     a great place to live. I think the reason that it is such a \n     great place to live is events like this. You look around and \n     you see the love in the community, you see the strength in \n     the community. It's nice to be back.\n       When I thought about what I'd like to talk with you about, \n     I immediately reflected on the fact that this is of course \n     our National Day of Prayer as well as the day for the \n     Colorado Prayer Luncheon. And I thought about spending a few \n     minutes with you talking about the relationship of personal \n     faith, to faith in a community, to strength and forward \n     movement in a community. Because very often we think about \n     where we would like the community to go, we think about where \n     we would like our leaders to take us. We very often forget \n     that strong communities are built person by person, step by \n     step, by the responsibility of each and every one of us. That \n     responsibility and that strength, I believe, can come from \n     many different sources, and certainly it comes from different \n     sources for different people. But for many of us, and perhaps \n     for most of the people in this room, it certainly relates to \n     deep and abiding faith in God, whatever one's religious \n     background. For me it comes from a deep and abiding faith in \n     Jesus Christ.\n       Now I have to tell you that I was born into the church. I \n     didn't have much choice. In fact, on the day that I was born \n     which was a Sunday, at 11:48 my father was preaching a \n     sermon. He had been told on Friday night that his child \n     probably wasn't going to be born for a couple of days, so go \n     ahead on Sunday and preach the sermon. And my goodness when \n     he came out of the pulpit on Sunday, he had a little girl.\n       We lived in the back of the church until I was three and \n     then moved into a parsonage. My grandparents were religious \n     people. I studied piano from the age of three. I could read \n     music before I could read. But the first song that I learned \n     was ``What a Friend We Have in Jesus.'' And then I learned to \n     play ``Amazing Grace,'' etc. etc.\n       My grandfather was a deeply religious person. Indeed I have \n     a lot of heroes in my life, but Granddaddy Rice is perhaps \n     the most remarkable because you see back in about 1920\n\n[[Page S6009]]\n\n     he was a sharecropper's son in Ewtah, Alabama. One day he \n     decided he wanted to get book learning, heaven knows why. And \n     so he asked people how could a colored man go to college, and \n     they said, ``Well, you see if you could get to Stillman \n     College (which is this little Presbyterian college down \n     the road) then you could go to college there.'' So he \n     saved up his cotton, went to Stillman College, paid for \n     his first year and then the second year they said, ``Now \n     how do you plan to pay for your second year?'' And he \n     said, ``Well, I've used all the money I have.'' And they \n     said, ``Well, you'll have to go home,'' And he said, \n     ``Well, how to those boys go to college?'' They said, \n     ``Well, you see they have what's called a scholarship, and \n     if you wanted to be a Presbyterian minister, then you \n     could have a scholarship too.'' My grandfather said, ``You \n     know, that's exactly what I had in mind,'' and he became \n     college educated, and my family has been Presbyterian ever \n     since.\n       So I was born into the church. My earliest memories are of \n     Sunday school and choir practice and youth fellowship, and \n     indeed if you're a minister's child, you have some kind of \n     strange memories because you see when I heard that story \n     about Christ coming again, I figured when I was about six \n     years old that if he was going to come again anyway, He might \n     as well come to Westminster Presbyterian Church because that \n     would certainly help the flagging attendance in the summer. \n     And so I would pray, ``If you're going to come, Christ, come \n     to my father's church. He could use the help,'' You see you \n     had different ways of thinking about religion when you were a \n     preacher's child.\n       But because I was born into the church, I never really \n     doubted the existence of God. I can tell you that I accepted \n     from the earliest years the whole mystery of the faith, the \n     birth, the life, the death, and the resurrection as truth. \n     Mine then is not a story of conversion to faith. The \n     existence of God was a given for me. That Jesus Christ was \n     His son was a given for me. But while mine is not a story of \n     conversion, it is a story of a journey to deepen my personal \n     faith, and I would imagine that for many of you, a story that \n     resonates, a story that has a familiar ring. You see, it's \n     easy when you are born to religious faith to take that faith \n     for granted, and not to deepen and to grow in it, not to \n     question, and to become comfortable with it.\n       When we moved here to Denver, I was at Montview Boulevard \n     Presbyterian Church. I was in the choir. I met some members \n     of Montview Boulevard here today with whom I sang in the \n     choir. It was a wonderful church, a large church. And then I \n     moved to California, and for awhile I continued to go to \n     church as I had done every Sunday since I could remember. But \n     you know pretty soon things got busy. And so before you knew \n     it, Sundays were for something else. Maybe I had to work. \n     Maybe I had to do something about that lecture that I had to \n     give on Monday. I was always traveling because I'm a \n     specialist in international politics, so maybe I was in some \n     other time zone, and when I got home I was just too tired to \n     go to church. And slowly but surely my faith which I'd always \n     taken for granted was there, but it was rather in the deeper \n     recesses of my mind, not front and center in the way that I \n     lived my life daily.\n       A funny thing happened in that period to me. One Sunday \n     morning when I knew I should have been in church, I was in \n     the Lucky Supermarket instead. And I was walking among the \n     spices buying food, and I'll never forget running into a \n     black man there. And if you know Palo Alto, that's a rare \n     occurrence anyway. And he told me he was buying some food for \n     his church picnic, and we talked a little, and then he looked \n     right at me and he said, ``Do you play the piano?'' And I \n     said ``Yes, I play the piano,'' And he said, ``You know my \n     church, Jerusalem Baptist Church down the road here just a \n     little bit, needs somebody to play the piano. Would you come \n     and play the piano for us?'' And so I did for several months \n     go and play the piano for Jerusalem Baptist Church. And I \n     thought, ``If that's not the long reach of the Lord into the \n     Lucky Supermarket on a Sunday morning, what is?'' But as a \n     result of going there and playing and getting involved \n     again with the church community, I began to see how much \n     my faith, which I'd taken for granted, was becoming \n     unpracticed, that it was no longer really becoming a part \n     of the way that I lived my daily life.\n       And so I started seeking out a church home, and I found \n     Menlo Park Presbyterian in Menlo Park right next to Palo \n     Alto. And one of the first sermons that I heard at Menlo Park \n     Presbyterian Church just reached out and grabbed me because \n     it said where I was in my own faith. And it was the story of \n     the prodigal son. But it was the story of the prodigal son \n     told from the perspective of the older son, not from the son \n     who had to come home, but the son who had always been there. \n     And the minister talked about how the older son was really \n     appalled, angry, and couldn't quite understand why while be \n     had been there toiling in the fields and had been a good son \n     and had supported his family, why there was all this \n     excitement when the prodigal son came home.\n       And I thought about it, and maybe what Christ was saying \n     here, what God was saying, was that the prodigal son who had \n     to be born again to this faith was being brought powerfully \n     back to his faith. While the older son who had always been \n     there doing what he was supposed to do but maybe just doing \n     it in the most routine fashion was losing what's most \n     important about faith, and that's the deepening and the fire \n     that comes from having it tested, from having to worry about \n     it, from having to think about it, from having to bat it \n     around in your mind from time to time so that it doesn't \n     become stale. And I suddenly saw myself as the elder son. And \n     I thought at that time, it's time to renew my faith and not \n     to take it for granted. And you know, it's a good thing that \n     I did because I was soon to learn why faith is so important \n     in your daily life.\n       It was about a year and a half after coming back to my \n     faith that I lost my mother, and I can tell you that I could \n     not have gotten through that without a strong and robust \n     faith. You see the preparation for struggle that faith \n     accords you is not something that you can call on the day \n     that it happens. You have to have honed it, you have to have \n     worked at it, it has to have become a part of you. I began to \n     understand during that period of time when I really was \n     experiencing the peace that passeth all understanding, that \n     faith is honed in struggle, that Paul was absolutely right \n     when he wrote in Romans that we are justified in faith and \n     that struggle brings patience, and patience hope, and hope is \n     not disappointed. Because it is in that time of struggle that \n     we learn that we are resilient human beings, that we have at \n     our core the ability to rebound and to go on.\n       Over the years, I have become more and more interested in \n     the stories of struggle--whether it is the death of a loved \n     one, whether it is what Colorado went through in Columbine, \n     whether it is the struggle that interestingly built Stanford \n     University. Do you know that Stanford University was built by \n     Governor and Mrs. Stanford to honor their only child who died \n     of typhoid at sixteen years old? And Mrs. Stanford writes in \n     her letters that she wanted to die too when her son and then \n     her husband died shortly thereafter, but she understood that \n     her faith was telling her to go on, to pick up the pieces, to \n     do something for other people's children. And so Stanford \n     University was from the Stanfords a living monument to other \n     people's children, born of the test of faith, the test that \n     is struggle. And I began to understand too the words of an \n     old Negro spiritual that had always been somewhat confusing--\n     ``Nobody knows the trouble I've seen. Glory Hallelujah''? \n     What does that mean? It means that out of struggle, faith is \n     honed.\n       Now why is faith honed out of struggle? First of all, \n     because you are at that time forced to confront the \n     relationship between faith and doubt. When my mother died, I \n     didn't have any good answers. Did I on the one hand pray to \n     God for understanding and on the other hand doubt why this \n     had happened? Of course when Columbine happened, did you on \n     the one hand pray for understanding and doubt why had it \n     happened? But faith, and indeed the lessons of Christ teach \n     us that faith can be strengthened by doubt. It doesn't have \n     to be weakened by it.\n       Some of my favorite stories in the Bible actually come from \n     the time when Christ is preparing to die. And when the \n     disciples--men who had walked with Him for the entire time of \n     His ministry, men who knew Him better than anyone else--found \n     themselves doubting and fearful of what was to come. He said, \n     ``I'll go to prepare a place for you.'' They said, ``Take us \n     with you because we don't actually know where you're going.'' \n     This isn't very reassuring. And of course the story of Thomas \n     which we had always been taught in a kind of pejorative sense \n     ``the doubting Thomas,'' but in fact what did Christ say? \n     ``Here, feel my side. Touch the wounds.'' He didn't say just \n     ``Leave.'' Doubt and faith have gone together from the \n     beginning of our religious experiences. And in times of \n     struggle, we are forced to work through our doubts in order \n     to re-energize our faith.\n       Times of struggle also challenge us on the relationship \n     between faith and reason because most of us live most of our \n     lives in our heads. We try and understand why. And if you are \n     like me and you live in an intellectual community, if you \n     can't prove it, if you can't see it, then you can't possibly \n     believe it. And yet there are those times when reason just \n     will not do the job. I noticed the little quote by Abraham \n     Lincoln in the bulletin this morning. ``I've been driven many \n     times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I had \n     nowhere else to go. My own wisdom and that of all about me \n     seemed insufficient for the day.'' How many times has your \n     reason, your intellect failed you and you've had to fall back \n     on faith? In times of struggle, we learn to trust, we learn \n     to fall back on faith, we learn to fall back on that which \n     cannot be seen and cannot be understood, and it makes us \n     stronger.\n       Finally, in times of struggle, perhaps more than at other \n     times, we are reminded also of the responsibilities of faith, \n     particularly if we've been through struggles ourselves and we \n     are called on to participate in, to be a part of someone \n     else's struggle. And it is that relationship between personal \n     faith and taking one's faith into the community to make it \n     better that I want to explore for a moment now--to take the \n     lessons and the power of faith outside of our own personal \n     experiences and into the community at large.\n       Now in order to do that, you have to draw on other parts of \n     your faith. You have to draw on what has been honed and \n     toughened inside you when you yourself have struggled. But \n     you also have to draw on the power that is there for you to \n     first and foremost be optimistic. When I am very often asked \n     what has\n\n[[Page S6010]]\n\n     faith done for me that is most important, I say that yes it's \n     been there for me in tough times and struggle, but I think \n     it's also made me an optimistic person. It's made me a person \n     who believes that there can be a better tomorrow.\n       If you don't believe that faith plays its role in making \n     you an optimistic person, think of the people who built this \n     country and the optimism that must have come from their \n     faith. Have you ever wondered what it must have been like to \n     come across the Continental Divide without roads? They \n     must have had faith that they were going to make it. They \n     must have had optimism about what was possible on the \n     other side. They must have gone together and indeed from \n     that they built a great country. Have you ever wondered \n     about the faith and optimism of my ancestors, slaves who \n     were three-fifths of a man who endured the most awful \n     hardships of day-to-day life and yet somehow looked \n     optimistically to a future? They must have done it out of \n     the strength of their faith. They must have done it out of \n     the optimism that only faith can give.\n       But imparting that optimism to people who are in need, \n     imparting the mysteries and the lessons of faith to people \n     who are in struggle is sometimes, oddly enough, easier than \n     imparting and using the lessons of faith in everyday life. \n     Sometimes we mobilize to use our faith when things are tough. \n     This city mobilized around Columbine. People are able to \n     bring themselves to love one another--Greeks and Turks after \n     the earthquake in Turkey, because you're mobilized in your \n     faith to help. But what about day to day in your interactions \n     with people in the community? Can you mobilize your faith in \n     the same way?\n       I think sometimes the biggest impediment to mobilizing our \n     faith in our day to day interactions in trying to make our \n     communities better is really in our lack of humility about \n     what we as mere human beings can bring to the table. You know \n     sometimes people of faith are wonderful at dealing with \n     people in need. But in more normal times we're our own worst \n     enemy because sometimes the shouting, the desire to lecture, \n     overwhelms the desire to lecture, overwhelms the desire to \n     listen and to understand. I think sometimes that the greatest \n     impediment to people of faith in really making a difference \n     in their communities to people on a daily basis--not just \n     when we need to be mobilized--is that we sometimes have \n     trouble, as people of faith, meeting people where they are, \n     not where we would like them to be.\n       And hereto, I draw on a lesson from Christ. Have you ever \n     noticed that when Christ was interacting with people, He \n     found a way to meet them where they were? With the rich young \n     leader, it was confrontational--to give up everything and to \n     give it to the poor was pretty confrontational. With Lazarus \n     and the sisters, it was dramatic--a miracle. With the woman \n     at the well, it was kind and understanding and quiet. How \n     many of us as people of faith have that entire repertoire at \n     our disposal? When we deal with people, do we ever stop \n     shouting so loud that they can hear through us the still, \n     small voice of calm, remembering afterall that we will not \n     personally work miracles in people's lives? That is the work \n     of God. But if we are to be a conduit, we have to be a \n     conduit that is willing to listen, a conduit that is willing \n     to help with humility, and a conduit that is willing to meet \n     people where they are.\n       Those I think are the lessons of faith--to hone our \n     personal faith, to practice it every day, to pray for our \n     leaders and for those who must carry the heavy burdens, and \n     to try to use our faith and its lessons, not just when we \n     need to be mobilized, but in our everyday interactions. \n     Because only then can people of faith really make a \n     difference in communities at home and communities abroad.\n       Thank you very much, and God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/28/senate-section/article/S6010-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MR. LLOYD A. SEMPLE RECEIVES 2000 JUDGE LEARNED HAND AWARD\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, each year, the American Jewish \nCommittee's Metropolitan Detroit Chapter presents one individual with \nits Judge Learned Hand Human Relations Award. Recipients of this award \nare honored for their outstanding leadership within the legal \nprofession, and for exemplifying the high principles for which Judge \nLearned Hand was renowned. I rise today to recognize Mr. Lloyd A. \nSemple, who will receive the 2000 Judge Learned Hand Award on June 29, \n2000, in Detroit, Michigan.\n  Mr. Semple is the Chairman of one of Detroit's oldest and most \nprestigious law firms, Dykema Gossett, PLLC. Founded in 1926, Dykema \nGossett provides legal services to a broad range of clients, from \ninternational and Fortune 500 companies to individuals and small ``Mom \nand Pop'' businesses. Its mission has remained constant throughout its \nalmost seventy-five years: to provide the best possible legal advice \nand service to its clients. The firm has grown over 270 lawyers strong, \nand now has locations in the following Michigan cities: Ann Arbor, \nBloomfield Hills, Grand Rapids, and Lansing; as well as offices in \nChicago and Washington, D.C. In addition, Dykema Gossett has recently \ngone global, forming an affiliation with a firm in Bologna, Italy.\n  In his time as Chairman, Mr. Semple has overseen this growth and \nadaptation to the ``new economy'' while at the same time stressing the \nimportance of pro bono work to the members and associates of Dykema \nGossett. Twice in recent years the law firm has been recognized by the \nDetroit Metropolitan Bar Association for its efforts in this regard. In \n1998, Dykema Gossett was selected by the Business Law Section of the \nAmerican Bar Association as the firm that made the most outstanding pro \nbono contribution in the United States in transactional and business \nrelated areas. In addition, members and associates donate their time \nand resources to a host of charitable and civic organizations, \nrecognizing the importance of being not only a community member, but a \ncommunity leader. Much of this is attributable, I think, to the strong \nleadership of Mr. Semple, and his belief that a good business should \nalso strive to be a good neighbor.\n  Mr. Semple himself practices general corporate law, including \nacquisitions, divestitures, mergers and financings. He received his \nBachelor of Arts degree from Yale University, and his Jurist Doctorate \nfrom the University of Michigan. He is a member of the Detroit \nMetropolitan Bar Association, the American Bar Association, and the \nState Bar of Michigan. He is a Director and/or Officer of Interface \nSystems, Inc., Sensys Technologies Inc., Tracy Industries, Inc., and \nCivix, Inc.\n  In addition, Mr. Semple serves as Chairman of the Board of Trustees \nof the Detroit Medical Center; Chairman of the Executive Committee of \nthe Detroit Zoological Society; and is a Trustee of Detroit Symphony \nOrchestra Hall. He is the Director and Corporate Secretary, as well as \na Trustee, of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Center, an organization \nwhich raises funds for the awareness and prevention of breast cancer. \nHe has served as Chairman of the Board of Harper Hospital, Councilman \nand Mayor Pro Tem of the City of Grosse Pointe Farms, President of the \nYale Alumni Association of Michigan and President of the Country Club \nof Detroit.\n  I applaud Mr. Semple on his many achievements within the realm of the \nlaw, and his many charitable endeavors outside of that realm. Not only \nthe City of Detroit, but the entire State of Michigan, has benefitted \nfrom his many great works. On behalf of the United States Senate, I \ncongratulate Mr. Lloyd A. Semple on receiving the 2000 Judge Learned \nHand Award, and wish him continued success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/28/senate-section/article/S6010-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/28/senate-section/article/S6010-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6010-S6011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:47 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 809.

A bill to provide for infant crib safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                       the infant crib safety act\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \ndesigned to eliminate injuries and deaths that result from crib \naccidents.\n  While there are strict guidelines on the manufacture and sale of new \ncribs, there are still 25 to 30 million unsafe cribs sold throughout \nthe U.S. in ``secondary markets,'' such as thrift stores and resale \nfurniture stores. These cribs should be taken off the market, and \neither made safe, or destroyed.\n  There are a number of reasons why unsafe cribs should be taken off \nthe market:\n  Each year, at least 45 children die from injuries sustained in cribs. \nThat is almost one child a week.\n  The number of deaths from crib incidents exceeds deaths from all \nother nursery products combined.\n  Over 9,000 children are hospitalized each year as a result of \ninjuries sustained in cribs.\n  To illustrate the need for this legislation, I want to share with you \nthe story of Danny Lineweaver.\n  At the age of 23 months, Danny was injured during an attempt to climb \nout of his crib. Danny caught his shirt on a decorative knob on the \ncornerpost of his crib and hanged himself.\n  Though his mother was able to perform CPR the moment she found him, \nDanny lived in a semi-comatose state for nine years and died in 1993. \nThis injury and subsequent death could have been prevented.\n  Since Danny's accident, we have passed laws mandating safety \nstandards for the manufacture of new cribs. But this is not enough.\n  There are nearly four million infants born in this country each year, \nbut only one million new cribs sold. As many as half of all infants are \nplaced in secondhand, hand-me-down, or heirloom cribs--cribs that are \nsold in thrift stores or resale furniture stores. These cribs may be \nunsafe, and may in fact threaten the life of the infants placed in \nthem.\n  This legislation requires thrift stores and retail furniture stores \nto remove decorative knobs on the cornerposts of cribs before selling \nthose cribs.\n  Additionally, the bill prohibits hotels and motels from providing \nunsafe cribs to guests, or risk being fined up to $1,000.\n  The Infant Crib Safety Act makes the sale of used, unsafe cribs \nillegal. I hope my colleagues will join me in putting a stop to \npreventable injuries and deaths resulting from unsafe cribs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 2804. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 424 South Michigan Street in South Bend, Indiana, as \nthe ``John Brademas Post Office''; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n[[Page S6016]]\n\n            designation of the ``john brademas post office''\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President. It is with great pride that I rise \ntoday to pay tribute to a good friend and a great man, former United \nStates Congressman John Brademas. I am honored to introduce legislation \ndesignating the United States Post Office located at 424 South Michigan \nStreet in South Bend, Indiana, as the ``John Brademas Post Office.''\n  John Brademas was born on March 2, 1927, in Mishawaka, Indiana, a \nsmall town in Indiana's third congressional district, which he would \nlater represent for more than two decades (1959-1981). John's father \nwas a Greek immigrant restauranteur and his mother was a Hoosier school \nteacher. Upon graduation from high school, John joined the Navy and \nsoon thereafter became a Veterans National Scholar at Harvard \nUniversity, from which he graduated with a B.A., Magna Cum Laude, in \n1949. From 1950 to 1953, he studied as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford \nUniversity, England, receiving the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in \nSocial Studies.\n  From 1955 to 1956, John Brademas served as Executive Assistant to the \nlate Adlai E. Stevenson, where he assumed research responsibilities \nduring the 1956 Presidential campaign. Three years later, John Brademas \nbecame the first native-born American of Greek origin to be elected to \nCongress. In the House, he quickly became a leader in the areas of \neducation, the arts and humanities, as well as a staunch defender of \nthe rights of the disabled and the elderly. During his service on the \nHouse Committee on Education and Labor, Congressman Brademas was \nlargely responsible for writing major federal legislation concerning \nelementary and secondary education, higher education, vocational \neducation, as well as support for libraries, museums, and the arts and \nhumanities.\n  Congressman Brademas was also the chief House sponsor of the \nEducation for all Handicapped Children Act; the Arts, Humanities, and \nCultural Affairs Act; and the Older Americans Comprehensive Services \nAct. In 1977, Congressman Brademas was chosen by his colleagues for the \ninfluential position of House Majority Whip, in which he served for his \nlast four years in office. Among his numerous accomplishments, \nCongressman Brademas was responsible for attaining the necessary \nfunding for the very same Post Office that I seek to name in his honor.\n  Today, Congressman Brademas is President Emeritus of New York \nUniversity, where he served as President from 1981-1992. During that \ntime, he led the transition of New York University from a regional \ncommuter school to a national and international research university. In \naddition to his responsibilities at New York University, he is the \nChairman of the National Endowment for Democracy and serves as co-\nchairman for the Center on Science, Technology and Congress at the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science. He also serves on \nthe Consultants' Panel to the Comptroller General of the United States.\n  During his long and distinguished service, both as a leader in \ngovernment and a leader in higher education, John Brademas has provided \ninspiration and guidance to two generations of men and women committed \nto public service and to education. I want to thank Congressman \nBrademas for his enduring contributions to the State of Indiana and the \nnation.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope that the Postal facility located at 424 \nSouth Michigan Street will soon bear the name of my good friend and \nfellow Hoosier, former Congressman John Brademas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself and Mr. Lieberman) (by request):\n  S. 2805. To amend the Federal Property and Administrative Services \nAct of 1949, as amended, to enhance Federal asset management, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n        the federal property asset management reform act of 2000\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today Senator Lieberman and I are \nintroducing, by request, the Federal Asset Management Reform Act of \n2000. This legislation is the result of the work of the General \nServices Administration, under the leadership of its Administrator \nDavid Barram, to modernize and reform the management, use and disposal \nof the Federal government's real property and surplus personal \nproperty.\n  The Federal government owns or controls over 24 million acres of land \nand facilities which have been acquired for use and operation by \nFederal agencies in support of their missions. Since 1949, the Federal \nProperty and Administrative Services Act has provided the foundation \nfor the management and disposal of these properties as well as for \nsurplus personal property. This legislative proposal is intended to \nimprove life cycle planning and management of Federal assets.\n  We are introducing this proposal today for the purpose of encouraging \nstudy and comment by all interested parties. Key participants in the \ncurrent property disposal process are state and local governments, non-\nprofit organizations and federal agencies. The Governmental Affairs \nCommittee intends to review this legislative measure and all comments \nreceived about it to better understand what changes are desirable in \nthe management of the Federal government's billions of dollars worth of \nreal and surplus property. The Committee expects to follow through with \nfurther legislative action in the next Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nFederal Asset Management Reform Act of 2000 be printed at this point in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2805\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n                         TITLE 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Property Asset \n     Management Reform Act of 2000''.\n\n                         TITLE 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 3 of the Federal Property and Administrative \n     Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. Sec. 472), is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(m) The term ``landholding agency'' means any Federal \n     agency that, by specific or general statutory authority, has \n     jurisdiction, custody, and control over real property, or \n     interests therein. The ten-n does not include agencies, when \n     they are acting as the sponsors of real property conveyances \n     for public benefit purposes pursuant to section 203 of the \n     Act (40 U.S.C. 33 Sec. 484).\n\n              TITLE 3. LIFE CYCLE PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT\n\n       Title 11 of the Federal Property and Administrative \n     Services Act of 1949, as amended, is amended by adding at the \n     end thereof the following new sections:\n       ``Sec. 213. (a) In accordance with the authorities vested \n     in the Administrator under section 205(c) of this Act, the \n     Administrator, in collaboration with the heads of affected \n     Federal agencies, shall establish and maintain current asset \n     management principles to be used as guidance by such agencies \n     in making major decisions concerning the planning, \n     acquisition, use, maintenance, and disposal of real and \n     personal property assets subject to this Act and under the \n     jurisdiction, custody and control of such agencies.\n       ``(b) In order to accumulate and maintain a single, \n     comprehensive descriptive listing of all Federal real \n     property interests under the custody and control of each \n     Federal agency, the Administrator, in coordination with the \n     heads of affected Federal agencies, shall collect such \n     descriptive information, except for classified information, \n     as the Administrator deems will best describe the nature, \n     use, and extent of the real property holdings of the United \n     States. For purposes of this section, real property holdings \n     include all public lands of the United States and all real \n     property of the United States located outside the States of \n     the Union, to include, but not be limited to the District of \n     Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Trust \n     Territory of the Pacific Islands and the Virgin Islands. To \n     facilitate the reporting on a uniform basis, the \n     Administrator is authorized to establish data and other \n     information technology standards for use by Federal agencies \n     in developing or upgrading agency real property infon-nation \n     systems.\n       ``(c) The listing compiled pursuant to this section shall \n     be public record; however, the Administrator is authorized to \n     withhold infon-nation, including the location of classified \n     facilities, when it is determined that withholding such \n     information would be in the public interest. Nothing herein \n     shall require the public release of information which is \n     exempt from disclosure pursuant to the Freedom of Information \n     Act (5 U.S.C.

The asset management plan shall be prepared \n     according to guidelines issued by the Administrator, shall be \n     maintained to reflect current agency program and budget \n     priorities, and be consistent with capital planning and \n     programming guidance issued by the Office of Management and \n     Budget;\n       ``(2) identify real property assets that can benefit from \n     the application of the enhanced asset management tools \n     described in section 216 of this Act;\n       ``(3) ensure, in those cases where a real property asset \n     can benefit from application of an enhanced asset management \n     tool, that any resulting transaction will result in a fair \n     return on the Federal government investment and protect the \n     Federal government from unreasonable financial or other \n     risks; and\n       ``(4) ensure that a listing and description of the real \n     property assets, under the jurisdiction, custody and control \n     of that agency, including public lands of the United States \n     and property located in foreign lands, is provided to the \n     Administrator, along with any other relevant information the \n     Administrator may request, for inclusion in a govemment-wide \n     listing of all Federal real property interests established \n     and maintained in accordance with section 213(b) of this Act.\n       ``(c) Except as otherwise provided by Federal law, prior to \n     a Federal agency acquiring any interests in real property \n     from any non-Federal source, the Senior Real Property Officer \n     of the acquiring agency shall give first consideration to \n     available Federal real property holdings.''.\n\n    TITLE 4.

Mr. President, today, along with Senator \nThompson, I am introducing a bill at the request of the administration \nto amend the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949. \nThe bill is designed to improve the federal government's role in \nmanaging both its personal and real property. By granting agencies \nenhanced tools to handle their assets, the bill's goal is to bring \nfederal asset management into the 21st century. I invite comments on \nthe administration's proposal and look forward to reviewing \nthem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 2806. A bill to amend the National Housing Act to clarify the \nauthority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to \nterminate mortgagee origination approval for poorly performing \nmortgagees; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                        CREDIT WATCH ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing, ``Credit \nWatch,'' a bill that will authorize the Federal Housing Administration \n(FHA) to identify lenders who have excessively high early default and \nclaim rates and terminate their origination approval. This legislation \nis necessary to protect the FHA fund and take action against lenders \nwho are contributing to the deterioration of our neighborhoods.\n  A recent rash of FHA loan defaults have led to foreclosures and \nvacant properties in a number of cities around the country. In \nBaltimore, the effects of high foreclosure rates are acute. In some \nneighborhoods, there are numerous foreclosed homes, now abandoned, \nwithin just a few blocks of each other. This can often be the beginning \nof a neighborhood's decline. It creates a perception that the property \nand the neighborhood is not highly valued. In turn, these neighborhoods \nbecome physically deteriorated and often attract criminal activity.\n  It's like a rotten apple in a barrel. The rundown appearance of one \nhome spreads to the surrounding neighborhood. Neighborhoods that are \nstruggling to stabilize and revitalize find their efforts undermined by \nthe presence of abandoned homes.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), community \nactivists, and local law makers have come together to examine the loans \nbeing made in neighborhoods with high foreclosure rates.\n  In Baltimore and other cities, these groups found that careless \nlenders are offering FHA insured loans to families who cannot afford to \npay them back. Early default or claim of these loans frequently leads \nto foreclosure of the home. A foreclosed property can easily turn into \nan uninhabited home, which can either begin or continue a cycle of \ndecline.\n  In an effort to reduce the number of loans that end in foreclosure, \nthe FHA developed several new oversight methods. One of which is \n``Credit Watch.''\n  ``Credit Watch'' is an automated system that compares the number of \nearly foreclosures and claims of lenders in the same area. This \nlegislation authorizes FHA to revoke the origination approval of \nlenders who have significantly higher rates of early defaults and \nclaims than the other lenders in the same area. FHA is currently \ntargeting lenders with default rates over 300% of the area average. \nThey estimate that in Baltimore this threshold would allow them to \nterminate the origination privileges of three major lenders that \naccount for 40% of early defaults and claims.\n  The legislation accounts for differing regional economies by ensuring \nthat lenders are only compared to others making loans in the same \ncommunity. It also provides a manner by which terminated lenders may \nappeal the decision of the FHA, if they believe there are mitigating \nfactors that may justify higher rates.\n  When lenders make loans with no regard for the consumer or the health \nof the community, the FHA must be able to take action in a timely \nmanner. This practice is a costly abuse of the FHA insurance fund. \nQuick action not only protects the health of the Mutual Mortgage \nInsurance (MMI) fund, but it protects neighborhoods from the \ndetrimental effects of high vacancy rates and consumers from the pain \nof foreclosure and serious damage to their credit.\n  Lenders that offer loans to individuals who cannot afford them should \nnot be able to continue making those loans. It is a bad deal for \ntaxpayers. It is a bad deal for neighborhoods. It is a bad deal for the \nfamilies who take out the loan.\n  Credit Watch is an effective and efficient way that the FHA can \nprevent these unfortunate foreclosures from happening. While we need to \naddress the larger issue of predatory lending in our communities, \n``Credit Watch'' is an obvious and immediate solution to one part of \nthe problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Bond, Mr. \n        Santorum, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Ashcroft, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 2807. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to establish a \nMedicare Prescription Drug and Supplemental Benefit Program and to \nstabilize and improve the Medicare+Choice program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        medicare prescription drug and modernization act of 2000\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today to \njoin Senators Breaux, Kerrey, Bond, Santorum, Landrieu, Ashcroft, and  \nCollins in introducing the ``Medicare Prescription Drug and \nModernization Act of 2000''--a truly bipartisan effort to address the \nreal need to provide seniors the prescription drugs they deserve and \nstrengthen and improve the Medicare program overall.\n  Last fall, I introduced the ``Medicare Preservation and Improvement \nAct of 1999'', with Senators Breaux, Kerrey, and  Hagel. This was the \nfirst bipartisan attempt to comprehensively reform Medicare in the \nprogram's 35 year history. When Medicare was first enacted in 1965, it \nhad the goal of providing seniors necessary acute health care that \nwould otherwise have been unaffordable. However today's health care \ndelivery systems are far more advanced than the program's creators\n\n[[Page S6021]]\n\never imagined. Our goal over the past year was to create an atmosphere \nfor further discussion on ways to strengthen and improve the Medicare \nprogram, including proposals for an outpatient prescription drug \nbenefit. Today, we take the first step in the right direction--a \ndirection to bring Medicare in line with the benefits and delivery \nsystems commonplace in the 21st century today.\n  Building on last year's bill and the findings of the Bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of Medicare, the ``Medicare Prescription Drug \nand Modernization Act of 2000'' takes the first steps towards long-term \nMedicare reform while adding a much needed outpatient prescription drug \nbenefit to the program. Unlike in 1965, prescription drugs are integral \nto the delivery of health care and treating diseases prevalent among \nthe elderly population. We must include a prescription drug benefit in \nthe Medicare system. However, we must also address some of the other \nproblems facing Medicare.\n  For instance, we must recognize the need to update the total benefit \npackage and increase the flexibility of the program. Today's Medicare \ncoverage is inadequate, covering only 53 percent of beneficiary's \naverage health costs, and still does not include coverage for many \npreventive services, eyeglasses, or dental care, much less prescription \ndrugs.\n  Medicare is also facing a doubling of beneficiaries over the coming \ndecades. Today, there are 39 million Medicare beneficiaries, but within \nthe next 10 years, 77 million baby boomers will begin entering the \nprogram. Our ability to effectively respond to this increased demand is \nfurther limited by the declining number of workers paying payroll \ntaxes, which fund Medicare obligations each year, as the number of \nworkers per retiree has continued to decline, from 4.5 in 1960 to 3.9 \ntoday. This figure is expected to further decline to 2.8 in 2020.\n  We all know that Medicare spending consumes much of the federal \nbudget. But this will only get worse. Currently absorbing nearly 12 \npercent of the federal outlays, Medicare will balloon to 25 percent of \nthe federal budget by 2030. The program, which relies on general \nrevenues to pay for close to 40 percent of total program expenditures \ntoday, will continue to use an increasing share of general revenues, \nleaving fewer and fewer federal dollars available to support other \nfederal programs.\n  Finally, with over hundred thousand pages of HCFA regulations \ngoverning Medicare, the program has become so bloated and heavily \nmicro-managed that it cannot adopt to the daily advances in medicine \nand health care delivery. Even when life-saving diagnostic tests become \navailable, such as a breakthrough prostate cancer-screening test that \ncame on the market in the early 1990s, it takes years before they can \nbe approved. Medicare has only recently begun reimbursing for prostate \nscreening and only because a new law was passed to allow it.\n  The very fact that Congress must past such laws illustrates perfectly \nthe problem with a heavily micro-managed system. No government program \ncan possibly keep up with the increasingly rapid rate at which new \ndrugs and technologies are brought to the market. As a physician, I \nknow that today, more than ever, access to lifesaving drugs and \ntechnology as they become available is the key to providing quality \nhealth care, and we must modernize Medicare to meet these demands.\n  The need to modernize Medicare has never been more apparent. The \nmeasures included in the ``Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization \nAct of 2000'' will provide seniors the option to choose the kind of \nhealth care coverage that best suit their individual needs, including \nenhanced benefits, outpatient prescription drug coverage, and \nprotections against high out-of-pocket drug costs.\n  The ``Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2000'' \nestablishes that Competitive Medicare Agency (CMA), an independent, \nexecutive-branch agency to spearhead an advanced level of Medicare \nmanagement and oversight--leaving behind the intransigent bureaucracy \nand outdated mindset infecting the program and instead guaranteeing \nseniors choice, health care security, and improved benefits and \ndelivery of care. Modeled after the Social Security Administration, the \nCMA functions in a manner similar to the Office of Personnel \nManagement, which has a 40-year track record of success in providing \nquality comprehensive health coverage for the millions of federal \nemployees and their families through the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program.\n  Vital to this bill is the Prescription Drug and Supplemental Benefit \nProgram that provides beneficiaries outpatient prescription drugs and \nother additional benefits through new Medicare Prescription Plus plans \noffered by private entities or through Medicare+Choice plans. The drug \nbenefit will provide, at a minimum, a standard prescription drug \npackage consisting of a $250 deductible, 50 percent cost-sharing up to \n$2,100, and stop-loss protection at $6,000. Seniors are guaranteed this \nminimum benefits, but also have the choice of other drug benefit \npackages. I recognize more than anyone that a one-size-fits-all \napproach to health care does not work. It is important to pass along \nthe same choices we, as members of Congress, have, Seniors deserve no \nless.\n  We ensure that low-income beneficiaries receive necessary drug \ncoverage by providing premium subsidies. Beneficiaries below 135 \npercent of poverty, beneficiaries receive a 100 percent premium subsidy \nand 95 percent of all cost-sharing. Beneficiaries between 135% and 150 \npercent of poverty receive premium subsidiaries on a sliding scale from \na much as 100 percent to no less than 25 percent, and all \nbeneficiaries, regardless of income, will receive a 25% premium \nsubsidy. Since 39 percent of beneficiaries below 150 percent of poverty \nhave no drug coverage, this provision alone will provide comprehensive \ndrug coverage for over 5 million seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities.\n\n  We also address the high costs of drugs by ensuring that no \nbeneficiary will ever pay retail prices for prescription drugs again. \nWe do this through a prescription drug discount card program that \npasses on price discounts negotiated between pharmaceutical companies \nand insurers to beneficiaries. For example, today a senior may pay $100 \nfor a particular drug. Under the ``Medicare Prescription Drug and \nModernization Act of 2000'', this senior would have access to the \ninsurers negotiated rate of $70, but then would also receive an even \nfurther discount through coinsurance, reducing the total price of the \ndrug by over 60 percent down to just $35.\n  The ``Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2000'' \nmodernizes Medicare by establishing a new competitive system under \nMedicare+Choice where plans bid for the costs of delivering care and \ncompete with traditional Medicare based on benefits, price, and quality \nso that beneficiaries receive the highest-quality, affordable health \ncare possible. Under this new system, plans are allowed maximum \nflexibility to reduce current beneficiary Part B premiums and cost-\nsharing as well as offer new and additional benefits to beneficiaries, \nincluding outpatient prescription drug coverage.\n  Finally, the ``Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of \n2000'', for the first time in Medicare's history provides lawmakers and \nthe public a better measure for evaluating Medicare's financial health \nand establishes strong reporting requirements for the Medicare program \nas a whole.\n  Medicare must be modernized to provide seniors integrated health care \nchoices, including outpatient prescription drug coverage. This \nafternoon my colleagues and I have moved beyond the demagoguery and \ndisinformation campaigns and have come together to propose bipartisan \nlegislation that balances the very real need for outpatient \nprescription drug coverage with the need for meaningful modernizations. \nBy moving forward on this legislation, I believe we can truly provide \nchoice and security for our Medicare beneficiaries to ensure their \nindividual health care needs are met, today and well into the \nfuture.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2809. A bill to protect the health and welfare of children \ninvolved in research; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n                   children's research protection act\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Ohio, \nSenator DeWine, to introduce important legislation to enhance the \nsafety\n\n[[Page S6022]]\n\nof our children. The Children's Research Protection Act will strengthen \nprotections for children participating in research and also increase \nthe number researchers expert in pediatric pharmacology.\n  Three years ago, Senator DeWine and I were successful in enacting \nlegislation to reverse a troubling statistic--the fact that only 20 \npercent of drugs on the market have been tested specifically for their \nsafety and efficacy in children. Our legislation, The Better \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act, for the first time provided a \nincentive for drug companies to test their products for use with \nchildren. The results of that legislation have been overwhelming. In \nthe 2 years since this initiative was started, drug manufacturers have \nlaunched more than 300 new pediatric studies of 127 drugs. In contrast, \nin the 5 years prior to enactment of our legislation, the industry \nconducted only 11 pediatric safety studies for drugs already on the \nmarket--11 studies in five years versus over 300 in just 2 years. The \nmost immediate consequence of this surge in the industry's interest in \ntesting their products in children is the rapid increase in the number \nof children being signed up to participate in research studies--more \nthan 18,000 children will eventually be needed just for the 300 trials \nthat have been proposed so far.\n  While we're thrilled with the success of our legislation, it has \nforced us to take a hard look at the adequacy of the safety protections \nfor children participating in research. All experimental treatments, by \ntheir very nature, contain some risk. Research involving children is no \nexception. Yet, despite the risks, each year thousands of parents agree \nto allow their children to participate in a clinical trial, either in \nhopes of improving their own health or the health of other children. In \ndoing so, they place their trust in the expertise and ethics of the \nresearchers and in strong oversight by the federal government. The vast \nmajority of the time that trust is well-founded. But recent isolated \nincidents involving children harmed during clinical trials, as well as \nincreasing concerns about the adequacy of federal oversight for \nclinical trials, generally point to the need to proactively address the \nissue of the safety of children in research.\n  It is that need to be proactive that has led Senator DeWine and I to \nintroduce the Children's Research Protection Act. This legislation will \naddress critical safety issues in children's research by:\n  (1) Requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to \nreview the current regulations for the protection of children \nparticipating in research and to clarify and update them to ensure the \nhighest standards of safety.\n  Requiring that all HHS funded and regulated research comply with \nthese strengthened federal protections. (Currently research overseen by \nthe Food and Drug Administration, but funded by private pharmaceutical \ncompanies, is not required to comply with the additional children's \nprotections, although many pharmaceutical companies do so voluntarily.)\n  (3) Requiring the 15 federal agencies that don't currently have \nspecial guidelines for children's research to develop them within 12 \nmonths.\n  (4) Asking the Secretary of HHS to review the adequacy of the IRB \n(Institutional Review Board) process for protecting children in \nclinical trials and to report to Congress within 6 months on the \nquestion of whether we should have a national board(s) to review \nadverse events arising out of research on children.\n  (5) Increasing the number of researchers that are experts in \nconducting drug research with children by providing grants for \nfellowship training and creating a loan repayment program for pediatric \ndrug researchers. Only 20 physicians complete clinical pharmacology \nspeciality training programs each year--of these, only 2 or fewer \nspecialize in pediatric pharmacology.\n  We still have a long way to go to make sure that children are not an \nafterthought when it comes to drug research, but we can start by making \nsure that when they volunteer to help other children by participating \nin research, their safety is paramount. This measure prescribes a \nstrong dose of safety for our children. It provides critically \nimportant safeguards and protections when it comes to pediatric \nmedicine testing, allowing us to increase our knowledge of children's \nmedication without increasing the danger to children.\n  I am pleased to join Senator DeWine in this effort and I look forward \nto working with my colleague to pass this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attached letters and a copy of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2809\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \n     enactment of the provisions of the Food and Drug \n     Administration Modernization Act (Public Law 105-115) \n     relating to pediatric studies of drugs, however, is expected \n     to increase the pediatric testing of pharmaceuticals and thus \n     to increase the numbers of children involved in research.\n       (4) Children are a vulnerable population and thus need \n     additional protections for their involvement in research \n     relative to adults. Yet, current Federal guidelines for the \n     protection of children involved in research have not been \n     updated since 1981, do not currently apply to Food and Drug \n     Administration-regulated research that is not Federally \n     funded, and have not been adopted by all Federal agencies \n     that conduct research involving children.\n       (5) Currently, in the United States, there is a shortage of \n     pharmacologists trained to address the unique aspects of \n     developing therapies for children. There are fewer than 200 \n     academic-based clinical pharmacologists in the United States, \n     of which 20 percent or fewer are pediatricians. Currently, \n     only 20 physicians complete clinical pharmacology specialty \n     training programs each year, and of these, only 2 or fewer \n     specialize in pediatric pharmacology.\n       (b) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) ensure the adequate and appropriate protection of \n     children involved in research by--\n       (A) reviewing and updating as needed the Federal \n     regulations that provide additional protections for children \n     participating in research as contained in subpart D of part \n     45 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations;\n       (B) extending such subpart D to all research regulated by \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services; and\n       (C) requiring that all Federal agencies adopt regulations \n     for additional protections for children involved in research \n     that is conducted, supported, or regulated by the Federal \n     Government; and\n       (2) ensure that an adequate number of pediatric clinical \n     pharmacologists are trained and retained, in order to meet \n     the increased demand for expertise in this area created by \n     the pediatric studies provisions of the Food and Drug \n     Administration Modernization Act (Public law 105-115), so \n     that all children have access to medications that have been \n     adequately and properly tested on children.\n       (c) Definition.--In this Act, the term ``pediatric clinical \n     pharmacologist'' means an individual--\n       (1) who is board certified in pediatrics; and\n       (2) who has additional formal training and expertise in \n     human pharmacology.\n\n     SEC. 3. REVIEW OF REGULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Review.--By not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall have conducted a review of the regulations \n     under subpart D of part 45 of title 46, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, considered any modifications necessary to ensure \n     the adequate and appropriate protection of children \n     participating in research, and report the findings of the \n     Secretary back to Congress.\n       (b) Areas of Review.--In conducting the review under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall consider--\n       (1) the appropriateness of the regulations for children of \n     differing ages and maturity levels, including legal status;\n       (2) the definition of ``minimal risk'' and the manner in \n     which such definition varies for a healthy child as compared \n     to a child with an illness;\n       (3) the definitions of ``assent'' and ``permission'' for \n     child clinical research participants and their parents or \n     guardians and of ``adequate provisions'' for soliciting \n     assent or permission in research as such definitions relate \n     to the process of obtaining the informed consent of children \n     participating in research and the parents or guardians of \n     such children;\n       (4) the definitions of ``direct benefit to the individual \n     subjects'' and ``generalizable\n\n[[Page S6023]]\n\n     knowledge about the subject's disorder or condition'';\n       (5) whether or not payment (financial or otherwise) may be \n     provided to a child or his or her parent or guardian for the \n     participation of the child in research, and if so, the amount \n     and type given;\n       (6) the expectations of child research participants and \n     their parent or guardian for the direct benefits of the \n     child's research involvement;\n       (7) safeguards for research involving children conducted in \n     emergency situations with a waiver of informed assent;\n       (8) parent and child notification in instances in which the \n     regulations have not been complied with;\n       (9) compliance with the regulations in effect on the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the monitoring of such compliance, \n     and enforcement actions for violations of such regulations; \n     and\n       (10) the appropriateness of current practices for \n     recruiting children for participation in research.\n       (c) Consultation.--In conducting the review under \n     subsection (a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall consult broadly with experts in the field, including \n     pediatric pharmacologists, pediatricians, bioethics experts, \n     clinical investigators, institutional review boards, industry \n     experts, and children who have participated in research \n     studies and the parents or guardians of such children.\n       (d) Consideration of Additional Provisions.--In conducting \n     the review under subsection (a), the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services shall consider and, not later than 6 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, report back to \n     Congress concerning--\n       (1) whether the Secretary should establish national data \n     and safety monitoring boards to review adverse events \n     associated with research involving children; and\n       (2) whether the institutional review board oversight of \n     clinical trials involving children is adequate to protect the \n     children.\n\n     SEC. 4. REQUIREMENT FOR ADDITIONAL PROTECTIONS FOR CHILDREN \n                   INVOLVED IN RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall \n     require that all research involving children that is \n     conducted, supported, or regulated by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services be in compliance with subpart D of \n     part 45 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       ``(b) Other Federal Agencies.--Not later than 12 months \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, all Federal agencies \n     shall have promulgated regulations to provide additional \n     protections for children involved in research.\n\n     SEC. 5. GRANTS FOR PEDIATRIC PHARMACOLOGY.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall award grants to qualified academic research \n     institutions and research networks with the appropriate \n     expertise to provide training in pediatric clinical \n     pharmacology, such as the Pediatric Pharmacology Research \n     Units of the National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development, and the Research Units of the National Institute \n     of Mental Health, to enable such entities to provide \n     fellowship training to individuals who hold an M.D. in order \n     to ensure the specialized training of pediatric clinical \n     pharmacologists.\n       (b) Amount of Grant.--In awarding grants under subsection \n     (a), the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure \n     that each grantee receive adequate amounts under the grant to \n     enable the grantee to fund at least 1 fellow each year for a \n     3-year period, at a total of $100,000 per fellowship per \n     year.\n       (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this section, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated such sums as may be necessary for each fiscal \n     year.\n\n     SEC. 6. LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM REGARDING CLINICAL \n                   RESEARCHERS.\n\n       Part G of title IV of the Public Health Service Act is \n     amended by inserting after section 487E (42 U.S.C. 288-5) the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 487F. LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM REGARDING PEDIATRIC \n                   PHARMACOLOGY.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The Secretary, acting through the \n     Director of the National Institutes of Health, shall \n     establish a program to enter into contracts with qualified \n     individuals who hold an M.D. under which such individuals \n     agree to undergo training in, and practice, pediatric \n     pharmacology, in consideration of the Federal Government \n     agreeing to repay, for each year of service as a pediatric \n     pharmacologist, not more than $35,000 of the principal and \n     interest of the educational loans of such individuals.\n       ``(b) Application of Provisions.--The provisions of \n     sections 338B, 338C, and 338E shall, except as inconsistent \n     with subsection (a) of this section, apply to the program \n     established under subsection (a) to the same extent and in \n     the same manner as such provisions apply to the National \n     Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program established in \n     subpart III of part D of title III.\n       ``(c) Funding.--\n       ``(1) Authorization of appropriations.--For the purpose of \n     carrying out this section, there are authorized to be \n     appropriated such sums as may be necessary for each fiscal \n     year.\n       ``(2) Availability.--Amounts appropriated for carrying out \n     this section shall remain available until the expiration of \n     the second fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year for \n     which the amounts were made available.''.\n\n     SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of sections 5 and 6 shall take effect on the \n     date that is 6 months after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 1, 2000.\n       Dear Senator Dodd, I am addressing you today in support of \n     proposed senate bill, AAC: ``Children's Research Protection \n     Act'' ``. . . that will protect the health and welfare of \n     children involved in research.'' Additionally, this bill will \n     serve to ascertain whether specific guidelines should be \n     included in the Code of Federal Regulations for conducting \n     research with other vulnerable members of our society.\n       As a long time advocate and provider of services for \n     persons with disabilities, families and children, my ongoing \n     research of the informed consent process as it relates to \n     clinical trials dates back to 1979. At that time, I focused \n     on some very complex issues of conducting medical research \n     with children who had mental retardation and were being \n     placed under state care.\n       We are a wealthy and powerful nation and I believe that our \n     children are our greatest treasure. They deserve the highest \n     ethical standards that we can provide in all areas of their \n     lives including medical research and health. With the passage \n     of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act, we \n     have widened the field of pediatric clinical research, as \n     should be the case since until this time it has been \n     seriously lacking attention. Due to this surge in new \n     research, it is the opportune time to review federal \n     regulations that provide guidelines for clinical trials. We \n     need to close gaps and better define protections so that our \n     children will be offered the safest environment possible \n     during research efforts. Furthermore, the parents and \n     guardians of our children need to have every advantage and \n     possible opportunity afforded them so they can more fully \n     understand the experimental nature of any research before \n     giving consent.\n       I am particularly excited that there are provisions in this \n     bill to help increase the number of pediatric clinical \n     pharmacologists and clinical investigators. This action will \n     strengthen the quality of research and treatment prescribed \n     for children.\n       In closing, this bill helps reach a goal of optimal health \n     therapy for our children. As always, I appreciate the hard \n     work and time that has been expended to bring this issue \n     forward for legislative action. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sheila S. Mulvey.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      May 1, 2000.\n       To Whom It May Concern: My name is David Krol and I am a \n     pediatrician in New Haven, Connecticut and a recent graduate \n     of pediatric residency training. I am writing in support of \n     the Children's Research Protection Act. As both a practicing \n     pediatrican and a child health researcher I am very \n     interested in studies that can improve the lives of children. \n     These studies, however, need to keep in mind the unique \n     biology of children as well as the developmental needs of \n     those who would participate in these studies. Children are \n     most definitely a unique population and require protections \n     in the research environment that are adequate, appropriate, \n     and different from adults. I am pleased to see that the \n     Children's Research and Protection Act addresses these \n     issues.\n       In addition, as a recent graduate from medical school with \n     a debt burden hovering near $90,000, I am very aware of the \n     difficult decision that many medical school graduates face in \n     choosing a specialty. It can be a very difficult decision to \n     pursue further training and postpone the reduction of the \n     significant debt many of us face. Those who pursue pediatric \n     subspecialty training, including pediatric pharmacologists, \n     are no exception to this fact. I am very happy to see that \n     the Children's Research Protection Act provides both funding \n     for pediatric pharmacology positions and loan repayment for \n     those who would choose to further their education in such an \n     important and rewarding specialty. I hope we can extend this \n     opportunity to all who pursue pediatric subspecialty \n     training. Pediatric research requires not only experts in \n     pediatric pharmacology but also in the specific diseases that \n     need to be researched.\n       It is with great pleasure that I write this letter in \n     support of the Children's Research Protection Act. I ask for \n     your support concerning this important issue in child health.\n           Sincerely,\n     David M. Krol, MD.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\n                                                      May 1, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and DeWine: The American Academy of \n     Pediatrics, representing 55,000 pediatricians throughout the \n     United States, is pleased to support the Children's Research \n     Protection Act. This legislation provides appropriate and \n     needed requirements for the inclusion of children in any \n     research conducted, supported, or regulated by the U.S. \n     Department of Health and Human Services.\n       Protection of children in all research settings is an \n     imperative. Under your strong\n\n[[Page S6024]]\n\n     leadership, important advances are being made in therapeutic \n     research for children through the Food and Drug \n     Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA). As a result of \n     FDAMA, the increase in the number of new clinical trials \n     involving pediatric patients is unprecedented. The Children's \n     Research Protection Act balances the need to continue and \n     encourage more and better clinical trials involving children \n     while at the same time ensuring that children are protected \n     by requiring that all research be in compliance with subpart \n     D of part 45 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations.\n       This legislation also recognizes the importance of \n     increasing the number of pediatric clinical researchers \n     through the grant and loan repayment provisions. We strongly \n     believe that this kind of greater support is needed for all \n     pediatric research scientists. Still, we recognize that this \n     legislation specifically addresses FDAMA's significant \n     increase on the need for additional pediatric clinical \n     pharmacologists to conduct pediatric drug studies. The grant \n     program and loan repayment provisions of this bill are \n     important incentives to securing greater numbers of well-\n     trained experts of pediatric clinical pharmacology, and can \n     hopefully be used as models for promoting a broader scope of \n     pediatric research.\n       Throughout the years, you have been a strong and successful \n     advocate for children and their needs and the American \n     Academy of Pediatrics is grateful to you. The Children's \n     Research Protection Act will be an advance for children. We \n     offer our assistance as this bill moves through the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Donald E. Cook, MD, FAAP,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Pharmaceutical Research and\n\n\n                                     Manufacturers of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 2000.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators DeWine and Dodd: The Pharmaceutical Research \n     and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) is pleased to offer its \n     support for The Children's Research Protection Act. This \n     piece of legislation addresses several key gaps towards the \n     successful implementation of Section 111 of the Food and Drug \n     Modernization Act of 1997 (FDAMA). This particular section of \n     FDAMA has had an enormous impact on the investigation of \n     important medicines in children. There has been a remarkable \n     increase in the number of medicines being studied by \n     pharmaceutical companies. The pharmaceutical industry has \n     proposed pediatric studies on 177 medicines and the FDA has \n     issued 145 written requests for studies as of May 1, 2000. In \n     the short time since its inception, the legislation has \n     fundamentally changed our approach to the study of medicines \n     in children and holds enormous promise for improved treatment \n     of sick children.\n       Several issues have become apparent as we have embarked on \n     this new era of clinical investigation. There is clearly a \n     shortage of experienced pediatric clinical pharmacologists, \n     and those active in the field are generally quite senior. \n     There is thus a need for training the next generation of \n     investigators. If children are to receive the benefits of the \n     new medicines now under development, and of the exciting \n     therapies of the future, we will need highly qualified \n     pediatric investigators, knowledgeable in the safe, ethical, \n     and efficient study of medicines in children. The NICHD \n     Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit network has been \n     instrumental in doing excellent studies in this area, and is \n     an exemplary training ground for young pediatric \n     investigators. It is vital that pediatric clinical \n     investigation be performed by our best physician/scientists, \n     in centers fully equipped to ensure a positive environment \n     for children who participate in studies, and to ensure that \n     all studies are done with the very highest standards of \n     clinical investigation and clinical care.\n       It is also crucial, as the number of patients studied is \n     expanding, to re-emphasize the ethical standards for \n     conducting studies in children. The FDA has held meetings of \n     its Pediatric Pharmacology Subcommittee, and one issue of \n     concern was that the DHHS Guidelines in investigation of \n     vulnerable subjects, 45 CRF 46, Subpart D does not cover all \n     of the studies or investigative centers where studies of \n     medicines under FDAMA might be done. It is clear that it is \n     in the interest of children, and of the clinical \n     investigative process, that the provision be reviewed and \n     that all studies of medicines in children be covered under \n     this provision.\n       To assure career paths for the new trainees in pediatric \n     clinical pharmacology, renewal of Section 111 of FDAMA is \n     particularly important since it assures continued pediatric \n     clinical investigation of new medicines. These two \n     legislative initiatives will have a major impact on the \n     future of the health of our children.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stephen P. Spielberg, MD, Ph.D.,\n     Vice President, Pediatric Drug Development, Janssen Research \n     Foundation, Chair, Pediatric Task Force, PhRMA.\n     Alan Goldhammer, Ph.D.,\n       Associate Vice President, US Regulatory Affairs PhRMA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     American Society for Clinical\n\n\n                                Pharmacology and Therapeutics,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 16, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: The American Society for Clinical \n     Pharmacology and Therapeutics is pleased to express support \n     of the Children's Research Protection Act. Our society is the \n     largest academic society of clinical pharmacologists in the \n     United States and consists of member scientists, clinicians \n     and researchers from the academic, regulatory and industry \n     sectors including physicians, PhDs and PharmDs. We endorse \n     the great need for this legislation as a means of improving \n     the care of children by improving medications available to \n     them and by increasing the effective use of medicines that \n     are already on the market for children. In addition, we \n     believe that the provisions of this legislation will \n     ultimately lead to a reduced incidence of side effects and \n     the rate of medication errors in children.\n       There are only two pediatric clinical pharmacology training \n     programs in this country, and it is estimated that the number \n     of practicing pediatric clinical pharmacologists may be as \n     few as 20. Consequently, it is little wonder that 80% of the \n     drugs already on the market have yet to be approved for use \n     in children. We must expand the cadre of well-trained \n     pediatric clinical pharmacologists who can focus their \n     scientific and clinical skills on assuring that children have \n     access to the same therapies readily available to adult \n     patients. Further, special studies are required regarding the \n     proper dosage and safe use of medications in children. The \n     ASCPT applauds your recognition of these needs, and we \n     believe that your bill includes the means to these ends: a \n     program to increase the number of funded pediatric clinical \n     pharmacology fellowships and a loan repayment program to \n     attract physicians to careers in clinical pharmacology will \n     improve the health of children through the safe use of \n     available medications.\n       Thank you for your leadership on children's health care, \n     and please add the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology \n     and Therapeutics to the list of organizations endorsing the \n     Children's Research Protection Act.\n           Yours sincerely,\n                                         Raymond L. Woosley, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                         Children's Hospitals,\n\n                                      Alexandria, VA, May 9, 2000.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Dodd and DeWine. On behalf of the National \n     Association of Children's Hospitals (N.A.C.H.), an \n     organization representing more than 100 freestanding \n     children's hospitals and pediatric departments of major \n     medical centers, I am writing to support the ``Children's \n     Research Protection Act.'' This legislation represents an \n     important step in assuring that children enrolled in \n     federally supported and/or regulated research receive \n     important protections for their safety and well-being when \n     participating as research subjects.\n       Children's hospitals are major centers for pediatric \n     clinical research--research supported by the federal \n     government, as well as private industry. The biomedical \n     research efforts undertaken by children's hospitals recognize \n     that ``children are not little adults'' and that their unique \n     needs must be taken into account when developing and \n     monitoring research protocols to address pediatric diseases \n     and conditions. With the relatively recent adoption of the \n     Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA), the \n     number of children enrolled in pediatric clinical trials is \n     rising. Therefore, it is especially important that a \n     consistent set of additional protections for children \n     participating in research, such as those included within \n     subpart D of part 45 of title 46, Code of Federal Regulations \n     (i.e. the ``common rule''), be reviewed and extended to all \n     federally conducted, supported, or regulated clinical \n     research.\n       The ``Children's Research Protection Act'' also establishes \n     a grant program and loan repayment provision to help address \n     the expected shortage of pediatric clinical pharmacologists \n     and clinical investigators trained to develop therapies for \n     children. This is especially important given the increased \n     demand for expertise in this area created by the pediatric \n     studies provisions of FDAMA. In addition, we are hopeful that \n     such a model of grant and loan repayment can eventually be \n     replicated to provide added incentives to increase the \n     overall pediatric research workforce, such as is proposed in \n     Sen. Bond's ``Healthy Kids 2000 Act.''\n       N.A.C.H. applauds your efforts for introducing this \n     important piece of legislation. Please feel free to contact \n     me if I can be of further assistance as this bill moves \n     through Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Lawrence A. McAndrews.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, in introducing the Children's \nResearch Protection Act. This bill is a logical and\n\n[[Page S6025]]\n\nnecessary follow-up to the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, \nwhich Senator Dodd and I got passed and enacted into law in 1997 as \npart of the FDA Modernization Act. This law created incentives for drug \nmanufacturers for use by children. Since the law has been in place, \nmore children than ever before are participating in clinical trials for \ndrug testing.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that we test drugs for children--on \nchildren. There are several reasons that such testing is necessary. \nChildren have different physical make-ups from adults, which means they \nmetabolize drugs differently. They likely need different doses and \ndifferent amounts of time between doses for medications to be safe and \neffective. Also, because the same disease can manifest itself very \ndifferently in children and adults, we need to thoroughly test the \ndrugs that we are using for children to treat the same illness.\n  As I noted already, since our Better Pharmaceuticals Act was enacted, \nwe have seen a rapid increase in the number of children being enrolled \nin clinical trials. More than 18,000 children will be needed just for \nthe 300 studies that have been proposed so far. Research has been \ncompleted and exclusivity granted on 22 drugs that were previously used \nfor children without safety information, and more than 300 pediatric \nstudies of 127 products are currently underway. Of those 22 drugs for \nwhich studies have been completed, eight drugs have already been re-\nlabeled to reflect, the new pediatric safety information.\n  In contrast, in the five years prior to enactment of our Better \nPharmaceuticals Act, only 11 studies to gather additional pediatric \nsafety information about drugs already on the market were conducted--\nthat's 11 studies in five years versus over 125 in just two years since \nthis legislation was enacted. The increase in pediatric studies is good \nnews for children and parents and is certainly a welcome improvement at \na time when only one in five drugs currently on the market in the \nUnited States has been approved for use by children.\n  While we want to encourage better drug testing for children, we also \nneed to ensure that strong federal protections are in place to protect \nchildren who participate in such research. Tragically, there are parts \nof the current law that do not protect children who participate in HHS \nfederally-regulated research, unless it is also federally funded \nresearch. These federal protections for children also have not been \nupdated since 1981, and have not been adopted by all of the federal \nagents that conduct research involving children.\n  That's why the Children's Research Protection Act we are introducing \nwould require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to \nreview the current regulations governing the protection of children \nparticipating in research and update them to ensure that the strongest \nfederal protections exist for such children.\n  Now, only HHS federally funded and federally regulated research has \nto comply with certain protections for children.\n  Our bill also would extend research protections for children to all \nresearch regulated by the Secretary of HHS, even if it is not federally \nfunded.\n  Furthermore, our bill would require that all other federal agencies \nthat conduct, support, or regulate research involving children must \nadopt regulations to provide greater protections for those children.\n  Finally, our bill would address the shortage of pediatric clinical \npharmacologists whose specialized expertise is essential in performing \npediatric studies, because the bill would authorize grants to ensure \nthat an adequate number of pediatric clinical pharmacologists and \nclinical investigators are trained and retained to meet the increased \ndemand for expertise created by the Better Pharmaceuticals law. There \nare fewer than 200 academic-based clinical pharmacologists in the \nUnited States, of whom 20 percent are pediatricians. Moreover, the bill \nwould authorize the Secretary of HHS to enter into loan repayment \ncontracts with doctors who agree to train and practice in pediatric \npharmacology.\n  Mr. President, it is very important that we pass our legislation this \nyear. While we have successfully encouraged better drug testing for \nchildren through the incentives in the ``Better Pharmaceuticals for \nChildren Act,'' we must take the next step and ensure that strong \nfederal protections are in place to protect the children who \nparticipate in such research.\n  The children who are participating in clinical trials are medical \npioneers. They will help to ensure that drugs used for children will be \nproven to be safe and appropriate for use in children. At the very \nleast, we should make certain that strong federal safeguards exist to \nensure their safety as they participate in these trials.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2810. A bill to amend the Consumer Product Safety Act to confirm \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission's jurisdiction over child safety \ndevices for handguns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                THE CHILD HANDGUN INJURY PREVENTION ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe Child Handgun Injury Prevention Act being introduced by my friend \nand colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry. I support this bill \nbecause I believe it will save lives.\n  Recently, we have all witnessed a disturbing trend. Day after day \nafter day, we see shocking news reports about children dying because \nthey got their hands on a loaded, unlocked firearm. In 1999 alone, this \nwas an almost daily occurrence. Last year, more than 300 children died \nin gun accidents. Most of these accidents occurred in a child's own \nhome, or in the home of a close friend or relative--the very places \nwhere these children should feel the safest.\n  Mr. President, the mixture of children and loaded firearms is deadly. \nAn estimated 3.3 million children in the United States live in homes \nwith firearms--firearms that are always or sometimes loaded and \nunlocked. I believe that the majority of parents with firearms believe \nthey are being responsible about gun storage and other safety measures \ndealing with firearms. But, the sad fact is that some parents simply \nhave a fundamental misunderstanding of a child's ability to access and \nfire a gun, to distinguish between real and toy guns, to make good \njudgments about handling a gun, and to consistently follow rules about \ngun safety. These are children, after all, and we can't expect them to \nunderstand completely what is involved with handling a gun safely.\n  Here's a startling fact: Nearly two-thirds of parents with school-age \nchildren who keep a gun in the home believe that the firearm is safe \nfrom their children. However, another study found that when a gun was \nin the home, 75 to 80 percent of first and second graders knew where \nthe gun was kept.\n  Many gun owners, state and local governments, as well as this Senate, \nhave started to recognize the combustible relationship between children \nand loaded, accessible firearms. This recognition has led many gun \nowners to purchase gun safety locks to ensure the safe storage of their \nhandguns. In some states, gun locks are required at the time handguns \nare purchased. Seventeen states have Child Firearm Access Prevention \nlaws that permit prosecution of adults if their firearm is left \nunsecured and a child uses that firearm to harm themselves or others. \nAnd, also, the Senate passed an amendment to the juvenile justice bill \nlast year that would require the use of gun safety locks.\n  Despite the fact that gun owners are buying more firearm safety \ndevices and governments are rushing to mandate their use, surprisingly \nthere are no minimum safety standards for these devices. Currently, \nthere are many different types of trigger locks, safety locks, lock \nboxes, and other devices available. And, there is a wide range in the \nquality and effectiveness of these devices. Some are inadequate to \nprevent the accidental discharge of the firearm or to prevent a child \naccess to the firearm.\n  As governments move toward mandated safety devices, it is crucial \nthat consumers know whether or not the devices they are buying will \nactually keep children from harming themselves. If states are going to \nprosecute adults when a child uses a firearm, these gun owners should--\nat the very\n\n[[Page S6026]]\n\nleast--have some peace of mind that their gun storage or safety lock \ndevice is adequate.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with Senator Kerry would help \nresponsible gun owners and parents know that the safety devices they \nbuy are at least minimally adequate. This legislation just makes sense. \nIt requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to formulate \nminimum safety standards for gun safety locks and to ensure that only \nadequate locks meeting those standards are available for purchase by \nconsumers. The standards to be used by the Commission require that gun \nsafety locks are sufficiently difficult for children to deactivate or \nremove and that the safety locks prevent the discharge of the handgun \nunless the lock has been deactivated or removed.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to note what this bill does not do. \nFirst of all, it does not give CPSC any say in standards of firearms or \nammunition. In other words, it is not intended to regulate firearms, \nthemselves, in any way whatsoever. Second, it would not mandate which \ntype of gun lock device consumers use.\n  As I said earlier, there are many different types of gun locks \ncurrently available. Some of these allow for easy access and use of \nfirearms for adults should they decide that is important to them. Other \ndevices are more cumbersome and do not provide quick and easy access. \nGun owners would be free to decide what device is best for them. This \nlegislation would have no effect on that issue. Finally, this \nlegislation does not require the use of gun safety locks. While the \nSenate has already passed legislation to do this, if that language is \nremoved in conference, this legislation will not affect that.\n  As I have stated already, Mr. President, I believe that this \nlegislation will save lives. But, more than that, this legislation will \nempower parents--parents who decide that they want to have a gun safety \nlock but are awash in a sea of different devices--to purchase only gun \nsafety locks that provide adequate protection for their children. I \nurge my colleagues to join Senator Kerry and me in support of this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 2811.

Res. 329\n\n       Whereas on July 18, 1994, 86 innocent persons were killed \n     and 300 were wounded when the AMIA Jewish Community Center \n     was bombed in Buenos Aires, Argentina;\n       Whereas the United States welcomes Argentine President \n     Fernando de la Rua's political will to pursue the \n     investigation of the bombing of the AMIA Jewish Community \n     Center to its ultimate conclusion;\n       Whereas circumstantial evidence attributes the attack to \n     the terrorist group Hezbollah, based in Lebanon and sponsored \n     by Iran;\n       Whereas the investigation indicates that this bombing could \n     not have been carried out without assistance from former \n     elements of local security forces;\n       Whereas additional evidence indicates that the tri-border \n     area where Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil meet was used to \n     channel resources for the purpose of carrying out the bombing \n     attack;\n       Whereas Argentine officials have acknowledged that there \n     was negligence in the initial phases of the investigation and \n     that the institutional and political conditions must be \n     created to advance the investigation of this terrorist \n     attack;\n       Whereas on March 17, 1992, terrorists bombed the Embassy of \n     Israel in Buenos Aires, killing 29 persons and injuring more \n     than 200 others, and the Government of Argentina has not yet \n     brought anyone to justice for that act of terrorism;\n       Whereas failure to duly punish the culprits of these acts \n     serves to reward these terrorists and help spread terrorism \n     throughout the Western Hemisphere;\n       Whereas the democratic leaders of the Western Hemisphere \n     issued mandates at the 1994 and 1998 Summits of the Americas \n     that condemned terrorism in all its forms and that committed \n     governments to combat terrorist acts anywhere in the Americas \n     with unity and vigor; and\n       Whereas it is the long-standing policy of the United States \n     to stand firm against terrorist attacks wherever and whenever \n     they occur and to work with its allies to ensure that justice \n     is done: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n\n[[Page S6029]]\n\n       (1) reiterates its condemnation of the attack on the AMIA \n     Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in July \n     1994, and remembers the victims of this heinous act;\n       (2) strongly urges the Government of Argentina to fulfill \n     its international obligations and commitments and its promise \n     to the Argentine people by pursuing the local and \n     international connections to this act of terrorism, wherever \n     they may lead, and to duly punish all those who were \n     involved;\n       (3) urges the Government of Argentina to pursue and \n     prosecute any person with ties to Hezbollah or any other \n     terrorist organization;\n       (4) calls on the President to raise this issue in bilateral \n     discussions with Argentine officials and to underscore the \n     United States concern regarding the 6-year delay in the \n     resolution of this case;\n       (5) recommends that the United States Permanent \n     Representative to the Organization of American States should \n     seek support from the countries comprising the Inter-American \n     Committee Against Terrorism to assist, if requested by the \n     Government of Argentina, in the investigation of this \n     terrorist attack;\n       (6) encourages the President to direct United States law \n     enforcement agencies to provide support and cooperation to \n     the Government of Argentina, if requested, for purposes of \n     the investigation into this and other terrorist activities in \n     the tri-border area; and\n       (7) desires a lasting and positive relationship between the \n     United States and Argentina based on a mutual commitment to \n     the rule of law and democracy in the Western Hemisphere and \n     mutual abhorrence of terrorism.\n       Sec. 2.

While Congress intended to cut approximately \n     $100,000,000,000 from the medicare program over 5 years, \n     recent estimates put the actual cut at over $200,000,000,000.\n       (2) A recent study on home health care found that nearly 70 \n     percent of hospital discharge planners surveyed reported a \n     greater difficulty obtaining home health services for \n     medicare beneficiaries as a result of the Balanced Budget Act \n     of 1997.\n       (3) According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \n     rural hospitals were disproportionately affected by the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997, dropping the inpatient margins \n     of such hospitals over 4 percentage points in 1998.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     Congress and the President should act expeditiously to \n     alleviate the adverse impacts of the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 on beneficiaries under the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act and health care providers \n     participating in such program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 BAUCUS (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3685\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Domenici, and Mrs. \nHutchison) submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to the \nbill, H.R. 4577, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n       Sec. ____.

Mr. President, I draw quick attention of the body to \nthe amendment I hope to bring up sometime during the session--or on a \nfreestanding bill--banning gambling on college athletics. There is \ncurrently only one State in the Union where you can bet on college \nsports. That is in Nevada. It is called the ``Vegas Exception.'' That \nhas led to a lot of problems of gambling on college athletics and on \ncollege campuses.\n  Also, one of the aspects I want to point out briefly--and why I want \nto bring this up yet this session of Congress because of the impact it \nis having on our young people--is the expansion into gambling and \ngetting addicted.\n  We are finding that one of the leading gateways for young people to \nget into gambling is through sports gambling--betting on sporting \nevents. That is one of the top two ways of getting young people \ninvolved. They are among the most susceptible to becoming addicted to \ngambling.\n  There is a study by the Harvard Medical School on addiction. It \nreported that college students are three times as likely to develop a \nsevere gambling problem as compared with other adults. It shows that \nthe leading gateway for college students becoming addicted is through \nsports betting.\n  There is only one place in the country where it is legal. That is in \nNevada. It is the ``Vegas Exception.'' That provides this atmosphere \nwhere it is legal or thought to be legal in many places, and we are \nseeing this problem grow.\n  The NCAA is strongly supportive of this amendment. They want to get \nat this issue of gambling that is expanding exponentially across the \ncountry, and the problems they are having they want to be able to deal \nwith so people will know there is a fair game that is going on. They \nwant to deal with it now.\n  Some Members are opposed to this amendment. I simply stand here to \nsay I am prepared to bring this amendment up at any time with limited \ndebate--1 hour of debate equally divided between each side--and I am \nwilling to go late into the night, as it is obvious now at this hour--\nto talk about this issue, get an up-or-down vote on it, and simply move \nforward. If the body agrees, let the body work its will. If the body \ndisagrees, so be it. Let's move on.\n  This is an important issue to our young people, to our colleges, and \nto college athletics. These games should remain honest and not be \ninfluenced by gambling. We are even hearing of some referees now who \nare betting on games. It is causing people to question whether these \nare legitimate sporting events or fixed events on the point spread.\n  I simply continue to state to my colleagues that this is an important \namendment on which I want to get a vote in this session of Congress.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Business \n     Development, Trade Promotion, and Tourism Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United States \n     Constitution recognizes the special relationship between the \n     United States and Indian tribes;\n       (2) beginning in 1970, with the inauguration by the Nixon \n     Administration of the Indian self-determination era, each \n     President has reaffirmed the special government-to-government \n     relationship between Indian tribes and the United States.\n       (3) in 1994, President Clinton issued an Executive \n     memorandum to the heads of departments and agencies that \n     obligated all Federal departments and agencies, particularly \n     those that have an impact on economic development, to \n     evaluate the potential impacts of their actions on Indian \n     tribes;\n       (4) consistent with the principles of inherent tribal \n     sovereignty and the special relationship between Indian \n     tribes and the United States, Indian tribes retain the right \n     to enter into contracts and agreements to trade freely, and \n     seek enforcement of treaty and trade rights;\n       (5) Congress has carried out the responsibility of the \n     United States for the protection and preservation of Indian \n     tribes and the resources of Indian tribes through the \n     endorsement of treaties, and the enactment of other laws, \n     including laws that provide for the exercise of \n     administrative authorizes.\n       (6) the United States has an obligation to guard and \n     preserve the sovereignty of Indian tribes in order to foster \n     strong tribal governments, Indian self-determination, and \n     economic self-sufficiency among Indian tribes;\n       (7) the capacity of Indian tribes to build strong tribal \n     governments and vigorous economies is hindered by the \n     inability of Indian tribes to engage communities that \n     surround Indian lands and outside investors in economic \n     activities on Indian lands;\n       (8) despite the availability of abundant natural resources \n     on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great \n     value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, \n     native Americans suffer high rates of unemployment, poverty, \n     poor health, substandard housing, and associated social ills \n     than those of any other group in the United States;\n       (9) the United States has an obligation to assist Indian \n     tribes with the creation of appropriate economic and \n     political conditions with respect to Indian lands to--\n       (A) encourage investment from outside sources that do not \n     originate with the tribes; and\n       (B) facilitate economic ventures with outside entities that \n     are not tribal entities;\n       (10) the economic success and material well-being of Native \n     American communities depends on the combined efforts of the \n     Federal Government, tribal governments, the private sector, \n     and individuals;\n       (11) the lack of employment and entrepreneurial \n     opportunities in the communities referred to in paragraph (7) \n     has resulted in a multigenerational dependence on Federal \n     assistance that is--\n       (A) insufficient to address the magnitude of needs; and\n       (B) unreliable in availability; and\n       (12) the twin goals of economic self-sufficiency and \n     political self-determination for Native Americans can best be \n     served by marking available to address the challenges faced \n     by those groups--\n       (A) the resources of the private market;\n       (B) adequate capital; and\n       (C) technical expertise.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To revitalize economically and physically distressed \n     Native American economies by--\n       (A) encouraging the formation of new businesses by eligible \n     entities, and the expansion of existing businesses; and\n       (B) facilitating the movement of goods to and from Indian \n     lands and the provision of services by Indians.\n       (2) To promote private investment in the economies of \n     Indian tribes and to encourage the sustainable development of \n     resources of Indian tribes and Indian-owned businesses.\n       (3) To promote the long-range sustained growth of the \n     economies of Indian tribes.\n       (4) To raise incomes of Indians in order to reduce the \n     number of Indians at poverty levels and provide the means for \n     achieving a higher standard of living on Indian reservations.\n       (5) To encourage intertribal, regional, and international \n     trade and business development in order to assist in \n     increasing productivity and the standard of living of members \n     of Indian tribes and improving the economic self-sufficiency \n     of the governing bodies of Indian tribes.\n       (6) To promote economic self-sufficiency and political \n     self-determination for Indian tribes and members of Indian \n     tribes.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Radiation Exposure \n     Compensation Act Amendments of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210 \n     note) recognized the responsibility of the Federal Government \n     to compensate individuals who were harmed by the mining of \n     radioactive materials or fallout from nuclear arms testing;\n       (2) a congressional oversight hearing conducted by the \n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate \n     demonstrated that since enactment of the Radiation Exposure \n     Compensation Act (42 U.S.C. 2210 note), regulatory burdens \n     have made it too difficult for some deserving individuals to \n     be fairly and efficiently compensated;\n       (3) reports of the Atomic Energy Commission and the \n     National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health testify \n     to the need to extend eligibility to States in which the \n     Federal Government sponsored uranium mining and milling from \n     1941 through 1971;\n       (4) scientific data resulting from the enactment of the \n     Radiation Exposed Veterans Compensation Act of 1988 (38 \n     U.S.C. 101 note), and obtained from the Committee on the \n     Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiations, and the \n     President's Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments \n     provide medical validation for the extension of compensable \n     radiogenic pathologies;\n       (5) above-ground uranium miners, millers and individuals \n     who transported ore should be fairly compensated, in a manner \n     similar to that provided for underground uranium miners, in \n     cases in which those individuals suffered disease or \n     resultant death, associated with radiation exposure, due to \n     the failure of the Federal Government to warn and otherwise \n     help protect citizens from the health hazards addressed by \n     the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. \n     2210 note); and\n       (6) it should be the responsibility of the Federal \n     Government in partnership with State and local governments \n     and appropriate healthcare organizations, to initiate and \n     support programs designed for the early detection, prevention \n     and education on radiogenic diseases in approved States to \n     aid the thousands of individuals adversely affected by the \n     mining of uranium and the testing of nuclear weapons for the \n     Nation's weapons arsenal.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Congress is approving \none of my top legislative priorities, the ``Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act Amendments of 2000,'' (S. 1515) which will update the \ncompensation program Congress enacted a decade ago. The amendments we \npass tonight will make certain that more Utahns who were exposed to \nradiation during the Cold War can now be granted deserved compensation \nto recognize the injuries and hardship they and their families have \nsuffered. It will also streamline the application process, making it \neasier for eligible claimants to qualify.\n  Mr. President, we our government can never truly make right the \nunanticipated illness and injury caused by our Nation's nuclear testing \nprogram. But we should do all we can, and it is my fervent hope these \namendments show Congress' commitment to righting a wrong in which the \ngovernment played such a substantial role.\n  S. 1515 is aimed at improving a program which provides a measure of \ncompensation to individuals who have sustained illness due to radiation \nexposure. These are fellow Americans who have suffered terribly from \ncancer and other debilitating diseases resulting from exposure to \nfallout and uranium mining during this narrow period of our history.\n  In meetings with constituents over the past several years, I have \nheard countless heart-rending stories about the devastating effects \nfamilies have felt due to their exposure to radiation. I recall so \nvividly one young woman in St. George, Utah talking about the \n``beautiful sky'' that her mother called all the children outside to \nview, thus exposing every family member to radiation. Tragically, many \nof those family members were eventually diagnosed with cancer.\n  Through advances in science, we now know so much more about the \neffects of that radiation than we did in the late 1950s and 1960s. In \nfact, we know so much more today than we did in 1990 when Congress \npassed the original compensation program, the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act. Our current state of scientific knowledge allows us \nto pinpoint with more accuracy which diseases are reasonably believed \nto be related to radiation exposure, and that is what necessitated the \nlegislation we are considering today.\n  The RECA amendments of 2000 updates that 1990 law in a number of \nimportant areas. Let me briefly take this opportunity to summarize the \nimprovements to RECA that S. 1515 makes:\n  1. It expands the list eligible diseases (leukemia) and other cancers \neligible for compensation to include: lung; thyroid; breast (male and \nfemale); esophagus; stomach; pharynx, small intestine; pancreas; bile \nducts; salivary gland; urinary bladder; brain, colon; ovary; gall \nbladder, or liver in those claimants referred to as ``downwinders'' and \nonsite test participants.\n\n  2. It extends eligibility to other diseases (non-cancers) including \npulmonary fibrosis, silicosis and pneumoconiosis to millers and miners.\n  3. It includes two new counties, Wayne and San Juan, as well as \nseveral other counties from other states.\n  4. It extends eligibility for compensation to include above-ground \nand open-pit uranium mine workers, uranium mill workers, and \nindividuals who transported uranium ore. Under the 1990 law, only \nunderground miners of uranium were included.\n  5. In an important change, it eliminates a distinction between \nsmokers and nonsmokers. While I appreciate the concern of government \nofficials that smokers who became ill could not reasonably attribute \nthat illness to radiation exposure, many constituents have explained to \nme that it was virtually impossible to provide reliable documentation \nabout as to whether they had smoked or not. Thus, I insisted in this \nchange so that claimants no longer need to prove they were non-smokers. \nFor many individuals, this will ease the application process \nimmeasurably.\n  6. It allows for certified physician/patient written documentation \nand appropriate tests (e.g. CAT scans and MRIs) to be used in the \nverification of a claim. This will also ease the claimant's application \nprocess tremendously. Before, claimants had to search for specific \ndocumentation that may have never existed or was disposed of years \nearlier.\n  7. In another important provision, these amendments respect Native \nAmerican law in claims processing as it applies to survivor eligibility \nbased on law, tradition, and custom of a particular Indian tribe (i.e. \nmartial status).\n  8. While the bill retains the RECA'90 levels of compensation and does \nnot alter the documentation requirements showing that a person was \npresent during the atomic testings, at the request\n\n[[Page S6039]]\n\nof Senator Daschle, the bill does extend compensation to a new group of \nindividuals: millers (and ore transporters) who are also eligible for \n$100,000.\n  9. In the case of millers, miners, and ore transporters, the bill \nlowers the amount of documented radiation from 200 Working Level Months \n(WLM) to 40 Working Level Months. If a miller or ore transporter \napplies for compensation, their exposure documentation can be either \nproof of 40 WLM or one year documented employment. This is a big \nchange, for with RECA 90, millers and ore transporters were not even \neligible for compensation and miners were required to show proof of 200 \nWLMs.\n  10. Miners and millers are eligible for compensation if they meet the \neligibility criteria for lung cancer and chronic lung diseases \nmentioned above in #2. Millers are eligible for compensation if they \ndevelop renal cancers, chronic renal disease including nephritis and \nkidney tubal tissue injury. The compensation would be $100,000.\n  11. Finally, at the suggestion of several Washington County, Utah \nconstituents, the bill includes a new grant program that will help with \nearly detection, prevention and screening of radiogenic diseases. These \nprograms will screen for the early warning signs of cancer, provide \nmedical referrals and educate individuals on prevention and treatment \nof radiogenic diseases. The grant program is designed to be available \nto a wide range of community-based groups, including cancer centers, \nhospitals, Veterans Affairs medical centers, community health centers \nand state departments of health.\n  I am extremely grateful to the interested and concerned constituents \nwho helped in the drafting of the RECA amendments. Many times, their \nheartfelt stories helped lead to provisions in the legislation which \ncan only help improve the program. For example, in one meeting on the \nbill held in St. George, Utah, a woman explained to my office that the \ncompensation program, while well-intended, could never make families \nwho had experienced radiation-caused illness whole again. She expressed \nher feeling that the greater good could come not from compensating \nindividuals, but from instituting programs which will help families \ndetect potential illness earlier, allowing them to be treated more \nsuccessfully and cost-effectively. From that conversation was born the \nnew prevention grant program, which I believe will prove to be \nextremely successful.\n  Our nation has a commitment to the thousands who suffered ill-effects \nfrom radiation exposure during a period of nuclear testing critical to \nour Nation's defense capabilities. I believe we have an obligation to \nthose who were injured, especially since they were not adequately \nwarned about the potential health hazards involved in their exposure.\n  This legislation was made possible by a staunch group of bipartisan \nsupporters who have worked several years to see these program \nmodernizations through. In particular, I want to thank my colleagues \nfrom the Beehive State, Representative Chris Cannon, a Judiciary \nCommittee member who worked so hard to get this bill through, and \nSenator Bob Bennett, for his support on this measure.\n  Likewise, I want to thank a number of other Senators for their help \nin passing this legislation--Senators Ben Nighthorse Campbell, Jon Kyl, \nand Pete Domenici, and Minority Leader Tom Daschle and Senator Jeff \nBingaman. All of these Senators assisted substantially in developing \nthis legislation.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and especially Senator Pat Leahy, for their help and \ncooperation on this issue. And, I want to pay special tribute to my \ncounterpart in the House, Chairman Henry Hyde, as well as to \nRepresentative Lamar Smith, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration \nand Claims.\n  Finally, I would also like to thank the ranking member of the House \nJudiciary Committee, Representative John Conyers, Representative Barney \nFrank, and Representative Joe Skeen for their generous support and \ncontributions toward the passage of this bill. I would also be remiss \nif I did not mention the contributions made to this bill by Stewart \nUdall, whose substantial work on RECA and these amendments should not \ngo unnoticed.\n  I want to offer sincere appreciation for the assistance and \ncooperation of key staff, including Cindy Blackston of the House \nJudiciary Committee, Trudy Vincent of Senator Bingaman's staff, Peter \nHansen and Mark Childress of Senator Daschle's staff, and Ed Pagano of \nSenator Leahy's staff.\n  Also, I want to recognize the hard work by my own staff on this \nlegislation. I have often thought that the probability of any bill \npassing by unanimous consent is an inverse relationship to the number \nof hours spent developing it. This bill has been a long time in \ndevelopment. Dr. Marlon Priest began the research phase for this bill \nover two years ago. Dr. David Russell has brought the legislation to \nits completion. Pattie DeLoatche, Rob Foreman, Shawn Bently, Troy Dow, \nJeannine Holt, and Patricia Knight have worked tirelessly together on \nbehalf of this legislation.\n  And last, but not least, I want to thank the many constituents who \noffered helpful suggestions to me as we worked to enact S. 1515. I have \na tremendous appreciation for their determination, dedication and hard \nwork which was such a necessary part of crafting this legislation.\n  The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendment of 2000 is an \nimportant piece of legislation which will speed up the application \nprocess as well as modernize the criteria for compensation, helping \nthousands of fellow Utahns and other deserving Americans who were \ninjured by our nation's nuclear development and testing programs. I am \nhopeful that President Clinton will sign this bipartisan bill into law \non a priority basis.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate is passing \nS. 1515, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Improvement Act Amendments \nof 2000. I deeply appreciate the hard work of my colleague, Senator \nHatch, in developing this legislation and bringing it to this point.\n  Hundreds of former uranium workers in South Dakota and thousands \nacross the nation have developed cancer and other life-threatening \ndiseases as a result of their work producing uranium on behalf of the \nUnited States government. Although the federal government knew that \nthis work put the health of these men and women at risk, it failed to \ntake appropriate steps to warn or protect them.\n  In 1990, Congress passed landmark legislation to compensate these \nindividuals. The legislation before us today takes critically-needed \nsteps to amend this act to make it easier for victims to apply for and \nreceive compensation. It also broadens the availability of compensation \nby updating the list of compensable diseases to take into account the \nlatest science and by extending compensation to groups of workers \nexcluded from the original law. Most importantly, it makes compensation \navailable to workers in all states, including my home state of South \nDakota. The original law limited compensation to workers in five states \nonly, despite the fact that workers in other states faced identical \ncircumstances.\n  It is critical that we pass this legislation as quickly as possible \nin order to provide these individuals with compensation. Many are sick, \nand unable to afford adequate health insurance. This compensation will \nprovide them with vital assistance.\n  While I believe we need to send this legislation to the President \nimmediately, there is one issue I hope to address as quickly as \npossible. The current version of this legislation sets different \nstandards of eligibility for compensation for uranium millers and \nuranium miners. Uranium millers must demonstrate that they worked in a \nmill for a year. However, miners must demonstrate that they were \nexposed to 40 or more working level months of radiation. Given that \nminers' records about their level of exposure have now been lost, or \nwere kept inaccurately, I believe we should set the one year standard \nfor both categories of workers. Would the Senator from Utah agree at \nthe first available opportunity to seek to amend this legislation to \nstate that miners must simply demonstrate that they worked in a mine \nfor one year to be eligible to receive compensation?\n  Mr. HATCH. I agree to work with the Democratic Leader. While we \ncannot\n\n[[Page S6040]]\n\nafford a delay in sending the current bill to the resident, a strong \nargument can be made that both miners and mill workers should have the \nsame standard of eligibility for compensation. I will work with the \nSenator in an expeditious manner to address this issue and make any \nnecessary amendment.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my colleague and once again commend him for his \noutstanding work on this issue.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing S. \n1515, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act Amendments of 2000, and \nsending it to President Clinton for his signature into law. I want to \ncongratulate the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, \nand the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, for their leadership \non this bill.\n  During the Senate Judiciary Committee consideration of this \nlegislation last year, I offered an amendment on behalf of Senator \nBingaman to add the category of renal disease affecting uranium miners \nto the coverage of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act. I am \npleased to report that our amendment has been retained in the final \nversion of this legislation. I know that Senator Bingaman sought higher \ncompensation levels for radiation exposure victims in his original \nlegislation, but has agreed to this bipartisan compromise to ensure the \nbill's final passage into law this year and to expedite compensation to \nradiation exposure victims in New Mexico.\n  I want to commend Senator Hatch and Senator Bingaman for a job well \ndone.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, and others, to recognize we are passing S. 1515, \nwhich makes long overdue improvements to the Radiation Exposure \nCompensation Act of 1990.\n  Mr. President, RECA was originally enacted in 1990 as a means of \ncompensating the individuals who suffered from exposure to radiation as \na result of the U.S. government's nuclear testing program and federal \nuranium mining activities. While the government can never fully \ncompensate for the loss of a life or the reduction in the quality of \nlife, RECA serves as a cornerstone for the national apology Congress \nextended to those adversely affected by the various radiation \ntragedies. In keeping with the spirit of that apology, the legislation \nthe Senate is passing today will further correct existing injustices \nand provide compassionate compensation for those whose lives and health \nwere sacrificed as part of our nation's effort to win the Cold War. \nWhile this bill does not go as far as the bill I originally introduced \nin the Senate this Congress, I am pleased that we have been able to \ntake these important steps to begin to compensate our citizens for the \nsacrifices they made.\n  During the period of 1947 to 1961, the Federal Government controlled \nall aspects of the production of nuclear fuel. One of these aspects was \nthe mining of uranium in New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming and \nUtah. Even though the Federal Government had adequate knowledge of the \nhazards involved in uranium mining, these miners, many of whom were \nNative Americans, were sent into inadequately ventilated mines with \nvirtually no instruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation. \nThese miners had no idea of those dangers. Consequently, they inhaled \nradon particles that eventually yielded substantial doses of ionizing \nradiation. As a result, these miners have a substantially elevated \ncancer rate and incidence of incapacitating respiratory disease. The \nhealth effects of uranium mining in the fifties and sixties remain the \nsingle greatest concern of many former uranium miners and millers and \ntheir families and friends.\n  In 1990, I was pleased to co-sponsor the original RECA legislation to \nprovide compassionate compensation to uranium miners. I believe that \nour efforts in 1990 were well intentioned but have not proven to be as \neffective as we had hoped in providing redress to those individuals who \nsuffered the effects of working in uranium mines or mills or \ntransporting the ore. The government has the responsibility to \ncompensate all those adversely affected and who have suffered health \nproblems because they were not adequately informed of the risks they \nfaced while mining, milling, and transporting uranium ore.\n  Now we are getting ready to pass this comprehensive amendment to RECA \nto correct omissions, make RECA consistent with current medical \nknowledge, and to address what have become administrative horror \nstories for the claimants. With passage of this bill, we're now a \nPresidential signature away from offering compensation to thousands \nmore uranium workers than ever.\n  Mr. President, the success of this bill is due in large part to Paul \nHicks, who stood up for uranium workers, and strongly encouraged \nCongress to do the right thing by passing this bill. Paul was President \nof the Uranium Workers of New Mexico, and his passing just two months \nago makes today's action bittersweet. But I hope his family can take \ncomfort in the fact that he made a tremendously positive impact on the \nlives of thousands of uranium workers.\n  Mr. President, I am appreciative of all the hard work done on this \nbill by Senator Hatch and others, and I hope the President will sign \nthis bill as soon as possible so that justice will be delayed no \nlonger.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate agree to the \namendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
