It seems overwhelming when we recall that You told us it is \npossible to so love even our enemies. O Lord, what a revolution that \nwould be--a revolution of new life for all.\n  Take from our minds all fragments of fear that would lead us to \nwithdraw into self-absorption. Give us the gift of freedom to fight \nwithout reserve for the community of humankind, the enjoyment of the \nworld as Your gift to everyone and the special role this United States \nSenate has in bringing this gift to the whole world.\n  So, on this day, may these Senators know that the people of this \nNation not only lay heavy responsibilities upon them but also hold them \nup in prayer. May the gracious power of Your love be served in what is \ndone in this hall today.

TOM PHILLIPS\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I wish to take a couple moments to welcome \nmy former pastor from Gillette, WY, to the Senate Chamber. I thank him \nand his wife Carolyn for making the journey to Washington to visit with \nus and some people with whom we have become acquainted through books we \nhave read.\n  Dr. Phillips came to Gillette in 1983, and he has a doctorate but \nprefers to be called ``pastor.'' It made a significant impression on \nour community. He also taught us the difference between going to church \nand worshiping. That has been a lasting legacy and pulled people \ntogether, unified them. But, more importantly, he provided an \nindividual ministry to me and to the other people in the congregation. \nHe has been an instructor and a conscience. He has stretched the \nimaginations and minds of the people in our congregation but most \nespecially my mind. Diana and I have had the blessings of this \nwonderful couple as they have been in Gillette; they have inspired us \nfrom their position and also were friends to us as just normal people, \nwhich can sometimes be very difficult for ministers.\n  Unfortunately, Gillette has lost his services; he is now in northern \nColorado where he is a minister to ministers. He is with the \nPresbytery. He goes around and shares with people who sometimes have \ndifficulty sharing with the members of their congregation. He provides \na special service there. Throughout all that time, he has been sharing \nbooks which in turn have challenged me, stretched me, and helped me to \ndo the job here.\n  So I thank both of them for their contribution to my and Diana's \nlife, the life of our family, and also to our education through the \nyears.\n  I thank ``Pastor'' Phillips.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12799-5", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to call attention to the fact that \nwith this vote Senator Patrick Leahy has reached a historic achievement \nin having cast his 10,000th rollcall vote.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  I join my colleagues in congratulating Senator Leahy on his historic \nachievement.\n  In the history of our Nation, only 1,851 Americans have ever served \nin the U.S. Senate, and have achieved this level. And only 21 have cast \n10,000 rollcall votes.\n  It is perhaps no coincidence that--at the very moment Senator Leahy \nwas casting his 10,000th vote in this chamber--baseball's home run \nking, Hank Aaron, was being honored on the other side of the Capitol.\n  Patrick Leahy and Henry Aaron are both ``heavy hitters''--in their \nown fields. They are both men whose names will be recorded forever in \nthe history books.\n  The greatest compliment one Senator can pay another is to call him or \nher ``a Senator's Senator.'' It is not a term that is used loosely. It \nis a term that must be earned. To be a ``Senators' Senator,'' you have \nto love the Senate. You have to love its history and traditions. Most \nof all, you have to love what it represents; you have to love \ndemocracy. You have to love it enough to be willing to fight for it, to \nsacrifice for it, and sometimes, to bend for it. Patrick Leahy is such \na man.\n  I am proud to serve with him in this Senate. And I am even more proud \nto count him as a friend.\n  I first came to this Senate in 1987. Those were hard times in rural \nAmerica. The farm economy was in a deep recession. In South Dakota and \nacross the country, people were being forced to sell farms that had \nbeen in their families for generations. That same year, Patrick Leahy \nbecame chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee. And I became its \nnewest member. It was on the Agriculture Committee that I first came to \nknow Senator Leahy. It was there that I first saw the qualities and \ncharacteristics which I now recognize as the hallmarks of his \nextraordinary career.\n  Patrick Leahy cares deeply about people, and about protecting \nAmerica's natural resources. Under his leadership, issues that had \nhistorically been considered ``second tier'' issues--such as nutrition \nand the environemnt--were elevated in importance. He helped bridge \ndifferences between farmers and environmentalists.\n  Patrick Leahy is a consensus builder. That is another thing I learned \nfrom watching him. Nearly every major piece of legislation reported out \nof the Agriculture Committee during his years as chairman was reported \nout with strong bipartisan support. He worked closely, first under \nSenator Dole, and then later under Senator Lugar, to build that \nsupport. Patrick Leahy is committed to making government work better.\n\n  In his first term as chairman, Senator Leahy managed two of the ten \nmeasures cited by Time magazine as landmark legacies of the 100th \nCongress. The first was the Hunger Prevention Act; the second was the \nAgriculture Credit Act, the most comprehensive reform of the farm \ncredit system in 50 years. That bill not only saved the farm credit \nsystem from bankruptcy; it saved millions of family farmers from \ndisaster.\n  I learned a lot from watching Patrick Leahy about how to be a leader, \nabout how to reach across the aisle and build a bipartisan consensus. \nHe grew up in Montpelier, Vermont's capital, left to go to Georgetown \nLaw School, and returned home to practice law. He began his political \ncareer in 1966 when he was elected the Chittenden County State's \nattorney. Eight years later, at the age of 34, he was selected by the \nNational District Attorneys Association as one of the three outstanding \nprosecutors in the United States. That same year, he was elected to the \nSenate.\n  He remains the youngest Senator, and the only Democratic Senator, \never sent to this body by the people of the Green Mountain State.\n  In 1998, he was reelected with 72 percent of the vote, one of the \nlargest margins of victory in any Senate race last year.\n  It is not simply the number of votes which he has cast which makes \nhim the kind of Senator he is and the man whom we congratulate today; \nit is also the nature of those votes, the serious reflection that \naccompanied them, and sometimes the courage it took to cast them.\n  Over the years, Senator Leahy has frequently spoken out against \nproposals he knew were popular but believed were unconstitutional. For \nthe last 3 years, as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, he has \nbeen an outspoken and articulate advocate for the right of Federal \njudicial nominees to have a fair vote, and the responsibility of this \nSenate to grant them that right.\n  On the Appropriations Committee's subcommitee, Senator Leahy has been \na leader in the global effort to ban antipersonnel mines. In 1992, he \nwrote the first law by any government banning the export of these \nweapons and played a key role in pushing for an international treaty \nbanning their use. Now 122 nations have signed that treaty.\n  He has also used his leadership position to fight the global spread \nof infectious diseases, and to prohibit American aid to police forces \nthat have records of human rights violations.\n  Patrick Leahy is a quiet, thoughtful man with great intellectual \ncuriosity and a great sense of humor. He is also one of the most \nforward-looking people I know. He was one of the first Senators to go \nonline and establish a home page on the World Wide Web. He frequently \nholds town meetings with Vermonters on the Internet.\n\n[[Page S12801]]\n\n  This year, he was awarded the John Peter and Anna Catherine Zenger \nAward ``for outstanding contributions in support of press freedom and \nthe people's right to know,'' only the second time since 1954 that it \nhas gone to a government leader.\n  In the 25 years he has served here, Patrick Leahy has lost a little \nbit of the hair he came with, but he has gained an extraordinary amount \nof wisdom and skill. He has shared those gifts with America, and we are \nbetter and stronger because of it.\n  Besides his 10,000 rollcall votes, there is at least one other \naccomplishment for which Senator Leahy will go down in the history \nbooks. We all know Patrick Leahy is one of the world's biggest ``Dead \nHeads.'' He is one of the biggest fans of the legendary band, the \nGrateful Dead. Several years ago, he invited Jerry Garcia and several \nother members of the band to have lunch in the Senate dining room. \nPeople were already doing double and triple takes--and then Senator \nThurmond walked in.\n  Ever the bridge builder, Senator Leahy rushed over to Senator \nThurmond and said, ``Please join us. There is someone I want you to \nmeet.''\n  If Patrick Leahy can help bridge that divide between Jerry Garcia and \nStrom Thurmond, there is hope for all of us. There is no telling what \nelse he can do in the Senate in the remaining time that he will be \nhere. I hope it is for years and years and thousands of votes to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I hate to see the minority leader's comments \nend. They were getting better and better as he got toward the end.\n  I also extend the congratulations of myself, all the Members of the \nSenate on this side, and on the Democratic side. It is certainly an \nenviable record: 10,000 votes, 25 years. We all know quite well Senator \nLeahy's efforts on behalf of the environment, agriculture, judiciary, \nforeign policy. His efforts are legendary. He has done a great job.\n  Mr. President, today is a special day. In the history of our country, \nless than 1,300 Americans have served in the U.S. Senate. Being a \nSenator is a singular honor bestowed on a very few. Today, our friend \nfrom Vermont, Pat Leahy has joined a unique club within this unique \nbody. He has cast his 10,000th vote.\n  Think about what that means. When Pat Leahy came to the Senate, as \nthe youngest man ever sent to the Senate by the people of the United \nStates, Gerald Ford was in the White House. Since then, Presidents and \nmajority leaders have come and gone, the Iron Curtain has come crashing \ndown, and Pat Leahy has kept on casting votes.\n  Pat already had remarkable career before he came to the Senate. After \nleaving Georgetown Law School, he served for 8 years as a state's \nprosecutor in Vermont where he gained a national reputation as a crime \nfighter. In 1974, he was named as one of the three outstanding \nprosecuting attorneys in the United States.\n  Upon entering the Senate Pat became a leader on agriculture, foreign \naffairs, and the judiciary. His Leahy-Lugar bill in 1994 revolutionized \nthe way the Department of Agriculture does its business and millions of \nfarmers are better off for his efforts.\n  So I echo the sentiments of my friend, the minority leader. We send \nPat and his wife Marcelle our very best wishes and our hopes for \ncontinued success in the days ahead.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is a real pleasure and a privilege \nfor me to be here to honor my colleague. We came into the Congress \ntogether. That moment is most memorable to me. I was at a reception and \nmissed the first vote in the House. I thank the Senator for never \nburdening me with that. I am privileged to be his colleague.\n  For four decades, Pat has served Vermont. At the time he was a \nChittenden County prosecutor, I was attorney general. We worked very \nclosely together to make sure that Vermont was protected.\n  In his position, he has gained national and international recognition \non many issues. He has led the fight to rid the world of landmines and \ncontinues to aid victims of these weapons through the Leahy War Victims \nFund. He has helped bring the computer age to the Senate, helped \neducate all Members on the value of the Internet, and continues to \nchampion environmental issues.\n  He always remembers his roots. I am sure I speak for him when I say \nthat his proudest accomplishments are those that make Vermont a better \nplace. He has worked tirelessly to ensure that Vermont receives full \nconsideration before the Senate. He has protected Vermont dairy \nfarmers, maintained funds for programs to preserve the waters of Lake \nChamplain, and helped fulfill George Aiken's legacy by adding lands to \nthe Green Mountain National Forest.\n  Patrick Leahy is a man of his word. He is a trusted friend who has \nthe courage of his convictions, and plays to win for the right cause. \nMany times he has been on the winning side for the benefit of Vermont \nand the Nation. I have worked on his side on many occasions and have \nalways marveled at his sense of the democratic process, at his \ncommitment to constituents, and his dedication to friends and his \nfamily.\n  I am proud to call Pat Leahy a friend of mine, and I have valued and \nhave enjoyed our interaction in the Halls of the Senate, from the good-\nnatured competition of our annual intrastate softball game to marching \nin Vermont's miniparades.\n  With this vote, Pat Leahy becomes only the 21st Member, as has been \npointed out, out of 1,851 men and women who have served, to respond yea \nor nay 10,000 times.\n  It is wonderful to be with you, Pat. Congratulations.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those who \nare so eloquently paying tribute to my friend and colleague from \nVermont, Senator Leahy. 10,000 of anything is a lot. But 10,000 votes \nis a mind-boggling milestone. I figured out that at our current pace, \nif God willing I am reelected, by the time I reach 10,000 votes we'll \nbe debating Y3K legislation. But seriously, 10,000 votes is an \nindication, not of longevity, but of thoughtfulness, patience, hard \nwork, effectiveness, and of representing ably and nobly your Vermont \nconstituents.\n  Many of my colleagues have worked side-by-side with Pat Leahy for a \nnumber of years, as he worked tirelessly and successfully to protect \nand advance Vermont's interests, as he led the crusade to ban the \nproduction and use of land mines, and as he wrote and rewrote laws in \norder to foster the growth of the Internet. When you hear them speak \nabout Pat Leahy, they speak about a man of exceptional character, \nastute vision, and abundant compassion. I've been here for only 9 \nmonths but working with Pat Leahy has been a truly rewarding experience \nfor me. He has been a leader, a teacher, and a friend. He is very \npatient and very open to ideas. And we have Pat to thank for producing \na balanced juvenile justice bill--a bill that, thanks to his efforts \nand those of Senator Hatch, secured the support of three-quarters of \nthis Senate. Who could have foreseen the Senate's reporting juvenile \njustice legislation on such a bipartisan basis? Who could have foreseen \nthe Senate's ultimately closing the gun show loophole after kicking off \nthe debate by voting down our modest proposal? Only those who correctly \nestimated Pat Leahy's skill and perseverance.\n  But outside the committee, we've worked together on local economic \ndevelopment issues. We share a large border and many of my northern New \nYork constituents share a great deal with Pat's rural Vermont \nconstituents. What a relief for me that I can turn to Pat at any time \non dairy and agriculture issues. I hope it is an indication that I've \nbeen a good student now that Pat has started calling me ``Farmer \nChuck.'' Well, if I'm ``Farmer Chuck,'' then all I can say is that, in \nlarge part, I learned my new craft from the best of them--Pat Leahy.\n  So, congratulations on reaching this ironman milestone. There aren't \ntoo many Senators who can make the kind of mark that Senator Leahy has \nmade and still be considered a friend to every person in the Senate. I \nknow you have been a friend to me, and for that I am proud to share \nthis great moment with you.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \ncongratulating my dear friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator \nLeahy, on his 10,000th vote cast as a member of this body.\n  What a great milestone Senator Leahy has reached. What a great \ntestament to the commitment of my dear\n\n[[Page S12802]]\n\ncolleague to his duty as a representative of the people of the state of \nVermont. Senator Leahy now joins an exclusive group of only a handful \nof Senators who have cast at least 10,000 votes. At a time when many \nAmericans are skeptical of Congress and the political process, it is \nre-assuring to know that my colleagues, like Senator Leahy, take their \nresponsibility to their constituents seriously. Even with modern \ntransportation, it is a challenge not to miss this important \nresponsibility of casting votes.\n  Senator Leahy has been an exemplary Senator. And it's not just the \nact of voting that matters. I also commend Senator Leahy for his hard \nwork, dedication, insight and adept ability to work in a bipartisan \nmanner--skills that he has brought to this floor, as well as to his \nrole as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. His leadership has \nbeen invaluable to the work of the Committee, as well as the work of \nmoving bills on the Senate floor. As a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I have been proud to work with him on innumerable pieces of \nlegislation affecting everything from civil rights to immigration to \ncrime.\n  Mr. President, I once again congratulate my dear colleague, Senator \nLeahy, and wish him well in continuing his outstanding work for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a milestone \nvote by the distinguished senior Senator from Vermont. Today Senator \nPatrick Leahy becomes the 21st member in the Senate's history to pass \nthe 10,000 vote mark. I have had the opportunity to work alongside the \nSenator for the last 11 years and it gives me great pleasure to take a \nfew minutes to discuss his many accomplishments.\n  Senator Leahy began working for the people of Vermont back in 1966, \nwhen he was elected Chittenden County state's attorney. He quickly \ngained a national reputation when he revamped the office and led a \nnational task force that was probing the 1973-74 energy crisis. In \n1974, he was elected to the Senate and he remains the only Democratic \nSenator in the state's history. This is important because to have the \nstate of Vermont re-elect Senator Leahy four times means that he is \ndoing work here that appeals to a wide cross section of people.\n  During his years as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry, Senator Leahy demonstrated his ability to \nreport bills to the full Senate with strong bipartisan support. In \npartnership with Senator Lugar he authored two farm bills that not only \nprotected important nutrition initiatives like the WIC program, but \nalso included landmark environmental features that have helped to \npreserve farmland. He has also been able to streamline the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, in the process saving more than $2 billion.\n  The issue that the Senator may be best known for is his fight for a \nworld-wide ban on land mines. Since 1989 he has labored to raise \nawareness among the public and build political support within the \nadministration. He pushed for an international treaty that would ban \nanti-personnel mines and got a commitment from the U.S. administration \nto sign the treaty when alternatives to the mines are available. And \nthe Leahy War Victims Fund provides up to $12 million a year in medical \nsupplies to aid land mine victims.\n  Senator Leahy is also a cofounder of the Congressional Internet \nCaucus. Now in his fifth term, Senator Leahy remains on the cutting \nedge of technology as he was one of the first Senators to establish a \nhome page on the web. He also conducts electronic town meetings with \nresidents on-line, and has sought to update copyright law to reflect \nthe changes that have occurred with the advent of the information age.\n  Equally important as these legislative achievements is the sense of \ntradition that Senator Leahy carries with him as he fulfills the daily \ntasks of a U.S. Senator. He has consistently been a voice for rural \nAmerica, and, while he always votes with the people of Vermont in mind, \nin a more traditional way Patrick Leahy has not been afraid to take an \nunpopular stance if he believes that the national interest is at stake. \nHe is a Statesman who appeals to a sense of bipartisanship on issues \ndealing with our national security and foreign policy. These are \ncustoms that are essential to the success of this institution, and the \nSenator is often looked to for leadership for these reasons.\n  I congratulate Senator Leahy for this momentous achievement. He is a \nfine example of what a United States Senator should be.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nhonoring Senator Leahy on casting his 10,000th vote in the United \nStates Senate. Given that I have just cast my 328th vote, I am humbled \nand impressed by the senior Senator from Vermont's accomplishment. This \nfeat is a true measure of Senator Leahy's dedication to the people of \nthe United States and his commitment to the state of Vermont.\n  Senator Leahy made a lasting impression on me early in my tenure as \nhe oversaw the Democratic Senators who attended the impeachment \ndepositions. In very difficult circumstances, Senator Leahy set a tone \nof fairness and collegiality. His example during the depositions is one \nthat I will always value as I continue my public service.\n  I am truly grateful for and humbled by the service that Senator Leahy \nhas given to this nation, and I also thank him for his enduring \nleadership, selflessness and influence in the U.S. Senate. I look \nforward to his next 10,000 votes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, after 25 years of service to the country, \nthe State of Vermont, and this body, Senator Leahy has just cast his \n10,000th vote. I should note that this milestone vote was cast in \nrelation to substantively dubious campaign finance reform legislation. \nI can't say that I blame him for supporting the legislation given the \nfact that his Republican opponents in his last race spent no money and \nactually endorsed him.\n  All kidding aside, this is an occasion to reflect on Senator Leahy's \nimpressive career. In 1974 Senator Leahy joined this body as the \nyoungest Senator ever elected to represent the state of Vermont. He was \nthe first Democrat elected to the Senate from Vermont in more than a \ncentury. If political commentators thought that voting in Pat Leahy was \na one-time event, they were wrong. Senator Leahy is currently serving \nhis fifth 6 year term. I have had the privilege of working closely with \nSenator Leahy for all of my years on the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nwhere I serve as chairman and he is my partner, the ranking member of \nthat committee.\n  I have appreciated and benefited from his experience and expertise in \nmay areas. When Senator Leahy came to the Senate he was already an \nexpert in the area of law enforcement having been named one of the \nthree outstanding prosecutors in United States in 1974. We on the \nJudiciary Committee have looked to Senator Leahy on these issues. On \nhigh-technology issues, as you all know, Senator Leahy prides himself \nin his leadership and knowledge of the issues. His interest and \nexpertise in these areas have helped move the Judiciary Committee \nforward in tackling these important issues.\n  We who know Pat Leahy know that he has remained young at heart, as \nevidenced by his continued devotion to the Grateful Dead. But his \ndevotion to the arts and his devotion to work in this body do not \ncompare to Senator Leahy's devotion to his wife, his children, and \nrecent grandson.\n  So, in conclusion, I want to pay tribute to Senator Leahy and his \nwonderful family on this remarkable day which symbolizes years of hard \nwork and dedication for which this institution and this country are \ngrateful. While Members of the senate differ from time to time, we can \nall appreciate and admire the accomplishment of casting 10,000 votes. \nso when I leave the floor today, I'll tell Senator Leahy, ``Pat you \nwere, `Built to Last' and while you may be getting up there in years, \nit's `just a touch of gray. Kind of suits you anyway. That was all I \nhave to say. It's all right.' ''\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that we recognize the Senator \nfrom Vermont for a couple of minutes to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think Mark Twain once referred to how \nnice it is to hear your eulogy while you are still alive. I do \nappreciate hearing from my friends, my distinguished colleague\n\n[[Page S12803]]\n\nfrom South Dakota, the closest friend I have ever had, the \ndistinguished Democratic leader, and the kind words he had to say; my \ngood friend from Mississippi, the distinguished majority leader; and, \nof course, my colleague who I have known for longer than anybody in \nthis body, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, Jim Jeffords.\n  These comments mean a great deal. That Vice President Gore, presided \nat the time of the vote meant a lot to me. I will note that the Vice \nPresident said earlier today: Boy, that guy Leahy must be awfully old.\n  I point out the Vice President and I have the same birthday, March \n31--about 8 years apart.\n  I have served here with so many. I see my dear friend and aisle mate, \nthe distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, who has cast the \nmost votes in history--over 15,000 votes, and my good friend, the \nPresident pro tempore, the distinguished senior Senator from South \nCarolina, Strom Thurmond, who has the second most votes ever cast in \nthis body.\n  I think of the people with whom I have served during the 25 years I \nhave served, people such as Scoop Jackson and Mike Mansfield, Jacob \nJavits, John Stennis, Hubert Humphrey, and Bob Dole. The two closest \nfriends I had in my class were a Republican and a Democrat: Paul Laxalt \nand John Glenn; and so many others who I served with including two \ncolleagues from Vermont, Bob Stafford and Jim Jeffords.\n  How fortunate I am to serve with the men and women of this body; \nevery one of whom is a close friend--those such as the distinguished \nSenator from Utah with whom I work on the Judiciary Committee; those \nwith whom I work on the Appropriations Committee, the chairman of our \nsubcommittee, the distinguished Senator from Kentucky, and the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Alaska, the chairman of the \ncommittee--he and Senator Byrd have taught me so much as I have served \non that committee--those with whom I serve on Agriculture, my good \nfriend, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Dick Lugar, and \nothers. There are so many of you.\n  When I came here the country was very much at risk and the Senate was \nin good bipartisan shape. Today the country is doing very well, and we \nsometimes break down too much along partisan lines. I think this is \nunfortunate. Those of us who have served here a long time know it does \nnot have to be that way. We know the country is better when we work \ntogether. I think of traveling with my friend from Mississippi, the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, Thad Cochran, when we \nwent to our home States. We find, even though we are of different \nphilosophies, there are so many things in common, so we can work \ntogether.\n  I hope we can do more and more of that. If I may say to all my \nfriends, nothing I can ever do in life will give me greater pleasure or \nhumble me more than serving in this body. There are only 100 of us who \nmight be here at any given time to represent a great nation of a \nquarter of a billion people. Think of the responsibility that is for \nall of us. These are the finest men and women, in both parties, I have \never known.\n  When Marcelle and I came to this city, we didn't knew how long we \nwere going to be here. I was the junior-most Member of this body, the \njunior-most Member--No. 99 in then a 99-Member Senate, because of a tie \nvote in New Hampshire. I sat way over in that corner.\n  I looked at Senators, people such as Ted Kennedy or Frank Church or \nBarry Goldwater, who would walk in here--people I knew from Time \nmagazine covers or from the news--and suddenly realized, I am here. I \nremember that day in January when I stood up to cast my first vote and \nthen quickly sat down. I also remember what Senator Mansfield, our \nleader, told me: Always keep your word, he said, and don't worry if you \nthink you cast a vote wrong; the issue will come back. It does. I have \nfound that is true after 10,000 votes.\n  So I think now I have been here long enough that this week I will \nfinally do something I have been putting off for 25 years. I will carve \nmy name in my desk.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12803-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 1999--Continued\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me go ahead then. This will be a little \ndisjointed, but I think I can accommodate all Senators.\n  I now move to proceed to Calendar No. 300, S. 1692, the partial-birth \nabortion bill, and a vote occurring immediately following 80 minutes of \ndebate, with 30 minutes under the control of Senator Levin, and 10 \nminutes each for the following Senators: Feingold, Boxer, McCain, \nSchumer, and Santorum, all occurring without any intervening action or \ndebate. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Hatch have 5 minutes \nafter the vote to speak on behalf of his colleague, Senator Leahy.\n  I further ask consent that it be in order for me to ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There are two parts to the majority leader's request. \nThe first is that he move to proceed to Calendar No. 300, S. 1692, \nwhich is the partial-birth abortion bill. The second is the unanimous-\nconsent agreement involving the request by a number of Senators to be \nheard. I have no objection to Senators being heard. I question why we \nneed to move to proceed to Calendar No. 300, when we simply could do so \nby a unanimous-consent request, thereby not taking off the table and \noff of consideration the campaign finance reform bill. I will, \ntherefore, ask unanimous consent that we simply allow the partial-birth \nabortion bill to be taken up, thereby precluding the need to vote on \nthe motion to proceed and thereby protecting the current position of \nthe campaign finance reform bill.\n  I personally would love to have the full debate that we were promised \non campaign finance reform. The amendments are pending. There ought to \nbe a vote on the Reid amendment. I would like to have a vote on my \namendment. Even though we did not get cloture, we ought to have that \ndebate.\n  There are other Senators who have yet to be heard on this issue. We \nhave not had the 5 days committed. We have not had the opportunity to \nvote on these issues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we simply take up partial-birth abortion \nso we can return to this issue once that issue has been resolved.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. By doing this, the campaign finance issue is put back on \nthe calendar. We can have the debate that is needed on the motion to \nproceed to the partial-birth abortion bill, and Senators can be heard \nto express their concerns about the campaign finance issue, as well as \nthe time Senator Hatch asked for after the vote. So I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order for me to ask for the yeas and nays.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Object.\n  Mr. KERRY. Object.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Object.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. KERRY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard to the request. The leader \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, is the motion to proceed pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader's motion is pending.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, is the motion debatable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to proceed is debatable.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very troubled by the majority \nleader's decision. There is no reason why we have to move to proceed to \nthe partial-birth abortion bill. It is a bill that I will probably end \nup supporting. So this decision about whether or not we support or \noppose partial-birth abortion, we will have a good debate about that \nand amendments will be offered. This is a question of whether or not we \nare going to keep our word, whether or not we are going to have the \nopportunity to finish the debate on campaign finance reform, whether or \nnot we are going to have the opportunity to offer amendments. That is \nwhat this is about.\n  So nobody ought to be misled. Do we finish our business? Do we follow \nthrough with commitments? Do we have a good debate or not? The majority \nleader said no. No, we won't have a debate on campaign finance reform. \nNo, we won't keep the commitments made with regard to how long this \nbill will be debated. That is wrong. A number of us--unanimously on \nthis side and some on that side--want to make sure the Record clearly \nindicates our anger, our disappointment, and our determination to come \nback to this issue.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my Democratic leader, does he not believe this \nis part of a pattern of taking issues that are important and rejecting \nthem out of hand and not giving a chance for these issues to be fully \nheard? Does he believe this is part of it?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from California raises a good point. The \nattitude appears to be: I am going to take my ball and go home anytime \nit doesn't go my way. I will just take my ball and go home. Well, I \nthink that is wrong. We ought not to go home. This is too important an \nissue. We ought to be here, have the debate and the votes, and get this \njob done right. The American people expect better than this. They are \nnot getting it with this decision; they are not getting it with the \nmotion to proceed; they are not getting it with our denial to have \na good vote and debate about some of these pending amendments.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to clarify what the Democratic leader has done. He \nhas offered unanimous consent to go to partial-birth abortion because \nif we go to it that way, after it is disposed of and resolved, we would \nautomatically then come back to campaign finance reform and resolve \nthat issue; is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Michigan is exactly right. If we would \nproceed to the partial-birth abortion bill by unanimous consent, the \npending issue would continue to be campaign finance reform. By moving \nto proceed to the partial-birth abortion bill, we then relegate the \ncampaign finance reform bill back to the calendar. That is what we want \nto avoid. That is unnecessary.\n  I think the American people are trying to sort this out and figure \nwhy we are doing this. The reason we are doing this is not because they \nwant to take up partial-birth abortion alone; it is because they don't \nwant to continue the debate on campaign finance reform. That is what \nthis action actually telegraphs to the American people.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If I may further ask the Democratic leader, even though \nmany of us oppose the bill relative to partial-birth abortion, we have \nnonetheless agreed that we would go to it by unanimous consent because, \nafter it was then disposed of, however it was disposed of, we could \nthen come back to this critical issue of campaign finance reform; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Michigan is exactly right. We are not \npassing judgment on the issue of partial-birth abortion; there will be \npeople on either side of it. But what we are united about, regardless \nof how one feels on partial-birth abortion--at least on this side of \nthe aisle--is that every single Democrat believes we ought to stay on \nthis bill. Every single Democrat wants to assure that we don't violate \nthe understanding that the Senate had about how long we would be on \nthis legislation, and whether or not we would be able to proceed with \namendments and have a good debate. So you are absolutely right. There \nis no question, by going to unanimous consent,\n\n[[Page S12805]]\n\nwe preclude the need to move off of this bill and put the bill back on \nthe calendar. We don't want that to happen.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My final question is this: Is that not the reason why this \nupcoming vote--when it comes--on the motion to proceed then becomes the \ndefining vote as to whether or not we want to take up campaign finance \nreform? Because if we move to proceed to partial-birth abortion, if \nthat motion is adopted, then campaign finance reform goes back on the \ncalendar. So this upcoming vote--whenever it occurs--on the question of \nmoving to proceed to partial-birth abortion then becomes the defining \nvote ahead of us on the question of campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Michigan is exactly right. The vote on \nthe motion to proceed will be a vote to take away our opportunity to \ncontinue to debate campaign finance reform. If you vote for the motion \nto proceed, you are voting against campaign reform; you are voting \nagainst maintaining our rights to stay on that bill and resolve it this \nafternoon, tomorrow, or the next day.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Or after partial-birth abortion.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Right. This is more than procedure; this vote is whether \nor not you want to stay on campaign finance reform and finish it. This \nis whether or not you are for campaign finance reform. That is what \nthis vote is all about.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first of all, I may be in some \ndisagreement with the distinguished Democratic leader about an upcoming \nmotion to proceed because some feel very strongly about the issue of \npartial-birth abortion and whether that vote might be interpreted as a \nvote in favor or against it.\n  Let me assure the distinguished Democratic leader--and I will \nelaborate on this in a second--we have not been treated fairly in this \nprocess by either side. So, therefore, Senator Feingold and I feel no \nobligation except our obligation to campaign finance reform, and that \nis to do whatever is necessary, at whatever time, to make sure this \nissue is voted on, as were the terms of the original unanimous consent \nagreement that was agreed to by the majority leader.\n  I think it is fair to say that neither I nor the Senator from \nWisconsin began this debate with the expectation that we were close to \nachieving 60 votes for campaign finance reform, although we have to be \nencouraged by the fact that three new Republican votes were cast in \nfavor of campaign finance reform in this last vote. We did, however, \nbelieve that we had a chance to build a supermajority in support of \nsome reform. We hoped that by dropping those provisions from the bill \nthat drew the loudest opposition last year, and by allowing Senators to \nimprove the legislation through an open amendment process, we might \nbegin to approach consensus.\n  It appears we were mistaken. The opponents of comprehensive reform \noppose even the most elemental reform. Those opponents abide on both \nsides of the aisle--if not in equal numbers, then in sufficient \nnumbers--to render any attempt to clean up the system a very difficult \nchallenge, indeed.\n  I suspect the opponents were concerned that were we ever allowed a \ntruly clean vote on a soft money ban, we might come close to 60 votes. \nI believe that explains the extraordinary efforts from both Democrats \nand Republicans to prevent that clean vote from occurring.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle that I have argued \nwith my Republican colleagues in the last two Congresses that reform \nsupporters deserve a decent chance, through an open amendment process, \nto break a filibuster. I can hardly complain to them now that the other \nside has apparently decided it could not risk such a process, fearing \nthat we might achieve what Democrats have long argued we should have--\nreform.\n  The Senator from New Jersey, Senator Torricelli, claims that the \nright wing of my party forced me to change our legislation. That will \nbe news to them. I have noticed no reduction in the intensity of their \nopposition to a soft money ban now that it no longer is accompanied by \nrestrictions on issue advocacy. All I have noticed is that the Senator \nfrom New Jersey has now become as passionately opposed to reform as are \nthe critics of reform in my party.\n  Although I cannot criticize Republican Senators for reneging on a \ncommitment to an open amendment process, I must observe that we were \npromised 5 full days of debate. That promise has not been honored. \nMoreover, the leadership decided to deny us even the opportunity to \nappeal to our colleagues before this vote, a rare and unusual occasion \naround here.\n  We were not allowed to continue our debate between the vote last \nnight and the votes we have just taken. Whether this was done to treat \nus unfairly or to respond to the tactics of the minority matters little \nto me. In the end, we are denied a fair chance to pass our reforms, as \nwe have been denied in the past. And although I am not all that \nsurprised by the tactics employed by both sides, I am, of course, a \nlittle discouraged.\n  However, Mr. President, neither Senator Feingold nor I are so \ndiscouraged that we intend to abandon our efforts to test Senate \nsupport for a ban on single source contributions that total in the \nhundreds of thousands, even million of dollars. We will persevere. And \nwe believe we are no longer bound by any commitment to refrain from \nrevisiting this issue in the remainder of this session of Congress. I \nknow there is not a lot of time left before adjournment, but if the \nopportunity exists to force an up or down vote on taking the hundred-\nthousand-dollar check out of politics, we will do so, Mr. President.\n  Some Senators may wonder why would we persist in these efforts when \nit is clear that the enemies of reform are numerous, resourceful, and \nbipartisan. Are we just tilting at windmills? I don't believe so Mr. \nPresident. I believe that some day, the American people are going to \nbecome so incensed by the amount of money that is now washing around \nour political system that they will hold Senators accountable for their \nvotes on this issue. Then, I suspect, we will achieve some consensus on \nreform. Until then, it is our intention to do all we can to make sure \nthe public has a clear record of support or opposition to reform upon \nwhich to judge us. Yesterday's cynical vote for a ban on soft money \nindicates to me just how fearful of a straight, up or down vote the \nopponents are.\n  Mr. President, I want to respond again to the criticism that my \nstated belief that our campaign finance system is corrupting is untrue \nand demeaning to Senators. Let me read a few lines from the 1996 \nRepublican Party platform.\n\n       Congress had been an institution steeped in corruption and \n     contemptuous of reform.\n       Scandals in government are not limited to possible criminal \n     violations. The public trust is violated when taxpayers' \n     money is treated as a slush fund for special interest groups \n     who oppose urgently needed reforms.\n       It is time to restore honor and integrity to government.\n\n  I repeat again. I am quoting from the Republican Party platform of \n1996.\n  Mr. President, I'm not saying anything more than what is, after all, \nthe official position of the Republican Party. Or is it my Republican \ncolleagues' view that only Democratic-controlled congresses are \n``Steeped in corruption and contemptuous of reform''?\n  As I said last week, Mr. President, something doesn't have to be \nillegal to be corrupting. Webster's defines corruption as an \n``impairment of our integrity.'' I am not accusing any Member of \nviolating Federal bribery Statutes. But we are all tainted by a system \nthat the public believes--rightly--results in greater representation to \nmonied interests than to average citizens. No, Mr. President, there is \nno law to prevent the exploitation of a soft money loophole to get \naround Federal campaign contribution limits. There is no law, but there \nought to be. That's why we're here.\n  Does anyone really believe that our current system has not impaired \nCongress' integrity or the President's for that matter? When special \ninterests give huge amounts of cash to us, and then receive tax breaks \nand appropriations at twice or five times or ten\n\n[[Page S12806]]\n\ntimes the value of their soft money donations. What is it these \ninterests expect for their generosity? Good government? No, they expect \na financial return to their stockholders, and they get it, often at the \nexpense of average Americans. Would they keep giving us millions of \ndollars if they weren't getting that return? Of course not.\n  Cannot we all agree to this very simple, very obvious truth: that \ncampaign contributions from a single source that run to the hundreds of \nthousands or millions of dollars are not healthy to a democracy? Is \nthat not evident to every single one of us? A child could see it, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The Senator from Kentucky said the other day that there is no \nevidence, no polling data, no indication at all that the people's \nestrangement from Congress would be repaired by campaign finance \nreform. He is correct, there is no such evidence.\n  But I have a hunch, Mr. President, that should the public see that we \nno longer lavish attention on major donors, should they see that their \nconcerns are afforded just as much attention as the concerns of special \ninterests, should they see some evidence that their elected \nrepresentatives place a higher value on the national interest than we \ndo on our own re-elections, should they no longer see tax bills, \nappropriations bills, deregulation bills that are front-loaded with \nbreaks for the people who write hundred-thousand-dollar checks to us \nwhile tax relief or urgent assistance or real competition, or anything \nthat could immediately benefit the average American is delayed until \nlater years, if ever, should they see that, Mr. President, I have a \nhunch, just a hunch, that the people we serve might begin to think a \nlittle better of us.\n  Mr. President, no matter what parliamentary tactics are used to \nprevent reform, no matter how fierce the opposition, no matter how \npersonal, no matter how cynical this debate remains, the Senator from \nWisconsin and I will persevere. We will not give up. We will not give \nup in the Senate. And we will take our case to the people, and \neventually, eventually, we will prevail.\n  I ask my colleagues, why must we appear to be forced into doing the \nright thing? Why can't we take the initiative, and show the people that \nit matters to us what they think of us?\n  Mr. President, despite our protestations to the contrary, the \nAmerican people believe we are corrupted by these huge donations. And \ntheir contempt for us--even were it not deserved--is itself a stain \nupon our honor. Don't allow this corrupt--and I use that term \nadvisedly--this corrupt system to endure one day longer than it must. \nWe have it in our power to end it. We must take the chance. Our \nreputations and the reputations of the institution in which we are \nprivileged to serve depend on it.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have just completed the 20th cloture \nvote on this subject since 1987. Since my party took over the majority \nin the Senate, the 52-48 vote was the highest watermark actually during \nthat period, and going all the way back over the 20 years I have been \ninvolved in this issue.\n  So I thank the 48 Senators--regretfully, all of them were \nRepublican--who resisted the temptation to support a measure that would \nhave quieted the voices of American citizens and destroyed the \neffectiveness of our national political parties.\n  Then, on the second vote, which was narrowed to only affect the two \ngreat political parties, there were 47 votes against that proposal, \nwhich is more than we had gotten on a much broader measure back in the \nfirst Congress after my party took over the Senate.\n  So I think it is safe to say there is no momentum whatsoever for this \nkind of measure which seeks to put the Government in charge of what \npeople may say, when they may say it, and attempts to take the two \ngreat American political parties out of the process.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona for retracting his statements on his \nweb site which were highly offensive to the Senator from Utah and the \nSenator from Washington State. We took a look at the web site. Those \nhave been deleted and we thank the Senator from Arizona for doing that.\n  Turning to the sequence of events over the last week, we began the \ndebate on Wednesday, October 13. Admittedly, it was later in the day \nthan the majority leader had intended. That was the day of the vote on \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, but those who were on the floor were \nready to go and suggested we begin Wednesday night at 7:30 p.m. and get \nstarted on the bill. There seemed to be not a whole lot of desire on \neither side to begin at that time of the night.\n  On Thursday, Republicans offered Senator McCain and Democrats an \noverall agreement providing for a vote on the Daschle-Shays-Meehan \namendment, and providing that all other amendments must be offered by \n5:30 on Monday. Consequently, this agreement would have outlined an \norderly fashion for debate and final disposition of the campaign \nfinance reform bill. That agreement was objected to by Senator McCain \nand our Democratic colleagues.\n  On Friday, Republicans offered Senator McCain and the Democrats an \nagreement that would provide for a time limit for debate on the \nDaschle-Shays-Meehan amendment and a vote in relation to that \namendment. That agreement was also objected to by our Democratic \ncolleagues.\n  Also on Friday, several efforts were made on behalf of the \nRepublicans to proceed with amendments to the pending campaign finance \nreform bill. The minority leader and the assistant minority leader then \noffered first and second-degree amendments, thereby filling up the \namendment tree. The first-degree amendment offered was the Shays-Meehan \nbill and the second degree was the McCain-Feingold bill. Cloture was \nthen filed on each amendment in the order stated. Those cloture votes, \nof course, have just occurred.\n  Again, on Friday, numerous unanimous consent agreements were offered, \nlargely by this Senator, in an effort to lay aside the pending \nDemocratic amendments in order to proceed with the amending process. \nThose consent agreements were objected to by the Democrats and thus the \nSenate was put in a holding pattern awaiting today's cloture votes.\n  Yesterday, the Senate debated throughout the day the pending two \namendments, and the Senator from Arizona made a motion to table the \nReid second-degree amendment and the motion to table vote occurred at \n5:45 yesterday and was defeated by a vote of 92-1.\n  The consent was offered to debate between 9:30 and 12:30 on Tuesday--\ntoday--calling for the cloture votes at 2 p.m. on Tuesday. That was \nobjected to. Therefore, the Senate had no alternative than to convene \nat 1:15 today and use the cloture rule to have the cloture votes occur \nat 2:15.\n  For the benefit of those who may not have followed this debate quite \nas closely as the Senator from Kentucky, I wanted to lay out the \nsequence of events since last Wednesday when we went to the bill and \nthe numerous efforts were made to have an open amending process so we \ncould have a chance to improve a bill that obviously is fatally flawed.\n  As is the case in all measures of any controversy in the Senate, I \nthink it is important to remember every controversial measure has to \nachieve a 60-vote threshold. That is not unusual. That is the norm. It \nshould not be surprising that this highly controversial measure, which \nmany people on my side believe is not bipartisan and not properly \ncrafted, would be subjected to the same 60 votes as other controversial \nmeasures.\n  The majority leader and the Republicans lived up to their end of the \nagreement. We are disappointed the Democrats refuse to abide by it. I \nam equally disappointed to hear the Senator from Arizona and the \nSenator from Wisconsin have announced they now refuse to honor that \nagreement.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No. I am about to yield the floor and you can say \nwhatever is desired.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have enjoyed working with the Senator from \nKentucky on this issue. He is certainly an expert at what is going on \nin the Senate. But I do say respectfully, he has over the years decided \nthat the best defense is a good offense. Certainly, that is what he has \ndone. One of\n\n[[Page S12807]]\n\nthe biggest targets he has talked about during the last few days is the \nDemocrats having stopped the Republicans from offering amendments to \nthis bill. It is simply not true, as indicated by the fact the Senator \nfrom Minnesota offered an amendment yesterday. There was still room to \noffer three or four amendments.\n  It was chosen as a matter of tactics not to offer amendments and then \ntalk about the fact they were not able to offer amendments. In fact, \nthe majority could have offered all the amendments they wanted. They \nsay, if cloture was invoked, the amendments would fail, well, that is \nthe way it always works around here.\n  We simply wanted a vote on the two issues before this body: The House \npassed Shays-Meehan bill; and the so-called ``McCain-Feingold lite''--\nthat is, to ban soft money.\n  That is what the debate has been about, an effort to avoid an up-or-\ndown vote on those two very important issues that the American public \ndeserve to have heard.\n  There was no holding pattern; the holding pattern was generated by \nthe majority themselves, as indicated by the actions taken by the \nmajority.\n  This is just the culmination of a number of things that we have \naround here. When the going gets tough, we go off the issue. The going \nwas just getting tough on this issue. My friend from Kentucky can spin \nthings; he is very good at that. Of course, everyone knows the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin and Senator McCain have picked up eight Republicans we \nnever had before. When the first votes took place on this issue, \nSenator Byrd was majority leader, we tried to invoke cloture seven \ntimes. The Democrats voted to invoke cloture on campaign finance \nreform, but we didn't have the support of Republicans, generally \nspeaking--certainly not eight. We now have that.\n  I say to my friend from Kentucky, he can spin it however he sees \nproper, but the numbers don't lie. We are picking up Republican \nSenators every time we have a vote on this issue. We have eight now. \nThat is a victory for campaign finance reform.\n  This debate should go forward, not be stopped now. As our Democratic \nleader further announced earlier today, there are issues we need to be \ntalking about. We should be talking about the Patients' Bill of \nRights--a real Patients' Bill of Rights, not the ``Patient Bill of \nWrongs'' passed out of this body. We should pass a Patients' Bill of \nRights as the House of Representatives did.\n  Minimum wage. Minimum wage is not for teenagers flipping hamburgers \nat McDonald's. People earn their living with minimum wage. Mr. \nPresident, 65 percent of the people drawing minimum wage are women; for \n40 percent of those women, that is the only money they get for their \nfamilies. Minimum wage is an issue we should be out speaking on today, \nnow.\n  Juvenile justice: We have been waiting for 5 months for that \nconference to be completed. It is not close to being done.\n  Medicare: We talked about Medicare. We go home and we know the \nproblems with Medicare. We did some things with the balanced budget \namendment that we need to correct. We should be working on that right \nnow.\n  Any time we have something important that is a little difficult, we \nwalk away from it, just as we walked away from one of the most \nimportant treaty's to come before the Senate, the Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty. We had 24 Republicans that signed a letter saying they thought \nthe treaty should not be acted on at this time, however, when the vote \ncame, they all walked away. The fact of the matter is if they didn't \nlike it in its present form, shouldn't we have had a debate on the \nSenate floor and maybe make some changes to it--just not vote it \ndown. We were prevented from doing that.\n\n  So I believe we should go forward on this most important issue. This \nis the fourth time during this debate I have had the duty of managing, \non the minority side, this bill, this most important campaign finance \nreform. This is the fourth time I have said this, and if I have the \nopportunity I will say it four more times.\n  The State of Nevada has less than 2 million people. In the campaign \nbetween Harry Reid and John Ensign almost a year ago, we don't know how \nmuch money was spent, but we know between the State party and Reid and \nEnsign campaigns we spent over $20 million. That does not count the \nindependent expenditures. We do not know how much they were. John \nEnsign and I estimate it was probably about $3 million in ads run for \nand against us. If you use no other example in America than the Reid-\nEnsign race of last year, that is a reason to take a real, strong, \nclose look at campaign finance reform.\n  Maybe after the two measures see the light of day and amendments are \noffered and we have a full debate, maybe they would be voted down. But \nshould not we at least have that opportunity? I think after what \nhappened in Nevada, if in no other place in America, we deserve a full \nairing of campaign finance reform. How in the world can you justify \nspending, in the State of Nevada, the money that was spent in that \nrace? John Ensign and Harry Reid have said to each other, and said \npublicly: We never had a chance to campaign against each other for \nourselves. We were buried by all this outside soft money.\n  Campaign finance reform, Patients' Bill of Rights, minimum wage, \njuvenile justice, Medicare--there are a lot of other things we should \nbe debating. But right now--today, this week --in the Senate, we should \nbe spending more time on campaign finance reform.\n  I say, as I have said on a number of occasions, I greatly appreciate \nthe efforts of my friend from Wisconsin. Here is a person who put his \ncareer on the line for a matter of principle. He was the original \nsponsor of McCain-Feingold. In the election that occurred last year, he \nalmost lost the election because he was buried by soft money. As a \nmatter of principle, Russ Feingold refused to allow anyone to use soft \nmoney in the State of Wisconsin for his benefit. He offended people by \nsaying: I know you are trying to help me, but I will not allow you to \nbring soft money in the State of Wisconsin as a matter of principle. He \nis still here. I have great admiration for him. I think what he has \ndone for the people of the State of Wisconsin and this country is \ncommendable.\n  If for no other reason, I believe he deserves a full debate in this. \nOf course he is joined with the Senator from Arizona.\n  We need to go forward on this issue. Personally, as has been \nindicated, I have supported the next measure the majority leader wants \nto bring up. But if I have an opportunity to vote on whether or not we \nare going to proceed to partial-birth abortion, I will vote no, even \nthough I am a supporter of that legislation.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the assistant minority leader \nfor his very kind remarks and his very strong remarks on the need to \nstay on this bill. I also thank the leader, Senator Daschle, for his \nstrong remarks in support of reform in the presence of so many \nDemocratic colleagues on the floor at that time right after the vote \nwas taken. Of course my gratitude goes to the Senator from Arizona for \ncontinuing to fight.\n  We are making progress. The story has not yet been told on this floor \nof what just happened on this vote. Certainly I do not share the \ninteresting account of the Senator from Kentucky, who seems elated that \nthree Republicans who have stuck with him all the way did not vote with \nhim this time. That is what just happened. That is what nobody is \npointing out.\n  Day after day after day in this effort I am asked: What other \nRepublicans are you going to get to support you, Russ? I am never sure \nbecause, obviously, each Senator makes his or her own decision. They \noften do not make their decisions until the last minute because these \nissues are often tough calls. But we finally had a vote where we found \nout we have a lot more support than some people thought. This is why \ngames have been played in the last couple of days. This is why we had \nthe Senator from Kentucky voting not to table a soft money ban last \nnight. I don't think he has changed his mind. But he urged every one of \nhis Republican colleagues last night to, in effect, vote to ban soft \nmoney after they just stood out here for 2 or 3 days and argued against \na ban.\n  Why? Why would they do that? Why did we not meet this morning? Why\n\n[[Page S12808]]\n\ndidn't the Senate do anything this morning? Here we are, near the end \nof one of the most difficult floor periods in a Congress, with \nappropriations bills and many other matters before us, with the \nleadership telling us over and over again we need to get all this work \ndone, but we did not meet this morning. I will tell you why. Because \nthe Senator from Kentucky knows his support is slipping. He may have \neven known we would pick up the support--and I say this to members of \nthe press and others who always ask me this: Who is going to support \nyou? This time we had Senators from Delaware and Arkansas and Kansas \nvote with us, including Senators who have never voted with us before.\n  I recognize there are still some tough issues to resolve for some of \nthe Senators who voted with us. But this is an exciting development. \nLast year the big deal was we had not gotten a majority. Then we got a \nmajority. The natural question is, How do you get to 60 votes? My \nanswer is, one at a time. But today we took three steps in that \ndirection. I think that tells you what is going on. They want to move \noff this bill because we are moving in the right direction. We are not \nthere yet but, boy, we are getting closer.\n  What will bring us to the end of this process, a fair end of this \nprocess? First of all, the understanding we had is that we would have 5 \nreal days of debate and amendment. You cannot count starting at 7:30 at \nnight on a Wednesday when Senators had left the Capitol as a day. So we \nare entitled, under this understanding, to come back in here the rest \nof today and tomorrow and debate this issue. We had three full days on \nthis bill--Thursday, Friday, and Monday. On two of those days we had no \nreal votes. Then today, the fourth day, we didn't come in until 1:15 \npm. That is not the five days of debate that we were promised.\n  I know there are other Senators on the Republican side who want to \njoin us, who want to add to the 55. But they want something every \nSenator has a right to want. They want a chance to offer amendments. \nThey have some ideas they would like to add to this soft money ban that \nI think could be acceptable, and they could finally help us break down \nthis absurd roadblock to banning this form of corruption that is \naffecting the Senate.\n  Make no mistake, three new Senators have voted with us. They do not \nrepresent an ideological group from the left or the right. They are \njust different Senators who, I believe, have finally had it with this \nsoft money system. This is why the Senator from Arizona and I used the \nstrategy of simplifying this bill, of saying let's at least have an up-\nor-down vote on soft money. That is what we just had. I find what these \nSenators did very encouraging. I thank them because it takes guts. It \nis tough to stand up to your leadership on this. They did it. I am \ngrateful for this vote. It is very significant.\n  So we should not leave the issue now. This is the time to let those \nSenators, and other Senators who have indicated an interest in banning \nsoft money, come to the floor, offer their amendments, and see if we \ncan fashion a compromise that could cause the Senate to be proud and to \njoin the House in trying to actually do something about this problem.\n  I thank all the Senators who will assist us in preventing this matter \nfrom coming off the floor. It belongs on the floor. It is the most \nimportant issue before this country, and we need to continue to work on \nit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent my comments not count under the \ntwo-speech rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator McCain and \nSenator Feingold for their efforts, though I must say I take exception \nto the comment of Senator McCain which he made earlier. He is my very \nclose friend. I have worked with him very closely on a lot of issues. \nBut when he suggests there is a bipartisan opposition to reform, I \nthink he is not paying tribute to the fact that no Democrat voted \nagainst cloture. No Democrat voted against proceeding to the full \nmeasure of germane amendments that would precede the bill. So even \nthough the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. Torricelli, may feel very \nstrongly about not just dealing with soft money, he was prepared to \naccept the verdict of the Senate in a normal process of amendment. This \nis not bipartisan in opposition. There is only one group of people who \nvoted against proceeding to campaign finance reform, only one group, \nand I regret it is entirely on the other side of the aisle, the \nRepublicans, because, obviously, we are not trying to make this \npartisan.\n  We were very grateful for those courageous Republicans who decided \nthe time has come to vote for campaign finance reform. Obviously, we \nwant them. We desperately need more Republicans who are willing to \nembrace campaign finance reform.\n  But the fact remains that on the critical votes of whether or not the \nSenate was prepared to eliminate the extraneous amendments, have \ncloture, and proceed to the process of debating this bill, not one \nDemocrat said no to that. It was only Republicans who have stopped the \nSenate in its tracks.\n  Where do we find ourselves? What did the Senator from Kentucky say? \nHe recited a few days of histrionics, a few days of sort of \nmaneuvering. We had a whole morning, this morning, as the Senator from \nWisconsin was saying, where we could have debated this. Why didn't we \ndebate this morning? The Senate did not even convene until 1 hour prior \nto having the votes, and that was because under the consent order \npreviously entered into, with the two cloture votes, those votes were \ngoing to take place 1 hour after the Senate convened.\n  So what could be more convenient? Convene the Senate as late as \npossible so that you have no time to debate and then proceed to have \ntwo votes. Why? Because you cannot turn up the heat on the issue; \nbecause the television cameras will not be on; because the galleries \nare not open; because the American people will not be sharing in a real \ndebate about the impact--the corrosive impact--of money on the American \npolitical system.\n  And our 47 and 48 colleagues on the other side of the aisle who stand \nthere and close down the process ought to take a sampling of the people \nwho are in the galleries. I know we are not allowed to do that, but I \nbet if you asked every single one of them, as they leave this Chamber, \n``Do you think there is too much money in American politics? Do you \nthink the money gains access to the system? Do you think the money \ndistorts the process? Do you think the money somehow does favor for \ncertain issues over the general interests?'' Every single one of those \npeople, or at least 85, 90 percent would tell you, yes, there is too \nmuch money in American politics, and it separates the average citizen \nfrom the people they elected to represent them. Overwhelmingly, \nAmericans believe that. And, overwhelmingly, Americans understand there \nis a connection between what happens in Washington and what does not \nhappen in Washington and all of the contributions.\n  This is the fight that some of us came to have: The fight over \nwhether or not we are going to have a fair political system.\n  I understand a lot of our friends on the other side of the aisle do \nnot want to change the system. Politics has a certain amount of self-\ninterest in it; and the self-interest of getting reelected is a \npowerful one. A lot of our colleagues over on the other side of the \naisle have a lot more money available to them than Democrats.\n  I was outspent in every election I ran in until the last election \nwhen a Republican agreed with me to do something different. We had a \nfair playing field. He was a sitting Governor. I was a sitting Senator. \nSo you know what we did. We both banned soft money--no soft money in \nour campaigns; we banned independent expenditures--no independent \nexpenditures; and we actually reached an agreement that we would both \nlimit ourselves to how much money we would spend in our race.\n  Then we did something else different. We had nine 1-hour televised \ndebates so the people in our State could share in a good, healthy \nexchange about the issues that matter to them.\n\n  So you can do it differently. You can do it differently. But if a lot \nof incumbents sit here and say: Boy, I like that money; it's so much \neasier for me to go\n\n[[Page S12809]]\n\ndown to the Hyatt Hotel or the Hilton Hotel or the Sheraton and have an \nevent; and there are a whole lot of people who can afford the flight, \nthe air ticket to Washington, and then can, after the air ticket, \nafford to bring a big check to me, come and meet me for a little while, \nand I can collect a whole lot of money--that way, I can fund a \ncampaign--that is pretty easy. Most challengers in this country cannot \ndo that.\n  The end effect of that is literally to strip away the vibrancy of our \nown democracy because what happens is the money is very well \nrepresented. But the points of view that do not have the money are not \nas well represented. And no one here can deny that. No one here can \ndeny that.\n  We have heard a lot of talk in the last few days about corruption. We \nhave heard about the way money corrupts politics, about how it corrupts \nthe system. I express my admiration to the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, my friend who is on the floor of the Senate. I think he has \na lot of guts. He has a lot of courage to come to the floor of the \nSenate and tell a lot of people the truth. And a lot of people do not \nlike to hear it.\n  So it got very personal last Friday--very personal--as we got led off \ninto a tangential debate where one Senator was challenging Senator \nMcCain, was challenging him to name names, lay out for us a list of \nthose in the Senate who have been corrupted.\n  I say to my colleague who was asking that question: Where does that \nline of questioning take us? Where does that line of questioning take \nus? No Member of the Senate that I know of runs around impugning the \ncharacter or the integrity of another colleague. That is not what the \nSenator from Arizona was doing.\n  What the Senator from Arizona was doing was having the courage to \npoint out that we are all prisoners--something he knows something \nabout. But in this case, we are also the jail keepers because we have \nthe key. We have the ability to release every single one of us from \nthis prison--where we have to go out and raise these extraordinary \namounts of money, where we allow ourselves to be proselytized by groups \nof people who spend $100 million a month in this city, either to get us \nto do something or to stop us from doing something. Think about it.\n  Then go out and ask how many of the average Americans are \ncontributing to that $100 million. Ask the folks working two or three \njobs, ask the folks who pay their taxes and struggle to send their kids \nto a good school, and who know their kids need technology and child \ncare and health care and a whole lot of other things if they feel well \nrepresented by that $100 million.\n  How many of them are lined up outside the Commerce Committee or the \nBanking Committee or the Ag Committee, or any other committee, when we \nhave a markup around here?\n  How many of them can afford to send a young messenger to wait in \nline, from the early hours of the morning, so they are assured of \nhaving a seat where the action is taking place?\n  I think we ought to get away from the side arguments and the side \ndiversions and understand what the Senator from Arizona, the Senator \nfrom Wisconsin, the Senator from Minnesota, and a whole lot of other \nSenators, a majority of the Senate, think about that, a majority.\n  This is not some wild-eyed, crazy fringe, tiny group of Senators who \nare somehow trying to stop the Senate from doing business. This is a \nmajority of the Senate who believes the time has come to have campaign \nfinance reform. Oh, sure, we all know the rules say it takes 60 votes. \nThat is a supermajority. We all understand that. But on the great \nfights of the Senate, people were willing to stay and fight. It took 6 \nweeks, I think, of filibuster for the Civil Rights Act to pass. We can \ngo back in history through a lot of other great debates of the Senate. \nIt took a long time, with serious work, serious meetings, serious \nefforts to try to reach agreement.\n\n  Let me give Senators a critical fact concerning the perception among \nthe American people today. I don't think anybody can disagree with \nthis. Some people want to avoid it, but I don't think an honest, \nintellectual assessment would allow them to disagree with it. Every \npoll shows it; every conversation anybody might have, even with the top \ncorporate chieftains of this country. I have talked to some of the top \nCEOs of some of the biggest Fortune 500 companies in the country about \nhow they feel about fundraising--from a Democrat or from a Republican. \nThose are the people who are increasingly turning off the current \nsystem. They are scared. They don't voluntarily get out of it.\n  There are a few who have. The committee of businessmen that has come \ntogether with a new plan has had the courage to say: We are not going \nto give to Republicans, and we are not going to give to Democrats, \neither. I have heard so many of these CEOs say: I know it is bad; I \nknow it is corrupting. I don't like it; I don't want to be part of it. \nBut if I unilaterally stop doing it, my competitor will be at the \ntable, and I won't be at the table.\n  That is what happens. So they don't do it. The fact is, the majority \nof Americans believe the amount of money spent on campaigns gains a \nspecial access to the political system for those who are most capable \nof contributing, whatever side they are on, whatever side of the issue.\n  Let's assume, for the sake of argument, no Senator is affected by the \nmoney that is given. Take the word ``corruption'' off the table, as it \napplies to any specific act of any legislator. Ask yourself, by fairer \njudgment, if the group that wants to achieve goal A can go out and \nraise tens of millions of dollars and have the ability to then load \nthat money into campaigns for people who will vote for what goal A is, \nand the people in goal B are all pretty poor or don't have access to \nmoney or aren't organized and don't have the ability to contribute the \nsame way, but their goal may be equally worthy or, in fact, more \nworthy, is there a fairness in the system? Is there a form of \ncorruption of the political process, not of the people but of the \npolitical process, that denies the kind of fair playing field I think \nis at the heart of the kind of democracy this country wants to provide \nits citizenry and for which it really stands?\n  I think the perception of that unweighted playing field, the \nperception of that unfairness ought to concern every Member of the \nSenate.\n  We can sit back and point to our own personal integrity. We can say \nwe don't make decisions on public policy based on campaign \ncontributions. The truth is, we are extraordinarily exposed to the \ngeneral awareness and perception and belief and cynicism that is now \nattached to the system which says that the money speaks and that it \nmakes a huge difference.\n  I think such a significant portion of Americans are affected by this \nthat, in point of fact, the standard set up by the Supreme Court with \nrespect to the perception of corruption is met.\n  When the Senator from Kentucky--I will talk about this a little \nlater--talks about the first amendment, there is a sufficient test \nunder first amendment standards that would allow the Court to make a \ndecision in favor of some restraints. They have already done that. They \ndid it in 1972, in 1974. We certainly have the right to do it now.\n  I ask my colleagues, every year 20,000 Americans are poisoned with \nthe E. coli bacteria when they eat contaminated food. They have found \ntuberculosis in beef, and two-thirds of chickens contain the \npotentially deadly campylocbacter bacteria. That is not a finding of \npoliticians. That is what scientists tell us. But in spite of the rapid \nspread of food-borne illnesses, we haven't responded. We haven't done \nanything. Walk into a room of 50 ordinary Americans and tell them we \nhaven't done anything to promote public health needs on this issue, \nthat every single bill that has come before us on food-borne illnesses \nhas been killed, and then tell them the food industry has made $41 \nmillion in campaign contributions to congressional candidates over the \nlast 10 years. Almost every person who hears that will say: I bet you \nthere is some kind of connection there.\n  Seventeen thousand people were killed by drunk drivers last year. \nMothers Against Drunk Driving, the National Safety Council, and \nhundreds of other organizations formed a coalition to pass stricter \nstandards on drunk driving, in order to keep drunk drivers off the road \nand get tougher on them when we catch them. Almost\n\n[[Page S12810]]\n\neveryone agrees this would save lives. But the regulations didn't pass. \nSurprise.\n  Ask the average person on the street if they think our inaction on \nsomething as obvious as that has any connection to the over $100,000 \nspent by Alcohol Wholesalers, by the National Restaurant Association, \nWine and Spirits Wholesalers, other alcoholic beverage organizations, \nthat gave to both sides, Democrats and Republicans alike. Ask them if \nthey think there is a connection.\n\n  Last year, we tried to do something to respond to the fact that every \nday 3,000 kids become smokers. We know, because the doctors and \nscientists tell us, that half of those children will wind up dying \nearly and costing us enormous sums of money in our medical care system \nuntil they ultimately die from their addiction. Ask the average \nAmerican if they believe all our legislative efforts on tobacco fell \napart, or at least in any part was it connected to the fact that Philip \nMorris and all the other big tobacco companies spent millions of \ndollars over every year for several years in contributions to both \nparties to hundreds of candidates for the House and the Senate. Was \nthat a spending in the general public interest? Was that a spending in \nthe interest of the Nation?\n  Certainly--and I agree with my colleague from Kentucky--if it wasn't \nspent to elect a candidate, if it was spent to sell the virtue of \ntobacco or of something that had nothing to do with an election, \ncertainly that fits under the first amendment. I understand that. That \nis a separate issue that can be dealt with separately.\n  I think we have to be even more frank than that in sort of \nacknowledging the kind of connection people perceive. The truth is, I \nthink all of us know, to varying degrees, we are trapped in a reality \nwhere big money gets its calls returned. Big money gets its meetings. \nBig money gets the face time it asks for and looks for. We can see it \nin all of the fundraisers that take place in this city and in other \nparts of the country. Every single one of us is sensitive to that \nreality. I understand that.\n  There are very few Senators who don't work hard to try to undo that, \nthe notion of the walls of the prison, if you will. I don't think \nSenators like it particularly. Some are content to live with it, even \nthough they may not like it. The reality is, nonetheless, it changes \nthe way the institution operates.\n  We only have to listen to someone such as Senator Byrd, the former \nleader, who has seen it on every side and has seen it change over the \nyears that he has been in the Senate. He will tell us how the Senate \nhas changed in the way it operates because of the amount of money in \nour system today.\n  I say to my colleagues, rather than put current Members on the spot, \nlisten to what some of our colleagues who have retired from Congress, \nwho are liberated from having to raise the money, who are out of the \nsystem, have said about the current game in which they were once \ntrapped.\n  Representative Jim Bacchus, a Democrat from Florida:\n\n       I have, on many occasions, sat down and listened to people \n     solely because I knew they have contributed to my campaign.\n\n  There is an honest statement by a former Representative. I don't \nexpect all my colleagues to stand up and say that, but that is what he \nsaid.\n  When asked whether Members of Congress are compromising the \ninstitution of Congress when they solicit contributions from the \nspecial interests they regulate, former House minority leader Bob \nMichel, a Republican from Illinois, said simply:\n\n       There is no question. I don't know how you even change \n     that. It is a sad way of life here.\n\n  That is a former leader in the House of Representatives, and a \nRepublican.\n  I don't have the quote, but I remember my friend, Paul Laxalt, one of \nthe closest friends of Ronald Reagan, who, when he left the Senate, \nsaid unequivocally:\n\n       The amount of money being raised in the U.S. Congress was \n     corrupting the process, and it was having a profound impact \n     on the quality of the U.S. Congress.\n\n  Listen to what former Representative Peter Kostmayer said:\n\n       You get invited to a dinner somewhere, and someone gives \n     you money, and then you get a call a month later and he wants \n     to see you. Are you going to say no? You are just not going \n     to say no.\n\n  Why do the special interests give money? I think everybody would \nagree that former Senator and majority leader George Mitchell was a man \nof enormous integrity. He led the Senate. He has been leading the peace \ntalks in Northern Ireland, a person of huge integrity, a former U.S. \ndistrict judge, a former Senate leader. George Mitchell summed it up \nsaying:\n\n       I think it gives them the opportunity to gain access and \n     present their views in a way that might otherwise not be the \n     case.\n\n  That is fundamentally the flaw. The Senator from Kentucky and others \ncan take umbrage at the notion of the use of the word ``corruption,'' \nbut you don't have to be specifically corrupt in some way that breaks \nthe law to be sharing in a general corruption, an ``impairment of the \nintegrity,'' as Webster defines it, of the institution, and the \nintegrity of this institution is impaired by the current system.\n  I mentioned a moment ago some of the best minds in the business \ncommunity--CEOs and others--who have shared with me, and I know with \nother colleagues, that they find the current system nauseating, \nsickening. They are tired of being ``shaken down''. That is their term, \nnot ours. I know there are letters that have been sent by Members of \nthe Congress to those groups that don't give. People have been \nthreatened not to give to the other party. People have been threatened. \nThese stories have all appeared in the Washington Post, New York Times, \nLos Angeles Times, Boston Globe--stories all across the country. People \nbelieve if they don't play the game on the fundraising circuit, they \nwill lose out in the subcommittees, the committees, and on the floor.\n  We saw, this summer, that some prominent business executives joined a \ncoalition for campaign finance reform, called the Committee for \nEconomic Development. They promptly received a letter from the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee telling them in no uncertain terms:\n\n       If you disagree with the radical campaign finance agenda of \n     the CED, I would think that public withdrawal from this \n     organization would be a reasonable response.\n\n  So what is the message there? The business leaders told me what they \nthought the message was. They said: We find it ironic that you are--\n  This is what they sent to Senator McConnell. This is their response \nto the people who are trying to keep us from voting for campaign \nfinance reform. The business leaders wrote:\n\n       We find it ironic that you are such a fervent defender of \n     First Amendment freedoms, but seem intent to stifle our \n     efforts to express publicly our concerns about a campaign \n     finance system that many of us believe is out of control.\n\n  I don't raise these issues to suggest in any way that any individual \nMember of this body is corrupt. I am not saying that, nor is the \nSenator from Arizona. But the system is leading us all down a road that \ndiminishes the trust of the American people in this institution and \nthat diminishes our connection to the American people and therefore \ntheir faith in the system of Government and in the capacity of this \nGovernment to do what our Founding Fathers wanted it to do.\n  This is less and less a real democracy, and more and more a ``dollar-\nocracy,'' a democracy mostly decided and impacted by the amounts of \nmoney that can be raised and spent, and not by the quality of the ideas \nthat are put forward and debated in the great manner of Lincoln and \nDouglas and others who took ideas to the American people.\n  Are we scared of ideas? Do we have to pitch every idea in a 30-second \nadvertisement, or a 60-second advertisement, and flood the airwaves \nwith seductive, distorted, completely contrived messages, rather than \nlaying out to the American people a series of facts and relying on them \nto choose?\n  I have been here now for 15 years, and every year I have been here we \nhave tried to achieve campaign finance reform. In fact, I was the \nauthor, together with Senator Boren, Senator Mitchell, and others, of \nan original effort that had a component of public financing. We \nactually passed that on the floor of the Senate when the Democrats were \nin the majority. President Bush vetoed it. Subsequently, we got\n\n[[Page S12811]]\n\nas many as maybe 46--I think it was--votes for a bill that might have \nhad some component of public financing.\n  But, each year, as the Republican majority has grown, the number of \npeople willing to embrace a broader set of reforms has also diminished, \nleaving us now with a stripped-down version of McCain-Feingold--\nstripped-down to the point that many people on our side of the aisle \nfear that it may have the unintended consequences of the 1974 reforms; \nthat if you do one component of reform, but you don't have a fair \nplaying field, you simply unleash torrents of money into other sectors \nthat may wind up having a negative impact on the ability of people to \nbe elected.\n  I think we have to act. I say to my colleague from Kentucky, the \nnotion that the members of the media are going to sit there--those who \nhave covered the Senate for years--and believe that 4 days of \ntruncated, half-hearted debate somehow  represents a legitimate effort \non campaign finance reform is beyond anything credible. I don't think a \nmember of the media could believe that when we sit here and say, well, \nwe went to this last Thursday, and on Friday half of the Senate left to \ngo home, and on Monday half of them hadn't come back, and on Tuesday \nmorning there was absolutely no debate at all, and then we had two \nvotes, and pretend somehow that the Senate has done anything serious \nabout campaign finance reform. What a farce. What a joke.\n\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to understand that \nthis is an issue that isn't going to go away. We must begin to be \nserious about having a fair playing field--and I do mean a fair playing \nfield, not trying to jockey it for Democrats or for Republicans but \ndeciding as a matter of common sense how we can approach an election.\n  We are supposed to be the premier democracy on the face of this \nplanet. We are supposed to be setting the example for people in other \nparts of the world. And more and more people look at our system, and \nsay: That is what it is all about? They spend $20 million in States \nsuch as Nevada chewing each other apart trying to prove what an evil \nAmerican the other guy or woman is. How extraordinary.\n  I think everybody on our side of the aisle was prepared to go into \nlong and serious meetings. We are prepared to caucus. We are prepared \nto have efforts to try to decide how we can come up with a fair playing \nfield. We ought to have a real debate because we need to understand \nthat the costs of campaigning are eliminating the capacity for fully \nrepresentative government for most Americans. Some people do not \nbelieve that. I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue \nwith fervor that the first amendment is represented by money, and the \nmore money you can raise, the fairer it is. You can go out and \ncampaign.\n  In 1996, House and Senate candidates spent more than $756 million. \nThat is a 76-percent increase since 1990. And it is a sixfold, 600-\npercent increase since 1976.\n  The average cost of a race in 1976 was $600,000 for a winning Senate \nrace. The average cost went to $3.3 million.\n  Many of us in 1996 were forced to spend more than that. My race in \n1996 was the most expensive race of that year in the country--a paltry \nsum compared to the Senator from California. I think she and her \ncolleague had to raise upwards of $20 million, and I think perhaps $30 \nmillion was spent against Senator Feinstein. I am not sure of Senator \nBoxer--but somewhere in that vicinity. My race in Massachusetts was \ncheap compared to that. We had only $12.5 million, maybe $13 \nmillion for 6 million people.\n\n  In constant dollars, we have seen an increase of over 100 percent in \nthe money spent for Senator races from 1980 to 1994.\n  I know Senators don't do this. Not every Senator is raising money \nevery single week. But many are because of the vast sums they have to \nraise. But on average, each Senator has to raise $12,000 a week for 6 \nyears to pay for his or her reelection campaign. That is just the tip \nof the iceberg now because we have had this incredible explosion in \nsoft money.\n  Soft money represents everybody taking advantage of the loopholes. It \nwasn't the intention of campaign finance reform or Congress to allow \nsoft money. I must admit some Democrats managed to develop that \nloophole rather more effectively at the outset than some Republicans. \nIt doesn't make it right.\n  In 1988, Democrats and Republicans raised a combined $45 million in \nsoft money; in 1992, that number doubled to $90 million; and in 1995 to \n1996, that number tripled to $262 million.\n  Do you know where it comes from? It comes from U.S. Senators who are \npassing legislation making telephone calls, or having meetings with \nhigh-powered corporate types, or very rich people who write checks for \n$50,000, $100,000, $200,000, and $300,000. Indeed, I believe the last \nyear, in 1996, there were nine people in America who wrote checks for \n$500,000.\n  That is where it comes from. And don't let anybody kid you. It goes \ninto campaigns. It wasn't meant to originally. But now it goes almost \ndirectly into campaigns.\n  So you, frankly, have corporations and a lot of big money directed \ninto the campaign process which was never the intention of the U.S. \nCongress back in 1974 when they passed campaign finance reform.\n  Do you know why ordinary citizens believe they are being shut out? Do \nyou know why the average American doesn't believe the system is on the \nup and up? Do you know why the average American thinks big money gets \ninfluence over their money? I will tell you why. Because fewer than \none-third of 1 percent of eligible voters donated more than $250 in the \nelectoral cycle of 1996.\n  I want to repeat that. Why do people think the system is out of \nwhack? Because fewer than one-third of 1 percent of all the eligible \nvoters in America gave more than $250 in the electoral cycle.\n  Think what would happen in this country if we invited people, as we \nused to do in the Tax Code, to take a tax deduction for a $50 or $100 \ndonation. And those tax deductions, when people were encouraged to take \nthem, in fact, added up to about $500 million a cycle, which would have \npaid for almost all the races back then. You could do it with small \ndonations, if they wanted to--if they wanted to. But they like to go \nout and get the bigger dollars. One-third of 1 percent of Americans \ncontribute over $250.\n  Ask most Americans what they think they are capable of giving to \ncampaigns or are able to contribute, and you will get a sense of the \ngreat divorce in this country, a huge gulf, a Grand Canyon of campaign \nfinance gap that is separating the average American from the political \nprocess.\n  Then we have another problem in the system--the issue ads. These are \nthose ubiquitous TV and radio ads bought by all kinds of special \ninterests to persuade the American people to vote for or against a \ncandidate. Usually, these ads are negative. They are usually \ninaccurate. But they are one of the driving forces of the American \npolitical process today. They violate the spirit of campaign finance \nlaws in the country. Of course, they do.\n\n  Listen to what the executive director of the National Rifle \nAssociation Institute for Legislative Action said. He said:\n\n       It is foolish to believe there is a difference between \n     issue advocacy and advocacy of a political candidate. What \n     separates issue advocacy and political advocacy is a line in \n     the sand drawn on a windy day.\n\n  Mr. President, the American people want us to fix this system.\n  An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll shows that 70 percent of the public \nbelieves campaign finance reform is needed.\n  So what the Republican Party is doing today is saying, well, we don't \ncare what 70 percent of the American people are willing to do. They are \nunwilling to pass campaign finance reform that is fair, unwilling even \nto deal with it in a serious way.\n  Last spring, a New York Times poll found that an astonishing 91 \npercent of the public favor a fundamental transformation of the system.\n  I believe we ought to be able to deliver on that kind of reform.\n  Some of our colleagues believe that reforming the current finance \nsystem in a comprehensive manner would violate the Constitution. The \nconstitutionality of a ban on soft money could raise questions. I think \nthe issue of a total ban on soft money, depending on how it is \nstructured, could conceivably be worked out in a thoughtful and artful \nway. But the point is it is fundamentally a sham issue as it is being\n\n[[Page S12812]]\n\npresented by the other side. And the first amendment is being used as a \nshield to prevent the proper scrutiny of this issue and to prevent us \nfrom changing it.\n  The truth is there are ways that you can reform the system within the \nconfines of the first amendment.\n  On the critical soft money issues, leading constitutional scholars \nand former ACLU leaders agree that banning soft money contributions \nwill not violate the Constitution if properly constructed. And we \nforget that the Supreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo held that limits \non individual campaign contributions do not violate the first \namendment. It simply cannot be said the first amendment provides an \nabsolute prohibition of any and all restrictions on speech.\n  When State interests are more important than unfettered free speech, \nthat speech is appropriately allowed to be narrowly limited.\n  Speech is already limited. We know in cases of false advertising and \nobscenity. And I think it is clear that under the limits of Buckley we \ncan deal with the risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption \nand the warranted limits on individual campaign contributions.\n  The ban proposed in McCain-Feingold simply requires all contributions \nto national political parties be subject to the existing Federal \nrestrictions on contributions to those parties that are used to \ninfluence Federal elections, and it would bar State and local parties \nfrom raising soft money for activities that might affect a Federal \nelection. Groups remain completely free to spend as much money as they \nwant on speech.\n  This is a red herring, a straw man. It is well used, I might add, by \nthe Senator from Kentucky, but it is wrong. I am convinced the courts \nwould ultimately hold it so, were we to do our work properly.\n  We've also heard that if we ban soft money, we will \nunconstitutionally infringe upon the rights of special interest groups \nto engage in free speech. I would respectfully suggest that there is \nsome real confusion here. The ban proposed in McCain-Feingold would \nsimply require that all contributions to national political parties be \nsubject to existing federal restrictions on contributions those parties \nuse to influence federal elections, and it would bar state and local \nparties from using soft money for activities that might affect a \nfederal election. Groups would remain free to spend as much as they \nwanted on speech--they simply could not funnel that money through the \npolitical parties.\n  Another favorite argument offered by those opposed to reform is that \nwe already have bribery laws to prevent corruption and the appearance \nof corruption. This argument ignores the fact that the Supreme Court in \nBuckley explicitly considered and rejected the same claim. The Court \nsaid that it was up to Congress to decide whether bribery and \ndisclosure laws were enough to address the federal problem with real \nand perceived corruption. A majority of the Members of the House and \nSenate do not believe the bribery laws are sufficient to \nlimit corruption or the appearance of corruption.\n\n  Opponents of campaign finance reform are vehement that any effort to \ncontrol or limit sham issue ads would violate the first amendment. They \nargue that as long as you don't use the words ``vote for'' or ``vote \nagainst'', you can say just about anything you want in an \nadvertisement. But that is simply not what the Supreme Court said in \nBuckley. It said that one way to identify campaign speech that can be \nregulated is by looking at whether it uses words of express advocacy. \nBut the Court never said that Congress was precluded from adopting \nanother test so long as it was clear, precise and narrow. It is exactly \nthat kind of test that is included in Shays-Meehan and that I hope can \nbe put back into the reform bill we are debating here today.\n  I believe reasonable people can come together and work through these \nfirst amendment questions. Certainly that ought to be a challenge the \nUnited States Senate is capable of meeting. And I believe that if we \ncan do that we can move on to a question no longer of whether to reform \nthe campaign system, but how.\n  I believe that the amendment offered by our minority leader would \nhelp us embrace reform. Though not a cure, embracing the Shays-Meehan \nmodel passed in the House treats the most serious symptoms that \nthreaten the health of our whole democratic system.\n  Let me say again, this amendment is by no means sweeping reform. It \ndoes not limit spending by candidates. It does not replace private \ncampaign contributions with clean money. But, it does address two of \nthe most serious problems with our current, broken campaign finance \nsystem. It bans soft money and it clamps down on phony issue ads. We \nmust attack both of these problems simultaneously if our campaign \nfinance system has any hope for recovery.\n  And I would remind the Senate that even those of us who agree that \nthere is a serious problem have different ideas on how to fix it, or \nwhat aspect in particular most desperately needs a cure.\n  I have long been an advocate of one particular kind of reform. I \njoined Senator Wellstone once again this year in offering a clean money \nbill that would take special interest money out of the political \nsystem. But I am a realist. The Senate is not yet ready to embrace \nsomething as broad as clean money, in spite of its merits. that is not \ngoing to happen yet, but I continue to hope and believe that it will \nsomeday.\n\n  In the meantime, we must focus on finding a remedy for the worst of \nthe problems from which our campaign finance system suffers. I believe \nShays-Meehan can do that.\n  And, Mr. president, I believe we can move this debate forward and \npass this legislation if we can avoid the hot-button issues on both \nsides, the poison pill amendments we've encountered again and again \nwhich have stopped us in our tracks.\n  One amendment which particularly worries me is the so-called paycheck \nprotection amendment. Some of my colleagues on the other side are \nadvocating that unions obtain written authorization from all union \nmembers before using any portion of union dues for political activity. \nThe amendment would not require corporations to obtain the same written \nauthorization from shareholders before using corporate treasury funds \nused for political activity. Proponents of this amendment complain that \nunion dues are used to run issue advocacy campaigns that are really \nthinly disguised electioneering. However, rather than closing the issue \nadvocacy loophole, which would comprehensively solve the problem, my \ncolleagues on the other side would inhibit unions only while leaving \ncorporations as well as conservative advocacy groups untouched.\n  If paycheck protection were passed, it would limit almost all \npolitical activities by unions, not just use advocacy. It would gut the \nfunds the unions use for internal communications activities, \nparticularly get out the vote activities. Rather than adopting this \ninherently unfair amendment, which would target only unions, a better \nsolution is to close the issue advocacy and soft money loopholes. I \nhope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in opposing \na paycheck protection amendment if one comes up.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can avoid those poison pills, I hope we can \nactually pass something this week, and that we can support the campaign \nfinance reform bill that was passed in the House, so that we have the \ntools to remedy both sham issue ads and soft money.\n  There is an awful lot riding on this debate. Because we have been \ndown this road before, many think the result is a foregoing conclusion. \nIn a front page article last Tuesday, the Washington Post stated,\n  ``. . . opponents of reform will rest easy in the knowledge that \nnothing will be accomplished.'' I hope the Post is wrong. I believe we \ncan make the system better. We are not going to take all of the steps \nthat would be necessary for a cure, but we can take care of the parts \nof the system that are hurting all of us the most. And that is a course \nof action on which all our citizens--and this Senate--ought to be able \nto agree.\n  I urge the Senate not to turn away from a real process where we sit \ntogether, work through the objections, have honest debate and \ndiscussion, and allow the Senate to work its will on the floor of the \nSenate rather than\n\n[[Page S12813]]\n\nwalking away again from one of the most urgent needs as expressed by \nour fellow citizens in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. He \nis eloquent on this subject.\n  I am grateful we have been able to extend the debate on campaign \nfinance reform at least a little bit because of this motion that has \nbeen made. On the other hand, it was our understanding we were going to \nbe on campaign finance reform for 5 days. Sadly, we didn't have the \nexpectation met that we would be 5 days on this particular matter.\n  I know the Senator from Michigan is here. I ask unanimous consent \nupon completing my remarks the Senator from Michigan be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer in his capacity as the \nSenator from Washington objects.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is hard for me to understand why my \nfriend objects, but that is his right to do so.\n  I wanted the Senator from Michigan to be heard because he is feeling \nvery strongly this particular vote we are going to have is as important \nas the other two votes we took on the procedural matter of cloture. If \nSenators believe we should have campaign finance reform, they should \nvote against the motion to proceed to an abortion issue that truly \nshould not be coming before this Senate. I will have more to say on why \nI believe that to be the case. The Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, I \nam sure, will get the time on his own accord at the appropriate moment.\n  As Members know, the Democratic side of the aisle was not going to \nobject to going to the abortion issue--although many do not believe it \nis the right time to do so--we would not object to that and we would \nhave been willing to go to that. It would have meant as soon as the \ndebate was finished on that abortion issue, we would have gone back to \ncampaign finance reform. Because of the parliamentary maneuver of the \nmajority leader, Senator Lott, we will not be able to go back \nautomatically to campaign finance reform if we vote to proceed to the \nabortion question.\n  I make a case for voting against that. I think the best case to make \nis the issue we have been trying to debate for the last few days, the \nissue of campaign finance reform.\n  I stood on this floor last week and admitted, with all eyes upon me, \nI was a user of the campaign finance system, I was good at it, I was \nbetter at it than my opponents. I know how to use the system. I have \nbeen in Congress since 1983. I learned very well by making mistakes \nearly in my career that Members need the resources in order to answer \nthe charges that are thrown against them.\n  I say the system is broken for three reasons. One, the average person \ndoesn't believe in this system. They have tuned out. They don't vote \nbecause they believe, rightly or wrongly, that it is the people with \nthe money who are the people with the access who essentially control \nthis agenda. They feel very left out of the system.\n  Second, there is an appearance of corruption. Everyone who partakes \nin this system plays the game that to many Americans appears to be \ncorrupt. We all play it well. The system has the potential to corrupt, \nand the system, at a minimum, has the appearance of corruption.\n  Third, this system takes too much of our time away from our work, \naway from our jobs.\n  I see the Senator from New York. I am proud of the kind of campaign \nhe ran. I know it was as hard for him as it was for me to raise the \nkind of money we raised. We are good at it. We know how to do it. It is \nnot necessarily to our benefit to change the system, but we know how \nbad it is.\n  My friend from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone, and I were talking about \ndialing for dollars, when we are up and we are hoping no one is on the \nother end, hoping it is an answering machine so we can leave our \nmessage because it is so demeaning to have to call total strangers we \nhave never heard of --had 100,000 donors to my campaign; I didn't know \nthe majority of those donors--to have to ask them for money. This is \nnot why a Senator is elected.\n\n  The system is broken and needs to be fixed. People are not voting \nbecause they don't believe in the system.\n  What does the majority leader do after a couple of days of debate? He \nwants to take campaign finance reform out of here. He wants to take it \noff the Senate floor. I think I see a pattern emerging in the Senate \nChamber which I don't think is particularly good for the American \npeople.\n  Campaign finance reform, wheel it out the door tomorrow.\n  The test ban treaty, we had a majority vote for that. Wheel it off \nthe floor.\n  Minimum wage, block it from ever coming. Lock the doors. We don't \nwant to hear about minimum wage, even though we are in an economic \nrecovery and the bottom economic class is not benefiting from it. The \nleast we can do is raise the minimum wage a few cents an hour. We can't \neven get that through the door.\n  He doesn't want sensible gun control. We passed it over his \nobjection. The majority party doesn't want it here. It was wheeled out \nthe door, into a conference committee, never to be heard from again. \nHow many more of our children have to die before we bring that back and \nvote in those sensible gun control measures?\n  The majority doesn't want real health reform. We passed a sham bill. \nThe House passed a good one. How about going to conference, \nstrengthening health reform so people can see the doctor they need to \nsee, when they need to, that they can get the tests they need when they \nneed the tests and they can live a good quality of life. No, that is \nshut out, wheeled out of here, never to be heard from again.\n  School construction, nowhere in the majority's bills; 100,000 cops on \nthe beat, nowhere in the majority's bills; school construction to begin \nto fix up the school classrooms, nowhere here, out the door.\n  This is becoming a killer Congress--kill everything the people want, \nincluding campaign finance reform.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have two editorials printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the San Diego Union Tribune, Oct. 19, 1999]\n\n Campaign Finance Reform--Time for a Vote on ending Special Interests' \n                                 Reign\n\n       Unpopular because of his relentless crusade to block \n     campaign finance reform, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is \n     resorting to stoning the messenger.\n       Rising on the Senate floor recently, McConnell indignantly \n     challenged Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., co-sponsor of the \n     campaign finance reform bill, to specify which senators have \n     been corrupted by special-interest contributions. McConnell's \n     theatrics were seconded by Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, \n     objecting to McCain's suggestion that lawmakers could be \n     bought or rented.\n       Coolly refusing to take the bait by naming names, McCain \n     recalled last year when Senate Republicans were assured by \n     their leadership that they needn't fear electoral \n     repercussions from voting against an anti-tobacco bill, \n     because the industry's political action committees would \n     generously support their re-election campaigns.\n       McCain could have recounted many other examples where big \n     contributors have wielded inordinate influence over the \n     Senate. The open secret on Capitol Hill is that, the bigger \n     the contributions, the greater the access.\n       Former Sen. Don Riegle, D-Mich., conceded as much when he \n     was accused, along with four other senators, including \n     McCain, of receiving $1.4 million to run interference for \n     Charles Keating while he ran a California savings-and-loan \n     institution into the ground. Although McCain was a bit player \n     in this sleazy process, he was scarred by it nonetheless. \n     That may help explain why he's so committed to sanitizing the \n     system.\n       The bill that he authored with Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., \n     would ban soft money, which is unlimited contributions that \n     political parties collect and spend to promote their \n     candidates. The reform measure may not completely cleanse the \n     system. But it would put a crimp in the current process, \n     which amounts to little more than legalized bribery.\n       For all his fulminations about protecting the sanctity of \n     free speech, McConnell knows that special-interest money \n     rules. In fact, he's altogether comfortable with a system \n     under which the National Rifle Association shoots down gun-\n     control bills, the oil lobby secures lower royalty payments, \n     and the telecommunications industry benefits from legislation \n     that lawmakers passed largely on faith.\n       These and other well-heeled interests make out very well \n     because they have invested plenty in lawmakers who repay \n     their favors. That is precisely what McCain means when he \n     says Congress has been corrupted by special-interest money. \n     And that's why Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike \n     support his bill to help clean up this mess.\n\n[[Page S12814]]\n\n       The question is whether McConnell and Senate Majority \n     Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., will permit a floor vote on the \n     reform measure. Or will they resort once more to procedural \n     gambits and strangle it?\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Bakersfield Californian, Oct. 19, 1999]\n\n                         Campaign Reform Vital\n\n       Senators should be allowed to vote up or down on a proposal \n     to overhaul a federal campaign finance law. Then, if the bill \n     by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russ Feingold, D-Wis., \n     does pass, the courts can sort out a potential constitutional \n     issue.\n       Instead, opponents of a proposed ban on so-called soft \n     money are vowing a filibuster--a non-stop talk-a-thon that \n     prevents debate on an issue. It is a parliamentary ``don't-\n     let-'em-get-a-word-in-edgewise'' maneuver. The filibuster can \n     be broken only if opponents muster a two-thirds vote in favor \n     of open and free debate--more than the majority vote needed \n     to pass the subject legislation itself. Soft money is a \n     contribution made in federal elections to political parties \n     for activities that are not supposed to support a specific \n     candidate. The idea was to stimulate public awareness of \n     elections and issues with such tasks as voter registration \n     drives and get-out-the-vote efforts.\n       However, critics of the practice wisely note that \n     experience shows a huge influx of money from well-heeled \n     interests--corporations, unions, special interest groups. The \n     effect is to overwhelm potential access to the campaign \n     process by individuals.\n       Worse, with some clever use of the funds, they can be \n     directed to help build awareness among voters of issues being \n     emphasized by specific candidates. The real-world effect of \n     the practice is to void the very theory of soft-money; \n     emphasize issues and process, not specific candidates.\n       In doing so, it creates an end-run around other rules which \n     set dollar limits on contributions that can be made directly \n     to candidates. Those limits are designed specifically to \n     level the access playing field by making all sources of \n     influence roughly equal.\n       It is worth noting that the House of Representatives--which \n     does not allow filibusters and whose members have the grind \n     of seeking election every 2 years--were shamed into passing a \n     version of the bill. But senators, who have the comparative \n     luxury of six-year terms, are balking at even allowing a vote \n     on the issue.\n       Opponents of the McCain-Feingold soft-money limits piously \n     say the law would inhibit the ability to buy advertising, and \n     hence limit politicians' freedom of speech. This from a \n     minority of senators who are muzzling free speech on the \n     bill???\n       The issue of whether campaign finance laws are \n     unconstitutional needs serious consideration. It is getting \n     it where it should: in the Supreme Court.\n       Let the Congress propose, the courts dispose. Vote on and \n     pass McCain-Feingold.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I find these articles interesting because \nthey are editorials from two Republican newspapers in my State, the San \nDiego Union Tribune and the Bakersfield Californian. Normally I would \nnot be reading their editorials into the Record because I usually do \nnot agree with them, but I agree with them on this. Because I do not \nwant to mention the name of any Senator, I will leave it out. The \narticle from the San Diego Union Tribune says:\n\n       For all the fulminations about protecting the sanctity of \n     free speech [this particular Senator] knows that special-\n     interest money rules. In fact, he's altogether comfortable \n     with a system under which the National Rifle Association \n     shoots down gun-control bills, the oil lobby secures lower \n     royalty payments, and the telecommunications industry \n     benefits from legislation that lawmakers passed largely on \n     faith.\n\n  This is pretty extraordinary for the San Diego Union Tribune. Of \ncourse Senator Feingold has been on this floor daily, reading us this \nlist of contributions and showing how it lines up with the legislation \nthat is taken up on this floor. I assure you, the people who need an \nincrease in the minimum wage are not making contributions to any of us, \nOK? I assure you they are not. They cannot. They can barely put food on \nthe table. No wonder they cannot even get their bill heard.\n  Then the Bakersfield Californian says:\n\n       Opponents of the McCain-Feingold soft-money limit piously \n     say the law would limit the ability to buy advertising, and \n     hence limit politicians' freedom of speech.\n\n  And they say:\n\n       This from a minority of senators who are muzzling free \n     speech on the bill?\n\n  That is interesting, by taking off the floor this bill for which a \nmajority voted, they are muzzling us. That is why this vote tomorrow is \nso important.\n  I want to make a couple of points about the bill waiting in the wings \nto come back on this floor for the third time. It is called the \npartial-birth abortion bill. There is no such thing as a partial-birth \nabortion. Ask any doctor. This is a made-up term. It is either a birth \nor it is an abortion. But it is fiery language. It makes people think \nthat a woman is waking up at the end of her pregnancy and saying: I \nhave changed my mind. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  What this bill is about is banning a procedure doctors say they need \nto save the life and health of the mother. The Senators want to come in \nhere and play doctor and say what procedure can and cannot be used on \nmy daughter and on everybody's daughter in the country. They are going \nto do it again, even though they do not have the votes to pass it over \nthe President's veto, and even though across this country that ban has \nbeen ruled unconstitutional in 20 different states.\n  So we are going to throw out campaign finance reform to go to a bill \nthat does not even belong here. This subject belongs at the medical \nschools and in the hospitals and clinics across the country. They are \nthe folks who have to decide how to deal with a medical emergency in \nthe late term of a pregnancy.\n  There is not one Senator in this Senate who favors abortion in the \nlate term--not one. We have all voted for various bills to say no. What \nwe do say is this: If it is an emergency to save the life of the woman, \nto spare her health, to keep her fertility so she can have other \nchildren, then it is up to a physician to decide.\n  We are going back to that bill. I will be debating it along with my \ncolleagues. There will be various alternatives. But let's be clear, \nlet's not pull any punches here; it is all about politics. They think \nit is an issue that gets them some votes out there.\n  I hope people will listen to the debate because I don't think people \nelected us to come here and be doctors. They go to the hospital to see \na doctor, not a Senator, and they come to the Senate to hear Senators, \nnot doctors. It is ridiculous. If 100 physicians walked in with their \ncoats on and tried to evict us from our chairs, they would be arrested. \nBut we come and we pass legislation telling doctors they are going to \ngo to jail if they do something to save a woman's life or her health. \nSomething is wrong. This does not belong here.\n  But we are going to go to this bill for the third time. The President \nwill veto it for the third time. We will uphold his veto for the third \ntime. We will talk about it for the third time, and we will protect the \nlife and the health of the women in this country for the third time.\n  In the meantime, we are throwing off the Senate floor issues that can \nget through this Senate and can get a signature from this President: \nthe minimum wage, 100,000 teachers, school construction, campaign \nfinance reform. We can do it. We have a majority who believe in it. We \ncan clean up the system.\n  I wish to say a special word about the Senator from Michigan. He has \nshown tremendous leadership on this issue over the years. He has seen \nthis as a moment where we can stand our ground and keep this bill on \nthe floor of the Senate. I look forward to his remarks as well as to \nthose of the Senator from New York. I am proud to have voted for every \ncampaign finance reform measure that ever came down when I was in the \nHouse. Even when I was on the board of supervisors in Marin County many \nyears ago this subject came up. So it has been many, many years. Maybe \nnow, with this vote tomorrow, maybe now we can get 51 people to say: \nKeep campaign finance on the floor.\n  My very last point: I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord one more letter.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: Saturday, October 23, will mark the one-\n     year anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Barnett Slepian, \n     who was murdered in his home in Amherst, New York. As you are \n     undoubtedly aware, there have been five sniper attacks on \n     U.S. and Canadian physicians who perform abortions since \n     1994. Each of these attacks has occurred on or close to \n     Canada's Remembrance Day, November 11. All of the victims in \n     these attacks were shot in their homes by a hidden\n\n[[Page S12815]]\n\n     sniper who used a long-range rifle. Dr. Slepian was killed. \n     Three other physicians were seriously wounded in these \n     attacks.\n       Federal law enforcement officials are urging all women's \n     health care providers, regardless of their geographic \n     location, to be on a high state of alert and to take \n     appropriate protective precautions during the next several \n     weeks. Security directives have been issued to all physicians \n     who perform abortions for clinics or in their private \n     practices, and to all individuals who have been prominent on \n     the abortion issue.\n       Senator Lott, on behalf of our physician members, and in \n     the interest of the public safety of the citizens of the US \n     and Canada, we urge you to reconsider the scheduling of a \n     floor debate on S-1692 at this time. As you are aware, each \n     time this legislation has been considered, extremely \n     explicit, emotional, and impassioned debate has been aroused. \n     We have grave fears that the movement of this bill during \n     this particularly dangerous period has the potential to \n     inflame anti-abortion violence that might result in tragic \n     consequences.\n       We sincerely hope that you will take the threats of this \n     October-November period as seriously as we do, and that you \n     will use your considerable influence to ensure that the \n     Senate does not inadvertently play into the hands of \n     extremists who might well be inspired to violence during this \n     time. We urge you to halt the movement of S. 1692. Please \n     work with us to ensure that the senseless acts of violence \n     against US citizens are not repeated in 1999.\n     Vicki Saporta,\n       Executive Director, National Abortion Federation.\n     Eileen McGrath, JD, CAE,\n       Executive Director, American Medical Women's Association.\n     Wayne Shields,\n       President and CEO, Association of Reproductive Health \n     Professionals.\n     Gloria Feldt,\n       President, Planned Parenthood Federation of America.\n     Patricia Anderson,\n       Executive Director, Medical Students for Choice.\n     Jodi Magee,\n       Executive Director, Physicians for Reproductive Choice and \n     Health.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a letter signed by the National \nAbortion Federation, Planned Parenthood Federation, American Medical \nWomen's Association, Medical Students for Choice, and the Executive \nDirector of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Wayne Shields, \nPresident and CEO, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals.\n  This is a serious letter. This letter points out this is the very \nworst time to go to this abortion bill. This letter points out that \n``Saturday * * * will mark the one-year anniversary of the \nassassination of Dr. Barnett Slepian, who was murdered at his home * * \n*'' while he stood in his living room; ``* * * five sniper attacks on \nU.S. and Canadian physicians * * * since 1994.''\n  I have to say this group is very concerned; this is not the time to \nbring up this bill. What is the rush to bring up this bill this week? \nUnfortunately--they sent this letter to Senator Lott--from what I \nunderstand, they did not get an answer. They are saying:\n\n       Senator Lott, on behalf of our physician members, and in \n     the interests of the public safety of the citizens of the \n     U.S. and Canada we urge you to reconsider the scheduling of a \n     floor debate on S. 1692.\n\n  That is the bill we are going to go to.\n\n       As you are aware, each time this legislation has been \n     considered, extremely explicit emotional and impassioned \n     debate has been aroused.\n\n  They write, and I think this is very serious, I say to my friends:\n\n       We have grave fears that the movement of this bill during \n     this particularly dangerous period has the potential to \n     inflame anti-abortion violence that might result in tragic \n     consequences.\n\n  This is a simple request. Wait a week or two before bringing this \nbill to the floor. So I think it would be good if we didn't go to this \nbill right now. I am very willing to debate it any time, any day of the \nyear, for hours. I will stand on my feet. I will talk about the women \nwho had this procedure who might have lost their lives or their health \nhad they not had it. It is not a problem for me. We are going to be \nable to sustain a veto with this President. But at least we should put \nit off for a week if we are being asked to do that.\n  For so many reasons, I hope we will not proceed to this abortion \nbill. If we do, we will be on the floor, we will talk about it, but I \nhope we will not go to it. I hope we will continue our work on campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nher inspiring words, as well as the Senator from Michigan for his \nleadership on this issue. I will not speak for a long time, but I felt \ncompelled to rise because we really are at a crucial time in a debate \non campaign finance reform.\n  We have debated this bill for a few days. Most of it has been on \nFriday and Monday, when most of the Members have not been here. The \ndebate is just beginning to reach its fulsome place. We need to \ncontinue this debate.\n  Campaign finance reform has been an issue that has been debated for \nover a decade. Scant progress was made. We made more progress on the \nfloor today, when 55 Senators voted for the McCain-Feingold bill, than \nwe have made in a long time. And those who wish to nip that progress in \nthe bud are not for campaign finance reform.\n  If anyone ever needed a distinction--there is a lot of rhetoric going \non and a lot of little cloudmaking machines to hide what is going on--\nlook at the vote. If you were for campaign finance reform, you voted \nfor that proposal; and if you were against, you voted against it--even \nmodest campaign finance reform.\n  Many of us bit our tongue when we voted for it because it is a small \nstep, a very small step--the simple abolition of soft money. It is not \neven what the House did. I would expect, on a lofty issue such as this, \nthe Senate to lead but instead the Senate trails far behind even the \nHouse of Representatives and certainly the American people.\n  And now, when we want to continue the debate, there is a move to shut \noff that debate. I would certainly ask my 10 colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who voted for this modest proposal not to shut off \ndebate, if you are serious about campaign finance reform. We have not \neven begun the amendatory process.\n  I have an amendment, along with the Senator from Illinois, that is \nvery simple: When issue committees put ads on television, they should \nhave to disclose where the money comes from--no prohibition, no \nlimitation, simply disclosure. Isn't it unbelievable we would support a \ncampaign finance bill and not have disclosure of where people are \nspending that money? The public certainly has a right to know about \nthat.\n\n  My good friend from Kentucky has been arguing the first amendment for \na very long time. I don't know why we don't see the same passion on \nother first amendment issues as we see on this one, but so be it.\n  But the amendment the Senator from Illinois and I will be proposing \nis a first amendment type of amendment: disclosure, sunlight, sunshine. \nIf a big corporation, any other big interest--it could be an \nenvironmental group or a labor group or some group that I generally \nsupport--puts money out there, large amounts of money, to make their \nviewpoint known, the public ought to know, particularly in these days \nwhen advertising can be so deceptive. We have groups called citizens \nfor fair this and fair that, when they are really interest group \nshields. Come clean.\n  Allow that amendment to be debated. I think if the amendment were \ndebated, it would pass. It has had some bipartisan support. Even the \nSenator from Nebraska has indicated a likelihood of support. But if we \ncut off debate, simply after the two cloture motions, we will have no \nchance to debate that amendment and other amendments. I think this \namendment would strike a balance that would satisfy most people.\n  So we sit in this Chamber. Today we began at 1:15. It is not that we \nare out of time; it is simply that those on the other side of the aisle \ndo not want to debate this issue. They want to put a dagger in the \nheart of campaign finance reform and by not debating don't even want to \nleave fingerprints. With the cloture votes today, I say to my \ncolleagues on that side of the aisle, your fingerprints are all over \nthat dagger that killed campaign finance reform.\n  There is not even a pretense, so at the very least let us debate it. \nLet us\n\n[[Page S12816]]\n\nspend some hours reminiscent of the great days of the Republic and the \nSenate debating this issue, which is a very serious issue about how we \ngovern our country. Let the debate be full. Let there be dialog. Let \nthere be amendments.\n  I worry about the future of this Republic. We have a great structure. \nThe Founding Fathers were truly geniuses. The more I am around, the \nmore I respect their genius. We have a great economic system, which the \nworld emulates, that promotes entrepreneurialism, that allows anybody, \nno matter how poor they start out, to rise to the top. But we have a \npoison eating at us, and that is the mistrust that the public has of \nthe Government. That mistrust is more caused by the way we finance \ncampaigns than any other single issue. It creates the partisanship \npeople decry.\n  When I went home to New York, I got lots of that this weekend because \nof the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. It promotes the feeling that an \nindividual citizen cannot have any influence on the Government. It \npromotes a view that it is not one-person/one-vote, but one-dollar/one-\nvote. Those views we do not even have to comment on their veracity. I \nthink there is a lot of truth to them. But it certainly creates a \nmistrust, a distance between Government and the people.\n  In an era where things move quickly, in an era of global competition, \nin an era where we all have to work together as one, this is poison. We \nhave a chance to take a modest step. It is not everything I would \nwant--not even close--but it is a modest step. We made real progress \ntoday. We got more votes than we thought we would. Two Senators on the \nother side of the aisle who had not voted for campaign finance reform \nbefore have voted for it now. Maybe if we debate this for another few \ndays, we will not win any more votes, but maybe we will. Maybe someone \nwill offer an amendment that strikes some kind of unity, some kind of \nfeeling of bringing us together.\n\n  The issue is too important to brush aside. The issue cries out for \nfull debate. To move off now, just as things begin to get going, is \nwrong and tragic, if that does not overstate it, because I think the \nissue is so important for the Republic.\n  So I make a plea to the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from \nMississippi: Don't cut off debate. Don't use your legislative \nprerogative and might to shut this debate down. Let it continue. Let \nthe debate continue. Let amendments, such as mine, be offered. Let \namendments, such as others have proposed, be offered. Let the chips \nfall where they may. But to shut off debate in this untimely manner is \na travesty of this body and for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what I would like to do now--not to bring \nany final disposition to this matter--there have been people coming on \nand off the floor. The Senator from Washington is here. If he would be \nrecognized next, then Senator Levin after that, and then Senator Reed \nafter that.\n  Mr. REED. Could I----\n  Mr. REID. Senator Reed before Senator Levin.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Senator Wellstone before everyone.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Levin, and then Senator Wellstone. And then \nfollowing Senator Wellstone, on our side, Senator Bob Graham from \nFlorida. If any Republicans come in the interim who want to speak, we \nwill stick them in so there is a balance.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will object to the request at least in \nthe form in which it was presented. It seems to me there ought to be a \nright for anyone on this side of the aisle to speak first, after the \nconclusion of any speech on that side of the aisle. If the request is \nonly for the order of speaking of Members of that side of the aisle, \nwith the clear understanding that if a Member on this side of the aisle \nwishes to succeed one of them, that he or she may do so, then I will \nnot object.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Washington, that was part of the \nconsent. I already said that. If somebody wants to come in from the \nRepublican side, they would step right in following the Democrat.\n  Mr. GORTON. With that understanding, I will not object.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Chair, the reason for this is we have people \nwho have been waiting for hours, not knowing when they are supposed to \ncome. I appreciate the consent of the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for all of the hours that have been spent \non the debate on the particular bill that has been before the Senate, \nthis year's form of McCain-Feingold, I believe it was summarized best, \nwith the most striking degree of contrast to the paradox imaginable, \nlast Friday by the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold. \nHe came to the floor of the Senate and specifically singled out the \nMicrosoft Corporation, based, of course, in the State I represent, in \nan attempt to make a direct link between campaign contributions and/or \ncontributions to political parties and the appearance of political \ncorruption. In order not to misstate in any respect, I will quote \nbriefly from the remarks of the Senator from Wisconsin:\n\n       Apparently Microsoft and their allies are not seeking to \n     directly affect the litigation that is being conducted with \n     regard to Microsoft by the Justice Department at this time; \n     what they are trying to do, according to this article [an \n     article in the newspapers on that day] is cut the overall \n     funding for the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. In \n     this context, if somehow things don't look right, there is \n     the ever present possibility that there would be an \n     appearance of corruption.\n\n  The Senator from Wisconsin then went on to relate how he recently \nread that Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is the world's wealthiest \nindividual. This led the Senator from Wisconsin to say:\n\n       I have no idea what Microsoft's or Bill Gates' actual \n     contributions are, and I am not suggesting that they are \n     making those contributions to influence funding of the \n     Justice Department. But for us to create a scenario where Mr. \n     Gates could give unlimited amounts of money rather than the \n     old $2,000 of hard money, or a Microsoft PAC could give more \n     than $10,000, to just have it be unlimited I believe \n     almost inherently . . . creates an appearance of \n     corruption that is bad for Microsoft, bad for the Justice \n     Department, and bad for the country.\n\n  It is 2 weeks ago that the General Accounting Office issued a report \nindicating the Department of Justice had spent, so far, $13 million in \na lawsuit that it has brought against the Microsoft Corporation. \nIncluded in that $13 million is a considerable amount of money for \npublic relations efforts on behalf of that lawsuit.\n  I think much of the speculation fueled by those public relations \nexperts is that the Department of Justice, if it has the opportunity, \nmay well ask the court literally to break up what has been the most \nsuccessful single corporation, the single corporation most responsible \nfor the dramatic change in the way our economy is run of any \ncorporation in the United States. So we have an administration and a \nGovernment spending $13 million to prosecute a case against this \ncorporation, speculating that it may ask for the breakup of the \ncorporation. But for the CEO of that corporation to spend more than \n$2,000 in political contributions or for its political action committee \nto spend more than $10,000, that is an appearance of corruption which \nmust be controlled by the Federal Government.\n  The bill the Senator from Wisconsin was promoting at the time he made \nthis speech would say that corporation and that individual could not \ngive $1, either to the Republican or the Democratic Party or to any of \ntheir subsidiary organizations, designed to be used for the education \nof voters or indirectly for the election of an administration more \nfavorable to entrepreneurship in the United States. And this is \ndenominated campaign election reform designed to deal with an \nappearance of corruption. Absolutely amazing--the Microsoft \nCorporation, not accused of doing anything wrong at all but simply \nbecause a Member of this body or the Department of Justice itself says \nthere might be an appearance of corruption, should be deprived of any \neffective means of defending\n\n[[Page S12817]]\n\nitself in a political court of public opinion. The Government can spend \n$13 million or twice or three times $13 million engaged in the \nprosecution; the company cannot attempt to influence either the amount \nof money the taxpayers give to that Department of Justice or, more \nprofoundly, the nature of the next administration that may or may not \nfollow the same antitrust philosophy itself.\n  Now, I guess I can lay it out. I am the Senator from the State in \nwhich Microsoft is located. Close to 15,000 of my constituents are \nemployed by that company. They have transformed not only my State and \nmy constituency in a magnificently positive fashion but the entire \nUnited States of America and have had a tremendously positive impact \nnot only on America's image in the world but on its economic success in \nthe world.\n  You bet I defend them. You bet I hope in my next political campaign I \nwill have its support. I already do, to a certain extent. That is \ntotally public and above board. I would be totally remiss in my duties \nif I didn't do so. But to say, in a world with a Government that may be \ntrying to destroy the company, that it is appropriate for this body to \ntell it that it effectively cannot participate in the political system \nor, for that matter, its employees can't effectively participate in \npreventing the Government from destroying their livelihoods in the \ncorporation that they bring up is bizarre. Apparently, those who want \nto change the laws and ban political parties from raising so-called \nsoft money say they do it to remove the appearance of corruption. But \nthey will define what the appearance of corruption consists of so once \nanything that they dislike is described by them as an appearance of \npolitical corruption, all limitations are off. They can do whatever \nthey want. They can restrict first amendment rights guaranteed by the \nConstitution of the United States in whatever way they would like to \nrestrict them. The first amendment may permit, to an almost unlimited \nextent, pornography, but it doesn't guarantee the right of an \nindividual or a group of individuals operating through a corporation to \ndefend their livelihoods and their existence.\n\n  At the outset of this debate, the proponents were asked to come up \nwith any incidents of actual corruption. In fact, they go out of their \nway to say there aren't any, or there aren't any that they know of, or \nthere aren't any that they are willing to report. But they say: In our \nmind's eye, the present system creates an appearance of corruption; \ntherefore, we can say to Microsoft, we can say to General Motors, we \ncan say, for that matter--in theory, as they work through political \nparties--to liberal individuals or interest groups that you cannot \ncontribute one dollar to the political party of your choice, to the \npolitical party you deem is most likely to allow you to conduct your \nbusiness and your affairs in a profitable and constructive manner.\n  No attack on the first amendment rights of free speech could be more \nopen or blatant than that. It says, simply, once we use those magic \nwords ``appearance of corruption''--and we will define that phrase and \nwe will define every activity that can be described by that phrase in \nour minds--we can then tell you that you are out of business; you can \nno longer participate, except with very modest contributions directly \nto candidates of hard money. And this philosophy isn't limited to the \nrather bizarre nature of the bill before us, which says that of the \n5,000 to 7,000 registered organizations that say they want to \nparticipate in the political system through the use of soft money and \nso-called issue advertising, it prevents only six of them from doing \nso--three Republican formal organizations and three Democratic formal \norganizations.\n  This bizarre bill says it is perfectly all right to contribute this \nmoney to any of the other several thousand such organizations, but it \nis only the historic political parties in the United States, around \nwhich we have organized for almost our entire history, the activities \nand support of which somehow or another create an appearance of \ncorruption.\n  Now, of course, the original McCain-Feingold bill did go beyond that \nand did say that no matter how seriously your most passionate interests \nas an individual or a group are attacked by the Government, or by a \nrival political organization during the last 60 days before an \nelection, you could never mention the name of the candidate for office. \nWell, I think, for all practical purposes, we all know that proposition \nis simply blatantly unconstitutional. It flies in the face of the first \namendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  But, this afternoon, at least for the more than 1 hour that I \nlistened to speeches on this subject, the actual bill that is before us \nwas almost not mentioned at all. All of the criticisms were aimed at \nthe money chase through which candidates go, the demeaning nature of \nhaving to ask people directly for money to fund candidates' activities. \nBut neither in McCain-Feingold 1 nor McCain-Feingold 2 is that subject \ndealt with at all. Not a word, not a line has anything to do with \ncontributions to individual candidates.\n  ``McCain-Feingold lite'' has to do only with contributions to \npolitical parties for purposes other than the direct \nadvocacy, election, or defeat of a particular candidate. How that is \nsupposed to corrupt the process is, for all practical purposes, \nunstated. There is not the slightest allegation that Members somehow do \nthings that they would not otherwise do because someone has given their \npolitical party an amount of money that can't be used directly for \ntheir own election.\n\n  ``McCain-Feingold heavy'' is hardly a selfless effort on the part of \nany Member of this body because what ``McCain-Feingold heavy'' says is \nthat your name, Mr. President, my name, and the names of all other \nMembers can't even be mentioned in one of these ads for 60 days before \nan election. Boy, that is certainly comfort for the political class--\ntake everyone out of the business for the last 2 months before an \nelection of communicating their own ideas about candidates \nindependently of a candidate himself or herself.\n  Now, we are also told that we didn't get enough time to debate this \nmatter and that the debate wasn't broad enough. I was here when we came \nvery close to a unanimous consent agreement for a week's worth of \ndebate on this issue. The whole thrust of that set of negotiations was \nthat we could start with whatever the Senators from Wisconsin and \nArizona wished, but there would be lots of amendments--amendments from \nthe Democratic side of the aisle, amendments from the Republican side \nof the aisle, and several votes on a wide range of ideas.\n  But what actually happened was, on the second day--I must say, over \nthe objections of the Senator from Arizona, who sits right in front of \nme--the minority leader and the minority whip set up a situation under \nwhich nobody else's amendments except theirs could be brought up, until \ntheirs were completely dealt with.\n  My friend and colleague, the junior Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, \ncame down here with a proposal in which I joined that said, OK, let's \nhave a little bit more balance; let's increase the amounts of hard \nmoney contributions that we like--almost, though not quite, back to the \nlevel they were in 1974, in real dollars. And then at the same time, we \nwill impose soft money limitations of the same amounts in which we have \nhard money limitations. There are even a few Members on the other side \nof the aisle who thought that was an idea worthy of discussion. But we \nweren't allowed to discuss it. We weren't allowed to put that one up. \nThey used their perfect parliamentary right to squeeze it down to their \nown proposals. And now they complain because their own proposals could \nnot get a sufficient number of votes to bring them to any kind of final \ndecision.\n  Now, in an ideal world, I don't think we should limit either of these \nkinds of contributions. I think we should make them all public and make \nthem public promptly. But if we are going to do so, I can't see the \nslightest rationale in the world for saying that the limitation in \ncertain forms of speech to six organizations across the United States \nof America is zero, while limitations on everyone else with that kind \nof money do not exist at all, and limitations on direct contributions \nof candidates are so low as a result of 25 years of inflation that \nanyone who truly wants to participate has to do it in a different \ndivision.\n  One of the primary reasons more money goes every year into so-called \nsoft money contributions is the fact\n\n[[Page S12818]]\n\nthat hard money contributions directed to candidates are increasingly \nlimited simply by the passage of time and by inflation. But then, of \ncourse, there would be other forms of soft money that aren't even \nremotely covered by even the broad version of McCain-Feingold. That is \nthe political advocacy of every major media in the United States--of \nnewspaper, radio station, and television station. What is the value of \nthose contributions on editorial pages across the country? Does the \naverage citizen who is brought up having an interest in government have \nthe same influence over the political process as the editorial director \nof the New York Times? Of course not. Does that individual have the \nsame influence as the head of Common Cause or the National Rifle \nAssociation or the AFL-CIO? Of course not. Both latter organizations \nare at least membership organizations which sometimes to a certain \nextent reflect the views of their members.\n  The newspaper editorial writer reflects only the views of the \nnewspaper owner or the newspaper publisher or the decisionmaker within \nthat newspaper. Of course, those newspapers want to limit other \npeople's voices. From their perspective, the first amendment is the \ntotal protection, from their view, and it is. But to exactly the extent \nthey can limit the voices of others, their voices will be heard more \nloudly. And little is heard about the fact their voice is louder than \nthat of the average citizen. But the first amendment does not say \neveryone has an equal voice in the public marketplace. It does say \neveryone has an equal vote in an election. But with respect to the \nmarketplace and political ideas, it simply says Congress shall pass no \nlaw abridging the freedom of speech. And every member of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States of America in 1974, when the last case came \nbefore it, said that freedom of speech to be effective does allow and \nrequire the use of money to make it carry further than any of our \nindividual voices do on a windy day out of doors--every single one of \nthem.\n  So the idea that somehow or other all voices have to be heard equally \nis not only not found in the Constitution, it is not found in any free \nsociety. To allow the Government to try to determine what voice each \nperson sends is exactly a power James Madison and the draftsmen of the \nfirst amendment said they would not allow the Government to do.\n  Let me return to the point at which I started, which does at least \nhave a virtue of dealing with the bill that is before us and not the \nlamentations of many of the Members on this floor that have nothing to \ndo with the bill that is before us.\n  They are saying, in effect, in one instance named by the Senator from \nWisconsin, that a company now being prosecuted by the Federal \nGovernment may not participate effectively in the political world out \nof which that prosecution grew, may not participate effectively in \nsupporting candidates or a political party that will have a profoundly \ndifferent view on antitrust laws. The Government can spend an unlimited \namount of money. Editorials writers can write an unlimited number of \neditorials. But the very subject of that prosecution, the very subject \nof those editorials, cannot participate effectively in the political \nprocess that brought about the prosecution in the first place.\n  The very statement of that kind of limitation is an argument--in my \nview an overwhelming argument--against this proposal at the present \ntime. The marketplace of ideas is disorderly. The marketplace of ideas \nis open. The marketplace of ideas is often dominated by those who have \nthe most ideas, the greatest stake in whether or not they carry. No \ncitizen is limited in his or her participation. But each citizen can \nspend as much of his or her time and effort and money as he or she \ndeems necessary at least to see to it those ideas are heard effectively \nby the people of the United States in a free country.\n\n  I deeply hope Microsoft and the employees who work for it in my State \nand elsewhere will have decided by this time next year that they need a \nnew administration with a very different direction of the United States \nin order to keep providing for this country the kind of leadership they \nhave provided. I am not sure I have persuaded them of that yet, but if \nI do, and if others do, they should not be artificially limited with \nthe statement that freedom of speech is for someone else but, for all \npractical purposes, not for you when your very existence is threatened.\n  That is what this is all about. And I don't think views on the floor \nof the Senate--or at least the votes--are going to be changed by \nanother week's worth of debate.\n  I am unhappy only with an alternative idea, somewhat more reasonable \nand somewhat more balanced, that the very tactics of the people who are \nnow protesting the end of this debate prevent this presentation.\n  We will try at least to put it in play for the next time around. But \nfor now, it seems to me appropriate to move on to another subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold for a second?\n  Mr. REED. I withhold.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nevada yield to me \nfor a procedural request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n\n\n                           Order Of Procedure\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur \non adoption of the pending motion to proceed at 9:50 a.m. on Wednesday, \nOctober 20, with the 20 minutes prior to vote equally divided between \nthe majority leader and the minority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, under those circumstances, for the \nmajority leader, I can now say that in light of this agreement, there \nwill be no further votes today. The next vote will occur at 9:50 a.m. \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, thank you.\n  First, let me thank the Senator from Michigan for graciously allowing \nme to precede him. I also understand he may have a parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my good friend from Rhode Island. I wonder if I \ncould propound a parliamentary inquiry without the Senator from Rhode \nIsland losing his right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There has been a lot of confusion about whether or not the \nbill was amendable prior to the cloture vote, and whether it would have \nbeen amendable after the cloture vote had cloture been invoked.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: I ask whether the tree was filled basically \nprior to the first cloture vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Prior to the cloture vote, an amendment to the \nWellstone amendment was in order. If cloture had been invoked, the \nWellstone amendment would fall, and an amendment to the bill then would \nhave been in order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If cloture had been invoked after the disposition of all \npending germane amendments, would the bill have been open to amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Once an amendment had been agreed to upon \nwhich cloture had been invoked, then further amendments would have been \nappropriate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the amendment had not been agreed to but had been \ndefeated, would the bill have been open to amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would still be in order.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise with regret. Again, we are on the \nverge of abandoning substantive votes on campaign finance reform. This \nis an issue of vital importance to the American people. It is of vital \nimportance to the majority of Members of this body.\n  We are here today because of the efforts of many, but particularly \nthe efforts of Senator McCain and Senator Feingold, who have advanced \nthis issue relentlessly over the course of the last several years. I \nregretfully and unfortunately fear we will step away once again from \nthis debate, step away once again from consideration of this important \ntopic. This is detrimental not only to this body, but also to the \nAmerican people, who desperately want to see changes to our campaign \nfinance system. I am disappointed because we have come very close \ncollectively in this Congress to a principled reform of our campaign \nfinance system.\n\n[[Page S12819]]\n\n  The other body has passed legislation which is comprehensive. They \nhave passed legislation which is now embodied in an amendment filed by \nSenator Daschle and Senator Torricelli. I believe this legislation goes \na long way towards addressing many of the problems that confront our \ncampaign finance system. It is not perfect. It is not absolutely \ncomplete. But it is a powerful corrective to the current problems we \nfind in our campaign finance system.\n  The amendment which Senator Daschle and Senator Torricelli have \nadvanced, known popularly as the Shays-Meehan amendment for the \nsponsors in the other body, does several important things. First and \nforemost, it bans soft money. Unlike the McCain-Feingold legislation, \nit bans all soft money--not just soft money directed at political \nparties.\n  Although we speak in these terms constantly, soft money, hard money, \net cetera, I want to point out that soft money is unregulated \ncontributions from corporations and individuals, typically very wealthy \nindividuals, that are increasingly commonplace in elections throughout \nthis country.\n  The Daschle legislation bans all such soft money contributions with \nrespect to Federal elections. I believe that is the best way to \nproceed. Even though the McCain-Feingold bill is noteworthy and \nimportant, I fear simply banning money from political parties will \ndrive these contributions to other formats, other forms, other forums.\n  Campaign dollars, like water, find their own level. When one channel \nis blocked, another channel will be pursued. Unless we have a \ncomprehensive approach, unless we ban all soft money, rather than \neliminating this problem we will merely redirect and reposition these \nsoft dollars into other forms.\n  The second important point with respect to the Torricelli and Daschle \nlegislation, is that it recognizes a relatively new phenomena in \ncampaigns, sham issue ads, which are really campaign ads which are \nunregulated. They are dressed up to talk about an issue, but they are \nreally about attacking candidates. Unless we have some disclosure, some \nregulation, these ads will become more prevalent and more pernicious in \nour campaign system.\n  The third point that the Daschle-Torricelli bill addresses is \nimproving disclosure by the Federal Elections Commission and \nenforcement by the Federal Election Commission. It is not sufficient to \nhave laws and rules on the books; they must be enforced. We all \nunderstand and believe that the more knowledge the American public has \nabout campaign contributions and their sources and uses, the more \ncomfortable they will feel with the political system.\n  Finally, this legislation which Senator Daschle and Senator \nTorricelli introduced establishes a commission to study further reform. \nAll of these points are necessary. They don't completely solve all the \nissues that confront our campaign finance system, but they go a long \nway towards advancing the cause of fundamental campaign finance reform.\n\n  Personally, I believe one of the problems we face is the escalation \nof spending on elections throughout this country and that we should \naddress this issue of unlimited spending. None of the legislation \ncurrently before the Senate goes that far, but I believe we have to \nreview and visit that issue when we again commence our debate on \ncampaign finance reform.\n  This issue of campaign finance reform is not an academic, \nhypothetical, theoretical concern. It comes directly from the concerns \nof the American people. It is manifested by their increasing cynicism \nabout the political system. It is manifested by their increasing \nindifference to the forms of government, to elections, to voting. This \ncynicism and indifference weakens our civic connections, weakens the \nfoundation of our government--which is at heart the belief by our \npeople in its fairness, efficiency and its service to them. All of this \ncan be traced in part to the growing cynicism towards the campaign \nfinance system.\n  These public phenomena have been measured by various surveys. In \nAugust, the Counsel for Excellence in Government released a survey \nconducted by Peter Hart and Robert Teeter, a Democratic pollster and a \nRepublican pollster. They found less than 40 percent of the American \npeople believe in the immortal words of President Abraham Lincoln: Our \ngovernment is by and for the people.\n  Rather, they believe it is a captive of special interests, and the \nlure the special interests use are campaign finance dollars.\n  In the past, people have been disillusioned with big government and \nunaccountable bureaucrats. Today, they are cynical and disillusioned \nabout the flood of cash flowing through the campaign finance system.\n  Another survey in January of this year, the Center on Policy \nAttitudes, found continuing record high public dissatisfaction with \ngovernment. This finding supports the notion that people believe that \ngovernment, and particularly elections, are not about ideas and \npolicies, but about money. Money is talking and the American public's \nvoice is being drowned out.\n  We must counter this--but we don't counter this type of public \nperception by walking away and abandoning campaign finance reform; \nrather, we counter it properly, correctly, and appropriately by \ndebating and voting on substantive campaign finance reform.\n  I have made it clear my preference is for legislation along the lines \nof Senator Daschle's and Senator Torricelli's amendment, essentially \naccepting the work of the other body in the Shays-Meehan legislation, \nmoving it forward, letting the President sign it, and letting the \nAmerican people know that we are listening to them; we hear them, and \nwe want to respond positively to their concerns and their growing \nuneasiness with our campaign finance system.\n  We are all trapped in a system that no one seems to like. The public \ndoes not like it and candidates are increasingly uneasy and concerned \nabout the need to raise huge amounts of money, the constant effort \nneeded to do that, and the perception of their efforts with respect to \ntheir obligations as public servants. Donors are increasingly troubled \nby the system. Indeed, many prominent business men and women throughout \nthe country have banded together to support comprehensive campaign \nfinance reform. It seems we are engaged in a race to the bottom--a race \nto see not what idea will prevail but how much money one can raise; to \nnot just express a message but to drown out all other messages.\n  Another disturbing aspect of this process, campaigns now are being \nwrenched away from the candidate. One of the more disconcerting aspects \nof recent campaigns, a candidate can be out there making his or her \ncase and suddenly be informed there is a TV ad from some unknown group \nfrom someplace in America arguing against them, advocating their \ndefeat. All of this suggests we have to do something about our campaign \nsystem.\n  As I mentioned, the other body has stepped forward. They have given \nus legislation. We are very close, if we embrace this legislation, to \npassage of fundamental campaign finance reform. I hope we will take \nthis step, but it appears increasingly clear we are abandoning our \nobligation to the American people. We are stepping away from votes on \nthe substance of campaign finance reform, be it the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation or the Daschle-Torricelli legislation. I believe that is a \nmistake. I believe the American people want us to act responsibly; they \nwant us to act promptly; they want us to do what they sent us here to \ndo, which is their business. And their business in the campaign finance \narea is putting in place reasonable restraints on spending.\n  A lot has been said about the marketplace of ideas, and that any \nfetters on campaign contributions would somehow affect the marketplace \nof ideas. There very well might be a marketplace for ideas in today's \ncampaigns, but it is a market with very high barriers to entry, \nbarriers that require extensive fundraising to overcome. It certainly \nis not perfect competition because the American people believe their \nvoices cannot compete with the voices of large corporations or wealthy \nindividuals who can, through direct contributions to candidates and \nindirect contributions of soft money, get their messages across on \ntelevision or in the advertising media. What many people fear is that \nelections have become less about candidates and ideas and more about \nauctions. They find that instinctively repelling.\n\n[[Page S12820]]\n\n  We have a chance to act. We should act. Regretfully, today we are \nforsaking that obligation. We are turning away from campaign finance \nreform. We are abandoning an obligation we should meet. I regret that. \nI hope we can proceed with this debate and move to votes on these \nmeasures, but I fear that will not be the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, tomorrow we will be casting the critical \nvote which will decide whether or not those of us who are in the \nmajority will insist that this body continue on the debate on campaign \nfinance reform. This will be the vote that counts. This will determine \nwhether the majority will back off because our bill is being \nfilibustered. This is a real test vote tomorrow in the battle to close \nthe soft money loophole.\n  We knew it was not going to be easy. We knew this was going to be \nfilibustered. But it is not the first time that major legislation \ninvolving key democratic principles has been filibustered on the floor \nof this Senate. Those of us who favor closing the soft money loophole, \nreducing the influence of huge contributions in political campaigns, it \nseems to me, now have to be just as committed, just as determined, just \nas passionate in our beliefs as the opponents are in their beliefs.\n  The opponents have every right to filibuster our bill. The rules \nallow filibusters. We ought to change those rules, but until we do, \nmost, if not all, of us participate, from time to time, in cloture \nvotes, making the other side get to 60 before we proceed. But just as \nthe minority has a right to filibuster a bill, those of us who are in \nthe majority have the right to say we are not going to back off just \nbecause a bill is being filibustered. We are not going to give up our \neffort. Rather, we are going to say to the opponents of this bill who \nare in the minority and who are filibustering our bill: That is your \nright and you have a right to exercise it. Proceed with the filibuster. \nWe are not going to withdraw our legislation.\n  During the civil rights days there were instances where there had to \nbe multiple cloture votes. There was a bill relative to fair housing in \n1968 which had four cloture votes over a period of 7 or 8 weeks before \nthere were enough votes to end the debate. The people who passionately \nbelieved in civil rights proceeded with their cause. They did not give \nup because they did not get enough votes to close off debate and to end \nthe filibuster the first time. They did not give up the second time. \nThey did not give up the third time; 7 or 8 weeks later, on their \nfourth cloture vote, finally they were able to achieve success.\n\n  I was reading these debates from the civil rights days, 1968, last \nnight. I read some of the speeches of a whole bunch of great Senators \non both sides of the issue: Senators Mansfield, Hart, Ervin, and other \nSenators, Javits. They were debating civil rights. It was a \ncontroversial bill. It involved whether or not citizens would have a \nright to housing free from discrimination based on race.\n  What struck me was the determination of the supporters of civil \nrights, the unwillingness to give in, give up, because they could not \nget enough votes the first time around to stop the filibuster. Senator \nHart, after they lost the first cloture vote said:\n\n       Those of us who support the bill that has been pending now \n     for, I think, 6 weeks, on the occasion of the vote last week \n     . . . indicated our intention to submit a modification today \n     or prior to the vote today. The modification would lessen \n     somewhat the reach of the coverage and make some procedural \n     changes.\n       I want to report that over the weekend a new and most \n     encouraging factor has developed. It is a new force and gives \n     a new dimension and promise for those of us who believe with \n     a very deep conviction that this country needs to be assured \n     that what a majority of the Senate has plainly indicated it \n     desires to achieve can be achieved, an effective . . . open \n     housing order.\n\n  Today, a majority of the Senate, in the words of Senator Hart, \n``plainly indicated'' that it desires to achieve campaign finance \nreform. On one vote, there were 52 Senators; on another vote, there \nwere 53 Senators. Today a clear majority of this Senate plainly \nindicated that it wants to achieve campaign finance reform.\n  Then it occurred, the third time they tried to attain an end to the \nfilibuster. By this time, Senator Dirksen, who was the Republican \nleader, who had been a supporter of civil rights prior to this bill in \nthe earlier days of the 1960s--Senator Dirksen, in 1968, after voting \nagainst ending debate the first and second time, decided that, with \ncertain changes in the legislation, he was going to vote to terminate a \nfilibuster in which he had participated. He said:\n\n       The matter of equality of opportunity in civil rights is an \n     idea whose time has come. And all the fulminations, whether \n     substantial or superficial, will not stay the march of that \n     idea.\n\n  The time has come for us to end the unlimited amount of money which \nflows into campaigns. This is an idea whose time has come. A majority \nof us have so voted. A majority of us feel strongly about it, and the \npublic, much more important than either of those comments, feels very \nstrongly about it. They are sickened by the amount of negative \nadvertising they are bombarded with. They are sickened when they read \nabout $50,000 and $100,000 and $1 million going into political parties \nin order, mainly, to fund these negative TV ads.\n  They are sickened when they read about a Democratic Party invitation \nor a Republican Party invitation that sells access to our key leaders \nfor big contributions. They are disgusted when they see an invitation \nthat reads: For $50,000 a year, you get two annual events with the \nPresident, two annual events with the Vice President, and you get to \njoin party leadership as they travel abroad to examine current \ndeveloping political and economic issues in other countries. They are \ndisgusted when they see for $250,000 you get breakfast with the \nmajority leader and the Speaker and you get a luncheon with the Senate \nRepublican committee chairman of your choice. So for $250,000 you get a \nluncheon with the committee chairman of your choice. What do we expect \nthe American public to think when they hear and read about that? And \nthat is directly connected to the soft money loophole.\n\n  The scourge of soft money, of unlimited contributions, inherently \nbreeds distrust for our democratic institutions. It is something that \nis inherent in the unlimited amount of the contribution.\n  Now, many of us believe very strongly that is true. But far more \nimportant than that is what the Supreme Court has said about this \nissue. In the Buckley case itself, a case which we all look to, and I \nwill quote from, the Supreme Court said the following about the \n``appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting unlimited \nfinancial contributions. . . .'' Those are the words of the Court, and \nnow I am going to read the entire quote:\n\n       And while disclosure requirements serve the many salutary \n     purposes discussed elsewhere in this opinion, Congress was \n     surely entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a \n     partial measure and that contribution ceilings were a \n     necessary legislative concomitant to deal with the reality or \n     appearance of corruption inherent in a system permitting \n     unlimited financial contributions, even when the identities \n     of the contributors and the amounts of their contributions \n     are fully disclosed.\n\n  The Buckley Court went on to say the following:\n\n       Not only is it difficult to isolate suspect contributions \n     but, more importantly, Congress was justified in concluding \n     that the interest in safeguarding against the appearance of \n     impropriety requires that the opportunity for abuse inherent \n     in the process of raising large monetary contributions be \n     eliminated.\n\n  Then the Court wrote about the contributions which are given either \nfor a quid pro quo or for the appearance of a quid pro quo. This is \nwhat they wrote:\n\n       To the extent that large contributions are given to secure \n     political quid pro quos from current and potential office \n     holders, the integrity of our system of representative \n     democracy is undermined. . . . Of almost equal concern is . . \n     .\n\n  That is, equal now to the quid pro quo--\n\n     the impact of the appearance of corruption stemming from \n     public awareness of the opportunities for abuse inherent in a \n     regime of large individual financial contributions. . . . \n     Congress could legitimately conclude that the avoidance of \n     the appearance of improper influence ``is also critical . . . \n     if confidence in the system of representative government is \n     not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.''\n\n  The Supreme Court wrote that before the soft money loophole became \nfully\n\n[[Page S12821]]\n\nexploited, before invitations, such as the kind I read from, went out \ntelling people if they contribute $250,000 or $100,000, they will get \nmeetings with the majority leader or they will get meetings with the \nPresident or they will get meetings with the committee chairman of \ntheir choice. This kind of sale of access, which we see in such a \ndisgraceful display, I believe, on the part of both parties, was not \neven in existence at the time the Buckley Court wrote that opinion.\n\n  Both parties are engaged in this. This is not pointing the finger at \neither party. Both parties engaged in soliciting these huge--unlimited \njust about--amounts of money in exchange for access. And that is soft \nmoney. That is unregulated money. That is money above and beyond what \nis permitted to be directly contributed to a candidate.\n  In fact, the Supreme Court was very explicit about another provision \nof the law which provides that $25,000 is the limit which can be given \nin all contributions during a year. The Supreme Court said this about \nthe $25,000. They describe the $25,000 limit as a modest restraint \nwhich serves, in the words of the Court, ``to prevent evasion of the \n$1,000 contribution limitation by a person who might otherwise \ncontribute massive amounts of money to a particular candidate through \nthe use of unearmarked contributions to political committees likely to \ncontribute to that candidate or huge contributions to a candidate's \npolitical party.''\n  So we have a $25,000 per year limit in the law. That is the most you \ncan give to a candidate or to a party, and the purpose, the Court said, \nwas legitimate to prevent evasion of the $1,000 contribution limit to \nany particular candidate. And yet we have parties soliciting $250,000 \nand $50,000 and $100,000. That is the state of decay of our campaign \nfinancing.\n  So what we will decide in our vote tomorrow morning is whether or not \nthe majority of this body--which has voted today to support the \nelimination of the soft money loophole--the majority of this body, \nwhich has voted today for campaign finance reform, will be willing to \nsimply withdraw because the filibusterers have, so far, succeeded in \nstopping us from getting to 60 votes. That is what we will decide \ntomorrow.\n  This great Senate is a battleground where wills are tested, where \npeople who believe strongly in one side of an issue will test their \ncommitment against people who believe strongly in the other side of an \nissue. Everybody in this body has rights. The majority has rights. The \nminority has rights. The minority has a right to filibuster, a right \nwhich I will defend until we change those rules.\n  But the majority surely has the right not to give up in the face of a \nfilibuster. The majority has a right--indeed, I believe an obligation \non a matter of this principle--not to simply say: Well, we didn't \nsucceed the first time or the second time, so we're just going to throw \nin the towel.\n  If we feel keenly about this issue--as the majority, I believe and \nhope, does--then tomorrow, when that vote comes, we should vote not to \nmove to other business. It has nothing to do with what the other \nbusiness is.\n  The issue tomorrow morning isn't whether or not we favor or oppose \nlate-term abortions. That is not the issue. That was clear when the \nDemocratic leader offered a unanimous consent request to move to the \nlate-term abortions bill, to move to the late-term abortions bill by \nunanimous consent, which would have allowed us to then return, \nimmediately after the disposition of that issue, to the campaign \nfinance reform. But the Republican leader, our majority leader, \nobjected to that unanimous consent proposal and as a result made a \nmotion. And if this motion succeeds, then campaign finance reform goes \nback to the calendar and is put on the shelf. The vote tomorrow is the \nacid test vote as to whether or not we in the majority, who favor the \nclosing of the soft money loophole, who believe that loophole is the \nprincipal culprit in the erosion of our campaign finance laws, those of \nus who believe that soft money has blown the lid off the contribution \nlimits of our campaign finance system, those of us who believe the \nappearance of impropriety, which is created when people are solicited \nfor huge sums of money to political parties and those parties, of \ncourse, turn around and spend it relative to campaigns and candidates, \nwhich is their business, those of us who believe keenly that this \nsystem is broken and we have to close this loophole--tomorrow will be \nthe acid test for us. Tomorrow we will be put to the test.\n\n  It is not an easy test for all of us. Tomorrow we will be asked \nwhether or not we are willing to move to other business, to put back on \nthe calendar, to put on the shelf, this fight for campaign finance \nreform.\n  It is my hope the vote tomorrow will be at least as strong as the \nvote we had today, that 52 or 53 of us will say: No, we want to stay on \nthis bill or come back to this bill automatically; we want to address \nan issue which has created such a terrible feeling in the stomachs and \nthe hearts of our people. That is the feeling that is created when this \nhuge amount of money washes into these political campaigns and when it \nis used to buy the kind of access which is purchased from both \npolitical parties.\n  This will be the acid test vote. This is the key vote. I hope we can \nlive up to the responsibility we have to fight as hard for something we \nbelieve in as the opponents oppose with all their hearts. I hope we can \ndo what was done in the days of the civil rights bills, where one \nfailure to stop a filibuster did not deter the supporters of civil \nrights, where two failures to stop a filibuster did not deter the \nsupporters of civil rights, where three failures did not stop the \nsupporters of civil rights. They proceeded. They amended. They \nmodified. They worked the issue because civil rights day had come. And \njust as the day for campaign finance reform has now come, I hope we can \nlive up to our responsibility tomorrow and vote not to move to other \nbusiness but, rather, to stay on this issue, to put the public focus on \nthis issue, to say to those who would filibuster, that is your right, \nbut we are not going to withdraw simply because you in the minority are \nfilibustering this important cause.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nhis comments. As I was listening to him talking about the history of \nthe civil rights movement, it occurred to me that the civil rights \nmovement was all about giving people of color, all Americans, the right \nto participate fully in the political life of our Nation. In many ways, \nI consider this issue to be every bit as important as that issue.\n  The civil rights movement was a movement that changed our country for \nthe better, not just for people of color but for all of us. I think \ntoday many Americans believe they have been locked out and they can't \nfully participate in the political life of our Nation. I think the \nethical issue of our time is the way in which big money has essentially \nhijacked politics, has corrupted politics in a systemic sense. \nTherefore, I think Senator Levin is absolutely right.\n  I will not speak very long. I have had a chance to speak many times \nduring this debate. I believe, as a Senator, I should come here today \nand say this vote tomorrow morning is all about whether or not Senators \nwho say they want this reform will maintain the commitment to it. It is \nquite one thing for those who are opposed to reform to filibuster this \nbill, but it is quite another thing for the rest of us to say: Well, \nyou filibustered the bill; now we move on to other legislation.\n  If Senators want to continue to block this, then they will have to \ncontinue to block it. If, in fact, those of us who believe the most \nimportant single thing we can do right now is to at least get some of \nthis big money out of politics in the case of soft money, the least \naccountable part of the giving and the taking, then I think we have to \nbe willing to fight for it.\n  I hope the majority who voted for this legislation, who voted for \nwhat I think would be a historically significant reform, a step forward \nfor our country in getting some of the big money out and bringing \ncitizens back in, will be the same majority voting tomorrow. I think \nthe vote tomorrow is really the critical vote. Either we essentially \nsay to those who have filibustered and those who have blocked our\n\n[[Page S12822]]\n\nefforts, we will go away; it is over, or we will say, no, you don't \nmove on to other legislation; we are going to continue to speak out and \ncontinue to debate and continue to work hard until we pass reform.\n  It is late in the day. The vote is tomorrow morning. But I am hoping \nthat, through the media, citizens will understand what this vote is \nabout tomorrow. I really believe people in the country want to see us \nmake this change.\n  I have an amendment. I have a self-interest reason. I have an \namendment I have introduced. I am not going to get a vote on this \namendment if everybody goes away. Given how difficult it is to pass \nreform, given all the ways in which those vested interests who give the \nmoney, those who are the well connected, those who are the heavy \nhitters, those who are the well heeled seem to have too much influence \nhere, and given the fact that those who have the power don't want the \nchange, I think that is, in part, what we are up against.\n  The vast majority of the people in the country want the change. If we \ndon't get this vote tomorrow and it is all over, I am absolutely \nconvinced the energy is going to have to come from the grassroots \nlevel.\n  I have an amendment--and I will come back with it over and over \nagain--that basically says, if we are not willing to pass the reform \nlegislation here, then let the people in our States decide. We are a \ngrassroots political culture. Sometimes it is the local level, \nsometimes it is the State level, which is willing to light a candle and \nshow the way.\n\n  If Massachusetts and Vermont and Maine and Arizona have passed clean \nmoney/clean election legislation, which basically gets all of the \ninterested private money out and says to candidates, if you run for \noffice, and it is voluntary, but if you will agree to spending limits, \nyou can draw from the funding in this clean money/clean election fund \nso it will be a clean election; it will be clean money: it won't be \ninterested money; it will be disinterested money, the elections will \nbelong to the people in the States and the Government will belong to \nthe people in the States and this is what we really ought to do.\n  If they want to do that, then my amendment says they ought to be able \nto apply it to Federal office as well. They ought to be able to say \nthat is the way we want to elect Senators or Representatives from \nMinnesota or Kansas or Michigan or whatever State we are talking about.\n  If tomorrow we don't get the vote, which essentially says we refuse \nto back down, we don't have 60 votes yet, you people will have to \ncontinue to filibuster this and we are going to keep having amendments, \nwe are going to keep having votes, and we are going to keep having \ndebate.\n  The majority leader said we had 5 days of debate. We haven't had 5 \ndays of debate. I am still puzzled why we didn't come into session \nuntil 1 today. I am not saying that in the spirit of whining. I am \nsaying that in the spirit of some indignation and anger. We should have \nbeen in here this morning. We should have been debating the vote we \nwere taking this afternoon on the McCain-Feingold bill. Senators should \nhave had the opportunity to come and talk about why they were for it or \nwhy they were against it. It is not as if this is a small issue.\n  It is not as if this is a small issue. When we talk about how we \nfinance our elections, when we talk about who gets to run for office, \nwho wins office, what kind of issues we look at, and whether or not \npeople believe in the political process, we are talking about whether \nor not we have a representative democracy. That is what we are talking \nabout.\n  I argue that not only have we moved far away from the principle that \neach person should count as one and no more than one, but we are also \ngetting to the point where we have Government of, by, and for a few \npeople; Government of, by, and for those who can make the big \ncontributions; Government of, by, and for just a tiny slice of the \npopulation. That is hardly a healthy, functioning, representative \ndemocracy. That is really what this debate is all about.\n  The problem is, we haven't had much of a debate. It is 6:20, and I am \nout here, and this is the end of the day, I gather. Tomorrow morning, \nwe will have the vote. This debate has just begun. It should not be \nover.\n  Really, what I hope is that tomorrow we will vote against moving on \nto other legislation and there will be a lot of Senators out here. I \nwill have this amendment that says let the people at the grassroots \nlevel determine this, and if people in our States want to get the big \nmoney out, and they want to have clean elections, and they want to have \nclean money, and they want to do it this way, then let them apply it to \nSenate and House races because, I am telling you, I think that is \nactually the way it is going to go. We won't get a chance to have an \nup-or-down vote on that amendment or many others that Senators have. We \nwon't have people out here spelling out why they are for McCain-\nFeingold, or for other changes, what ways they want to improve it, what \ndo they think we should do. We haven't had that full debate.\n  This issue deserves that debate. This is supposed to be the world's \ngreatest deliberative body. But we haven't done the deliberation. What \nwe have had is an effort to block this, and I think those who block \nthis legislation are just hoping it will go away. The way it goes away \nis if those of us who have been for the reform just literally fold our \ntents and go away. Some of us around here are making the appeal that \nthat should not happen.\n  I want to make one final point. And I am speaking as one Senator from \nMinnesota. I think for me, ever since I came here in 1990, this has \nbeen the issue. There are many issues I care about, but this is such a \ncore issue. I find it hard to believe that all of us will not focus on \neconomic justice, on making sure we have equal opportunity for every \nchild, and on making sure we have environmental protection on this \nland, making sure we do something about the conditions in the inner \ncity, making sure people in rural America have a chance, making sure \nfamily farmers get a decent price, making sure there is a good \neducation for every child, making sure we speak to the bread-and-butter \neconomic issues that affect the vast majority of families, making sure \nwe have the courage to take on the big insurance companies, big oil \ncompanies, pharmaceutical companies, and telecommunication companies.\n  I think the way in which we finance campaigns and the influence of \nbig money diverts our efforts, frustrates our efforts, and determines \nthat we won't be able to make this change. This is the core issue. This \nis all about--as Bill Moyers, a wonderful journalist, has said--the \n``soul of democracy.'' That is what this debate is about.\n\n  If this debate is all about the soul of democracy, if whether or not \nwe are going to pass some reform is all about the soul of democracy, if \nthis is all about whether or not we are going to continue to have a \nreal functioning representative democracy, that we are still going to \nhave self-government, then I think we don't do this in 4 days; we don't \ngo away.\n  Tomorrow morning, there is a critical vote. I am really hoping the \nmajority who voted for the McCain-Feingold bill--a very modest effort, \na stripped-down piece of legislation, with bare minimum reform, that is \nat least a step in the positive direction--those Senators who voted for \nthat I hope will be the same Senators who will say: No, we are not \ngoing to let you take this off the agenda, this issue stays on the \nagenda of the Senate, and we want full-scale debate and an opportunity \nto introduce amendments, and we want everybody out here spelling out \nfor the people in our States why we are for reform or why we think this \ncurrent system is unacceptable.\n  The other point I will make is that, for those of you who are working \naround the country with public campaigns, for all of the locally \nelected leaders who have said, we are committed in our States to \npassing clean money/clean election legislation, I say go to it. What \nhappened out here on the floor of the Senate serves notice that the way \nthis change is going to take place is from the grassroots level.\n  What I want to do as a Senator is to support those efforts everywhere \nin the country. I want to meet with people doing the organizing. I want \nto continue to bring the amendment to the floor of the Senate which \nsays, if\n\n[[Page S12823]]\n\nStates want to go in that direction and apply the clean money/clean \nelection initiatives to Federal races, they should be able to do so \nbecause I am convinced that you won't be stopped. It could be that the \nmonied interests are going to be able to stop the forum here, but I \ndon't think they are going to be able to stop it in Minnesota or in \nStates all around our country.\n  We are going to have to do it at the grassroots level. We are going \nto have to bring more pressure from the grassroots level and have more \nof this legislation passed by the States. It will bubble up, and \neventually--I certainly hope before I finish up my career in public \nservice--we will finally pass sweeping legislation which not only will \nget a lot of the big money out of politics and a lot of people back \ninto politics but will do something that is even more important, and \nthat will be to renew democracy.\n  I look for the day when people in our country are engaged in public \naffairs, when we have a really good citizen politics. I look for the \nday when young people can't wait to run for public office and serve in \npublic office. I just hope for the day, and dream for the day, when \npeople have a really good feeling about public life, a really good \nfeeling about politics, a really good feeling about political parties, \na really good feeling about the debate on the issues. I long for that \nday. I hope for that day. I dream for that day.\n  One way or the another, I am hoping and dreaming that during my \ncareer in the Senate we will be able to pass this legislation. I hoped \nit would be now. Whether or not it will be now depends upon whether or \nnot we will have a majority of Senators who will say tomorrow: We are \nnot moving off this legislation, we are not going to let those who \noppose reform take this question off the table; this will be the \nbusiness of the Senate tomorrow, the next day, and the next day, and \nmaybe the next day after that, until we pass reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, last night, surprisingly, our session \nadjourned early. This morning, even more surprisingly, we had no \nsession at all. I am sad to say I am suspicious enough to think that \nthe reason for the early adjournment yesterday and the absence of a \nsession this morning was in order to reduce the opportunity for those \nsuch as myself who believe the issue we are debating is extremely \nfundamental, albeit also extremely sensitive to some, and therefore \ndeserves a full discussion. By the shortening of the session yesterday \nand this morning's termination of the session, we lost several hours \nthat would have otherwise been used to discuss this issue with our \ncolleagues and with the American people. But there were some benefits \nof the fact that we were not in session last evening and we were not in \nsession this morning. And that is that some of us--I hope many of us--\nhad an opportunity to see a repeat of a lecture that was given in 1995 \nby the eminent American historian, David McCullough. The lecture was \ngiven at the LBJ school at the University of Texas in Austin, TX. It \nwas on a general topic of ``Character Above All''--``Character Above \nAll.'' The topic of David McCullough's lecture was Harry Truman, a man \nwho served in this Chamber with great distinction, presided over this \nChamber briefly as Vice President of the United States, and then for \nthe better part of 8 years served as President of the United States.\n\n  In his lecture, Mr. McCullough outlined a number of the \ncharacteristics of Harry Truman that made him such a distinguished \nfigure. Mr. McCullough said that he was a better American than he was a \nPresident; that he was the embodiment of the essential value of his \ncountry--a man who had been raised in rural circumstances in Missouri, \nwas not particularly well educated but, in fact, by his own efforts \nbecame classically educated, and then rose to the highest position in \nthe land at a time of extreme national urgency during those critical \nyears immediately after World War II.\n  Mr. McCullough said one of the characteristics of Harry Truman that \nmade him such an effective American, an effective President, and \nrevered citizen of this land was the fact that he had a set of core \nvalues. He knew who he was; he knew what he stood for; he did not have \nto wake up in the morning and put his finger in the air to find out \nwhich direction the wind was blowing.\n  I suggest that this debate today is essentially about character--\nindividual character, yes, but more importantly the character of our \nNation, the character of our democracy at the end of the 20th century. \nThis debate is also about fundamental values. In what do we believe? \nWhat do we consider to be worthy of asking our fellow citizens and \nourselves to sacrifice for?\n  Mr. McCullough talked about the fact that some Presidents who do not \nrise to the highest ranks of history's estimation were Presidents who \nwere reluctant to ask the American people to do great things; that the \nPresidents who have challenged us to our fullest potential as a people \nhave been those Presidents whom we mark as being our most revered.\n  I believe those comments about character, about values, about who we \nare as Americans, are significant in this debate this evening because \nwe are talking about an issue that goes to the heart of our society, to \nthe heart of the relationship between our society of America and the \nformal institution of government, which is the embodiment of our \nsociety.\n  I regret to say that today the abuses, the pernicious effects of \nmoney in our political system, represent a cancer, a cancer that is \neating away at the heart of our values, the heart of our compact as \nAmericans, the heart of our democracy. There are symptoms of this \ncancer. They include the increased feeling of disaffection between \ncitizens and their government, a feeling that government is not a part \nof the ``we'' of which we all belong, but it is the ``they'' who are in \nconfrontation with our own personal desire; and the low level of \nparticipation--not only the low level of participation in the act of \nvoting, but also the low level of participation in people's willingness \nto serve in civic activities.\n  There was a long essay recently by a Harvard professor called \n``Bowling Alone,'' about the fact that some of the institutions such as \ncivic clubs and even sports organizations that have previously been a \nsource of our national coherence have been increasingly shredded--low \nparticipation in people's willingness to accept positions of appointed \nresponsibility, whether it is to the local PTA or to a governmental \nposition, low participation of people in basic citizens' \nresponsibilities such as jury duty, the very difficulty of our \nvoluntary military to get an adequate number of persons to fill the \nranks of our Army, Navy, and Air Force.\n  I was struck over the weekend, which, frankly, was spent in part \nwatching some football games, at how many ads were run by our services \nto try to entice people to join the military. Those ads are themselves \nan indication of the difficulty of securing the kind of citizen \nparticipation associated with our democracy--the difficulty of \nattracting people to run for public office. Unfortunately, many people \ntoday are running away from public office.\n  I have had some considerable personal experience trying to encourage \npeople who I thought had talent and integrity and would bring the \nexperience of their lives to enhance public decisionmaking. How \ndifficult it is to get those people to be willing to expose themselves \nto the kind of requirements of which the necessity to raise enormous \namounts of money in a way that many people believe is degrading and \nrequires them to pander makes seeking public office unattractive and in \nthe final analysis is an option which is rejected.\n  Another example of the symptoms of this disease of cancer eating away \nat the heart of our democracy is the fact that now leading business \nexecutives are declaring that they are going to opt out of this current \nfundraising system, that they no longer want to pick up the phone, as \none of those executives said while interviewed on television, 1,000 \ntimes for people soliciting funds, and not just soliciting what might \nbe considered a reasonable contribution but soliciting for thousands of \ndollars of contributions over and over and over. And so they have opted \nout of the system.\n  Our efforts today are a part of a larger effort to try to restore \nthose values\n\n[[Page S12824]]\n\nof community, those values of common sharing of the excitement, the \nresponsibilities, and the obligations of a democratic society.\n  I hope that our efforts this week will be the beginning of true \nreform--reform that puts our political system back in the hands of the \npeople.\n  The current version of Senator McCain's and Senator Feingold's \nlegislation focuses on soft money. That is the money which comes into a \npolitical party that is not subject to the normal regulations and is \nunlimited in amount; with only minor manipulation soft money now can be \nused for almost any political purpose. Other than soft money which we \ntypically refer to as hard money, the money that is regulated, the \nmoney that is limited in amount, the money that is subject to full \nreporting, there is virtually no difference in what today's soft money \ncan be used for and what hard money can be used for.\n  We will have other amendments to consider in other areas of needed \nreform in our campaign finance system. All of these are important and \nworthy of debate. I hope we will keep our focus on what I suggest is \nthe single most important issue we face: How can we eliminate from our \nsystem the amount that is coming from the enormous faucet of soft \nmoney? How can we begin to restore the American public's trust and \nconfidence in their government? The public should be confident their \nelected representatives are voting on the basis of honestly held \nconvictions, not on the basis of who has contributed tens or even \nhundreds of thousands of dollars to a political party, which money then \nis used to advance that particular public official's political \ncandidacy.\n  While we cannot legislate the trust of the American people, we can \nplant the seeds of confidence by enacting real campaign finance reform. \nWe must change the path we are on to regain the public's trust. It is \ncritical the American people have trust in their public institutions to \nassure the proper functioning of a democracy.\n  In 1774, Edmund Burke was a member of the British Parliament. He had \ncast a vote which was contrary to the will of his constituency in the \ncommunity of Bristol. They berated him for not having voted the way \nthey--those who had elected him to the Parliament--would have \npreferred. Edmund Burke accepted the responsibility as a representative \nof the people to also become an educator of the people. He said to the \nelectors of Bristol on November 3 of 1774, your representative owes you \nnot his industry only but his judgment; and he betrays instead of \nserving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion.\n  The people of Bristol may have temporarily been disappointed that \nEdmund Burke did not do what they felt at the moment was their desire, \nbut they were satisfied with the fact he was giving them more than just \na weather vane of their opinion; rather, he was giving them the benefit \nof his informed judgment.\n  Today, unfortunately, many citizens believe their representatives \nfollow neither their judgment nor popular opinion. Instead, they \nbelieve it is only the donors of huge amounts of soft money who hold \nthe ear and the vote of their elected representatives.\n  We are not the first branch of government to recognize the connection \nbetween our actions and our appearances and the public's confidence and \nwillingness to respect and legitimize our actions. For many years, the \nJudiciary has imposed upon itself strict rules governing the conduct of \njudges and lawyers. These rules do not exist because it is assumed \njudges will engage in unethical behavior; rather, it is to make certain \nthey avoid even the appearance of impropriety. This self-regulation \nhelps to maintain the public's confidence in the integrity of our \njudicial system. I suggest we in Congress have a similar obligation to \nmaintain the public's confidence in the integrity of the legislative \nsystem.\n  Make no mistake, by any measure, the public's faith and confidence in \nthe political process is eroding. Voter turnout is low, youth \nparticipation is low, institutional confidence is down. It is our \nobligation, as it is the obligation of the judicial branch, to take \nthose steps that will restore the necessary public confidence.\n  It is no coincidence participation and trust in our governmental \ninstitutions are at a low point at the same time the pursuit of \ncampaign money by parties and politicians is at an all-time high. The \ncrass chase for soft money by candidates of both parties is demeaning \nto the contributor; it is demeaning to the political recipient. I hope \nwe can convince Members of both parties to put an end to it. The ever-\nincreasing focus on fundraising has fundamentally and negatively \nchanged the nature and the purpose of a congressional campaign. Our \nattention has been diverted from activities which are most beneficial \nto voters while we chase money. This need to amass a huge campaign war \nchest has led to the privatization of our traditionally public campaign \nprocess.\n\n  Political campaigns should belong to the people, not to the few who \ncan participate in the financing of those campaigns. Over the past two \ndecades, we have watched as campaigns have been transformed. What used \nto be an effort to meet and to listen to voters has now become an \nexercise in raising money for carefully crafted, frequently negative \ntelevision commercials. Candidates now move from the television studio \nto record sound bites to the telephone to solicit campaign \ncontributions to pay to air those sound bites. This transformation has \nnarrowed the range of issues debated to those few who can be broadcast \nin a 30-second commercial.\n  What is lost? Lost is the interaction with voters. Lost are real \ndebates about important substantive issues. Most important, what could \nbe lost is our rich political heritage of a genuine dialog between \ncandidates and voters. What had been a publicly owned campaign system \nhas become a privately managed and staged event. The essential purpose \nof a political campaign is being subverted. Campaigns should provide \nthe opportunity for two-way growth. Campaigns should prepare the \ncandidate to represent and govern. Meeting the public, managing a \ncampaign, a candidate learns important lessons crucial to government. A \ncandidate learns important insights about the people he or she hopes to \nrepresent.\n  I have suggested to newspaper editorial boards when they interview \npersons who are seeking their endorsement for a campaign that there are \na set of questions that ought to be asked of all candidates. One of \nthose questions is, What have you learned since you announced your \nintention to seek public office? What have you learned since that date \nthat will make you a better person should you be elected to office? Has \nthe candidate, in fact, used the campaign as a learning, growing \nprocess?\n  Similarly, a political campaign and its interaction is important to \nthe public. The observation of a candidate allows the voter to exercise \na thoughtful judgment about who should be entrusted with the \nresponsibility to govern. The shift from hard money to soft money has \nobliterated much of this relationship, the relationship of the \ncandidate learning from the citizens, and the citizens' ability to \nassess the qualities of that candidate for public service.\n  The shift from hard money to soft money brings many adverse effects \nwhich will move our campaigns away from this two-way growth. Soft money \nhas no standards. It is unlimited, unregulated, unreported. It turns \ncandidates away from seeking contributions from traditional fundraising \nsources. The public loses accountability.\n  In relying on soft money, the candidate loses control of his or her \ncampaign. There are not very many things that happen in a political \ncampaign which are real. Most of the things that occur in a campaign \nare contrived or manipulated. One of the things that is real is how \nwell a candidate runs their campaign. That requires acts of judgment as \nto the people with whom you will associate yourself in the campaign, \nhow well you allocate resources to pursue your campaign, the kinds of \npriorities and issues upon which you base your campaign. Those are all \nindicators of how the person, if elected to office, is likely to carry \nout his or her public responsibilities in exactly the same area. But \nthe heavy reliance on soft money and the ability of the candidate to \nturn his campaign essentially over to those who will present him or her \nin the most favorable television light causes the candidate to lose \nthat control of the campaign and the public\n\n[[Page S12825]]\n\nto lose the ability to use that campaign as an indicator of the \nindividual's potential for public service.\n\n  It is not just the candidate who loses control. The public also loses \ncontrol. It loses the opportunity to see the candidate exercise his or \nher personal judgment and thereby loses an important opportunity to \nevaluate the candidate as a potential public servant.\n  Finally, it is clear the distinction between the uses of hard and \nsoft money have become pure sophistry. Experience has shown us that \nparties can advocate for a particular candidate with soft money every \nbit as effectively as they can with hard money.\n  Just a few hours ago, I saw a television commercial that was a \ncommercial which was paid for by one of the campaign committees of the \nCongress. The commercial was an attack against a candidate alleging \nthat candidate had broken the trust of the people by spending Social \nSecurity surpluses for other than intended Social Security purposes. \nThe ad did not say: Vote against candidate and current Member of \nCongress X. But, rather, it ran that individual's name in the ad and \nsaid: Call him and tell him to stop raiding Social Security.\n  That is the kind of ad that is being bought and paid for and \ndisseminated over the airways with this gush of soft money. It is an ad \nwhich is intended not to enlighten the public but to distort and \nmanipulate the public. It is the type of negative ad which has \ncontributed so substantially to the loss of public confidence in the \npolitical system.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill will not correct all the problems in our \ncurrent system, but it will give us a good start towards that solution. \nBanning soft money, in my opinion, is the first step. Opponents of \ncampaign reform argue that more money is good for democracy because it \nincreases political speech. They also argue that even modest attempts \nat reform violate the first amendment's protection of free speech.\n  Now, presumably these opponents, who would argue any attempts at \nreform violate our protection of freedom of speech, do not favor any \nlimits on campaign donations--no limits by non-U.S. persons, \nbusinesses, or even governments. We have had a lot of investigations, a \nlot of bemoaning the fact that non-U.S. persons, businesses, and \npossibly even non-U.S. governments have made contributions to American \npolitical campaigns and potentially were doing it in order to secure \nfavor for their particular interest within the United States. The fact \nis, that is a very serious and, in my opinion, extremely noxious policy \nthat allows non-U.S. persons, businesses, and even governments to \ninvolve themselves in U.S. political campaigns. But it is not illegal \nunder the current law. The basis of the fact it is not illegal is this \nenormous loophole called soft money.\n  Citizens of another country, business interests of another country, \ngovernments, foreign governments, can all contribute to American \npolitical campaigns through the gaping loophole of soft money. Yet the \nopponents of this legislation that is before us tonight would argue \nthat to close even those loopholes would constitute an undue \ninfringement on freedom of speech. How absurd.\n  The arguments against reform confuse the quantity of speech with the \nquality of speech. We have a great deal of evidence that pouring more \nsoft money into our campaigns has actually harmed our electoral \nprocess. Party soft money expenditures for the 1996 Presidential and \ncongressional elections totaled $262 million. Let me repeat that. Soft \nmoney to American political parties in the 1996 Presidential and \ncongressional elections totaled $262 million. That figure was three \ntimes the $86 million which was spent through soft money in the 1992 \nPresidential and congressional elections.\n  Despite this threefold increase in soft money between 1992 and 1996, \nwere there evidences that it had a positive effect on American \nparticipation in government? Are there evidences, as is suggested by \nthe concept that more money is better for the political process, that \nthese expenditures were used to energize the spirit of democracy? Oh, \nno. Presidential election turnout in 1996 was the lowest in 72 years.\n  When you consider what a tripling of soft money that occurred between \n1992 and 1996 did to voter turnout, you can shudder to think what will \nhappen in next year's Presidential election when soft money \nexpenditures are expected to double again, to over $500 million. Voters \nseem to recognize that, while money may buy an increase in the volume \nof speech, it does so at the price of the quality, the thoughtfulness \nof speech. And the volume finally drowns out the quality, and the voter \nturns off and retreats from participation.\n\n  Removing unlimited, uncontrolled soft money from the process would \nnot infringe on anyone's right to free speech. Contributions to \ncandidates and parties would still be not only permitted but \nencouraged. They would simply have to be made according to the rules, \nrules already in place, rules that have been sanctioned by our \njudiciary as being consistent with first amendment freedom of speech \nprivileges.\n  For years we have regulated hard money and union and corporate \ncontributions. Indeed, some of these regulations have existed since the \ntime of Theodore Roosevelt. These regulations are consistent with the \nfirst amendment. So is the proposed ban on soft money. I believe the \nactual quality of political speech will be enhanced with a prohibition \non soft money. It provides ample avenues for contributing to political \ncandidates, for candidates communicating with and learning from voters, \nand for raising the credibility of the tattered system by which we \nelect public officials. We can have all of those benefits by using the \nsystem we thought we had, and that is the system that provides for \ncontrolled, limited, fully reported campaign contributions.\n  Reform will encourage more voters to participate because they will \nhave renewed hope that their individual voices are being heard, that \ntheir individual voices will make a difference.\n  Our colleagues in the House of Representatives have acted. Many \nStates have acted. The public is now rightfully waiting for us in this \nChamber which has been described as the greatest deliberative body on \nEarth. Our people are waiting for us to act to put our campaign system \nback in order. The system is broken. We have the power, we have the \nobligation, to fix it. The McCain-Feingold bill is a significant step \nin that direction. I am proud to support it. I encourage my colleagues \nto do likewise.\n  Tomorrow will be the testing hour. We are asked to vote on what \nappears to be a procedural matter, to proceed to another piece of \nlegislation, legislation that has considerable support, legislation \nthat this Senate has considered on a number of occasions in recent \nyears, legislation which this Senate will undoubtedly consider during \nthis session of Congress.\n  Make no mistake about it, the effect of voting tomorrow morning to \nproceed to another piece of legislation is a vote to strike a stake in \nthe heart of even the beginning of campaign finance reform in America \nbecause if we adopt this motion to leave this legislation and turn to \nanother subject matter, I sadly suggest we will never return again to \ncampaign finance reform. We will have done a disservice to the American \npeople.\n  I hope that we will rise to the standard of character above all, that \nwe will demonstrate we are worthy of our previous colleagues in this \nSenate, such as Senator and later President Harry S. Truman, that we \nknow who we are, we know what our responsibilities are to the American \npeople, and we are prepared to discharge those responsibilities. I \nthank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate took two very important \nvotes with regard to the question of how to reform the manner in which \nelections for federal office are financed. These votes provided the \nSenate two very different paths in which to accomplish this goal.\n  As my colleagues are aware, a majority of Senators in this body \nclearly believe that the current system is in need of reform. Progress \nhas been made in previous years in two important areas: in the \nsubstance of the issue and in gaining greater Congressional support for \nreform.\n  Nevertheless, I believe that the paramount goals of any true effort \nof reform must be to reduce the perception that special interest money \nexerts undue influence on elected officials, and to address the blatant \nelectioneering disguised as issue advocacy.\n\n[[Page S12826]]\n\n These two components must be a part of any proposal forming the basis \nof Senate debate. The original McCain-Feingold legislation (S. 26) \noffered this base, and that is why I supported and cosponsored the \nbill.\n  In the past two years, the Senate has voted five different times to \ninvoke cloture on the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform proposal. \nI supported each of these motions because of my belief that the Senate \nneeded to begin the process of debating the merits of the bill. I also \nvoted for cloture on the paycheck protection proposal because I \nbelieved that it was an opportunity for the Senate to level the playing \nfield on the pending debate.\n  Now, what is the playing field about which I speak? I believe that \nthe Senate should keep its eye on the overall objective of limiting the \nexplosion of unregulated spending which has diminished the role of the \ncandidate and heightened the role of not only the political parties, \nbut of outside groups who have a direct impact on federal elections \nwithout any accountability to the public.\n  Let me now take a moment to explain my reasons for supporting cloture \non the Daschle amendment to S. 1593 and for opposing cloture on the \nReid amendment to the Daschle amendment.\n  I voted for cloture on the Daschle substitute amendment to the \nscaled-down McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill because it \nwould have provided the Senate with a better starting point than we \nhave had in previous years. While it was not a perfect version of a \ncampaign finance reform bill, it offered the Senate the opportunity to \ndebate and to amend a comprehensive and level bill, similar to the \nversion recently approved by the House of Representatives.\n\n  On the other hand, I voted against cloture on the Reid amendment \nbecause I believe this approach would restrict the political parties \nwithout acknowledging the skyrocketing impact of outside groups on the \npolitical process. The Reid amendment, which was almost identical to \nthe scaled-down version of the McCain-Feingold bill (S. 1593), in my \nview, did not go far enough to address this important issue. I am \ntroubled by the prospect that non-party activities would remain \nunregulated while the parties would be restrained. This could make a \nflawed system even more unbalanced.\n  I admire the work Senators McCain and Feingold have done in raising \nawareness of the problems of our campaign finance system. I fully \nintend to continue working with them, as well as the other supporters \nof campaign finance reform, to develop a comprehensive approach in this \nmatter. The Senate had the opportunity to make this important change in \nthe current fundraising system by invoking cloture on the Daschle \namendment. I will continue to support campaign finance reform measures \nthat follow this approach.\n  In addition, I intend not to support the Majority Leader's motion to \nproceed to S. 1692, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban bill at this time. \nMy vote for cloture on the Daschle amendment was based on the belief \nthat debate on this issue should move forward and the reform process \nshould begin. The Daschle amendment provides the Senate with this \nopportunity for a meaningful debate on the bill.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is \nvery important to our political system. I believe that our current \ncampaign finance system needs serious reform. But, I cannot support the \ncurrent version of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill. I \nbelieve the bill's total ban on so-called ``soft money'' is \nunconstitutional. It is a clear violation of the free speech clause of \nthe First Amendment.\n  Soft money is used by political parties to advocate specific policies \nor issues, as well as other party-building activities, such as voter \nregistration and get-out-the-vote efforts. The Supreme Court considers \nthese issue advocacy activities to be free speech and has made it \nperfectly clear through previous rulings that any total prohibition of \nfunds for issue advocacy would be a violation of the First Amendment.\n  That's why I have been working with several of my colleagues, \nincluding Senators Hagel, Abraham, Gorton, and Thomas, to come up with \na campaign finance reform proposal that makes much-needed changes in \nthe system, while still preserving the free speech rights guaranteed \nunder the First Amendment. I believe that by correcting the problems, \nwe can achieve a fair and open system of campaign finance laws, which \nis a big step toward restoring the people's faith in our democratic \ngovernment.\n  Our proposal would achieve a number of important goals.\n  First, it would improve our disclosure laws and increase \naccountability of political candidates and political parties. Our \nproposal would provide for more disclosure of contributions given to \ncandidates and parties, institute immediate electronic disclosure by \nthe Federal Election Commission (FEC), and require disclosure of the \nnames of those who purchase political advertisements on radio and \ntelevision.\n  Second, our proposal would impose overall limits on what individuals \ncan provide to both candidates and parties. As I noted earlier, right \nnow, a person can contribute any amount of ``soft'' money he or she \nwishes to a political party. Under our proposal, a person could give a \nmaximum of $60,000 to national political parties. The proposal also \nwould allow that same person to make individual contributions to \ncandidates of up to $3,000--up from the current $1000 limit. This would \nbring the total amount that an individual could give to parties, \ncandidates, and other political committees to $75,000. The limitation \non contributions to political parties would not take effect until after \nthe Supreme Court has a chance to review any constitutional challenges \nto these limits.\n  The goal here is to limit one person's or organization's ability to \ndistort the political process through massive cash contributions to \nparties. In addition, we would like to see more of that limited \ncontribution go toward the candidates, themselves, rather than the \nparties, because candidates currently face tougher disclosure \nrequirements than the parties. In short, our plan would put a lid on \noverall contributions and increase accountability of these funds.\n  I know a number of my colleagues and I were looking forward to \ndiscussing our proposal and others and how it would bring reform to our \npolitical process. We should view today's vote as a demonstration for \nthe need for our proposal--one that will not run counter to the First \nAmendment, and one that will ensure greater accountability and \ncredibility of our political process.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to register my support for meaningful \ncampaign finance reform. I will be voting today for cloture on the \nDaschle amendment which is the broader version of campaign finance \nreform passed by the House, including provisions to limit issue \nadvocacy advertising during campaigns. Should we have a vote on the \nReid amendment, I will also be voting for cloture on a ban on so-called \nsoft money contributions to political parties. Although I was \nunavoidably absent from the Senate during yesterday's vote, I would \nhave voted against the motion to table the Reid amendment banning soft \nmoney contributions.\n  Banning of soft money is the least we can do. This unlimited flow of \nmoney into party coffers creates the greatest opportunity for special \ninterests to seek favor with politicians. The reality that businesses \nor organizations can be tapped for such vast sums has dramatically \nchanged the atmosphere surrounding the work of our legislative and \nexecutive branches of government. Even responsible voices in business \nhave said that they want out from this unseemly competition. The \nCommittee for Economic Development, a group of 200 senior executives \nand college presidents, has put forward its own campaign finance \nproposal, mirroring many of the ideas we have discussed over the last \nfew days, stating, ``As business leaders, we are troubled by the \nmounting pressure for businesses to contribute to the campaigns their \ncompetitors support, as well as the dangers that real or perceived \npolitical corruption pose for business and the economy.''\n  Whether the presence of unlimited political contributions is \ncorrupting or whether it just creates the appearance of corruption, the \ndamage is done. Americans are disaffected with politics and political \ncampaigns and have voted\n\n[[Page S12827]]\n\nagainst the current system with their feet: U.S. voter turnout in \nelections is in serious decline. According to the Committee for the \nStudy of the American Electorate, over the last 30 years we have \nwitnessed a 26 percent decline in voter participation. Fifty-four \npercent of voting age adults reported voting in the last Presidential \nelection in 1996, the lowest level since the Census Bureau began \ncollecting these statistics in 1964. And these statistics may not even \ntell the whole story, with some citizens unwilling to admit they did \nnot vote. The official statistics maintained by the Clerk of the House \nmeasured voter turnout in 1996 at 49.8 percent. For non-Presidential \nelection years, the numbers are even more discouraging. During the 1998 \nelections, we witnessed the lowest voter turnout since 1942.\n  Our representative democracy is harmed by eroding participation. As \nelected officials we have a responsibility to try to address the \nsources of voter disaffection. According to the Census Bureau, 17 \npercent of non-voting registered individuals reported they did not vote \nbecause of apathy. That number was up from 11 percent in 1980. In \nresponse, we should be working to help reconnect the voters with their \nelected officials and to invest them in the political debates of the \nday. Campaign finance reform, in one form or another, is an important \npart of that process. However, there is more we can be doing to bring \ncitizens back to the polls and to engage them in the issues facing our \ncountry. We must be clearly responsive to our constituents and not the \nspecial interests who often seem to have a stranglehold on the \npolitical process. Unfortunately, there are far too many bills which \nhave the fingerprints of special interests all over them. We must take \nback the process from the special interests and craft bills beholden to \nno one but our constituents.\n  We should also be working to eliminate barriers to voting. Nearly 5 \nmillion registered voters said they did not make it to the polls in \n1996 because they couldn't get time off from work or school to vote. In \nresponse, we need to explore ways to make it easier for Americans to \ncast their ballots, and we need to do so in a way that does not \nencourage voter fraud. One such approach which merits further \nconsideration is longer voting hours at the polls.\n\n  In the past I have introduced legislation to study the possibility of \nextending voting hours across the weekend. If polls were open on \nSaturday and Sunday, people would have more than enough time to vote. \nSince the mid-19th century we have held election day on the first \nTuesday in November, ironically because it was the most convenient day \nfor voters. Tuesdays were traditionally ``court day'' and landowning \nvoters were often coming to town that day anyway. We need to consider \nthe national rhythms of today and determine what framework for voting \nmakes the most sense for the American people.\n  While weekend voting may pose some challenges, others have \nrecommended that we require the states to keep the polling stations \nopen from early in the morning until late in the evening on election \nday. This more limited proposal would be less costly and more \nmanageable for states and would also provide more opportunities for \npeople to vote.\n  We should consider proposals to create a national voter leave, \nperhaps just two hours on election day to enable workers to make it to \nthe polls. I am also intrigued by proposals to allow the disabled to \nvote by telephone, and we should be investigating how we can make use \nof the internet to make registration and voting easier.\n  The internet is already ushering in a new era in elections, bringing \nnew meaning to the issue of transparency in the financing of political \ncampaigns. Until now, disclosure has been one of the cornerstones of \ncampaign finance reform. The disinfectant of sunshine has always been \nheralded as a means of keeping politics clean. However, in this era of \ninstant posting of campaign contributions, we are seeing an interesting \nside effect. The very tool to limit the role of special interests in \npolitics is also highlighting that role and adding to the disaffection \nof voters. While it is important for us to continue to shine a \nspotlight on campaign contributions, we must recognize that disclosure \nis not enough. Ultimately, meaningful campaign finance reform and other \nefforts to increase voter motivation are the keys to bringing citizens \nback into the polling booth. Elections are essential to maintaining a \nrobust democracy. Looking at the fragile democracies around the world \nreminds us that the right to elect our own leaders is a precious \nright--most valuable if it is exercised.\n  Mr. President, whether we pass campaign finance reform today or at \nsome point in the future, I want to acknowledge the hard work of my \ncolleague from Wisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold in moving this issue \nforward. Senator Feingold and Senator McCain have persisted in raising \ncampaign finance reform in the face of opposition from a minority \ndetermined to block reform. I will continue to support their efforts \nand look forward to the day when all Americans recognize that they have \na stake in our society and are motivated to exercise their civic duty \nto vote.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my extreme \ndisappointment in the Senate's failure to invoke cloture on the \ncampaign finance reform legislation. This is the third consecutive year \nwe have held this debate and I am disturbed that each attempt to move \nthis bill has failed.\n  Our campaigns are awash in money. Over the weekend, both the \nWashington Post and the New York Times ran stories detailing the rise \nof soft money contributions and the impact it is having on our \nelectoral process.\n  We do not need newspapers to tell us what we already know. We have \nrun the campaigns, we have raised the money, and we have felt the sting \nof negative attack ads.\n  I am now entering my fourth statewide campaign in California. In the \n1990's, I have raised more than $40 million. In the 1990 race for \nGovernor, I had to raise about $23 million. In the first race for the \nSenate, $8 million; in the second race, $14 million. This process has \ngot to stop.\n  I want to speak for a few minutes about my last campaign. All of us \nin the Senate have all faced tough campaigns, but I think this election \nwas a little different because of the record amounts of money that were \nspent.\n  In 1994, my opponent spent nearly $30 million in his effort to defeat \nme. It wasn't simply the amount of money spent that made this race \nunpleasant, however. It was how the Money was spent.\n  This race was not a discussion of issues. Instead, money was spent on \nnegative ads that misrepresented votes I had taken and mislead voters \nabout my positions. This campaign was primarily about bringing a \ncandidate down, not promoting a view or even another candidate.\n  I wish I could say that this was a unique circumstance in which a \nwealthy individual used unlimited resources to mount this type of \ncampaign. Unfortunately, it has become all too common. Instead of \nwealthy candidates using their own money, political parties and outside \norganizations are raising millions of dollars in soft money \ncontributions. They are bankrolling attack ads designed solely to \ndefeat candidates.\n  Studies have clearly shown that as election day gets closer, ads \nbecome more candidates oriented and more negative. Instead of promoting \na position or an issue, these ads attempt to influence an election by \npainting a distorted view of a candidate.\n  The impact that this type of campaigning is having on the electorate \nas whole is of much greater consequence than the effect on any single \nrace. Voter disenchantment with the political process is at an \nunprecedented level. Negative campaigning may be designed to drive \ncandidates from office, but it is actually driving voters away from the \npolls.\n  Over the past several days, much has been said about the rise in soft \nmoney spending and its influence over our elections. The numbers are \nclear and unquestionably disturbing. Soft money spending doubled \nbetween 1992 and 1996 and it is projected to double again this cycle.\n  I believe the most distressing effect of soft money, however, has \nbeen the impact on the voters. Since the early 1990s, when soft money \nbegan to explode, voter turnout has significantly\n\n[[Page S12828]]\n\ndeclined. Between the presidential election years of 1992 and 1996, the \npercentage of eligible voters participating in elections fell 6 points \nfrom 55 to 49 percent.\n  Voting participation in midterm elections fell from 38.78 percent in \n1994 to 36.4 percent in 1998. There may be a number of reasons for this \ndecline, but I believe it is largely due to a growing distaste for the \npolitical process. The political dialogue has become dominated by \npersonal attacks and unsubstantiated charges and voters have chosen to \nnot participate.\n  I voted in favor of the Shays-Meehan legislation that the minority \nleader offered as an amendment. I believe it represents the most \ncomprehensive reform of the current system. This bill has already \npassed the House by a decisive, bipartisan margin and the Senate should \nhave followed suit.\n  I also supported the streamlined version of the McCain-Feingold bill. \nAs we know, this bill contains only the ban on soft money and permits \nunion members to prevent the use of their dues for political \nactivities.\n  I supported this bill, but I did so with some misgivings. One of the \nkey provisions that was dropped from the original legislation dealt \nwith issue advocacy. This is a loophole in the current campaign finance \nsystem that allow unions, corporations, and wealthy individuals to \ninfluence elections without being subject to disclosure or expenditure \nrestrictions.\n  I am very concerned that banning soft money without addressing issue \nadvocacy will simply redirect the flow of undisclosed money in \ncampaigns. Instead of giving soft money to political parties, \nindividuals, and organizations that want to influence elections will \ncreate their own ``independent'' attack ads.\n  One study now estimates that between $275 million and $340 million \nwill be spent on so-called issue advertisements during the last \nelection cycle. This amount of spending becomes a third campaign where \ncandidates can't respond because they don't know from where the attack \nis coming.\n  Despite the lack of issue advocacy, I voted in support of the soft \nmoney ban. While this may not entirely solve the problems in our \ncampaign finance system, at least it would move the debate forward. \nBanning soft money is an important and necessary step in a larger \neffort to reform the system.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate did not invoke cloture on either amendment \nand it now appears the bill will be removed from the floor and the \ndebate ended for the year.\n  This is the worst possible outcome. As a result of our actions today, \nthe influence of soft money will continue to grow, attack ads will \nsaturate the airwaves during each election, and voters will continue to \nlose interest in the process.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle not to take down \nthis bill. Let us go forward with the amendment process and give us an \nopportunity to pass this legislation. We owe it to the American public.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about \nthe proposed McCain-Feingold bill.\n  I have always maintained several guiding principles when considering \nproposals to change the way our campaigns are financed, the most \nimportant of which is the first amendment right of Americans to \nparticipate in the political process. I have heard from many \nconstituents who agree that Congress should focus its attention on \npreserving the first amendment, which has been the basis for active \ncitizen participation in our political process.\n  Recently, a constituent from Woodbury, Minnesota, wrote, ``The First \nAmendment to the Constitution must not be legislated into obscurity. \nMoney is only one of the many voices people use to express their views. \nYou must not remove the voice of the people in an attempt to remove \navarice and greed from the political process.''\n  By guaranteeing to citizens the right to speak freely and openly, the \nfirst amendment ensures, among other things, average Americans can \nparticipate in our political process through publicly disclosed \ncontributions to the campaigns of their choice. The first amendment \nalso allows Americans to freely draft letters to the editor, join \npolitical parties, and participate in rallies and get-out-the-vote \ndrives. I am proud of Minnesota's long history of active citizen \nparticipation in many of these activities during each election year.\n  Mr. President, before this debate concludes, the Senate will have \nconsidered many broad, sweeping proposals to amend the McCain-Feingold \nbill in an attempt to impose new restrictions upon our fundamental \nrights. However, rather than pass new campaign finance laws, we should \nencourage and protect citizen involvement in our political process \nthrough greater enforcement of our existing election laws, fair and \nfrequent disclosure of candidate campaign contributions, and a long-\noverdue increase in Federal contribution limits. I remain concerned \nabout any proposal that infringes upon the fundamental right of \ncitizens, candidates, groups, and political parties to have their \nvoices heard in the democratic process.\n  In my view, efforts to pass burdensome and restrictive campaign \nfinance proposals overlook the fundamental reason why the American \npeople have begun to lose faith in their government. The public's \nmistrust of their elected officials has not grown from a lack of laws, \nbut from the activities of those who break our existing laws. \nMinnesotans have contacted me to express their outrage over blatant \nviolations of our existing Federal election laws, and more \nspecifically, illegal and improper campaign activity that occurred \nduring the 1996 elections.\n  During the course of this debate, we should not forget that election \nlaws enacted 25 years ago to curb corruption in the political process \nhave been circumvented and repeatedly violated. This was made very \nclear to the American people throughout the extensive hearings \nconducted by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee during the last \nCongress, despite the fact that more than 45 witnesses either fled the \ncountry or refused to cooperate with the committee investigation.\n\n  Importantly, the investigation conducted by the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee has contributed to the investigative and \nprosecutorial efforts of the Justice Department's Campaign Task Force. \nAbove all else, the findings issued by the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee have proven that the current law works if we simply enforce \nthe laws on the books.\n  For these reasons, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment \noffered by Senators Thompson and Lieberman that would improve the \nenforcement of our existing election laws. Among its provisions, this \nproposal would authorize federal prosecutions of federal election laws \nif the offender commits the existing offense ``knowingly and \nwillingly'' and the offense involved more than $25,000. As my \ncolleagues know, current law only allows violations of election laws to \nbe prosecuted as misdemeanors.\n  Mr. President, the Thompson-Lieberman amendment also extends the \nstatute of limitations for criminal violations of the Federal Election \nCampaign Act from 3 years to 5 years--consistent with the statute of \nlimitations for most other federal crimes. It would direct the United \nStates Sentencing Commission to promulgate a sentencing guideline \nspecifically directed at campaign finance violations and consider \nissuing longer sentences for those whose convictions involve foreign \nmoney or large illegal contributions.\n  Most importantly, this amendment would make it clear that all foreign \nmoney is illegal by prohibiting soft money donations to candidates or \npolitical parties by foreign nationals. I know that all Americans were \noutraged by the improper role of foreign money contributions during the \n1996 presidential campaign. I commend Senators Thompson and Lieberman \nfor this meaningful proposal to improve our current enforcement \nstructure and ensure that violations of federal election laws do not \noccur during the 2000 campaign.\n  In addition to more timely enforcement of our existing election laws, \nI believe reasonable disclosure requirements provide the electorate \nwith more information, deter corruption or the appearance of corruption \nthrough increased exposure of contributions, and\n\n[[Page S12829]]\n\nhelp to determine violations of election laws. However, we should \nensure that disclosure requirements do not infringe upon the individual \nrights and privacy of donors or discourage citizen involvement in the \ndemocratic process. In fact, it was a former Minnesotan, Chief Justice \nWarren Burger, who emphasized the need for carefully drafted disclosure \nprovisions as part of his opinion in the case of Buckley versus Valeo.\n  In Buckley, Chief Justice Burger wrote,\n\n       Disclosure is, in principle, the salutary and \n     constitutional remedy for most of the ills Congress was \n     seeking to alleviate. * * * Disclosure is, however, subject \n     to First Amendment limitations which are to be defined by \n     looking at the various public interests. No legislative \n     public interest has been shown in forcing the disclosure of \n     modest contributions that are the prime support of new, \n     unpopular, or unfashionable political causes.\n\n  Mr. President, I commend Senators McCain and Feingold for their \ndecision to modify their proposal and reduce the level by which this \nlegislation would infringe upon the first amendment rights of \nAmericans. Unfortunately, the revised McCain-Feingold bill continues to \nplace new restrictions upon national political parties through a \nproposed ban on party soft money.\n  I do not believe that any limit or ban on party soft money would \nsurvive strict scrutiny by the Supreme Court. We should not pursue a \nsuspect expansion of government control of national parties, but rather \nrecognize that political parties enjoy the same rights as individuals \nto participate in the democratic process. This is a view consistent \nwith the Supreme Court decision in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign \nCommittee versus FEC, in which the Court found that Congress may not \nlimit independent expenditures by political parties.\n  In striking down limits on the ability of political party independent \nexpenditures, the Supreme Court wisely questioned any attempt to \ndemonstrate a compelling reason for government regulation upon the \nability of political parties to support state and local party \nparticipation in the political process when it declared:\n  ``We also recognize that FECA permits unregulated `soft money' \ncontributions to a party for certain activities, such as electing \ncandidates for state office * * * or for voter registration and `get \nout the vote' drives. * * * But the opportunity for corruption posed by \nthese greater opportunities for contributions, is, at best, \nattenuated.''\n  Mr. President, I believe we should strengthen, rather than diminish, \nthe role of political parties. In my view, some of my colleagues favor \na ban on party soft money because parties promote ``issue advocacy'' \ncommunications. These advocates fail to recognize that a political \nparty's ability to engage in these communications is fully protected by \nthe first amendment. In debating the merits of a proposed ban on party \nsoft money, we should heed the Supreme Court's wisdom in Buckley when \nit held that communications which do not expressly advocate the \nelection or defeat of a candidate using such words as ``vote for'' or \n``defeat'' cannot be regulated.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe there would be less reliance upon \nparty soft money if Congress would increase the current contribution \nlimits and encourage individuals and donors to become involved in \nentities that are already subject to regulations and disclosure, such \nas political action committees and national parties. In many ways, the \nprevalence of soft money in recent campaigns is a consequence of \ncontribution limits established in 1974 and upheld in Buckley.\n  I am very encouraged that the Supreme Court for the first time since \n1976 recently heard arguments regarding the constitutionality of \ncontribution limits. I believe both contributions and expenditures are \nentitled to protection as core political speech and have concerns with \nthe Supreme Court's decision in Buckley, which upheld limits on \ncontributions while striking down limits on expenditures. In my view, \nto leave these limits in place without any adjustment would be unfair \nand continue to threaten the individual rights of donors and \nindividuals. As Chief Justice Burger wrote in Buckley, ``Contributions \nand expenditures are the same side of the First Amendment coin.''\n  Mr. President, I am committed to protecting the rights of all \nAmericans to participate in the political process. However, we should \nnot use violations of existing law to restrict political speech and \nparticipation in the political process. Those who choose to offer their \nideas and talents in a manner that will help to strengthen our nation \nfor future generations must not be discouraged from doing so.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, in her most recent book, ``The \nCorruption of American Politics,'' the very skilled and veteran \nWashington reporter Elizabeth Drew writes that ``indisputably, the \ngreatest change in Washington over the past 25 years--in its culture, \nin the way it does business and the ever-burgeoning amount of business \ntransactions that go on here--has been in the preoccupation with money. \nIt has transformed politics and its has subverted values . . .''\n  This evaluation once was nursed by a few public interest groups and \nthen a group of congressional reformers. Now, it constitutes \nconventional wisdom. It is written in the books. It is fact. The \npolitical preoccupation with money has ``transformed us and subverted \nvalues.'' According to a Quinnipiac College poll published October 14, \n68 percent of those surveyed believe large campaign contributions \ninfluence the policies supported by elected officials and a June survey \nby the National Academy of Public Administration reported the number \none thing politicians could do to regain public trust is to curb large \ncampaign contributions. Despite these assessments from the people we \nserve, Congress remains incapable of changing how U.S. federal \ncampaigns are financed.\n  With the 2000 election cycle well underway, it is clear the worst \nhabits of the past two decades have become the springboard from which \nnew excesses will be launched. Candidates are awash in more money than \never before and party fund-raising records are being shattered again \nand again. At least two presidential primary candidates--George W. Bush \nand Steve Forbes--have decided to forego public matching funds in order \nto avoid the related limits on their campaign spending, while \ncandidates and third party groups are seeking ever more inventive ways \nto raise undisclosed and unlimited funds to communicate with voters and \ninfluence elections.\n  As a member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, I had hoped \nthe system had reached its nadir in the 1996 federal election campaign, \nwhich the committee investigated for most of 1997. I was too \noptimistic. Because of Congress' failure to enact campaign \nfinance reform, the system continues to fester and elections seem to be \nauctioned off to the highest bidders.\n\n  After it's over, the complete story of the 200 presidential race will \nbe told. Until then, the investigation conducted by the Governmental \nAffairs Committee provides the best portrait there is of how corrupt \nour elections have become and how obviously current practices violate \nthe clear intent of Congress in passing campaign finance laws. Our \ninvestigation revealed that in 1996, the major parties sabotaged some \nof the most fundamental values underpinning our American experiment in \nself-rule. They gave millions of Americans good reason to doubt whether \nthey had a true and equal voice in their own government.\n  What emerged from that investigation was the picture of a campaign \nfinance system gone haywire--a story replete with abuses ranging from \ninstitutionalized failures to two-bit hustlers--a story that should \nhave made any elected federal official ashamed and disgusted by the \ntaint that has diminished our representative democracy, that is to say, \nevery citizen's right to an equal voice in his or her government. The \ninvestigation forces us to ask whether we are no longer a nation where \none person's vote speaks louder than another person's money. Or have we \nreached a place where one person's money can drown out another person's \nvote?\n  For those who may have forgotten the unseemly details, let me remind \nyou of what our year-long investigation uncovered, because it's \nimportant to remember these things. We learned about a brazen man named \nRoger Tamraz, who contributed $300,000 in soft money to the Democratic \nParty for access to the White House in order\n\n[[Page S12830]]\n\nto try to override the NSC's rejection of his plan for a Caspian Sea \noil pipeline. Ultimately, he never gained the White House support he \nwas looking for but he did get to talk to the President of the United \nStates. Any lessons to be learned from his experience, we asked? Yes, \nhe responded. Next time he would contribute $600,000. After this \nremarkable comment, Tamraz admitted he had never even bothered to \nregister to vote because, in his words, his checkbook was worth ``a bit \nmore than a vote.''\n  We also learned about Johnny Chung, a California entrepreneur, who \nvisited the White House 49 times, had lots of pictures taken with the \nPresident, and once gave the First Lady's chief of staff a $50,000 \ncheck right there in the East Wing. He had a particularly jarring \nassessment of our government. ``I see the White House is like a \nsubway,'' he told the committee. ``You have to put in coins to open the \ngates.''\n  For those of you who may think these are just marginal opportunists \nwho slipped through the cracks of our system, let me remind you of the \nrevolving cast of top-dollar contributors who slept in the Lincoln \nbedroom and of the chairman of the Republican Party who sought a $2.1 \nmillion loan for a Republican think tank from a Hong Kong \nindustrialist, which was intentionally defaulted on 2 years later. The \nchairman said he had no idea this was a foreign contribution, even \nthough the industrialist had renounced his U.S. citizenship and the \nchairman obtained the loan while cruising Hong Kong Harbor on the \nindustrialist's luxury yacht.\n\n  These are colorful stories and among the most outrageous incidents \nuncovered by the committee. But the far more prevalent collection of \nbig soft money donations came not from the carnival hawkers but from \nmainstream corporate and union interests and individuals. In total, the \nparties raised $262 million in soft money during the 1996 campaigns--12 \ntimes the amount they raised in 1984. And that's chicken feed compared \nto the amount of soft money being raised for the 2000 campaign. Based \non the first 6 months of this year, both parties have doubled their \ntake over the same period in 1995.\n  To my friends who say these contributions are an expression of free \nand protected speech, I respectfully disagree. Free speech is abut the \ninalienable right to express our views without government interference. \nIt is about the vision the Framers of our Constitution enshrined--a \nvision that ensures that we will never compromise our American \nbirthright to offer opinions, even when those opinions are unpopular or \nrepugnant. But that is not at issue here, Mr. President. Absolutely \nnothing in this campaign finance bill will diminish or threaten any \nAmerican's right to express his or her views about candidates running \nfor office or about any other issue in American life.\n  What we would be threatening, is something entirely different, and \nthat is the ever increasing and disproportionate power that those with \nmoney have over our political system. Let's not fool ourselves--because \nthe American public isn't fooled. Much of the campaign money raised \ncomes from people seeking to maintain their access to, and perhaps sway \nover, particular parties or candidates. That explains why so many big \ngivers are so generous with both parties at the same time.\n  Everyone of us in this chamber knows intimately the cost of running \nfor office. It requires us to spend so much more time raising money \nthan we ever did in the past, so much more time that we find we have \nless time to do the things that led us to run for office in the first \nplace. Barely a day seems to go by in this town in which there is not \nan event or a meeting with elected officials attended only by those who \ncan afford sums of money that are beyond the capacity of the \noverwhelming majority of Americans to give. That, Mr. President, is \nthreatening the principle that I--and all of us, I dare say--hold just \nas dearly as the principle of free speech. It is the genius of our \nRepublic, the principle that promises one man, one vote, that every \nperson--rich or poor, man or woman, white or black, Christian or Jew, \nMuslim or Hindu--has an equal right and an equal ability to influence \nthe workings of their government.\n  I have always said the most serious transgressions of the 1996 \npresidential campaign were legal. Wealthy donors contributing hundreds \nof thousands of dollars in soft money blatantly skirted legal limits on \nindividual contributions. Unions and corporations donate millions to \nboth Republican and Democratic parties, despite decades-old \nprohibitions on union and corporate involvement in federal campaigns. \nAnd tax-exempt groups paid for millions of dollars worth of television \nads that clearly endorsed or attacked particular candidates even though \nthe groups were barred by law from engaging in such extensive partisan \nelectoral activity. Each of these acts compromised the integrity of our \nelections and our government. Each of these acts violated the spirit of \nour laws.\n  To achieve significant reform of the Federal Election Campaign Act, \nthe unrelenting pressure to raise vast sums of money simply must be \nreduced. A ban on soft money contributions is the necessary beginning \nto that process and the current McCain-Feingold proposal is the vehicle \nthrough which this goal can best be accomplished now. I believe the \nrecord created by the Governmental Affairs Committee's hearing in 1997 \nhelped that bill obtain the votes of a majority of the Senate in the \n105th Congress, but an anti-reform minority filibustered the bill and \nprevented it from passing. The House has twice approved the companion \nShays-Meehan proposal. A majority of Congress supports this bill. A \nlarge majority of the American public supports this bill. One day, if \nnot today, it will become law. By placing a limit on the amount of \nmoney raised for campaigns, we can restore a sense of integrity--and of \nsanity--to our campaign financing system and to our democracy.\n  If I could waive a magic wand, I would have Congress enact far \nbroader reforms than what is in the bill before us today. I would make \nsure that advertisements for candidates could no longer masquerade as \nso-called issue ads, thereby evading the disclosure requirements of our \ncampaign laws; I would make sure that no organization could claim the \nbenefit of tax-exemption and then work to influence the election or \ndefeat of particular candidates or parties. I would make sure that \ncandidates for the Presidency who receive public funds live up to the \noriginal intent of the law, that they remain above the fund-raising \nfray and abstain from raising any more money once they have accepted \npublic funds. I would like to see more exacting criminal law provisions \nbecome part of the campaign finance law. Indeed, I hope to offer and \nsupport amendments aimed at some of these problems as our debate on \nthis bill continues.\n  The truth is that we can never fully write into law what every \ncitizen has a right to expect from his or her representatives--that \nthose who seek to write the rules for the nation will respect them, \nrather than search high and low for ways to evade their requirements \nand eviscerate their intent; and that those who have sworn to abide by \nthe Constitution will honor the trust and responsibilities the \nConstitution places in their hands.\n  We can, however, reduce the feverish and incessant chase for money, \nthe chase that has pushed candidates and their parties to duck, dodge \nand ultimately debase the laws we have now. The pressure to raise ever \nexpanding sums of cash will continue to drive good people to do bad \nthings, almost regardless of what the law calls for, if we do not \nrecast the system to permanently defuse the fund-raising arms race and \nstem the corrosive influence of big money. That is the challenge ahead \nof us.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the first amendment does not permit \nregulation of contributions or expenditures for issue advocacy. The \nSupreme Court has allowed regulation of contributions and expenditures \nthat are (1) coordinated with a candidate--and thus a contribution--as \nwell as (2) those that can be used to expressly advocate the election \nor defeat of a candidate, including independent expenditures by \ncorporations and unions--but not independent expenditures of political \nparties. The Supreme Court has never allowed regulation of \ncontributions and expenditures for issue advocacy and other activities \nthat are (1) not coordinated with a candidate and (2) do not include \nexpress advocacy of the election or defeat of a candidate.\n  Buckley and its progeny prohibit regulation of issue ads and \ncontributions\n\n[[Page S12831]]\n\nand expenditures used to engage in issue advocacy. As originally \ndrafted, the Federal Election Campaign Act FECA would have required \ndisclosure of all contributions over $10 received by any organization \nwhich publicly referred to any candidate or any candidate's voting \nrecord, positions, or official acts of candidates who were federal \nofficeholders.\n  The D.C. Court of Appeals struck down this ``issue advocacy'' \nprovision in Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F.2d 821, 869-78 (D.C. Cir. 1975). \nThe invalidation of the issue advocacy disclosure provision was the \nonly part of the D.C. Circuit's decision that was not appealed to the \nSupreme Court. Back then supporters of regulation at least accepted the \nconstitutional impossibility of regulating issue advocacy.\n  In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 43 (1976), the Supreme Court \nexpanded upon the D.C. Circuit's view that issue advocacy could not be \nregulated and limited the scope of FECA's contribution limits and other \nregulations to cover only money used for ``communications that include \nexplicit words of advocacy of election or defeat of a candidate.'' This \nincludes money contributed to a candidate, his committee and the hard \nmoney account of his party.\n  The court stated that ``funds used to propagate * * * views on issues \nwithout expressly calling for a candidate's election or defeat are * * \n* not covered by FECA.''\n  And such funds cannot be covered by any bill Congress adopts because \nthe Supreme Court said in Buckley that its narrow construction of the \nFederal Election Campaign Act (FECA), limiting its scope to money that \ncan be used for ``express advocacy,'' was necessary to avoid \n``constitutional deficiencies.''\n  In sum, the Buckley Court looked at Congress' effort to cover ``all \nspending'' intended to ``influence'' elections and said we cannot \nregulate beyond the realm of express advocacy. Buckley held that:\n\n       So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in \n     express term advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they \n     want to promote the candidate and his views.\n\n  As one former FEC chairman, Trevor Potter, has written, Buckley.\n\n       Clearly meant that much political speech Congress had \n     intended to be regulated and disclosed without instead be \n     beyond the reach of campaign finance laws.\n\n  The outer bounds of constitutionally permissible regulation of \npolitical activity. The farthest the Supreme Court has ever gone in \npermitting constraints on political speech was its decision in Austin \nv. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990).\n  In this case the Court upheld prohibitions on independent \nexpenditures--non-coordinated ads that expressly advocate the election \nor defeat of a candidate--paid for directly from corporate treasuries.\n  There is no basis for construing this case as justifying restrictions \nor prohibitions on contributions or expenditures that are not express \nadvocacy.\n  In fact, any argument that Austin provides a basis for contribution \nor expenditure limits on funds that do not go to a candidate and are \nnot otherwise used for express advocacy is foreclosed by the Supreme \nCourt's decision in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. \n765 (1978).\n  In Bellotti the Court ruled that a Massachusetts statute prohibiting \n``corporations from making contributions or expenditures for the \npurpose of . . . influencing or affecting the vote on any question \nsubmitted to the voters'' was unconstitutional because it infringed the \nfirst amendment right of the corporations to engage in issue advocacy \nand, more importantly, the wider first amendment right ``of public \naccess to discussion, debate, and the dissemination of information and \nideas.''\n  The case made clear the distinction between portions of the \nchallenged law ``prohibiting or limiting corporate contributions to \npolitical candidates or committees, or other means of influencing \ncandidate elections'' (which were not challenged) and provisions \n``prohibiting contributions and expenditures for the purpose of \ninfluencing . . . issue advocacy.\n  The Court explained that the concern that justified former ``was the \nproblem of corruption of elected representatives through creation of \npolitical debts'' and that the latter (issue ads) ``presents no \ncomparable problem'' since it involved contributions and expenditures \nthat would be used for issue advocacy rather than communications that \nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.\n  Bellotti conclusively rejected prohibitions on contributions and \nexpenditures for issue advocacy, while expressly leaving open the \npossibility that the government ``might well be able to demonstrate the \nexistence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent \nexpenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.''\n  And Austin merely confirmed that the state government could regulate \nor even prohibit independent expenditures by corporations, which are \nused to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. But \nAustin has nothing to do with contributions and expenditures for \ncommunications discussing issues.\n  The reformers are fond of the Supreme Court's statements in Austin \nconcerning the corrupting influence of aggregated wealth. But this \ndicta does not support regulation of party soft money. And arguments \npredicated on it do not withstand scrutiny.\n  This clear from the fact that after Austin the Supreme Court stated \nin the 1996 Colorado Republican Committee case that ``where there is no \nrisk of ``corruption'' of a candidate, the government may not limit \neven contributions.''\n  Moreoever, the Court has explained that the prohibitions on \ncorporations and unions making contributions or independent \nexpenditures that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a \ncandidate are permissible to the extent that they ``prohibit the use of \nunion or corporate funds for active electioneering on behalf of a \ncandidate in a federal election'' the Court does not consider \ncontributions and expenditures used for issue advocacy and purposes \nother than expressly advocating the election or defeat of a federal \ncandidate to involve such risks because it has held that the government \ncannot prohibit ``corporations any more than individuals from making \ncontributions or expenditures advocating views,'' that is a quote from \nCitizens Against Rent Control, 454 U.S. 290, 297-98 (1981).\n  Moreover, the Court has explained that ``Groups [such as political \nparties] . . . formed to disseminate political ideas, not to amass \ncapital'' do not raise the specter of distortion of the political \nprocess necessitating regulations on the use of the treasury funds of \nunions and for profit corporations because the resources of groups such \nas political parties and other issue groups ``are not a function of \n[their] success in the economic marketplace but popularity in the \npolitical marketplace.''\n  Restrictions on issue advocacy, including contributions for it are \nalways invalidated by the Supreme Court. Consistent with this narrow \ndefinition of the legislative power to intrude into this most protected \narea of free speech, the Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional \nthe most rudimentary state and local restrictions on individuals, \npolitical committees and corporations when it involved regulation of \nissue advocacy and the funds that pay for it, as opposed to \ncontributions or expenditures for express advocacy.\n  See McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 356 (1995), \ninvalidating requirement that issue-oriented pamphlets identify the \nauthor;\n  Citizens Against Rent Control v. City of Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 197 \n(1981), invalidating city ordinance limiting contributions to \ncommittees formed to engage in issue advocacy.\n  First National Bank v. Belotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978), invalidating law \nbanning corporate contributions and expenditures for issue advocacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12831-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12831-S12832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PROGRESS ON EAST TIMOR\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Through intimidation \ntactics, they have undermined the efforts of international humanitarian \nagencies to provide assistance and to facilitate repatriation.\n  Many of us have been alarmed by persistent reports that the \nIndonesian military has continued to aid and abet the militias. On \nOctober 11, the commander of the international peace\nkeeping force in East Timor demanded a formal explanation from the \nIndonesian government as to whether any Indonesian soldiers or police \nofficers were involved in a militia attack against the international \npeacekeepers on October 10. Officials from the peacekeeping force said \nthat uniformed soldiers and police officers had escorted the militias \nand did nothing as militia members opened fire on the peacekeepers. I \nurge the Indonesian military and security forces to sever all links \nwith the militias.\n  I welcome the establishment by the United Nations Human Rights \nCommission of a commission of inquiry to investigate the atrocities \nthat occurred in East Timor following President Habibie's decision to \nhold the referendum on East Timor's status. The Indonesian government \nmust end collaboration with the militias if this investigation of the \natrocities is to be credible.\n  In the coming weeks, the United States should do all it can to see \nthat the transition to independence is accomplished peacefully and that \nthose responsible for atrocities are brought to justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12832-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nHATE CRIMES PREVENTION ACT IN THE COMMERCE JUSTICE STATE APPROPRIATIONS \n                                  BILL\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to express to the conferees of \nCommerce Justice State Appropriations the importance of keeping the \nHate Crimes Prevention Act in the spending bill.\n  I am a cosponsor of this legislation that expands the federal \ncriminal civil rights statute on hate crime by removing unnecessary \nobstacles to federal prosecution and by providing authority for federal \ninvolvement in crimes directed at individuals because of their race, \ncolor, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation or \ndisability.\n  In particular, prejudice against people with disabilities takes many \nforms. Such bias often results in discriminatory actions in employment, \nhousing, and public accommodations. Laws like the Fair Housing \nAmendments Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the \nRehabilitation Act are designed to protect people with disabilities \nfrom such prejudice\n  But disability bias also manifests itself in the form of violence--\nand it is imperative that the federal government send a message that \nthese expressions of hatred are not acceptable in our society.\n  For example, a man with mental disabilities from New Jersey was \nkidnaped by a group of nine men and women and was tortured for three \nhours, then dumped somewhere with a pillowcase over his head. While \ncaptive, he was taped to a chair, his head was shaved, his clothing was \ncut to shreds, and he was punched, whipped with a string of beads, \nbeaten with a toilet brush, and, possibly, sexually assaulted. \nProsecutors believe the attack was motivated by disability bias.\n  In the state of Maine, a married couple both living openly with AIDS, \nstruggling to raise their children. Their youngest daughter was also \ninfected with HIV. The family had broken their silence to participate \nin HIV/AIDS education programs that would inform their community about \nthe tragic reality of HIV infection in their family. As a result of the \npublicity, the windows of their home were shot out and the husband was \nforcibly removed from his car at a traffic light and severely beaten.\n  Twenty-one states and the District of Columbia have included people \nwith disabilities as a protected class under their hate crimes \nstatutes. However, state protection is neither uniform nor \ncomprehensive. The federal government must send the message that hate \ncrimes committed on the basis of disability are as intolerable as those \ncommitted because of a person's race, national origin, or religion. \nAnd, federal resources and comprehensive coverage would give this \nmessage meaning and substance. Thus, it is critical that people with \ndisabilities share in the protection of the federal hate crimes \nstatute.\n  Senator Kennedy's Hate Crimes bill has the endorsement of the \nAdministration and over 80 leading civil rights and law enforcement \norganizations. It is a constructive and sensible response to a serious \nproblem that continues to plague our nation--violence motivated by \nprejudice. It deserves full support, and I am hopeful that it is \nincluded in the final version that the President signs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12832-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2000\n\n\n                         Port McKenzie Project\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

A bill to amend chapter 87 of title 28, United States Code, \nto authorize a judge to whom a case is transferred to retain \njurisdiction over certain multidistrict litigation cases for trial; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 multidistrict jurisdiction act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill entitled the \n``Multidistrict Jurisdiction Act of 1999.'' This bill would restore a \n30-year-old practice under which a single court, to which several \nactions with common issues of fact were transferred for pre-trial \nproceedings, could retain the multidistrict actions for trial.\n  This bill is necessary to correct a statutory deficiency pointed out \nby the Supreme Court in Lexecon v. Milbert Weiss Bershad Hynes & \nLerach, 523 U.S. 26 (1997). It is an important bill for judicial \nefficiency and for encouraging settlements of multidistrict cases. And \nI am pleased that the Judicial Conference and the Multidistrict \nLitigation Panel support this bill. Moreover, I am pleased that this is \na bipartisan bill with Senators Leahy, Grassley, Torricelli, Kohl, and \nSchumer as cosponsors.\n  Section 1407(a) of title 28, United States Code, authorizes the \nMultidistrict Litigation Panel to transfer civil actions with common \nquestions of fact ``to any district for coordinated or consolidated \npretrial proceedings.'' It also requires the Panel, on or before the \nconclusion of such pretrial proceedings, to remand any such actions to \nthe district courts in which they were filed. However, for the 30 years \nprior to the Lexecon decision, federal courts followed the practice of \nallowing the single transferee court, upon the conclusion of pretrial \nproceedings, to transfer all of the actions to itself under the general \nvenue provisions contained in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404. This had the \npractical advantage of allowing the single transferee court to retain \nfor trial the multiple actions for which it had conducted pretrial \nproceedings. This greatly enhanced judicial efficiency and encouraged \nsettlements.\n  In Lexecon, however, the Supreme Court held that the literal terms of \n28 U.S.C. Sec. 1407 did not allow the single transferee court to retain \nthe multidistrict actions after concluding pretrial proceedings. \nInstead, the Court held, the plain terms of Sec. 1407 required the \nPanel to remand the actions back to the multiple federal district \ncourts in which the actions originated. The Court noted that to keep \nthe practice of allowing the single transferee court to retain the \nactions after conducting the pretrial proceedings, Congress would have \nto change the statute.\n  The bill would amend 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1407 to restore the traditional \npractice of allowing the single transferee court to retain the multiple \nactions for trial after conducting pretrial proceedings. The bill also \nincludes a provision under which the single transferee court would \ntransfer the multiple actions back to the federal district courts from \nwhich they came for a determination of compensatory damages if the \ninterests of justice and the convenience of the parties so require.\n  Mr. President, this bill is very similar to the first portion of a \nH.R. 2112 that passed the House of Representatives under the effective \nleadership of Congressman Sensenbrenner. H.R. 2112 includes both the \n``Lexecon fix'' and a provision to streamline catastrophe litigation. I \nbelieve that both provisions would make good law. However, the Lexecon \nmatter constitutes an emergency for the Multidistrict Litigation Panel, \nwhich has a large number of these cases poised for remand if the \nretention practice is not restored. The catastrophe legislation would \nconstitute an important improvement, but is not an emergency matter. \nGiven this situation, I propose that we pass only the ``Lexecon fix'' \nduring this session by unanimous consent and work to pass the \ncatastrophe legislation during the second session.\n  Senators Leahy, Grassley, Torricelli, Kohl, Schumer, and I look \nforward to passing the Multidistrict Jurisdiction Act of 1999 very \nquickly. The Judiciary awaits our prompt action.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1748\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Multidistrict Jurisdiction \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION.\n\n       Section 1407 of title 28, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in the third sentence of subsection (a), by inserting \n     ``or ordered transferred to the transferee or other district \n     under subsection (i)'' after ``terminated''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(i)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), any action transferred \n     under this section by the panel may be transferred, for trial \n     purposes, by the\n\n[[Page S12836]]\n\n     judge or judges of the transferee district to whom the action \n     was assigned to the transferee or other district in the \n     interest of justice and for the convenience of the parties \n     and witnesses.\n       ``(2) Any action transferred for trial purposes under \n     paragraph (1) shall be remanded by the panel for the \n     determination of compensatory damages to the district court \n     from which it was transferred, unless the court to which the \n     action has been transferred for trial purposes also finds, \n     for the convenience of the parties and witnesses and in the \n     interests of justice, that the action should be retained for \n     the determination of compensatory damages.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply to any civil \n     action pending on or brought on or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the distinguished \nChairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Grassley, Senator \nTorricelli, Senator Kohl, and Senator Schumer in introducing the Multi-\nDistrict Jurisdiction Act of 1999. Our bipartisan legislation is needed \nby Federal judges across the country to restore their power to promote \nthe fair and efficient administration of justice in multi-district \nlitigation.\n  Current law authorizes the Judicial Panel on Multi-District \nLitigation to transfer related cases, pending in multiple Federal \njudicial districts, to a single district for coordinated or \nconsolidated pretrial proceedings. This makes good sense because \ntransfers by the Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation are based \non centralizing those cases to serve the convenience of the parties and \nwitnesses and to promote efficient judicial management.\n  For nearly 30 years, many transferee judges, following circuit and \ndistrict court case law, retained these multi-district cases for trial \nbecause the transferee judge and the parties were already familiar with \neach other and the facts of the case through the pretrial proceedings. \nThe Supreme Court in Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & \nLerach, 523 U.S. 26 (1998), however, found that this well-established \npractice was not authorized by the general venue provisions in the \nUnited States Code. Following the Lexecon ruling, the Judicial Panel on \nMulti-District Litigation must now remand each transferred case to its \noriginal district at the conclusion of the pretrial proceedings, unless \nthe case is already settled or otherwise terminated. This new process \nis costly, inefficient and time consuming.\n  The Multi-District Jurisdiction Act of 1999 seeks to restore the \npower of transferee judges to resolve multi-district cases as \nexpeditiously and fairly as possible. Our bipartisan bill amends \nsection 1407 of title 28 of the United States Code to allow a \ntransferee judge to retain cases for trial or transfer those cases to \nanother judicial district for trial in the interests of justice and for \nthe convenience of parties and witnesses. The legislation provides \ntransferee judges the flexibility they need to administer justice \nquickly and efficiently. Indeed, our legislation is supported by the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the Judicial Conference of \nthe United States and the Department of Justice.\n  In addition, we have included a section in our bill to ensure \nfairness during the determination of compensatory damages by adding the \npresumption that the case will be remanded to the transferor court for \nthis phase of the trial. Specifically, this provision provides that to \nthe extent a case is tried outside of the transferor forum, it would be \nsolely for the purpose of a consolidated trial on liability, and if \nappropriate, punitive damages, and that the case must be remanded to \nthe transferor court for the purposes of trial on compensatory damages, \nunless the court to which the action has been transferred for trial \npurposes also finds, for the convenience of the parties and witnesses \nand in the interests of justice, that the action should be retained for \nthe determination of compensatory damages. This section is identical to \na bipartisan amendment proposed by Representative Berman and accepted \nby the House Judiciary Committee during its consideration of similar \nlegislation earlier this year.\n  Multi-district litigation generally involves some of the most complex \nfact-specific cases, which affect the lives of citizens across the \nnation. For example, multi-district litigation entails such national \nlegal matters as asbestos, silicone gel breast implants, diet drugs \nlike fen-phen, hemophiliac blood products, Norplant contraceptives and \nall major airplane crashes. In fact, as of February 1999, approximately \n140 transferee judges were supervising about 160 groups of multi-\ndistrict cases, with each group composed of hundreds, or even \nthousands, of cases in various stages of trial development.\n  But the efficient case management of these multi-district cases is a \nrisk after the Lexecon ruling. Judge John F. Nangle, Chairman of the \nJudicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation, recently testified before \nCongress that: ``Since Lexecon, significant problems have arisen that \nhave hindered the sensible conduct of multi-district litigation. \nTransferee judges throughout the United States have voiced their \nconcern to me about the urgent need to enact this legislation.''\n  Mr. President, Congress should listen to the concerned voices of our \nFederal Judiciary and swiftly approve the Multi-District Jurisdiction \nAct of 1999 to improve judicial efficiency in our Federal courts.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the Multidistrict Jurisdiction Act of 1999. This \nlegislation would make a technical fix to section 1407 of Title 28, the \nmultidistrict litigation statute, in response to the recent Supreme \nCourt decision in Lexecon v. Milberg Weiss.\n  Section 1407(a) of Title 28 authorizes the Judicial Panel on Multi-\nDistrict Litigation to transfer civil actions with common issues of \nfact to any district for coordinated or consolidated pretrial \nproceedings, but requires the Panel to remand any such action to the \noriginal district at or before the conclusion of such pretrial \nproceedings. Until the Lexecon decision, the federal courts followed \nthe practice of allowing a transferee court to invoke the venue \ntransfer provision and transfer a case to itself for trial purposes. \nHowever, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed this practice, holding that \nthe literal terms of section 1407 do not give a district court \nconducting pretrial proceedings the authority to assign a transferred \ncase to itself for trial.\n  This legislation would amend section 1407 of Title 28 to permit a \njudge with a transferred case to retain jurisdiction over multidistrict \nlitigation cases for trial. This change was approved by the Judicial \nConference and is supported by the Judicial Panel on Multi-District \nLitigation. The legislation also includes a provision under which a \ntransferee court would transfer actions back to the federal district \ncourts from which they came for a determination of compensatory damages \nif the interests of justice and the convenience of the parties so \nrequire.\n  The Multidistrict Jurisdiction Act of 1999 will promote the efficient \nadministration of justice by allowing the federal courts to continue an \neffective practice they have been using for almost thirty years. It \nmakes sense to allow the transferee judge who has conducted the \npretrial proceedings and is familiar with the facts and parties of the \ntransferred case to retain that case for trial. This significantly \nbenefits the parties to a case, and reduces wasteful use of judicial \nand litigants' resources. I am glad to support this legislation, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it as well.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Hatch, Leahy, \nGrassley, Torricelli, and Schumer in introducing the Multidistrict \nJurisdiction Act of 1999. Our bipartisan measure will help give back to \nFederal judges the authority they need to handle multiple, overlapping \ncases as efficiently and effectively as possible.\n  This legislation essentially overturns the Supreme Court's decision \nin Lexecon Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26 \n(1998). In that case, the Supreme Court rejected 30 years of practice \nduring which trial courts overseeing related cases for consolidated \npretrial proceedings had been permitted to retain jurisdiction of those \ncases for trial. That long-standing routine made plain common sense, \nbecause oversight by one court (instead of dozens of courts) is often \nthe best use of resources, regardless of whether the parties are still \nin discovery or already at trial. Indeed, a consolidated trial may not \nonly be more convenient for the parties and the witnesses, but it also \npromotes justice by keeping the case before a judge who is already \nfamiliar with the underlying facts.\n\n[[Page S12837]]\n\n  Let me just point out that I do not mean to criticize the Supreme \nCourt's decision as a matter of law. It may well be that the original \nMultidistrict Litigation statute was too narrowly drafted, and \nultimately it is the responsibility of Congress to write--or, in this \ncase, rewrite--the law to make sure it says what Congress intends.\n  While this measure is an important step forward, we must recognize \nthat it is just that--a step. There is much more we can do to promote \nefficiency and fairness in litigation for both victims and defendants. \nIn fact, the proposal to overturn Lexecon was first raised publicly at \na hearing on class action reform in the House early last year, as just \none of several proposals that would help ensure the fair administration \nof justice. Ironically, while this measure appears to be on the fast \ntrack, we continue to delay consideration of the other more pressing \nclass action measures that were the focus of that hearing. And, while \nconsolidation could be particularly valuable in the class action \ncontext, without class action reforms this bill actually won't affect \nmost class actions. The reason is simple: while this bill only applies \nto cases filed in Federal court, most class actions--even ones that are \nnationwide in scope and shape nationwide policies--end up in State \ncourt.\n  Indeed, increased consolidation would help eliminate one of the most \nsignificant class action abuses--that is, the dangerous ``race to \nsettlement'' among competing cases. Currently, overlapping class \nactions involving the same parties and the same claims put rival class \nlawyers in competition to get the first--and only--settlement \navailable. The result is all too common: one lawyer lines his pockets \nwith huge fees by taking a quickie settlement, while the class gets the \nshort end of the stick. For example, in one instance involving \noverlapping Federal and State actions, the class lawyers who brought \nthe State case negotiated a small settlement precluding all other \nsuits, and even agreed to settle federal claims that were not at issue \nin State court. Meanwhile, the Federal court was outraged, finding that \nthe Federal claims could have been worth more than $1 billion, while \naccusing the State class lawyers of ``hostile representation'' that \n``surpassed inadequacy and sank to the level of subversion'' and of \nhaving ``more in line with the interests of [defendants] than those of \ntheir clients.''\n\n  This danger was recently underscored by the Judicial Conference's \nAdvisory Committee on Civil Rules Report on Mass Tort Litigation, which \nfound that ``[T]he risk is considerable that speedy justice may be \nconverted into speedy injustice . . . if two or more courts enter a \nrace to be first to achieve a disposition binding on all courts.'' The \nreport added that, ``This risk is aggravated by the `reverse auction' \nscenario . . . , in which a defendant may play would-be class \nrepresentatives off against each other, bidding down the terms of \nsettlement to the lowest level that can win approval by the most \ncomplaisant available court.'' This race to settlement, or ``reverse \nauction,'' shortchanges legitimate victims, while allowing blameworthy \ndefendants to get off easy.\n  Mr. President, we can prevent abuses like this--and encourage \nefficiency--simply by permitting more overlapping nationwide class \nactions to be brought into Federal court, the only place where the \nconsolidation procedure is available. Once the cases are consolidated, \nlead counsel will be appointed, making it impossible to shop around \nlow-priced settlements and to pit competing class lawyers against each \nother. However, as long as these class actions can be kept in various \nState courts, this bill won't succeed in bringing consolidation to the \ncomplex cases that need it most.\n  That's one of the principal reasons why Senator Grassley and I \nintroduced the Class Action Fairness Act of 1999 (S. 353) earlier this \nyear. Our proposal, which among other provisions allows more nationwide \nclass actions to be removed to Federal court, would--in conjunction \nwith the bill we are introducing today--help eliminate the race to \nsettlement in most class actions, save court resources and promote \nefficiency by placing related class actions before one court. A similar \nmeasure has already passed the House, and we look forward to moving \nthis measure ahead in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues today in offering our \nproposal to return to Federal courts the authority they need to \nconsider multiple, overlapping cases in a fair, expeditious and just \nmanner. This is a necessary step in the direction of real reform, and I \nhope it will build momentum for more comprehensive reform, like the \nGrassley/Kohl Class Action Fairness Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 1749. A bill to require the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to \nissue revised regulations relating to dietary supplement labeling, to \namend the Federal Trade Commission Act to provide that certain types of \nadvertisements for dietary supplements are proper, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n      dietary supplement fairness in labeling and advertising act\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the \nDietary Supplement Fairness in Labeling and Advertising Act. The \npurpose of the legislation is to reaffirm Congress' intent in enacting \nthe Dietary Supplement Health Education Act (DSHEA). In enacting DSHEA, \nCongress intended to insure that all Americans had access to factual \ninformation about vitamins and other dietary supplements so that they \ncan make informed decisions about their health and well-being.\n  In recent years, the prevalence of scientific data demonstrating the \nbenefits of proper nutrition, education, and appropriate use of dietary \nsupplements to promote long-term health has increased tremendously. \nAdditionally, preventative practices, including the safe consumption of \ndietary supplements, has been shown to significantly reduce the health-\ncare expenditures in this country. That is why I continue to support \nresearch efforts that focus on preventative care. The role government \nfunding can have in achieving scientific and medical gains in crucial. \nPast successes have frequently led to rapid technological advancements \nin medicine, biotechnology, and other important areas that shape our \nlives.\n  Over 100 million people use dietary supplements daily throughout the \nUnited States. This bill that I am introducing would allow access by \nthe public to solid scientific research about the safe and proper use \nof dietary supplements. It prevents the Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) from promulgating rules that change the intent of congressional \nregulations regarding structure and function claims and would amend the \nFederal Trade Commission Act to provide that certain types of \nadvertisements for dietary supplements are proper.\n  DSHEA required the FDA to promulgate reasonable guidelines to \nregulate the content of dietary supplements labels. The goal of this \nrequirement is to insure that the labels give consumers information \nnecessary for them to decide whether they want to take a particular \nsupplement, without making claims regarding medical or disease benefits \n(which are reserved for FDA-approved drugs).\n  The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) currently enforces a standard for \nadvertising that conflicts with the intent of DSHEA. The FTC does not \nalways allow the same information in advertising of dietary supplements \nthat is allowed in labeling of the same products. For instance, the FTC \nhas made it difficult to advertise the benefits of calcium, vitamin C, \nand other common and heavily studied supplements.\n  The information that the FDA allows as part of the labeling of a \ndietary supplement should also be allowed in advertising that same \nsupplement, yet the FTC is seeking to regulate the advertising of \ndietary supplements by denying to consumers some of the very \ninformation that DSHEA required the FDA to let them use. This forces \nmanufacturers to work under two sets of contradictory regulations and \nundermines the intent of Congress.\n  Additionally, this bill would instruct the FDA to withdraw the notice \nof proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register of April 29, \n1998, which attempts to regulate the types of statements made \nconcerning the effects of dietary supplements on the structure or \nfunction of the body. The FDA is asserting responsibilities beyond \ncongressional intent. Specifically, it is\n\n[[Page S12838]]\n\nseeking to change the definition of ``disease'' by deeming improper any \nclaim that refers to the ``prevention or treatment of abnormal \nfunctions.'' In these cases, the product would be subject to regulation \nas a drug, rather than a dietary supplement. Furthermore, it was never \nCongress' intent to disallow the use of citations from credible \nscientific publications in providing accurate information in labeling \nof dietary supplements. Numerous, common sense examples can be made to \ndemonstrate the irresponsible nature of this rule. Aging and pregnancy \nwould now be considered diseases under the policy.\n  In passing this legislation, my hope is to continue to open up \ncommunication and provide access to fair and adequate reviews of all \nclaims. This bill prescribes a method by which the Commission must act \nprior to filing a complaint that initiates any administrative or \njudicial proceeding alleging noncompliance by an advertiser. Simply, \nthe FTC would be required to provide a full and fair opportunity for \nadvertisers to consult with the Commission's scientific experts. \nDecisions about the use of dietary supplements should not be made by \nbureaucrats. Instead, meetings with scientific experts would provide \nfor an open exchange of ideas and information, and ensure that \ndecisions are based on concrete, substantial scientific evidence. This \nis good government practice, and during a time where our society has \nbecome far too litigious, I support strengthening the review process, \nprior to filing any claims or complaints.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Dietary Supplement Fairness in \nLabeling and Advertising Act. It would insure that all Americans have \naccess to factual information about vitamins and other dietary \nsupplements so they can make informed decisions about their health and \nwell-being, while continuing to provide adequate safeguards to protect \nthe public good.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 1750. A bill to reduce the incidence of child abuse and neglect, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION AND ENFORCEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child \nAbuse Prevention and Enforcement Act (CAPE). This legislation would \nprovide a much-needed increase in funding for the investigation of \nchild abuse crimes, as well as prevention programs designed to prevent \nchild abuse. This bill is similar to the legislation introduced by my \nOhio colleague in the House of Representatives, Deborah Pryce, which \nrecently passed overwhelmingly in the House.\n  As a former Greene County, Ohio, prosecutor, and--more importantly--- \nas a parent, nothing disturbs me more than reports of child abuse and \nneglect. As a prosecutor, I saw--- first-hand--too many examples of \nchild victimization and abuse. These days, it seems like you can't turn \non the local news without hearing about another unforgivable act of \nviolence against a child. Some of these stories have become infamous. \nYet, sadly, most stories of child abuse are quickly forgotten. Such \nstories have become so common, it seems that our collective conscience \nis seldom even affected any more.\n  The sheer numbers of abusive acts committed against our children are \nastounding. In my State of Ohio, one incident of child abuse or neglect \nis reported to authorities every three minutes! What's worse is that \nthese reports of abuse are on the rise. In a study of child abuse, the \nFederal government found that the number of abused and neglected \nchildren in this country nearly doubled between 1986 and 1993. As a \nresult, child protective service agencies across the country are facing \nmore than a million cases of abused and neglected children each year.\n  The Federal government can take meaningful steps--starting now--to \nhelp fight child abuse. The Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act \nwould be one meaningful step. Through the use of advanced technology, \nthis legislation would enhance the ability of law enforcement systems \nto exchange timely and accurate criminal history information with \nagencies involved in child welfare, child abuse, and adoption services.\n  Every day, State and local child welfare services attempt to ensure \nthat children are cared for properly and living with loving families. \nIt is their job to prevent at-risk children from being left under the \nsame roof with domestic or child abusers. Often, when child welfare \nagencies conduct child safety assessments, criminal histories and civil \nprotection order information are not always readily available. These \nagencies may not be getting the full story. The result, in some cases, \nis that an abused or neglected child is removed from one harmful \nenvironment only to be placed in another. To improve access to critical \nlaw enforcement information, the bill I am introducing today would \namend the Crime Identification and Technology Act (CITA), which I \nsponsored last year, to allow State and local governments to use CITA \ngrant dollars to enable the criminal justice system to provide criminal \nhistory information to child protection and welfare agencies.\n\n  Our bill also would allow the use of funds from the $550 million \nByrne grant program for activities aimed at cracking down on and \npreventing child abuse and neglect. Since 1986, Byrne grant dollars \nhave been used successfully to provide financial assistance to State \nand local governments to coordinate government efforts to fight crime \nand drug abuse. With our bill, State and local agencies could use Byrne \ngrant dollars to train child welfare investigators and child protection \nworkers. The funding also could help build and develop child advocacy \ncenters and hospitals for the abused. These are just a few of many \npossible uses.\n  Mr. President, our bill would go even one step further to direct \nresources to fight against child abuse. It would double the amount of \nfunds available to States and localities to assist the victims of \ncrimes against children. Currently, $10 million of the Federal Crime \nVictims $383 million fund are earmarked for child abuse and domestic \nassistance programs. This fund is financed not by taxpayer dollars, but \nthrough criminal fines, penalties and forfeitures. While the fund has \ngrown since its beginning in 1984, the amount reserved for assistance \nto victims of abuse has remained stagnant. Our bill would earmark $20 \nmillion to help public and nonprofit agencies provide necessary \nservices like rescue shelters, 24-hour abuse hotlines, and counseling \nto victims of child abuse.\n  Mr. President, this is one piece of legislation that can and should \npass the Senate quickly. As I noted earlier, a similar bill was \noverwhelmingly approved by the House by a vote of 425-2. More than 50 \nchild protection organizations have endorsed this legislation, \nincluding the National Child Abuse Coalition; the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children; Fight Crime: Invest in Kids; the Family \nResearch Council and the Christian Coalition; the American Professional \nSociety of the Abuse of Children; and Prevent Child Abuse America.\n  I urge my colleagues here in the Senate to demonstrate their \ncommitment to America's abused and neglected children by supporting \nthis legislation. Let's show some compassion and support our States and \nlocal communities in the fight against child abuse.\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the senior \nSenator from Ohio in introducing the Child Abuse Prevention and \nEnforcement Act. Our bipartisan legislation builds on the successful \npassage into law of the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998, \nwhich Senator DeWine and I sponsored in the last Congress. Our bill \nalso complements S. 249, the Missing, Exploited and Runaway Children \nProtection Act, which Senator Hatch and I worked together to steer to \nfinal passage just last month.\n  Unfortunately, the number of abused or neglected children in this \ncountry nearly doubled between 1986 and 1993. Each day there are 9,000 \nreports of child abuse in America and more than three million cases \nannually of abused or neglected children. In my home state of Vermont, \n2,309 children were reported to child protective services for child \nabuse or neglect investigations in 1997, the last year data is \navailable. After investigation, 1,041 of these reports found \nsubstantiated cases of child maltreatment in Vermont.\n  Each child behind these statistics is an American tragedy.\n\n[[Page S12839]]\n\n  But we can help. The Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act \nprovides these abused or neglected children with the Federal assistance \nthat they deserve. And our legislation can make a real difference in \nthe lives of our nation's children without any additional cost to \ntaxpayers.\n  Our bipartisan legislation will make a difference by giving State and \nlocal officials the flexibility to use existing Department of Justice \ngrant programs to prevent child abuse and neglect, investigate child \nabuse and neglect crimes and protect children who have suffered from \nabuse and neglect. The bill does this by making three changes to \ncurrent law.\n  First, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act amends the \nCrime Identification Technology Act of 1998 to make grant dollars \navailable specifically to enhance the capability of criminal history \ninformation to agencies and workers for child welfare, child abuse and \nadoption purposes. Congress has authorized $250 million annually for \ngrants under the Crime Identification Technology Act.\n  Second, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act amends the \nByrne Grant Program to permit funds to be used for enforcing child \nabuse and neglect laws, including laws protecting against child sexual \nabuse, and promoting programs designed to prevent child abuse and \nneglect. Congress has traditionally funded the Byrne Grant Program at \nabout $500 million a year.\n  Third, the Child Abuse Prevention and Enforcement Act doubles the \navailable funds, from $10 million to $20 million, for grants to each \nState for child abuse treatment and prevention from the Crime Victims \nFund. This fund is financed through the collection of criminal fines, \npenalties and other assessments against persons convicted of crimes \nagainst the United States. In the 1998 fiscal year, the Crime Victims \nFund held $363 million. To ensure that other crime victim programs \nsupport by the Fund are not reduced, the expansion of the child abuse \ntreatment and prevention earmark applies only when the Fund exceeds \n$363 million in a fiscal year. This year, the Crime Victims Fund is \nexpected to collect more than $1 billion due in part to large anti-\ntrust penalties.\n  Despite the tireless efforts of concerned Vermonters, including the \nmany dedicated workers and volunteers at Prevent Child Abuse in Vermont \nand the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitative Services, \nVermont is below the national average for its ability to provide \nservices to abused or neglected children. In 1997, 411 children found \nto be abused or neglected received no services, about 40 percent of \ninvestigated cases. Nationally, about 25 percent of all abused or \nneglected children received no services. Our legislation provides more \nresources to help Vermonters and other Americans provide services to \nall abused or neglected children.\n  I thank the many advocates who support our bill and the companion \nlegislation introduced by Representatives Pryce and Stephanie Tubbs \nJones, H.R. 764, which passed the House of Representatives by a vote of \n425-2 on October 5, 1999. These advocates include the diverse National \nChild Abuse Coalition: ACTION for Child Protection; Alliance for \nChildren and Families; American Academy of Pediatrics; American Bar \nAssociation; American Dental Association; American Professional Society \non the Abuse of Children; American Prosecutors Research Institute; \nAmerican Psychological Association; Association of Junior Leagues \nInternational; Boy Scouts of America; Child Welfare League of America; \nChildhelp USA; Children's Defense Fund; General Federation of Women's \nClub; National Alliance of Children's Trust and Prevention Funds; \nNational Association of Child Advocates; National Association of \nCounsel for Children; National Association of Social Workers; National \nChildren's Alliance; National Committee to Prevent Child Abuse; \nNational Council of Jewish Women; National Court Appointed Special \nAdvocates Association; National Education Association; National \nExchange Club Foundation for Prevention of Child Abuse; National \nNetwork for Youth; National PTA; Parents Anonymous; and Parents United. \nIn addition, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and \nPrevent Child Abuse America have endorsed our bill and its House \ncounterpart.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Child Abuse \nPrevention and Enforcement Act for the sake of our nation's \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1751. A bill to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nmodify reporting requirements and increase contribution limits, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  citizens' right to know act of 1999\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, last week, the minority put the Senate in a \ntake-it-or-leave, it position with respect to campaign finance reform. \nUsing a parliamentary tactic that foreclosed other amendments from \nbeing offered, and then objecting to requests to take up other \nproposals, the proponents of S. 1593, the McCain-Feingold campaign \nfinance reform bill, got what they wanted--a vote on an unamended, and \ntherefore unimproved, version of their bill.\n  Mr. President, there are many of us who agree that we should make \nchanges in our campaign finance laws; but, we disagree that we should \ncompromise the First Amendment to do it.\n  Today, I am introducing the ``Citizens' Right to Know Act,'' a bill \nthat represents my thinking on campaign finance reform.\n  Many pundits and many colleagues here in Congress perceive that the \nAmerican people think that our government has become too fraught with \nspecial interest influence, bought with special interest campaign \ncontributions. We have all heard voters voice their frustrations about \ngovernment. Given some of the games we play up here that affect \nnecessary legislation--such as the bankruptcy bill to name just one \nexample--this attitude is not surprising or unwarranted.\n  Yet, it may be a mistake to interpret these frustrations as \nwidespread cynicism about the influence of special interests rather \nthan about the government's inability to enact tax relief, inertia on \nlong-term Social Security and Medicare reforms, and the tug-of-war on \nbudget and appropriations.\n  Nevertheless, it goes without saying that maintaining the integrity \nof our election system and citizens' confidence in it has to be among \nour highest priorities. The question is: what is the right reform?\n  There are a number of flaws in the McCain-Feingold bill. The \nprincipal one is that the McCain-Feingold attempts, unconstitutionally, \nI believe, to gag political parties. What Senators McCain and Feingold \nforgot is that political parties are organizational instruments for \npromoting a political philosophy and ideas. To ban the ability of \nparties to get their messages out to the people is an infringement on \nfree speech.\n\n  The proposal I am introducing today has two main goals: (1) to open \nup our campaign finances to the light of day, thus allowing citizens to \nmake their own judgments about how much influence is too much; and (2) \nto expand opportunities for individuals to participate financially in \nelections, thus decreasing the reliance on special interest money in \ncampaigns.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the ``Citizens' Right to Know \nAct,'' would require all candidates and political committees to \ndisclose every contribution they receive and every expenditure they \nmake over $200 within 14 days on a publicly accessible website. This \nmeans people will not have to wade through FEC bureaucracy to get this \ninformation, and the information will be continuously updated.\n  People should be able to compare the source of contributions with \nvotes cast by the candidate. They can decide for themselves which \ndonations are rewards for faithfulness to a principle of representation \nof constituents and which contributions might be a quid pro quo for \nspecial favors.\n  Further, my proposal would encourage--not require--non-party \norganizations to disclose expenditures in a constitutionally acceptable \nmanner the funds that they devote to political activity. Organizations \nthat chose to file voluntary reports with the FEC would make individual \ndonors to their PACs eligible for a tax deduction of up to $100.\n  This provision is designed to encourage voluntary disclosure of \nexpenditures of organizational soft money.\n\n[[Page S12840]]\n\nThose organizations that did so would be shedding light on campaign \nfinance not because they have to, but because it furthers the cause of \nan informed democracy.\n  An article in the Investor's Business Daily quoted John Ferejohn of \nStanford University as writing that ``nothing strikes the student of \npublic opinion and democracy more forcefully than the paucity of \ninformation most people possess about politics.''\n  The article goes on to suggest that ``But many reforms, far from \nhelping, would cut the flow of political information to an already ill-\ninformed public.'' Citing a study by Stephen Ansolabehere of MIT and \nShanto Iyengar of UCLA, which demonstrates that political advertising \n``enlightens voters,'' the IBD concludes that ``well-informed voters \nare the key to a well-functioning democracy.'' [Investor's Business \nDaily; 9/20/99]\n\n  Morton Kondracke editorializes in the July 30, 1999, Washington \nTimes, ``Full disclosure would be valuable on its merits--letting \nvoters know exactly who is paying for what in election campaigns. Right \nnow, campaign money is going increasingly underground.''\n  This is precisely the issue my amendment addresses. My amendment, \nrather than prohibit the American people from having certain \ninformation produced by political parties, it would open up information \nabout campaign finance. Knowledge is power. My proposal is predicted on \ngiving the people more power.\n  Additionally, my legislation will raise the limits on individual \nparticipation in elections. Special interest PACs sprung up as a \nresponse to the limitations on individual participation in elections. \nThe contribution limit for individuals is $1000 and it has not been \nadjusted since it was enacted in 1974.\n  Why are these limits problematic? The answer is that if a candidate \ncan raise $5000 in one phone call to a PAC, why make 5 phone calls \nhoping to raise the same amount from individuals? My legislation \nproposes to make individuals at least as important as PACs.\n  My bill also raises the 25-year-old limits on donations to parties \nand PACs. It raises the current limits on what both individuals and \nPACs can give to political parties. As the League of Women Voters has \ncorrectly pointed out, the activities of political parties are already \nregulated, whereas the political activities of other organizations are \nnot. If we are concerned about the influence of ``soft'' money--that \nis, money in campaigns that is not regulated and not disclosed--and \ncannot be regulated or subject to disclosure under our Constitution--\nthen we ought to encourage--not punish--greater political participation \nthrough our party structures.\n  We need to put individuals back as equal players in the campaign \nfinance arena. Special interests--both PACs and soft money--have become \nimportant in large part because current law limits are not only a \nquarter century old, but are also higher for special interests than \nindividuals.\n  Some people have argued that raising the limits on donations to \npolitical candidates and parties exacerbates the problem. Their concern \nis that there is too much money in politics, not that there is too \nlittle.\n  I will respond by saying that, first, all individual donations would \nhave to be disclosed. The philosophy of the ``Citizens' Right to Know \nAct'' is that people have a right to make their own determinations \nabout whether a contribution is tainted or not.\n  Second, the higher contribution limits for hard money donations make \nindividual citizens more important relative to special interests in \ncampaign finance. If one goal of campaign finance reform is to reduce \nthe influence of special interests, then raising the limits on \nindividual contributions is a way to do it.\n  Third, most of the increases in the bill are merely an adjustment for \n25 years of inflation. While the contribution limits have remained \nunchanged, the costs of running a campaign have increased. The higher \nlevels reflect reality.\n  Most importantly, while money is an essential ingredient in a \ncampaign, and is necessary to get one's message to the voters, the real \ninfluence in campaigns is the public. Even if wealthy John Smith gives \nthousands of dollars to a party or candidate, the fact is that he only \ngets one vote on election day. Candidates and parties have to persuade \npeople to their way of thinking. All the money in the world cannot \ncompensate for a dearth of principles or unpopular ideas.\n  The McCain-Feingold approach represents a constitutionally specious \nbarrier on free speech. It would, by law, prohibit political parties \nfrom using soft money to communicate with voters. Prohibitions are \nrestrictions on freedom.\n  My bill, in contrast, does not prohibit anything. It does not \nrestrict the flow of information to citizens. On the contrary, my \nproposal recognizes that citizens are the ultimate arbiters in \nelections. They should have access to as much information as possible \nabout the candidates and the positions they represent.\n  Thus far, the information that is available to voters about campaign \nfinance has been difficult to obtain and untimely. My bill, by \nempowering voters with this information, will put the role of special \ninterests where it rightfully belongs--in the eye of the beholder, not \nthe federal government.\n\n

Res. 205\n\n       Whereas the family is the basic strength of any free and \n     orderly society;\n       Whereas it is appropriate to honor the family unit as \n     essential to the continued well-being of the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas it is fitting that official recognition be given to \n     the importance of family loyalties and ties: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of each November in which the \n     holiday of Thanksgiving is observed as ``National Family \n     Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue each year a \n     proclamation--\n       (A) designating the week of each November in which the \n     holiday of Thanksgiving is observed as ``National Family \n     Week''; and\n       (B) calling on the people of the United States to observe \n     ``National Family Week'' with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come before you today to submit \na resolution which would designate the week of each November in which \nthe holiday of Thanksgiving is observed as ``National Family Week.'' \nEach Congress since 1976 has passed legislation which established \nFamily Week on a bi-annual basis, and I have been a frequent cosponsor \nof it. In fact, last Congress, I was the sponsor of the legislation, \nand am pleased to be able to further contribute to this longstanding \ntradition of recognizing the importance of family.\n  This Congress, however, I would like to pay special tribute to the \nhard work of the man who founded the idea of Family Week, Mr. Sam \nWiley. Ever since 1971, Mr. Wiley worked hard to see that Family Week \nwas recognized on every Thanksgiving in every state, and by every \npresident. Unfortunately, however, Mr. Wiley passed away in December \nafter a long battle with cancer. Remarkably, even during this fight \nwith the painful and deadly disease, Mr. Wiley was more concerned with \nmaking sure Family Week continue, as it was his constant vigilance that \nkept the idea and spirit of Family Week alive year after year.\n  A friend, Mr. Noel Duerden, has said that Mr. Wiley's greatest desire \nwas to make sure that after he died Family Week would still live on. As \na tribute to Mr. Wiley, my legislation will guarantee that Family Week \ncontinues by making it permanent. The resolution I am submitting today \nwill ensure that every year the President will issue a proclamation \ndedicating the week of the Thanksgiving holiday as Family Week.\n  As we all know, the family is the most basic element of our society, \nand the tie that binds us to one another. It is the strength of any \nfree and orderly society and it is appropriate to honor this unit as \nbeing essential to the well-being of the United States.\n  Since Family Week will be observed during the weeks on which \nThanksgiving falls, we will be paying homage to what we as a nation \nalready know--the strength of the family provides the support through \nwhich we as individuals and a nation thrive. Therefore it is \nparticularly suitable to pause during this special week in recognition \nof the celebrations and activities of the family which bring us closer \ntogether.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort and ask that an \narticle from the Indianapolis Star about Mr. Wiley and Family Week be \nplaced in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n            Founder Wants To Make Sure Family Week Continues\n\n                           (By John Strauss)\n\n       He founded National Family Week, but on a day when so many \n     families were together for the holiday, Sam Wiley found it \n     hard to say much.\n       ``I've seen better days,'' he said Friday from a bed at St. \n     Vincent Hospice.\n       Wiley, 72, is in the terminal stages of pancreatic and \n     liver cancer, but he is less concerned about his personal \n     situation than making sure the National Family Week movement \n     continues.\n       Ever since he started it in 1971, the week has been \n     recognized each Thanksgiving by every president and in every \n     state through proclamations, seminars and other activities \n     designed to recognize the importance of strong families.\n       Wiley's movement has a Web page, www.familyweek.org. The \n     former Whiteland High School administrator, teacher and \n     basketball coach, who retired in 1988, has worked tirelessly \n     to promote the week as a way to strengthen the regard and \n     support for families.\n       Along the way, he made 25 trips to Washington. His room at \n     the hospice has photos on the wall of Wiley with presidents \n     Ronald Reagan and George Bush, and with former Vice President \n     Dan Quayle as the proclamations for National Family Week were \n     signed over the years.\n       Wiley never married, but he came to believe in the \n     importance of families through his work with students, said \n     Rush Isenhour, a childhood friend from their days in Boone \n     County.\n       Isenhour was at Wiley's bedside on Friday, as her friend, \n     who is heavily medicated for pain, drifted in and out of \n     consciousness. Wiley's friends said he does not have long to \n     live.\n       ``He was a schoolteacher and he had so many children from \n     underprivileged families,'' Isenhour said. ``He heard them \n     talking about their family life, and that got him to thinking \n     about it, and it got him started.''\n       Noel Duerden, a friend who helped Wiley over the years, \n     said he and others are trying to find other groups to carry \n     on the organizational work. One of the biggest tasks is \n     writing and calling governors across the country to get them \n     to issue proclamations which are only good for a year.\n       ``Everybody's interested in National Family Week, but \n     nobody's taking the lead except Sam at this point,'' Duerden \n     said.\n       ``His greatest desire before he dies is to make sure this \n     continues,'' he said. ``Not just the proclamations, which are \n     a heavy amount of work, but to promote it with the \n     organizations and get right down to families.''\n       Duerden said he has been talking with the National Urban \n     League, the American Legion, Girl Scouts and other groups to \n     find support for continuing the annual observance.\n       Judy Lifferth is coordinator of National Family Week \n     activities in Columbus, where ``Families of the Year'' are \n     recognized for sticking together and supporting each other in \n     the face of difficulties.\n       This year's program also included training in Active \n     Parenting, a six-session video and discussion course that \n     focuses on communication and other parenting skills.\n       ``We live a fast-lane life, and National Family Week gives \n     people a chance in the\n\n[[Page S12843]]\n\n     middle of their busy lives and realize how important their \n     families are,'' Lifferth said.\n       The Columbus mother of five has worked on National Family \n     Week activities for 10 years but didn't realize until \n     recently that the founder lived just up I-65 from her.\n       ``I wish there was a way I could meet him,'' she said.\n       ``I would like to tell him thank you from the bottom of my \n     heart.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12843-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12843-S12844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   CLELAND AMENDMENTS NOS. 2308-2316\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table)\n  Mr. CLELAND submitted nine amendments intended to be proposed by him \nto the bill (S. 1593) to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of \n1971 to provide bipartisan campaign reform; as follows:\n\n                           Amendment No. 2308\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____.

Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to \nstand before the Senate today and speak of an organization that has, \nfor the past 25 years, been committed to ending violence toward women \nand children. The organization is called Women Helping Battered Women \n(WHBW) and their goal is simple: create a living environment for women \nand children that is free from fear of battering--sexual, physical, \nemotional or financial. On the occasion of their 25th anniversary, \nWHBW, through their direct service, their advocacy and their \neducational and outreach programs stands as an example for us all and, \nunfortunately, are as crucial today as they were 25 years ago.\n  We must not shy away from the impacts of domestic violence. In the \nUnited States, a woman is battered by a partner every seven seconds and \nthirty percent of Americans know a woman who has been physically abused \nby their husband or boyfriend in the last year. In my home state of \nVermont, I shudder when I hear that domestic violence touches over \n16,000 Vermonters each year. In Chittenden County alone, an \noverwhelming 59% of all reported crimes since January 1998 have been \ndomestic-related disturbances. We often perceive Vermont as one of the \nsafest states in the nation, however, the incidence of domestic \nviolence in Vermont continues to rise.\n  As a result of WHBW's work, over 3,500 Vermonters' lives were \npositively touched during difficult and dangerous times in their lives. \nI'd like to highlight their PARADIGM project, a joint educational \npartnership with the Woman's Rape Crisis Center. The PARADIGM project \nserves to educate students, churches and professional and community \ngroups, in the hope of breaking the cycle of violence in the home and \nin our communities.\n  Mr. President, you may see me and others wearing a purple ribbon, to \nsymbolize our commitment to ending violence against women and children \nin our state, and across the nation. Yet it is the day to day work of \nWomen Helping Battered Women--it is their strength and advocacy--that \ncontinues to make a difference and helps Congress focus on this issue. \nCongress made a commitment to the women behind the statistics when we \npassed the bipartisan Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). I will \ncontinue to work to fulfill this pledge to millions of women and \nfamilies who have suffered, by fully funding this important Act which \nsupports shelters, counseling, training, and law enforcement. In fact, \nmy work helped to double the fiscal year 1997 allocations for community \nlevel demonstration projects and to increase the domestic violence \nhotline funds. Congress also included funding targeted exclusively to \ncombat domestic violence in rural areas--especially important in my \nhome state of Vermont. We must continue the work we began with the \npassage of VAWA and pass a reauthorization of these vital programs. I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of S. 51, the Violence Against Women Act II. \nI pledge to work with my colleagues to get this needed legislation \npassed in the near future.\n  I applaud WHBW's leadership and the creative initiatives they have \nundertaken to build and maintain a multi-cultural organization which \nempowers staff, volunteers, and the women and families they serve. I \ncommend Woman Helping Battered Women for their crucial work in breaking \nthe silence for victims, supporting women and children in meeting their \nmost basic needs in times of great difficulty, educating our \ncommunities, and working to heighten public awareness of this growing \nepidemic.\n  Mr. President, thank you for the opportunity to provide my colleagues \nwith a shining example of a group of dedicated individuals actively \nengaged in the war against domestic violence. I join other Vermonters \nin offering my heartfelt congratulations and gratitude to Women Helping \nBattered Women for their many years of good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12846-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12846-S12847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMEMORATING THE AGREEMENT FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SISTER RELATIONS \n  BETWEEN THE STATE OF MONTANA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND GUANGXI \n          ZHUANG AUTONOMOUS REGION, PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nestablishment of the sister-state relationship between my home state of \nMontana and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of the People's Republic \nof China.\n  The establishment of this sisterhood marks a successful conclusion to \nmany years of building mutual cooperation, trust and friendship, as \nwell as a bright beginning of a continued strong relationship between \nour countries.\n  I would like to commend Governor Marc Racicot of the State of Montana \nfor his continued efforts to bring new opportunities to the state \nthrough education, business relations and cultural exchanges. I would \nalso like to thank the People's Republic of China and Governor Li \nZhaozhuo for linking Guangxi Province to Montana. The richness of \nculture, citizens, history, and boundless environmental beauty make our \nstate and your province a perfect match.\n  Montana and Guangxi have worked a long time in building this \nrelationship. In fact, a high level delegation from Guangxi Province \njoined the first Mansfield Pacific Retreat on ``Trade and \nAgriculture,'' held in Bigfork, Montana, in May 1996.\n  The idea of establishing friendly exchange relationships between \nAmerican states and cities and Chinese provinces and cities goes back \nto the late 1970s when China, as a country, began to ``open up to the \noutside.'' These sister relationships have proved to be very helpful in \nestablishing cultural and grassroots relations. A good example is the \nproduct relationship between the city of Seattle and Chongqing in \nSichuan Province.\n  The establishment of Montana's sister ties with Guangxi Province in \nSouth China fits within this tradition of promoting people to people \ncommunication. Such a relationship is especially relevant to Montana \nbecause of the life, work, and legacy of Mike Mansfield. He is \nMontana's ``favorite son'' who has also made a name known for himself \nin China. His promotion of sister relationships with Asia began during \nhis tenure as American Ambassador to Japan. He proposed and helped to \nestablish Montana's sister relationship with Kumamoto Prefecture. He \nalso established the University of Montana's sister relations with Toyo \nUniversity in Tokyo and Kumamoto University in Kumamoto City.\n  Although Senator Mansfield is better known for his promotion of \nmutual understanding with Japan, his impact on American Chinese \nrelations is also significant. His interest in East Asia began when he \nserved in the U.S. Marines soon after World War I and visited the \nAmerican Garrison then in the city of Tianjin.\n  Senator Mansfield continued his work in the Far East as a Congressman \nfrom Montana. He visited China at the request of President Roosevelt to \nreport back with advice on American policy following the defeat of \nJapan in the Pacific War. He is also credited with opening relations \nwith China in the early 1970s and he was the first American Senator to \nvisit China, soon after President Nixon's historic visit in 1972. The \ncurrent ties between Montana and Guangxi are a fitting expression of \nthe value of people to people communication between America and China. \nThey\n\n[[Page S12847]]\n\nare also a fitting tribute to the legacy of Senator Mansfield.\n  Finally, I was pleased to have the opportunity to visit Guangxi's \nbeautiful city of Guilin last summer during President Clinton's visit \nto China. I was impressed by the great efforts the Guangxi's citizens \nhave taken to ensure that their children and generations to come will \ncontinue to enjoy the natural wonders and beauty of their province. We \nin Montana also take such pride in our state's natural treasures--our \nmountains, our lakes and our wildlife.\n  I am very proud of the establishment of Montana and Guangxi's \nsisterhood. This is just the beginning.

Mr. Alexander passed away last \nmonth after a long and distinguished career in law practice. His deep \npassion for his work took him on a journey from the smallest courtrooms \nin Alabama, to the great and hallowed halls of the U.S. Supreme Court. \nHis dedication and heartfelt concern for the ``little guy'' was an \ninspiration. Jimmy will be missed by the many people whose lives he \ntouched and affected.\n  Jimmy was born in Bear Creek, in Marion County, in 1939. After \ngraduation from Russellville High School in 1957, Jimmy went on to \ncontinue his education at the University of Alabama, receiving his \nundergraduate degree in 1960, and his law degree in 1963. Jimmy's \ninnate industriousness and work ethic were tailor-made for his chosen \nprofession. Jimmy quickly developed a reputation as an outstanding \ncriminal defense attorney and successful domestic relations lawyer. \nJoining the firm of Malone, Malone and Steel directly out of law \nschool, he soon was made partner and ultimately became senior partner \nof the firm Alexander, Corder, Plunk, Baker, Shelly, and Shipman P.C., \nin Athens, AL. Jimmy was the city attorney for Athens and Ardmore for \n17 years. He served on the city Board of Education for 5 years and was \nthe Alabama Bar Association Commissioner for the 39th judicial circuit \nfor 4 years.\n  It was through these professional forums that Jimmy was able to \nthrive in his work and gain a statewide reputation as a standout trial \nattorney. In private practice for 36 years, Jimmy has counseled \nbusinesses, commercial clients, and recently, had taken a strong \ninterest in championing the cause of the ``little guy.'' Particularly \nfor the last 15 years, he focused on representing the poor, under \nrepresented, physically injured, and financially cheated, many of whom \nhad no where else to turn than Jimmy Alexander. Jimmy developed a \nparticular fondness for taking on big business, insurance companies, \nand large industry. He represented many high profile cases, and in \n1989, won the largest monetary judgment at the time in Limestone County \nand in another case, setting a precedent for the largest monetary \njudgement in the entire State of Alabama. His gifted ability even took \nhim before the U.S. Supreme Court, where he argued a case against an \ninsurance company.\n  Jimmy Alexander will be remembered as a dedicated attorney, who \nbrought human compassion to his work. Many of his colleagues have \nexpressed their respect and admiration for his approach to both his \nwork and his life, and I join them in their prayers for him and his \nfamily. My thoughts and wishes extend to his wife Rose, and two \nchildren, Tonya and Eric, during this difficult time. Mr. President, I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12847-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CENTRAL CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCentral Connecticut State University as it celebrates its 150th \nanniversary. Under the dynamic leadership of President Richard Judd, \nthis fine institution has continued to achieve the vision of academic \nexcellence upon which it was founded.\n  Originally the New Britain Normal School, CCSU was established by the \nState General Assembly in 1849 and stands as the oldest public \ninstitution of higher education in Connecticut. Whether under the name \nNormal School, Teachers College of Connecticut, or Central Connecticut \nState University, its students have never received less than a first-\nrate education. CCSU has cultivated a rich academic environment in \nwhich both graduates and undergraduates have the opportunity to better \nunderstand themselves as well as the world around them.\n  Academically, athletically, and culturally, CCSU and its more than \n11,000 students have much to celebrate throughout this special year. \nWhat makes CCSU so unique is that it has never isolated itself from the \nsurrounding community. Instead, the university embraces its position \nwithin the larger civic arena and, in doing so, offers its students the \nvaluable opportunity to make a real difference in the city of New \nBritain and beyond. CCSU students, faculty, and facilities have played \na significant role in the city's development and will continue to weave \nthemselves into the city's social fabric for many years to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join me in celebrating the \nsesquicentennial anniversary of Central Connecticut State University, \none of the Nation's great academic institutions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12847-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nON THE DEDICATION OF THE LAKE CHAMPLAIN/SAINT ALBANS HISTORICAL DIORAMA\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncompletion of the Lake Champlain/Saint Albans Historical Diorama.\n  This interactive educational exhibit at the Saint Albans Historical \nMuseum is ambitious in its geographic and historic scope. It spans the \nentire Champlain Valley, from Fort Ticonderoga to the Richelieu River \nand also spans time, from pre-history to the present.\n  The people of Saint Albans have a tremendous understanding and \nrespect for their history, as seen by the fact that this exhibit was \nfunded entirely through local contributions and completed in just over \na year, with most of the work done by residents of Saint Albans and \nneighboring towns. It is a beautiful addition to one of Vermont's \nfinest historical museums.\n  The Champlain Valley is the birthplace of the United States and \nCanada. For two hundred years the Champlain Valley was the stage for \nconflicts between the French and the English, and then for the most \ncritical campaign of the Revolutionary War. In times of peace, the \nChamplain Valley has been an important corridor of commerce. Important \nsites from this history are displayed and interpreted in the Diorama, \nincluding wonderful scale models of the region's lighthouses.\n  The Diorama also depicts the local history of Saint Albans, \ndisplaying her historic structures, rail yards and neighborhoods in \ngreat detail. These events and places are brought to life in three \ndimensions, engaging and educating the viewer as is possible with no \nother medium.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I recognize the Saint \nAlbans Historical Society and all of the others who have helped to \ncreate the diorama. This is a significant contribution to the heritage \nof Vermont.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12847-4", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12847-S12848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING ST.

Over the past year, the church has been celebrating its \nmore than one hundred years of service. I am honored to have the \nopportunity to join with them in their celebration of this tremendous \nmilestone. For over one hundred years, the St. Paul Baptist Church has \nprovided the African-American community with a strong sense of unity as \nthe only black Baptist church in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey.\n  The church has experienced tremendous growth since it was founded by \nthe Reverend M.R. Rosco in 1899. Today, it can boast not only of being \na house of faith and worship, but also of its daily contributions to \nthe community of Atlantic Highlands through its\n\n[[Page S12848]]\n\nEducational Center and the Vassie L. Peek, Sr. Educational Annex.\n  I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of St. Paul's \npastor, the Reverend Doctor Henry P. Davis, Jr., to New Jersey's \nBaptist community. Over the years, Reverend Davis has been a shining \nexample of devotion to his church. In addition to his commitment to his \nparish, the Reverend has served as Treasurer of the General Baptist \nState Convention of New Jersey, Moderator of the Seacoast Missionary \nBaptists Association of New Jersey, an Executive Board member of the \nNew Jersey Council of Churches, and Secretary of the Moderator's \nAuxiliary of the National Baptist Convention, USA.\n  Once again, I would like to extend my congratulations and warmest \nwishes to Reverend Davis and his congregation on the occasion of the \ncentennial celebration of St. Paul Baptist Church. The church's \ncontributions to the residents of Atlantic Highlands is unmatched. I \ncan only hope that the next one hundred years will be as rewarding as \nthe first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12848-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO WILLIE AND VERONICA ARTIS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nWillie and Veronica Artis of Flint, Michigan. On October 19, 1999, they \nwill be honored by Mott Community College for their many contributions \nto the greater Flint community.\n  In 1979, Willie Artis co-founded Genesee Packaging, Inc., a maker of \ncorrugated packaging with a focus on the automotive industry. Mr. Artis \nand Mr. Buel Jones began this company by utilizing the opportunities \nthat were available to them through General Motors' minority business \ndevelopment programs. Using their extensive background in automotive \ncontract packaging and corrugated manufacturing, Mr. Artis and Mr. \nJones were able to penetrate the existing automotive market and build a \nrelationship with a General Motors buyer.\n  Upon co-founder Buel Jones' retirement, Willie Artis took control of \nthe day-to-day operations of the company and implemented a \nrestructuring of the organization. Presently, Genesee Packaging employs \na total of 230 people in three different plants and has just completed \nthirty-three consecutive months of profitability.\n  Willie Artis has over twenty-eight years of experience in sales, \ncorrugated manufacturing and automotive contract packaging. He obtained \nhis education at Wilson College in Chicago, Illinois, and continued his \neducation through executive seminars for business owners at Dartmouth \nCollege. He is currently President and Chief Executive Officer of \nGenesee Packaging, Inc. in Flint, Michigan.\n  Willie Artis' wife, Veronica Artis, is also an instrumental force at \nGenesee Packaging, Inc. Veronica obtained her higher education at the \nUniversity of Wisconsin, Dartmouth College, Wharton School of Business, \nand Harvard University. Before joining Genesee Packaging, Inc, Veronica \nheld various positions at Wisconsin Bell and Ameritech. Veronica joined \nGenesee Packaging, Inc. in 1989 as the Vice President of Administration \nand she is a member of the Executive Staff.\n  The event at Mott Community College on October 19, 1999, is a salute \nto Mr. and Mrs. Artis' success, their commitment to the greater Flint \ncommunity, and their contributions as fine corporate citizens.

Mr. President, on October 13, the Broadcasting \nBoard of Governors--which supervises all U.S. Government-sponsored \ninternational broadcasting--held a ceremony celebrating its new status \nas an independent agency.\n  Among the speakers was the President of Estonia, Lennart Meri, who \ndelivered a very thoughtful and eloquent speech on the importance of \ninternational broadcasting to the mission of promoting democracy and \nfreedom around the world.\n  I commend it to all of my colleagues. I ask to have printed in the \nRecord, the text of President Meri's speech.\n  The speech follows:\n\n           The Unfinished Tasks of International Broadcasting\n\n  (By Lennart Meri, President of the Republic of Estonia, Washington, \n                         D.C., 13 October 1999)\n\n       No one talking in this city about the importance of the \n     media could fail to recall Thomas Jefferson's observation \n     that if he were forced to choose between a free press and a \n     free parliament, he would always choose the former because \n     with a free press and a free parliament, he would end with a \n     free parliament, but with a free parliament, he could not be \n     sure if he would end with a free press.\n       I certainly won't become the exception to that practice. \n     But if these words of your third president and the author of \n     the American Declaration of Independence continue to resonate \n     around the world, one of his other observations about the \n     press may be more relevant for our thinking about the current \n     and future tasks of international broadcasting. Responding in \n     June 1807 to a Virginia resident who was thinking about \n     starting a newspaper, Jefferson argued that ``to be most \n     useful,'' a newspaper should contain ``true facts and sound \n     principles only.''\n       Unfortunately, he told his correspondent, ``I fear such a \n     paper would find few subscribers'' because ``it is a \n     melancholy truth that a suppression of the press could not \n     more completely deprive the nation of its benefits than is \n     done by its abandoned prostitution to falsehood.'' And one of \n     the greatest advocates of the power of the media to support \n     democracy concluded sadly, ``nothing can now be believed \n     which is seen in a newspaper. Truth itself becomes suspicious \n     by being put into that polluted vehicle.''\n       Jefferson's optimistic comment about the role of a free \n     press came as he was helping to make the revolution that \n     transformed the world; his more critical ones came after his \n     own, often less than happy years as president of the United \n     States. Given my own experiences over the past half century, \n     I can fully understand his shift in perspective and can thus \n     testify that were Thomas Jefferson to be with us today, he \n     would be among the most committed advocates of international \n     broadcasting precisely because of his experiences in the \n     earlier years of the American republic.\n       For most of my adult life, I lived in an occupied country, \n     one where the communist regime suppressed virtually all \n     possibilities for free expression in public forums. As a \n     result, we turned to international broadcasting like Radio \n     Free Europe, Radio Liberty, the Voice of America, and the BBC \n     to try to find out what was going on.\n       Let me go back in memory for a moment. Estonia was already \n     under Soviet occupation when the ``Battle of Britain''--\n     solitary England's solitary battle against the totalitarian \n     world--began. This is how I saw it, at the age of twelve, \n     before our family was deported to Siberia. Nazi Germany \n     bombastically boasted of its victories, London spoke of \n     losses. And yet each broadcast from London, day after day, \n     ended with the English newscaster's dry announcement: ``Das \n     waren die Nachrichten am 5. Juni, am hundert sechs und \n     funfzigsten Tage des Jahres, wo Hitler versprach, den Krieg \n     zu gewinnen.''--``These were the news of June 15, 156th day \n     of the year when Hitler promised to win the war''. There was \n     no irony in these words. Rather, there was the pedantic \n     knowledge of a pharmacist--how many drops of truth \n     morning, day and night were necessary to keep the ability \n     of doubt alive. The end of World War II found me in exile, \n     buried deep into the heart of Russia, a couple of hundred \n     kilometers from the nearest railway station. You had your \n     Victory Day celebrations, and so had I. I bought a crystal \n     of selenium to build a radio receiver. During the time of \n     war, all radio equipment had been confiscated in Russia. \n     Now, suddenly, I was holding in my hands a thumb's length \n     of a glass tube containing a crystal and a short wire--my \n     pass to freedom. The third receiver, built already in \n     Estonia, finally worked, and I have been with you ever \n     since. I doubt whether it is in my powers to give you a \n     convincing picture of our spiritual confinement. Imagine \n     being blind, unable to see colours, to perceive light or \n     shadows; being surrounded by the void space without a \n     single point of reference, without gravity that would feel \n     like motherly love in this spiritual vacuum. And then, for \n     a quarter of an hour, or half an hour, or even--a royal \n     luxury--for a whole hour--the void would suddenly be \n     filled with colours, fragrances, voices, the warmth of the \n     sun and the fresh hope of spring. How many of you remember \n     the Moscow Conference of 1946, to which so many Estonians \n     for some unknown reason looked forward with hope? I \n     remember Mr. Peter Peterson from the BBC covering the \n     conference, I remember, the intonation of Winston \n     Churchill, when he said of the winners of this very \n     ``Battle of Britain'': ``That was their finest hour''. I \n     remember the lectures of astronomer Fred Hoyle, to which I \n     listened taking notes from week to week. Under Soviet \n     rule, his discovery was banned as ``idealistic''.\n       Some years ago, when I received Javier Solana, the \n     Secretary-General of NATO, in Tallinn, I compared the \n     inevitability of the expansion of the island of democracy and\n\n[[Page S12849]]\n\n     NATO security structures with Fred Hoyle's expanding \n     universe, and noticed when I was still speaking that Mr. \n     Salona was deeply and personally moved by my speech. ``You \n     could not have known,'' he said afterwards, ``that Fred Hoyle \n     was during my university studies my research subject.'' This \n     is how the radiation from an antenna materialises into \n     attitudes, actions, and landscapes. Allow me two more \n     comments. It is my duty to thank from this chair your \n     predecessors for the decision to start broadcasts in Estonian \n     on Radio Liberty, and even more for the decision to transfer \n     the broadcasts in Estonian to the responsibility area of \n     Radio Free Europe--in full concord with the non-recognition \n     policy of the United States. I do not know how this decision \n     was taken. During the Korean War, I heard from the Russian \n     broadcasts, that the next day, the first Estonian broadcast \n     would be on the air at 1800 hours. I was still a student and \n     lived in Tartu, in a dormitory, which housed more than 500 \n     students. I mentioned the forthcoming Estonian broadcast to \n     one single friend. Stalin's terror was rampant in Estonia. \n     For the time when the broadcast begun, my room was full of \n     people, and more were coming. I will never forget that day, \n     those solemn thirty minutes, and least of all the atmosphere \n     in my room. Those people were the friends of my friend's \n     friends. I knew a few, most were strangers to me. Every \n     listener stood apart, in different directions, motionless, no \n     glance met another, no word was spoken, we parted in silence. \n     Such gatherings were punished with twenty-five years of hard \n     labour. Not a single one of these twenty or thirty people got \n     into trouble, which bespeaks of a high morale.\n       And my last point. I have myself worked at the radio, and \n     know and knew the most distressing doubt--or ignorance, to be \n     more accurate--whether your message did find your listeners. \n     The broadcaster's work is like a dialogue with the stars: \n     he can hear his own voice, but never gets any answer. The \n     listener's temptation to respond is overwhelming. In \n     spring 1976 Radio Free Europe informed that the Estonian \n     polar explorer. August Massik had died in Canada. I picked \n     up the phone and dictated a message for the writers' \n     newspaper, and it appeared two days later, on June 18. In \n     the circumstances of totalitarian seclusion, this was \n     quite an accomplishment, which, I hoped, would morally \n     support Radio Free Europe's Estonian staff. I must \n     confess, I also wrote to your countryman Alistair Cooke \n     the following lines, and I am quoting: ``Your word has \n     always penetrated the Iron Curtain. Every week you have \n     been a member of our family. I don't remember if you have \n     ever spoken about Estonia, but you have always spoken as a \n     European about the democratic world, which is the same''. \n     I was deeply moved to get Alistair Cooke's reply, which I \n     would very much like to read to this audience: ``It will \n     be plain to you'', Alistair Cooke wrote, ``why I \n     particularly cherish letters from people who listened, \n     sometimes at their peril, from behind the Iron Curtain. Of \n     all such, your letter is at once the most touching and the \n     most gratifying. I am deeply grateful to you and wish you \n     all good things as you approach what (to me) is early \n     middle age! Most sincerely, etc. Alistar Cooke''. That was \n     the role you have played, and I doubt whether you yourself \n     are aware of how much an antenna can outweight the world's \n     biggest army.\n       Frequently, these sources provided the only reliable news \n     we could get about what was going on not only in the outside \n     world but also in our own country. These broadcasts were our \n     universities: They provided us with the materials we needed \n     to understand our world and ultimately to build a movement \n     capable of reclaiming our rightful place in world.\n       Indeed, one of the key moments in the recovery of the \n     independence of my country is directly tied to international \n     broadcasting. On January 13, 1991, Russian leader Brois \n     Yeltsin flew to Tallinn in the aftermath of the Soviet \n     killings in Lithuania. While there, he not only signed \n     agreements acknowledging the right of the Baltic states to \n     seek independence from the Soviet Union but he issued a \n     statement calling on Russian officers and men not to obey \n     illegal Soviet orders to fire on freely elected governments \n     or unarmed civilians.\n       Through a series of FM and telephone connections from \n     Tallinn via Helsinki to Stockholm to Munich, Yeltin's words \n     reached REF/RL's Estonian Service and then were broadcast \n     throughout the Soviet Union on all of that station's language \n     services. I am convinced that that broadcasting by itself \n     prevented Moscow from taking even more radical steps against \n     our national movement and thus set the stage for the recovery \n     of our independence as well as for the dissolution of the \n     Evil Empire as a whole.\n       Just one indication of how important that action was to us \n     is the fact that the head of RFL/FL's Estonian Service at \n     that time, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, is now Estonian foreign \n     minister.\n       I can't stress too highly what these broadcasts meant to me \n     and to my fellow Estonians in another sense as well. During \n     the long years of occupation, these broadcasts in our own \n     languages demonstrated that the world, and that there was no \n     basis for pessimism about our future. And these broadcasts, \n     especially those which were about our country, reminded not \n     only us but the Soviet Authorities that they would never \n     be able to prevent us from regaining our freedom.\n       When we finally did so in 1991, I like many other Estonians \n     and, I suspect, like many of you, looked to the future with \n     enormous self-confidence. and also like many of you, I was \n     sure that the chief contribution of international \n     broadcasting to my country lay in the past. Indeed, it was in \n     that spirit that I nominated Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty \n     for the Novel Peace Prize, an honor I still believe it should \n     ultimately receive.\n       Surely, we thought, with communism overthrown and with our \n     own independence reaffirmed, we could quickly establish our \n     own free press, one that would provide our citizens with the \n     information they would need not only to recover from the past \n     but to allow us to re-enter Europe and the West.\n       But the experience of the past eight years has shown that \n     such optimism was misplaced. First of all, the privatisation \n     of the media did not make it free. Because of economic \n     difficulties, privatisation both reduced the number of media \n     outlets, thus paradoxically stifling freedom, and encouraged \n     those remaining to seek readers and listeners by appealing to \n     the lowest common denominator among our citizens. Instead of \n     elevating the understanding of their audiences, all too many \n     of our media outlets played to the worst in them, filling \n     their pages or their broadcasts with sex, violence, and \n     charges of corruption.\n       That is why I have complained so often that the path from a \n     controlled press to a free press all too often lies through \n     the worst kind of yellow press.\n       There is a second reason why our optimism about our own \n     domestic media was misplaced; the experiences and values of \n     the editors and journalists who now work in the domestic \n     media. Not surprisingly, almost all of them are products of \n     the Soviet system. Their understanding of what the media is \n     for and what they do is thus very different from that of \n     journalists who have grown up in a free media environment. \n     They see media outlets as a form of propaganda, something the \n     new owners frequently even encourage, and they see individual \n     news stories as a chance to push their own agendas rather \n     than to report accurately on what is going on.\n       And there is yet a third reason why we expected too much \n     too soon in this area after the collapse of communism. A free \n     press needs a free audience be it readers or listeners, and \n     such an audience is not something that has been created \n     overnight in any country.\n       It did not happen overnight even in the United States which \n     never faced the same kind of tyranny that we did. Indeed, \n     Jefferson complained about this as well when he said that for \n     the citizens of his day, ``defamation is becoming a necessity \n     of life; in so much that a dish of tea in the morning or \n     evening cannot be digested without this stimulant.''\n       But the impact of the Soviet system in my country was far \n     deeper and more insidious than that and far deeper and more \n     insidious than many people either in Estonia or in the West \n     want to acknowledge. It involved more than the mass \n     executions and deportations, more than the destruction of \n     much of the landscape, and more than 50 years of the \n     stifling of our lives. It involved in the very first and \n     most important sense the deformation of our minds and \n     souls, a deformation that means that even today many of us \n     cannot confront reality except through the filters \n     provided by that past. Estonian is not an easy language to \n     learn, but any of you who can listen to Estonian \n     broadcasts or who read Estonian newspapers or journals \n     will immediately feel what you are listening to or reading \n     is something very different from the media you are used to \n     in this long-established democracy. And if you listen or \n     read while you visit my country--and I invite all of you \n     to do so--you will be shocked by the difference between \n     what you hear and see in the media and what you hear and \n     see all around you.\n       Jefferson again understood this problem when he wrote: \n     ``The real extent of this misinformation is known only to \n     those who are in situations to confront facts within their \n     knowledge with the lies of the day.'' And he added that ``I \n     really look with commiseration over the great body of my \n     fellow citizens, who, reading newspapers, live and die in the \n     belief, that they have known something of what has been \n     passing in the world in their time.''\n       I share that feeling almost every time I pick up an \n     Estonian paper or listen to a broadcast by a domestic \n     Estonian outlet.\n       Now, lest you accuse me of being overly pessimistic, let me \n     hasten to add that there are notable exceptions among owners, \n     among journalists and especially among readers and listeners. \n     There are owners of media outlets in my country who do \n     believe in the principles of a genuinely free press. There \n     are journalists who understand that news is not the same as \n     propaganda and that checking facts is important. And there \n     are many readers and listeners who know what genuine news is \n     and increasingly expect to get that and not the poor \n     substitute they are often given.\n       One of the reasons that I have some optimism about the \n     future of the free media is that our very oldest citizens \n     remember the media from before the Soviet occupation and our \n     very youngest are growing up without the constraints of the \n     communist system. These two groups have been responsible for \n     most of the positive changes in our country since 1991 not \n     only in the media but in all fields of endeavor. Indeed, I \n     think it is symbolic that I am a representative of those who \n     remember Estonia before the Soviets came\n\n[[Page S12850]]\n\n     and our prime minister Mart Laar, perhaps the youngest \n     national leader in the world, came of age as they were \n     leaving.\n       Another reason I am somewhat more optimistic than you may \n     think is that international broadcasting has already done \n     some important work. Those of us who listened to what the \n     Soviets called the ``foreign voices'' not only heard the news \n     but learned what news is--and importantly what it isn't. Many \n     of our best journalists have been regular listeners to RFE/\n     RL, to VOA, to the BBC and to all the others for their entire \n     lives. That gave them the courage to think differently and a \n     model for their profession. Without it, we would have been \n     much further behind.\n       But there is a final reason for my optimism: the continuing \n     impact of international broadcasting to my country and to its \n     neighbors. Estonians and many other people around the world \n     fudge their own media on the basis of what \n     international broadcasting tells them. That operates as an \n     important constraint on the tendency of domestic media \n     operations to go off the rails, but it also means that \n     these audiences are learning what news is and thus will \n     demand it from their domestic outlets. And when they do, \n     then there will be genuinely free press and the \n     possibility of genuinely free society.\n       Consequently, I am now convinced that the greatest \n     challenges for international broadcasting lie ahead and not \n     in the past, for overcoming the problems Jefferson identified \n     two centuries ago is not going to be easy or quick. Estonia \n     as many of you know has done remarkably well compared to many \n     of the other post-communist countries, but our problems are \n     still so great in the media areas as elsewhere that we will \n     continue to need your help and your broadcasts long into the \n     future.\n       On behalf of the Estonian people, I want to thank you in \n     the United States for all you have done in the past and are \n     doing now through your broadcasts to my country and to other \n     countries around the world. I believe that international \n     broadcasting is and will remain one of the most important \n     means for the spread of democracy and freedom. And \n     consequently, I am very proud to greet you today on the \n     occasion of the formation of the Broadcasting Board of \n     Governors as an independent agency--even though I want all of \n     you who are celebrating that fact to know that your greatest \n     challenges lie ahead and that those of us who are your chief \n     beneficiaries will never let you forget it.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12850-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A THANK YOU TO WILLIAM ANDREW WHISENHUNT\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, one of the highest compliments \na person can receive is to be called a ``servant,'' someone who gives \nof himself for others. A man I've known for many years, a man of \noutstanding reputation, a man who has given a large part of his life in \nservice to his neighbors, a man respected by his peers, is about to \nmake a major change in his life. The people of the Fair State of \nArkansas would be remiss if we did not acknowledge that change.\n  Andrew Whisenhunt of Bradley, in Lafayette County in southwest \nArkansas, was born in the town of Hallsville, TX. However, his family \nmoved to the Natural State while Andrew was still a baby. So, \ntechnically he is not a native. However, Andrew is an Arkansas through \nand through.\n  He has long been in the public eye. Yet, soon, Andrew will step down \nfrom the presidency of Arkansas Farm Bureau Federation after 13 years. \nA modern-day tiller of the soil, he has been a farmer for as long as he \ncan remember--and his father before him. With loving support form his \nwife, Polly, and with help from his five children--Warren, Terri, Tim, \nJulie, and Bryan--Andrew has built the farm where he's lived almost all \nhis life into what has been called a model of modern agriculture. And \ntestimony to that has been the Whisenhunts' selection as ``Arkansas \nFarm Family of the Year'' in 1970, and Andrew's choice as ``Progressive \nFarmer Magazine's Man of the Year in Arkansas Agriculture'' in 1984.\n  His love for his chosen profession has carried him far beyond the \nfence rows of his 2,000-acre cotton, rice, soybean, and wheat-and-feed \ngrain operation. The journey began when he joined Lafayette County Farm \nBureau in 1955. By the time Andrew was elected to the Board of \nDirectors of Arkansas Farm Bureau in 1968, he had served in almost \nevery office in his county organization, including president. In his \nearly years on the Farm Bureau State board, he worked on several key \nboard panels, including the Executive and Building committees. (The \nlatter's work resulted in construction of Farm Bureau Center in Little \nRock in 1978.)\n  His fellow board members thought enough of his personal industry and \nleadership abilities that they elected him their secretary-treasurer in \n1976, an office he filled for 10 years. During that time, Andrew also \nwas active outside the Farm Bureau arena as, among other things, a \ncharter member of Arkansas Soybean Promotion Board, and as a former \npresident of both the American Soybean Development Foundation and the \nArkansas Association of Soil Conservation Districts. Then he was \nelected president of Arkansas Farm Bureau in 1986.\n  During his tenure, the organization has enjoyed unprecedented growth \nin membership, influence and prestige. When Andrew accepted the mantle \nof top leadership, Farm Bureau represented some 121,000 farm and rural \nfamilies in the State. Today, that figure stands at almost 215,000--and \nArkansas has become the 8th largest Farm Bureau of the 50 States and \nPuerto Rico.\n  As Arkansas Farm Bureau has grown, Andrew's leadership has done \nlikewise. As an influential member of American Farm Bureau Federation's \nExecutive Committee, he has traveled far and wide as an advocate not \njust for Arkansas farmers, but to advance American interests in \ninternational trade and relations. He was a member of the Farm Bureau \ndelegation that visited Russia after the Iron Curtain shredded, to \nexperience that nation's agriculture firsthand and to offer help to \nfarmers there. Andrew also was a key player in delegations to China, \nJapan, and the Far East, and to South America. He was among U.S. farm \nleaders who traveled to Cuba recently to see how trade with that nation \nmight be re-established. He even led a group of Arkansas farm leaders \nfirst to pre-NAFTA Mexico; then to deliver rice the Farm Bureau had \ndonated to a Central American village devastated by Hurricane Mitch.\n  Andrew's influence and tireless work ethic embrace the nonfarm sector \nas well. His service to his local community includes county and city \nschool boards, his local hospital board, the Bradley Chamber of \nCommerce and his church. He also is a board member of Florida College \nin Tampa.\n  When Andrew steps down as president of Arkansas Farm Bureau \nFederation in December, the members of that great organization will \nmiss him greatly. But he has never been one to sit still, and chances \nare, that won't change. As the new century unfolds, Farm Bureau's loss \nundoubtedly will be a gain somewhere else for all Arkansans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12850-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REGIONAL MARCHEGIANA SOCIETY\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary Maine family, distinguished both by its record of public \nservice and the accomplishments it has achieved in many other walks of \nlife. The Washburn family included three sisters\n\n[[Page S12851]]\n\nand seven brothers who helped guide this country through the Civil War \nand prepare our Nation for the 20th century. I am proud, as all Mainers \nare, that the Washburns hailed from Livermore, Maine, where the \nNorlands Living History Center still honors their memory and provides \npeople of all ages with a chance to experience rural life in the late \n1800's.\n  Israel and Martha Washburn raised 10 children in Livermore, Maine, \nduring the early years of the 19th century. Included among the children \nwere seven brothers who made substantial contributions to our Nation. \nThe Washburns hold the distinction of being the only family in the \nhistory of our Nation to have three brothers serve in Congress \nsimultaneously. In the 1850's Cadwallader Washburn representing \nWisconsin, Elihu Washburn representing Illinois, and Israel Washburn, \nJr., representing Maine were all Members of Congress in the tumultuous \nera leading up to the Civil War. Years later, William Washburn followed \nhis brothers to Congress, representing Minnesota for three terms. \nWilliam concluded his time in Washington with a term in the United \nStates Senate.\n  The Washburns served the public outside of Washington as well. \nCadwallader Washburn was elected Governor of Minnesota in 1872. His \nbrother, Israel, was Governor of Maine from 1861 to 1863 and is ranked \nas one of the great ``war governors'' of the Civil War era for his \nskill and dedication in raising and equipping volunteer regiments for \nthe Union cause. Israel was also an early member of the Republican \nParty and is given credit by some for naming the party.\n  The Washburns also served their country abroad. Charles Washburn \nserved as a Minister to Paraguay in the 1860's. During the War of the \nTriple Alliance, he was forced to flee the country when the dictator of \nParaguay, General Francisco Solano Lopez, accused Washburn and other \nembassy staffers of conspiring with Paraguay's enemies.\n  Elihu Washburne, who added the English ``e'' to his last name, was \nalso a diplomat. After 16 years in the House of Representatives, where \nhe was known as the ``watchdog of the Treasury'' for his unyielding \noversight of the ``peoples money,'' he was appointed to a 2-week term \nas President Grant's Secretary of State. Following the courtesy \nappointment, he was selected as our Nation's Ambassador to France. \nElihu rose to diplomatic greatness during the Franco-Prussian War of \n1870-1871, which resulted in the fall of Napoleon III and the French \nEmpire. Throughout the Siege of Paris and the upheaval of the Commune, \nhe alone among foreign ambassadors remained at his post and gave refuge \nto hundreds of foreign citizens trapped in the city. His memoirs, \n``Recollections of a Minister to France, 1869-1877,'' provide an \nimportant historical accounting of the end of France's Empire and his \nservice is a model of exemplary diplomatic performance during a crisis.\n  The Washburn brothers also served our Nation in the military. Samual \nWashburn spent his life on the sea and served in the U.S. Navy during \nthe Civil War as the captain of the gunboat Galena. Cadwallader \nrecruited and commanded the Second Wisconsin Volunteer Cavalry, which \nserved with distinction in the Civil War's southwestern theater. He \nrose to the rank of major-general, serving with Grant at Vicksburg and \nlater as military commander of the Memphis District of the Army of the \nTennessee.\n  As remarkable as they were, the achievements of the Washburn Brothers \nwere not limited to military and governmental pursuits. Four of the \nbrothers, Israel, Elihu, William, and Cadwallader, were lawyers. \nCharles was a writer and journalist who invented a typewriting machine \nthat was sold to the Remington Company. Algernon Sydney Washburn was a \nsuccessful banker in Hallowell, Maine. ``Sid,'' as he was known, \nprovided loans to his brothers that financed many of their ventures. \nCadwallader was also a successful businessman and founded a large \nmilling operation in Minneapolis that produced Gold Medal flour, which \ncan still be found on the shelves of America's grocery stores. Today, \nhis company is known as General Mills. William also engaged in milling, \nand his company later merged with the Pillsbury Corporation.\n  Though the adventures of the seven brothers Washburn took them all \nover the globe, the Norlands in Livermore, Maine, was always their \nhome. In 1973, their descendants donated the property, which included \nthe family mansion, surrounding historic buildings, and hundreds of \nacres of land, to the non-profit Washburn-Norlands Foundation. Today, \nthe property that was once home to this remarkable family is a living \nhistory center. Each year, approximately 25,000 visitors have the \nopportunity to sample life in the 1800's through Norland's hands-on \neducational programs. Moreover, the museum and property honors the many \naccomplishments of a family that is nearly without peer in the history \nof public service to this great nation. The Norlands Living History \nCenter is significant for both the history it preserves and the \ninnovative education it provides, and I commend those associated with \nthe center for the important work that they do.\n  Mr. President, the legacy of the Washburn family is yet another \nexample of why Maine and its people are so special. I am grateful for \nhaving had this opportunity to share with you the story of this \nremarkable family and to acknowledge the important work being done by \nthe dedicated staff and friends of the Norlands Living History Center \nto protect and share this important piece of our heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12851-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REVISED ORGANIC ACT OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

EISENHOWER EXECUTIVE OFFICE BUILDING\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 293, S. 1652.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1652) to designate the Old Executive Office \n     Building located at 17th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, \n     in Washington, District of Columbia, as the Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower Executive Office Building.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nconsidering S. 1652, legislation I have introduced with Senator Baucus \nand others that would name the Old Executive Office Building, OEOB, \nafter Dwight D. Eisenhower. This bipartisan bill would honor both an \narchitectural landmark and a great American leader.\n  The OEOB, located at the corner of 17th Street and Pennsylvania \nAvenue, is a familiar sight to my colleagues. Yet its history and \narchitectural importance may not be as well-known. Its existence grew \nout of the dire need for executive office space near the White House \nduring the 19th century. After the British burned the first pair of \noffice buildings in 1814, the State, War, and Navy Departments had to \nmake do in cramped quarters for several years. Finally, in the late \n1860s, the Grant administration proposed a new building to house those \nagencies, and Congress appointed a commission to select a site and an \narchitect.\n  The architect selected by the Commission was Alfred Mullett, the \nArchitect of the Treasury. To the surprise of\n\n[[Page S12854]]\n\nsome, his winning design was not Greek Revival (like the Treasury \nBuilding), but instead French Second Empire--a style that was perhaps \nmore flamboyant and exuberant than Washington had seen until that \npoint, but that reflected the optimism of the post-Civil War period. \nGround was broken in 1871, and seventeen years later the building was \ncompleted. Today, the building is listed on the National Register of \nHistoric Places, and ranks first among historic buildings in the \ninventory of the General Services Administration's Public Buildings \nService.\n  As planned, the building first was occupied by the State, War, and \nNavy Departments. For years, these Departments carried out their work \nthere. Indeed, the building has housed 16 Secretaries of the Navy, 21 \nSecretaries of War, and 24 Secretaries of State. But many other \nprominent national leaders have carried out their work there as well: \nBoth Presidents Roosevelt (Theodore and Franklin), as well as \nPresidents Taft, Eisenhower, Johnson, Ford, and Bush, had offices in \nthe OEOB before becoming President. And Vice Presidents since Lyndon \nJohnson have maintained offices there.\n  Some little-known historic trivia about the building: Apparently the \nbuilding once had wooden swinging doors at its doorways, but it is said \nthey were removed after an eager staffer cannoning through the doors \nran into Winston Churchill, knocking the famed cigar from his mouth. \nAnd it is said that after a slip on the stairs, Secretary of War Taft \nhad installed the extra brass stair railings. By the way, once Taft \nbecame President, his family cow, Pauline, grazed on what is the OEOB's \nSouth Lawn.\n  Eventually, however, the building's original tenants left, with the \nState Department the last to vacate in 1947. Once State moved out, and \nthe President's staff began moving in, the OEOB lost its moniker as the \n``State, War & Navy Building,'' and instead was known simply as the \nExecutive Office Building. When a new office building was built across \nthe street, the OEOB became the ``Old'' Executive Office Building, and \nthat undistinguished name has remained to this day.\n  Among those who worked in the building was a young Dwight Eisenhower. \nMy colleagues certainly are well aware of the career of our 34th \nPresident. Born in Denison, TX, and raised in Abilene, KS, Dwight \nEisenhower spent a life in public service to this country. A graduate \nof West Point, he had the privilege of being assigned to some of our \nbest-known military figures: Generals Pershing, MacArthur, and \nMarshall. Later, at the height of his military career, he was appointed \nSupreme Commander of the Allied Forces during WWII. He commanded the \nNormandy invasion, which led to the end of WWII. In peacetime, he \nserved as president of Columbia University, and also as the head of the \nNATO forces in Europe. In 1952, America again called him to national \nservice, and ``Ike'' became our 34th President. For all that he did to \nsecure democracy and peace in this century, Dwight Eisenhower stands as \none of this country's great leaders.\n  What my colleagues may not have known is that Dwight Eisenhower had a \nspecial personal connection to the Old Executive Office Building. As \nchief military aide to General MacArthur (then Army Chief of Staff), a \nyoung Dwight Eisenhower worked in the OEOB from 1933-35. Later on, when \nhe himself became Army Chief of Staff, Eisenhower again was based in \nthe OEOB. And on January 19, 1955, the first televised presidential \npress conference was held by President Eisenhower on the fourth floor \nof the OEOB. Indeed, Susan Eisenhower tells us that her grandfather \noften spoke fondly of the building and his years in it.\n  It is not surprising, therefore, that Eisenhower played a key role in \nthe building's preservation. In the late 1950s, his Advisory Committee \non Presidential Office Space recommended that the building be torn down \nand replaced with an expensive modern office building. White House \nhistorian and scholar William Seale reports that the architect in \ncharge tried to persuade President Eisenhower, who recently had \nsuffered a heart attack, that a new building would not have as many \nstairs to climb. ``Nonsense,'' said the President, ``My doctors require \nthat I climb so many steps a day for the good of my heart!'' The tide \nturned at that point, and the building was saved.\n  Designating the Old Executive Office Building as the Dwight D. \nEisenhower Office Building would be a fitting honor to a great American \nleader in war and in peace, and a fitting recognition of a grand \nAmerican building. For that reason, this naming is supported by Stephen \nAmbrose, the well-known Eisenhower biographer; William Seale, the \nauthor of the White House Historical Association's history of the White \nHouse; Senator Bob Dole, World War II veteran and distinguished public \nservant; and the Eisenhower family. It is no wonder that S. 1652 has \ngarnered strong and bipartisan support.\n  Let me extend my appreciation to the Senate leadership for setting \naside this day to consider S. 1652. I look forward to its passage by \nthe Senate today, and its ultimate enactment by Congress this year. I \nthank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from Stephen Ambrose, William \nSeale, and Bob Dole, and an editorial by Jim O'Connell, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Ambrose Tubbs, Inc.\n\n                                    Helena, MT, September 7, 1999.\n     Senator John Chafee,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chafee: I am eager to join Bob Dole, John \n     Eisenhower, Susan Eisenhower and the many others who are \n     supporting naming the Old Executive Office Building after \n     General and President Eisenhower.\n       Almost a decade ago I was on a committee to do something to \n     recognize Eisenhower's 100th birthday. Andrew Goodpaster was \n     the chairman. At our first meeting I said we need a statue of \n     him or a building in Washington named for him. I was about \n     laughed out of the room. I was told there was no way the \n     Democrats were going to honor Eisenhower in our nation's \n     capital. I protested--if a statue, put him in uniform, I \n     said: if a building, call it General Eisenhower. Plus which, \n     I said, every general from the Civil War has a square in the \n     nation's capital named for him, usually with a statue. Why \n     not Ike? You can see how far I got.\n       Renaming the Old Executive Office Building for him would be \n     appropriate as well as much deserved. He served in the \n     building in the early 1930's as an aide to General Douglas \n     MacArthur, then Chief of Staff, U.S. Army. In the late \n     1950's, as President, Eisenhower saved the building from \n     demolition.\n       Eisenhower was the leader in war and in peace of the men \n     and women who saved our country and democracy. Surely \n     something can be done in Washington to pay at least a bit of \n     our eternal respect and gratitude to this great man.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stephen E. Ambrose.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Alexandria, VA,\n\n                                                 January 13, 1998.\n     Mr. James J. O'Connell,\n     Vice President, Ceridian Corp.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. O'Connell: Thank you for your letter of December \n     18 about the OEOB. I am interested that you propose that it \n     be named for President Eisenhower. Long ago, Congressman \n     Howard W. Smith told me about a meeting he had with a \n     committee charged with the ``problem'' of that building. An \n     architectural firm was determined to demolish it, and had at \n     least a thousand reasons why the old building needed a new \n     replacement (doubtless in steel and aluminum). The committee \n     was not really happy about it, but listened. Then they had a \n     meeting President Eisenhower attended, fresh from heart-\n     attack recovery. The architect made a very great point about \n     the terrible stairs in the building and how hard they were on \n     heart patients. Eisenhower suddenly interrupted and said \n     something like, ``Nonsense. My doctors require that I climb \n     so many steps a day for the good of my heart.'' Somehow, the \n     tide turned at that point and the old building was saved. \n     Judge Smith concluded with, ``It was a perfectly good \n     building. Well built. No need to destroy it.''\n       You have a good idea and a perfectly valid one. When in the \n     company of that great structure, and all its complex \n     architectural detailing, I like to think of all the lives \n     that have passed through it, all the great men and even \n     unknown great men and women that make up its story.\n       Do you think you will have competition from General Grant? \n     The building is usually considered the best example of the \n     ``General Grant'' style of American architecture. I prefer \n     Eisenhower, because it would appear that he was the one who \n     saved it, even before the era of preservation really began.\n       I appreciate your kind remarks. Certainly I have been lucky \n     to have the White House as a vehicle for my history studies.\n       Every best wish,\n           Sincerely,\n     William Seale.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                  August 23, 1999.\n     Hon. John H. Chaffee.\n       It was good to talk to you last week and I'm delighted you \n     support naming the Old\n\n[[Page S12855]]\n\n     Executive Office Building after President Eisenhower. It's \n     something that will touch the heart of every World War II \n     veteran, indeed of every American who remembers Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower as one of America's greatest 20th century leaders \n     in peace and war.\n       Our 34th president is virtually unrecognized in the \n     Nation's Capital. Eisenhower biographer Stephen Ambrose \n     agrees fully that no fitting tribute to Eisenhower exists in \n     Washington, DC. Dr. Ambrose supports naming the OEOB after \n     Ike and would be pleased to write a letter voicing this \n     support.\n       The OEOB, called the ``State, War & Navy Building'' from \n     1888 until 1947, is Washington's most distinguished office \n     building. Eight future Presidents served in the building \n     before becoming President--Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, \n     as Assistant Secretaries of the Navy; William Howard Taft, as \n     Secretary of War; Herbert Hoover, as chief of the post-WWI \n     allied relief operations; and Vice Presidents Lyndon Johnson, \n     Gerald Ford and George Bush. Twenty-four secretaries of state \n     served in it.\n       General Eisenhower himself served in the building from \n     1929-1935, as senior aide to General Douglas MacArthur and as \n     Army Chief of Operations. Furthermore, noted architect and \n     foremost White House historian William Seale tells us that \n     former Congressman Howard W. Smith credited Eisenhower with \n     saving the building from demolition in the late 1950s. Seale \n     is the author of ``The White House: The History of An \n     American Idea.''\n       The present name of this 19th century masterpiece is \n     largely an historical accident. After State vacated in 1947, \n     the building became known simply as the ``Executive Office \n     Building.'' When a new executive office building opened on \n     17th Street in 1965, the Executive Office Building became the \n     ``Old'' Executive Office Building.\n       Naming the OEOB for Dwight Eisenhower would give us the \n     opportunity to honor the former State, War and Navy Building \n     with a proper name. At the same time, it would pay a unique \n     tribute to Dwight D. Eisenhower, whose contributions to our \n     nation are symbolized by this building that served him well \n     during both his military and presidential careers. I spoke \n     last week with Susan Eisenhower about this proposal, which \n     was brought to her for the family's consideration. Susan, her \n     father John, and other family members are supportive. They \n     were deeply touched that the idea has been suggested and that \n     the Nation might honor President Eisenhower in this way.\n       Because OEOB is an ``office'' on the GSA Public Buildings \n     Survey, I understand that the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works would have jurisdiction over legislation to name \n     OEOB after Eisenhower. For many reasons, therefore, you are \n     the best person to champion this legislation in the Senate. I \n     predict many co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle\n       This year we mark the 30th year since Eisenhower's death. \n     More and more World War II vets are retiring from Congress. \n     We need to act quickly to introduce a bill, report it out of \n     Committee and encourage timely action in the House. I hope \n     you will be able to introduce legislation shortly after the \n     Senate reconvenes in September. I will do everything I can \n     personally to help you round up co-sponsors. And we will get \n     letters of endorsement from individuals and organizations to \n     support your leadership.\n       I would be delighted to put your staff in touch with a few \n     people who have done the preliminary research on the OEOB. \n     Maybe this would be helpful as your staff works to draft \n     appropriate bill language. We can also provide assistance in \n     drafting a floor statement and a ``Dear Colleague'' letter \n     and lining up cosponsors when you have a draft bill that can \n     be circulated among your Senate colleagues.\n       I look forward to hearing from you soon and providing any \n     help you need with this important legislation to recognize \n     the leader of The Greatest Generation. This would be \n     particularly appropriate as the American century draws to a \n     close and we enter the new millennium.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Dole.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 10, 1997]\n\n               A Building by any Other Name than the OEOB\n\n                           (By Jim O'Connell)\n\n       Now that Congress and the White House have reached \n     agreement on balanced budget legislation, they can turn their \n     attention toward addressing another overdue issue: a new name \n     for the Old Executive Office Building (OEOB). Washington's \n     most remarkable office building, perhaps the finest example \n     of French Second Empire architecture in America, has a name \n     remarkable only for its blandness--and that came to it by \n     default.\n       The 19th century Victorian masterpiece was begun in 1871 \n     and completed in 1888. Originally, it was called the State, \n     War and navy Building after its first occupants. Twenty-four \n     secretaries of state served there, and the former State, War \n     and Navy libraries recall that illustrious past. Today, the \n     OEOB houses the offices of the vice president.\n       In 1947, after the last secretary of state vacated the \n     premises, White House offices moved in, and the building came \n     to be known as the Executive Office Building (EOB). That \n     nondescript label reflected the new executive branch \n     tenants--the National Security Council and the Budget Bureau \n     (now the Office of Management and Budget). Never mind that \n     the town had plenty of other executive office buildings.\n       But in 1965 EOBers faced a dilemma: A new executive office \n     building was about to open just north of the EOB. If the 1965 \n     structure was ``new,'' then the 1888 vintage building must be \n     old. With Washington's fascination with acronyms, the \n     building soon became known as the OEOB. What would architect \n     Alfred B. Mullet have said to that?\n       This 19th century treasure merits better--much better. \n     Given its role and its location beside the White House, it \n     should have a name that honors one of our presidents. Five \n     possibilities came to mind:\n       The Roosevelt Executive Office Building. On the plus side, \n     both Roosevelts worked in the building as assistant Navy \n     secretaries. On the minus: Both are memorialized already, \n     Franklin recently in West Potomac Park and Teddy in the woods \n     at Roosevelt Island.\n       The Grant Executive Office Building. Ulysses S. Grant was \n     president when the groundbreaking for the building occurred \n     in 1871. Also, Second Empire architecture reached its zenith \n     during his presidency--indeed it was sometimes called the \n     ``General Grant Style.'' While the Union general is \n     memorialized at the west front of the Capitol, Washington had \n     no monument to Grant the president.\n       The Cleveland Executive Office Building. Grover Cleveland \n     was president at the 1888 completion of the building. After \n     four years of living next to the construction project, our \n     22nd president took a one-term hiatus--coming back to be our \n     24th president.\n       The Truman Executive Office Building. President Truman \n     occupied the White House in 1947, when the State Department \n     moved out. At that point, the building's name had to be \n     changed, and the bland EOB name came into use. It seems only \n     fitting that consideration be given to naming the building \n     after ``Harry,'' even if he did call the building ``the \n     greatest monstrosity in America.''\n       The Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Long before \n     becoming commander of allied forces in Europe in World War \n     II, Dwight D. Eisenhower worked in the building as Army chief \n     of operations and military aide to Chief of Staff Douglas \n     MacArthur. The five-star general's distinguished Army career \n     echoes the building's military past--two bronze Spanish \n     cannons captured in 1898 are still in place at the \n     Pennsylvania Avenue entrance. And Eisenhower no doubt played \n     a role in helping the building survive a 1957 recommendation \n     of the Advisory Committee on Presidential Office Space that \n     EOB be replaced with a modern office complex. The Kennedy \n     Center's Eisenhower Theater is faint praise indeed for this \n     American hero.\n       After a half-century, it's time to honor the old State, War \n     and Navy Building with a new name and in so doing pay lasting \n     tribute to a former president.\n       Myself--I like Ike!\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the authors of this legislation \nfor working to bring this bill to the floor. I had the privilege of \nworking under President Eisenhower as Assistant to the Secretary of the \nInterior and Solicitor of the Interior Department. I am proud to have \nserved under President Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n  In 1947 President Eisenhower said of our democracy:\n\n       The American system rests upon the rights and dignity of \n     the individual. The success of that system depends upon the \n     assumption by each one of personal, individual responsibility \n     for the safety and welfare of the whole. No government \n     official, no soldier, be he brass hat or Pfc., no other \n     person can assume your responsibilities--else democracy will \n     cease to exist.\n\n  This sentiment is still true today. It speaks to the timelessness of \nPresident Eisenhower's thoughts and efforts and it offers us a glimpse \nof how he approached his duties and his life in general.\n  Ike was a good soldier who got most of his insight into government \nfrom his experience at West Point. His focus was on duty, honor and \ncountry. To him, the role he was given by the American people is \noutlined in the Constitution and he followed the language of the \nConstitution to the best of his ability. Also known as an \n``internationalist'', he believed in friendship and peace. Ike ran for \nPresident because of concern that too many people were afraid of other \ncountries and believed that if we were to have peace in the world then \nwe need friendships with other countries.\n  Eisenhower as our leader made many decisions that we live by today. \nUnlike many who currently seek and obtain political offices, he was \nconcerned with making the right decisions and not with what his legacy \nwould be. Today's leaders should and do build on the leadership of the \npast--leadership that he provided and taught us to emulate.\n  The period of Ike's Presidency was an interesting and important \nperiod in the history of our country--particularly for my State and the \nState of my good\n\n[[Page S12856]]\n\nfriend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye. President Eisenhower originally \nopposed statehood for Alaska in his first term. In 1950 you needed a \npassport or birth certificate to return to the ``south 48'' from \nAlaska. Today we remember the phrase ``Taxation without \nrepresentation''. It was true back then, especially for those of us who \nfought and returned from WWII. It was demeaning and unfair. As everyone \nknows, we won the statehood fight and it turned out to be good for the \npeople of Alaska and the country as a whole.\n  In working for Alaska statehood under President Eisenhower I found \nthe ability to work freely, but with his full support. Bill Ewald, a \ngood friend of mine, is quoted in the book ``Eisenhower \nthe President'':\n\n       . . . in the end . . . the greatest glory must go to \n     Eisenhower. He chose his lieutenants, gave them the freedom \n     to think and to innovate, backed them to the hilt despite his \n     qualms, and thus produced an outcome that, in retrospect, \n     remains a triumph of his administration.\n\n  Only 40 years later Alaska provides 25 percent of all U.S. oil \nproduction, and 50 percent of fish consumed in the United States is \ncaught off Alaska's shores.\n  Eisenhower believed that a modern network of roads is ``As necessary \nto defense as it is to our national economy and personal safety''. \nUnder his leadership, the Federal Aid-Highway Act of 1956 authorized \n41,000 miles of highways (later adjusted to 42,500) by 1975. By 1980, \n40,000 miles were completed. Today there are more than 42,700 miles in \nthe system. Citizens of no nation on Earth can equal the mobility that \nis available to the majority of Americans via our National Highway \nSystem. A study in 1994 found that the fatality rate for interstate \nhighways is 60 percent lower than the rest of the transportation system \nand the injury rate is 70 percent lower. The U.S. Army cited the \nInterstate Highway System as being critical to the success of the \nDesert Shield-Desert Storm Operation because it allowed for the rapid \ndeployment of troops and equipment to U.S. ports for deployment \noverseas.\n  In the area of defense, Ike's efforts could not be eclipsed. His \nleadership in pushing for adequate funding of our defense system led to \nthe successes we enjoy today. With the strongest military power on \nEarth, and with new and effective weapon systems in our arsenal, we \nshould look to the past and give Ike credit for his vision on our \nnational defense.\n  In his 1961 farewell address, President Eisenhower said:\n\n       America is today the strongest, the most influential and \n     most productive nation in the world . . . America's \n     leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched \n     material progress, riches and military strength, but on how \n     we use our power in the interests of world peace and human \n     betterment.\n\n  It was President Eisenhower's hope as we all pursue our careers, \nregardless of the path we take, that we would remember his words and \nwould do our best to be a ``foot soldier'' in his battle to ``wage \npeace.'' I still consider myself one of Eisenhower's ``foot soldiers''.\n  Naming the Old Executive Office Building after President Eisenhower \nis a fitting tribute to the man who save the world and I am proud to \ncosponsor this legislation.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I join the chorus of voices calling for the \nOld Executive Office Building to be renamed in honor of Dwight D. \nEisenhower.\n  President Eisenhower had a direct connection to the building. He \nworked there as an aide to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, and as Army Chief of \nOperations. As President, he saved the building from demolition.\n  But of course the reasons for commemorating President Eisenhower in \nthis way are far more profound than his historical connection to the \nbuilding.\n  At the close of this century, America is the world's lone \nsuperpower--due in large part to the leadership of President Eisenhower \nfrom 1953-60, the years when the course to our current position of \nsupremacy was being charted.\n  A world power structure going back several centuries was shattered by \nWorld War II. America had made a grave mistake after World War I by \nretreating into isolationism. Fortunately, after the Second World War, \nthe United States recognized its responsibility to assume leadership of \nthe free world in the global confrontation with communism. The man most \nresponsible for solidifying America's postwar position was Dwight D. \nEisenhower.\n  Eisenhower, former supreme allied commander in World War II and then \nsupreme commander of the new North Atlantic Treaty Organization, \nunderstood perhaps better than any man of his time how the world was \ninterconnected--and how America's destiny was intertwined with the \ndestinies of its friends and enemies throughout the world. He was not \nafraid to lead in foreign policy.\n  Nor was he afraid to lead in domestic policy, especially in race \nrelations. We think of the 1960s as the decade of civil rights, but it \nwas President Eisenhower who ordered the complete desegregation of the \nArmed Forces. It was President Eisenhower who sent Federal troops to \nLittle Rock, Arkansas, to guarantee compliance with a court order for \nschool desegregation.\n  Naming the Old Executive Office Building for Dwight D. Eisenhower is \na fitting way to honor the many ways he contributed to the building of \nthe greatest nation the world has ever seen.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee legislation to name the Old \nExecutive Office Building after one of Kansas' sons, former President \nDwight David Eisenhower.\n  Although Congress is portrayed in the press as mired in gridlock over \nbudget caps and campaign finance reform, the Senate does rise above the \ndaily political battles and pass commonsense bipartisan legislation \nthat the American public is often unaware of because it lacks the \nsizzle for front page headlines or evening news sound bites.\n  The Senate passage of S. 1652 formally recognizes former President \nEisenhower's dedication and faithfulness to the United States. This \nKansan rose from his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry at \nWest Point to Supreme Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, \nwhere he directed one of the most ambitious invasions in military \nhistory.\n  At the end of his military career, Eisenhower embarked on his \nsuccessful candidacy for President of the United States. Eisenhower's \nbiographer, Stephen Ambrose, wrote in his introduction to ``Eisenhower \nThe President'' that ``Dwight Eisenhower is one of only two Republicans \n(the other was Grant) to serve two full terms as President. Along with \nthe two Roosevelts, he is the only twentieth-century President who, \nwhen he left office, still enjoyed wide and deep popularity. And he is \nthe only President in this century who managed to preside over eight \nyears of peace and prosperity.''\n  America liked Ike.\n  We in Kansas are always honored when we can share our admiration for \nDwight David Eisenhower with the rest of the Nation including the \nDwight David Eisenhower National Highway System and the Eisenhower \nPresidential Center in Abilene, Kansas.\n  My own family has strong ties to Ike and the Eisenhower years. My \nfather, Wes, played a key role in Eisenhower's presidential nomination \nand his election. He served as Republican national chairman for Ike.\n  Naming the Old Executive Office Building after former President \nEisenhower is fitting because this building is almost as historic as \nthe White House. Former Presidents Theodore and Franklin D. Roosevelt, \nTaft, Johnson, Ford, and Bush, and Eisenhower himself, all had offices \nin this building before becoming President. This ornate building is one \nof the most impressive buildings in Washington and some believe its \nstyle epitomizes the optimism and exuberance of the post-Civil War \nperiod when it was constructed. Throughout his government career, Ike \nalso conveyed these feelings to his troops and the American people \ntherefore this recognition is well-deserved.\n  I am glad that my Senate colleagues agreed to expedite the passage of \nthis bill and hope the other body takes quick action. It builds on last \nweek's celebration in Kansas of former President Eisenhower where the \nState of Kansas made his birthday Dwight D. Eisenhower Day in Kansas. \nMore importantly, our state leaders provided schools with curricula on \nEisenhower\n\n[[Page S12857]]\n\nto teach and remind children of this great leader.\n  For my colleagues reading and information, I ask unanimous consent \nthat an editorial from the Topeka Capital Journal be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Dwight D. Eisenhower Finally Gets His Day\n\n       It is not hyperbole at all to say this: Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower stands as one of the 20th century's towering \n     figures--and among what may have been history's most heroic \n     generation, he was a giant.\n       This Kansas-reared man's memory is still celebrated today \n     in the hamlets of Europe he helped free from Nazi oppression \n     and occupation as supreme Allied commander in World War II.\n       Meanwhile, in a wax museum dedicated to all the U.S. \n     presidents in Gettysburg, Pa., Eisenhower's likeness has been \n     lifted out of its chronological place and given its own \n     spotlight for visitors to appreciate. His life, his career, \n     his achievements, his impact on the world were that \n     significant.\n       Yet, the state that claims him, and which he claimed as a \n     youth and at his death in 1969, has done precious little to \n     observe his honored place in history.\n       Until now.\n       This week, Abilene, site of the Eisenhower Library and \n     Museum, feted the 34th president in a three-day celebration \n     ending today with a conclusion of a Veterans of Foreign Wars \n     vigil at 8 a.m., wreath layings at 10:30 and 11 a.m., a \n     children's bicycle parade at 1:30 and the unveiling at 2 p.m. \n     of a statute of a boyish Eisenhower at the downtown mini-\n     park.\n       Thursday, on his birthday and officially Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower Day in Kansas, schoolchildren released balloons, \n     heard music and speeches (including one by Ike's \n     granddaughter, Anne Eisenhower) and celebrated with a \n     birthday party and concert that night.\n       Just as important, curricula on Eisenhower was sent to \n     schools statewide.\n       It's hard to believe we've gone this long before \n     proclaiming a day for Eisenhower--the state's most famous and \n     celebrated figure.\n       ``He really is a world-renowned figure,'' said state Sen. \n     Ben Vidricksen, R-Salina, who sponsored the legislation \n     leading to this long-overdue observance.\n       Though born in Denison, Texas, Eisenhower spent his \n     formative years in Abilene, Kan., where they regard him as a \n     local boy who grew to become a hero.\n       ``He was a wonderful role model,'' said Kim Barbieri, \n     education specialist with the Eisenhower Foundation.\n       ``Even his critics never questioned his honesty and \n     sincerity,'' said one author. ``As a general, he commanded \n     the greatest army in history. As a president, he dedicated \n     himself to fighting for peace.''\n       Indeed, though a product of the military, Eisenhower once \n     warned the American people to guard against ``the acquisition \n     of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the \n     military-industrial complex.''\n       Though his was one of the poorer families in Abilene, it \n     was predicted in the Abilene High School year-book in 1909 \n     that Eisenhower would go on to be president--Dwight's \n     brother, Edgar Eisenhower, that is. Dwight was supposed to go \n     on to be a history professor at Yale.\n       The prediction was off slightly, of course. And because of \n     that, the world is a better place--and millions of people are \n     free today.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to add my support to S. \n1652, a bill to designate the Old Executive Office Building located at \n17th and Pennsylvania, here in the District of Columbia, and the Dwight \nD. Eisenhower Executive Office Building.\n  I remind my colleagues of the many accomplishments and selfless \ncontributions of our 34th President. His strong character and \nremarkable achievements have made him a role model for many young \npeople worldwide. As a native of Kansas myself, it is an honor to \ncommemorate this fellow Kansan by associating his name with a \nremarkable architectural landmark like the Old Executive Office \nBuilding.\n  Born 25 years after the end of the civil war, Dwight David Eisenhower \nwas the third son of David and Ida Eisenhower. He spent his formative \nyears sharing a crowded house with five brothers in Abilene, Kansas. He \nsought and received an appointment to West Point. In 1927 he entered \nArmy War College here in Washington, DC. His early Army career saw \nrapid advancement through the ranks. Within 11 years, he was chief \nmilitary aide to Gen. Douglass MacArthur and by the age of 40 served as \nArmy Chief of Operations. While holding these positions, Eisenhower \noccupied several offices in the Old Executive Office Building and spent \nmany hours walking the white marble tile corridors.\n  On June 6, 1944, he was Supreme Commander of the D-Day Normandy \ninvasion. Through his actions and duties, his name became synonymous \nwith heroism. Just 6 months later, he was promoted to U.S. Army's \nhighest ranking, General of the Army.\n  After the war, Eisenhower's popularity with the American people \nsoared. In 1948, he actually received the nomination for President from \nboth political parties but declined the honor. Instead, he became the \npresident of Columbia University in New York City. Fear of communist \nbuilt-up and disappointment with the mismanagement of the Korean war, \nconvinced Eisenhower that he had a duty to run, and in 1952 he received \nthe Republican nomination for President.\n  Eisenhower's two terms as President of the United States saw many \nprogressive and important accomplishments. After inauguration, he \nsigned a truce that brought an armed peace along the border of South \nKorea and effectively ended the war. In 1956, he sponsored the first \ncivil rights bill since Reconstruction. Eisenhower signed legislation \ncreating the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and \nwitnessed Alaska and Hawaii become States. His public works programs \nincluded the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1954 and the Interstate Highway \nSystem in 1956, the largest construction project in history. Perhaps \nEisenhower's greatest feat during his presidency was making and keeping \nthe peace with communist countries. Eisenhower seldom boasted, but he \nonce summed up one of the proudest accomplishments of his presidency in \nthese words: ``The United States never lost a soldier or a foot of \nground in my administration. We kept the peace. People asked how it \nhappened--by God, it didn't just happen, I'll tell you that.''\n  Dwight D. Eisenhower attributed his success and good fortune to ``. . \n. a lifetime of continuous association with men and women . . . who . . \n. gave others inspiration and guidance.'' His parents, church, and \ncommunity were first among them. The small town environment of Abilene, \nKansas taught him ambition without arrogance and self-dependence with a \nconcern for others. President Eisenhower never forgot where his \nstrength or that of the Nation came from. In June of 1954, an amendment \nwas made to add the words ``one Nation under God'' to the Pledge of \nAllegiance. Eisenhower remarked, ``In this way we are reaffirming the \ntranscendence of religious faith in America's heritage of future; in \nthis way we shall constantly strengthen those spiritual weapons which \nforever will be our country's most powerful resource in peace and \nwar.''\n  So, in renaming this most historic structure, we celebrate not only \nthe accomplishments of President Eisenhower, but the strong, loving \nfamily and nurturing community of his youth which helped propel him to \ngreatness. These are the values with which we attempt to equip our \nchildren and prepare great leaders for our future.\n  Many of the young people of our country have little or no idea who \nthis great American was or what his leadership in both war and peace \nmeant to the nation and the world. It is my hope that when Americans \nvisit the Dwight D. Eisenhower Executive office Building, a curiosity \nabout his heritage is evoked in children and adults alike, and people \nare inspired by his example.\n  I encourage all Senators to support this bipartisan legislation and \nhonor our former President and wartime leader Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I voted in favor of cloture on the \namendment denominated the Daschle amendment, which was the Shays-Meehan \nbill, because I believe comprehensive campaign finance reform is highly \ndesirable. The bill, as embodied in the Daschle amendment, would \neliminate soft money for all issue advertising. I believe that is \nsound.\n  I voted to oppose cloture to the Reid amendment, which would curtail \nsoft money for issue advertising for only six committees: The \nRepublican National Committee, the Democratic National Committee, the \nRepublican Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee, the Republican House Campaign Committee, and the \nDemocratic House Campaign Committee.\n  It is my view that if soft money is to be prohibited on issue \nadvertising, then soft money should be prohibited across the board. To \napprove the lesser provisions of the Reid amendment, which would affect \nonly six political campaign committees, would be unfair, because other \norganizations could use soft money for issue advertising.\n  That is the distinction on my vote on the Daschle amendment where I \nvoted for cloture contrasted with the Reid amendment where I opposed \ncloture.\n  Furthermore, I believe the comprehensive reform embodied in the \nShays-Meehan bill is what ought to be adopted. The bill has another \nvery important provision; and that is the provision relating to the \nchanging of the definition of ``express advocacy'' and ``issue \nadvocacy.'' At the present time, issue advocacy would incorporate an \nadvertisement, which could detail the ways one candidate is bad, and \nhis opponent is good. But as long as the ad did not say, ``Vote for the \nopponent; vote against the candidate,'' it is considered issue \nadvertising. That is totally unrealistic. Shays-Meehan would make an \nimportant change on that provision.\n  I would add one caveat as to constitutionality. All of this is \nsubject to some very stringent tests under the Buckley decision. I \nbelieve before we are going to get comprehensive campaign reform, we \nneed to overrule the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States \nin Buckley v. Valeo.\n  Senator Hollings and I have proposed constitutional amendments now \nfor more than a decade. I would not consider amending the language of \nthe first amendment, but I disagree when a Supreme Court decision, made \nby a divided Court--says that money is equivalent to speech for the \nindividual person but not for contributors. I ran in 1976 in a \ncontested primary against my good friend, the late Senator John Heinz. \nIn the middle of that campaign, the Supreme Court of the United States \ndecided that an individual can spend millions, where my opponent spent \na considerable amount of money--but as my brother he was limited to a \n$1,000 contribution. His speech as an individual contributor, was \nlimited in the context, where my brother could have financed a \ncampaign. Ultimately, we are going to have to change the Buckley \ndecision.\n  To repeat, I would not change the language of the first amendment. \nBut, I think other legal judgments, perhaps mine included, would be as \ngood as the Supreme Court Justices who decided Buckley v. Valeo.\n  But I do believe that if there is to be a curtailment of soft money, \nit ought to be done as Shays-Meehan did it in the Daschle amendment; \nnot with the Reid amendment, which would limit only six political \ncommittees and leave others in a position to finance soft money \ncampaigns, which would be an uneven playing field and unfair.\n  Mr. EDWARDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, our political process is diseased. The \nvirus causing that disease is money. The worst virus of all is what is \nknown as soft money. The people of America, including folks I grew up \nwith in a small town in North Carolina, no longer believe their vote \nmatters. As a result, they do not go to the polls; they do not \nparticipate. They have completely disengaged with their Government and \nthe political process.\n  We have to do something in the Senate to bring those people back, to \nmake the people all over this country believe again that this is their \nGovernment. We have to make people believe again that their Government \nup in Washington is not some foreign thing that has nothing to do with \nthem and nothing to do with their lives, but, in fact, they have \nownership of this Government; this is their Government. It doesn't \nbelong to the Senators who participate in this body; it belongs to the \npeople, every single one of them. We must make them believe again that \nwhen they go to the polls and vote, their vote counts every bit as much \nas anybody else's vote and that their voice in the process is as loud \nand clear as anybody else's.\n\n  The reality is, people have disengaged for a two major reasons. One \nis the influx of big money. I don't think it is an accident that during \nthe widening of the soft money loophole and the boom of big soft money \ncontributions over the last several years that allows people to write \nchecks for $100,000, $200,000, $500,000, completely unregulated, \nunmonitored--that during this same period of time voter turnout has \nsteadily declined.\n  The simple reason for that is, average Americans, average North \nCarolinians, believe their voice is being drowned out by big money. \nThese people, who have good sense, their gut tells them that when \nsomebody else writes a check for $100,000--first of all, most of them \ncan't afford to write a check for $25 for a political candidate, much \nless $100,000--that there is no way in their life experience they are \ngoing to be listened to, that they are going to have the access to \ntheir Senator or to their Congressman that the person who writes these \nbig money checks has. It is just that simple. They are not on a first-\nname basis with their Senator, they are not on a first-name basis with \ntheir Congressman, but these people who write $100,000 checks are.\n  We have to do something about that. That problem--that cynicism, the \ndistrust, the belief that Government up in Washington has nothing to do \nwith them--is what keeps them from going to the poll.\n  Unfortunately, this problem of the influence of big money is \ncompounded when they turn on their television sets in October before an \nelection, and what do they see on television? They see hateful negative \npersonal attacks, many of which are funded with big money, soft money, \nunregulated money contributions. These negative political ads are the \nsecond major reason people are not engaged in the political process. It \nis the reason that they don't vote and that they are cynical about \ngovernment and cynical about politics. It is also the reason they don't \nencourage their kids to get involved in government. It is the reason \nthey themselves don't participate, because they believe in their hearts \nthat the process has been corrupted. The result of that corruption is, \nthey want nothing to do with it. They don't want their family to have \nanything to do with it. They don't want their kids to have anything to \ndo with it.\n  It used to be that public service was a very noble calling, before \nthis extraordinary influx of big money and these spiteful \nadvertisements we have seen over the last few years. We have to do \neverything in our power to return power in this Government where it \nstarted and where it belongs, which is with average Americans going to \nthe polls.\n  One of my constituents wrote to me. I think he said it very well. I \nam quoting Jason McNutt. He said:\n\n       Our democracy is threatened by the amounts that wealthy \n     special interests are spending on politics. Ordinary citizens \n     like myself have very little influence. . . The American \n     democracy has been corrupted by big money.\n\n  He is exactly right. Mr. McNutt is expressing a feeling that, at a \ngut level, people all over this country have. And that feeling of \ndisenchantment is what we have to address.\n\n[[Page S12860]]\n\n  I heard an extended debate last week between Senator McCain, who has \nshown great and courageous leadership on this issue, and another \nSenator. Basically the interchange was, point out to us what Senators \nhave been corrupted. A large part of the debate had to do with \nquestions and answers about which Senators had been corrupted.\n  I have been in the Senate for about 9 months.\n  The men and women I serve with here are far from corrupt. They are \nhard-working people who do what they think is right and, even when we \ndisagree, I have enormous respect for my colleagues in this body. That \nrespect has done nothing but grow during the time I have been here.\n  The problem with the debate, though, is it is not about what Senators \nare corrupt. That focus is wrong. That is about us. This debate is not \nabout us. This debate is about the folks who have quit voting. It is \nabout parents who don't want their kids involved in politics, who don't \nwant their kids involved in Government. They have this feeling in their \nstomach that there is something wrong. They could not articulate to you \nwith great specificity what is wrong, but they know something is wrong. \nThere is no place I would put greater confidence than in the gut \nunderstanding of the American people. It is the reason they are not \nvoting anymore and not participating.\n  The single biggest loophole that we have today is soft money. I \nstrongly support comprehensive, across-the-board campaign finance \nreform, to return power to regular people. But the reality is that what \nwe have a chance of passing in this Congress is a ban on soft money. \nThat doesn't solve the problem, there is no question about that; we \nwill continue to have other problems in other areas. But if we keep \nputting this off, not addressing the issue and voting it down on a \nprocedural basis, even though a majority of the Senators voted in favor \nof campaign finance reform, we have not sent the right signal to the \nAmerican people. We have a responsibility--I believe I have a personal \nresponsibility to the people that I represent all over North Carolina--\nto say that we are going to do what we can do. We are going to send you \na powerful signal that we are starting the process of solving this huge \nproblem.\n  The simplest way to send that signal is to ban soft money--to ban it \ntomorrow. Let's put a stop to this unregulated flow of huge sums of \nmoney that are coming into our political system. This ban alone won't \nsolve the problems facing our political system. Nobody believes it \nwill. But it will send a powerful message across this country that we \ncare, that the people in this Senate care about how average Americans \nfeel about the process. Because if we don't ban soft money, we send the \nsignal that we don't care, that all we care about is ourselves, our own \nelections, and we don't care about the people out there across this \ncountry who are no longer going to the polls. We have to do something \nabout that. They need to hear a loud and powerful message from us.\n  We can address the other issues as we go forward. But, first, we have \nto make it clear to the people of America that we are willing to do \nsomething and that we are focused on them, their concerns, and their \nworries and not just ourselves and our elections. That is what we need \nto do, Mr. President.\n  The bottom line is, we ultimately have to return power in this \nGovernment to where it started, which is with regular people going to \nthe polls. We have to return democracy to its roots, because that is \nhow this country began. Over the course of the last 200 years--\nparticularly over the course of the last 10 years--that has changed. \nFolks back home know in their hearts and souls, without seeing it, that \nthese powerful people who write big checks, the big special interests, \nare having an enormous influence over what happens up here. It bothers \nthem. You know, it ought to bother them, because they are right. We \nhave to say something back to these people who are worried, who aren't \nvoting anymore and don't want their kids involved in Government and \npolitics. I, myself, in my last campaign, made a decision not to accept \ncontributions from PACs and Washington lobbyists, which is nothing but \na small step along this road. But we as a body have to send a message, \nand that message should be loud, clear, and unequivocal. The message is \nthat we are returning power in your democracy to you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/19/senate-section/article/S12860-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
