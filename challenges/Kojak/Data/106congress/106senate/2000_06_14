The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the leadership determined the Senate will \nreturn to consideration of this very important piece of legislation. I \nshall now read the order that was devised by the leaders.\n  Today, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of S. 2549, \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill. As a reminder, there are \nan overwhelming number of amendments in order. In an effort to complete \naction on the bill, those Senators with amendments are encouraged to \nwork with the bill managers during today's session.\n  Of course--I think I am joined by my distinguished ranking member--we \ndesire to try our very best to continue to consider only those \namendments that are actually germane to the purpose of this bill. That \nis my hope. Votes are expected throughout the day, and Senators will be \nnotified as votes are scheduled.\n  Senators should be aware that consideration of the Transportation \nappropriations bill may begin as early as the leadership determines. \nHopefully, also, last night we agreed among the leadership to vote on \nthe nominee for the Department of Energy, General Gordon. There will be \nsome announcement to that effect later today.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes. I want to finish up.\n  Mr. BYRD. Did not the clerk read ``a bill making appropriations''? \nDid not the clerk read ``a bill making appropriations'' being the \nbusiness before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill is to authorize appropriations.\n  Mr. BYRD. Parliamentary inquiry: What is the business before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. S. 2549 is the bill before the Senate. It is \nto authorize appropriations.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank our distinguished colleague.\n  It had been my hope to lay aside the Smith amendment to which is \nattached the McCain amendment regarding campaign finance issues. I have \nbeen advised there is an objection to laying that aside. There is a \npossibility that objection could be raised solely for the purpose of \nthe managers of the bill, Mr. Levin and myself, proceeding to clear \namendments that have been agreed to on both sides. I am just not at the \nmoment able to assure the Senate that is in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for clarification----\n\n[[Page S5060]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum call has been requested.\n  Mr. WARNER. I urge us to proceed with the quorum call.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have had a discussion with the leaders \non the other side of the aisle. I think there is a consensus that with \nthe current objection to laying aside the Smith-McCain legislative \npackage, which is the pending business, together with the Warner-Dodd \namendment, which also needs a UC to lay aside, we cannot do either of \nthose at this time. So the consensus is we go into a period of morning \nbusiness, and at the hour of 11 o'clock the Senator from Virginia be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, at the hour of 11 o'clock \nwe would then return to the consideration of the matter that is now \npending?\n  Mr. WARNER. Right, and that I be recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. And that the Senator from Virginia be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, it is my \nunderstanding, of course--and I think it is our understanding \ncollectively--that for the next 1 hour and 15 minutes, until 11 \no'clock, there would be no substantive legislative issues that would be \nintroduced in any manner.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct. I understand that is under the rules \nguaranteed. We should, I think to accommodate our distinguished \ncolleagues who have been waiting----\n  Mr. REID. We should get that.\n  Mr. WARNER. Get the order entered. I was going to include a specific \ntime for the President pro tempore, the former distinguished majority \nleader, and such others who want to be recognized during morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 6 minutes be allocated to \nthe distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina and----\n  Mr. REID. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Twenty minutes be allocated to our distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Byrd, and then the morning would flow in morning \nbusiness until 11 o'clock.\n  Mr. REID. And all the reservations that were announced would be \nsubject to the unanimous consent request that has been propounded?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 223 years ago today, the United States \nwas engaged in its war for independence. I note that the American \nContinental Army, now the United States Army, was established by the \nContinental Congress, just 2 years earlier on June 14, 1775. I express \nmy congratulations to the United States Army on its 225th birthday.\n  At the start of that war, American colonists fought under a variety \nof local flags. The Continental Colors, or Grand Union Flag, was the \nunofficial national flag from 1775-1777. This flag had thirteen \nalternating red and white stripes, with the English flag in the upper \nleft corner.\n  Following the publication of the Declaration of Independence, it was \nno longer appropriate to fly a banner containing the British flag. \nAccordingly, on June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress passed a \nresolution that ``the Flag of the United States be 13 stripes alternate \nred and white, and the Union be 13 stars white in a blue field \nrepresenting a new constellation.''\n  No record exists as to why the Continental Congress adopted the now-\nfamiliar red, white and blue. A later action by the Congress, convened \nunder the Articles of Confederation, may provide an appropriate \ninterpretation on the use of these colors. Five years after adopting \nthe flag resolution, in 1782, a resolution regarding the Great Seal of \nthe United States contained a statement on the meanings of the colors: \nred--for hardiness and courage; white--for purity and innocence; and \nblue--for vigilance, perseverance, and justice.\n  The stripes, symbolic of the thirteen original colonies, were similar \nto the five red and four white stripes on the flag of the Sons of \nLiberty, an early colonial flag. The stars of the first national flag \nafter 1777 were arranged in a variety of patterns. The most popular \ndesign placed the stars in alternating rows of three or two stars. \nAnother flag placed twelve stars in a circle with the thirteenth star \nin the center. A now popular image of a flag of that day, although it \nwas rarely used at the time, placed the thirteen stars in a circle.\n  As our country has grown, the Stars and Stripes have undergone \nnecessary modifications. Alterations include the addition, then \ndeletion, of stripes; and the addition and rearrangement of the field \nof stars.\n  While our Star-Spangled Banner has seen changes, the message it \nrepresents is constant. That message is one of patriotism and respect, \nwherever the flag is found flying. Henry Ward Beecher, a prominent 19th \ncentury clergyman and lecturer stated, ``A thoughtful mind, when it \nsees a nation's flag, sees not the flag only, but the nation itself; \nand whatever may be its symbols, its insignia, he reads chiefly in the \nflag the Government, the principles, the truths, and the history which \nbelong to the nation that sets it forth.''\n  Old Glory represents the land, the people, the government and the \nideals of the United States, no matter when or where it is displayed \nthroughout the world--in land battle, the first such occurrence being \nAugust 16, 1777 at the Battle of Bennington; on a U.S. Navy ship, such \nas the Ranger, under the command of John Paul Jones in November 1777; \nor in Antarctica, in 1840, on the pilot boat Flying Fish of the Charles \nWilkes expedition.\n  The flag has proudly represented our Republic beyond the Earth and \ninto the heavens. The stirring images of Neil Armstrong and Edwin \nAldrin saluting the flag on the moon, on July 20, 1969 moved the Nation \nto new heights of patriotism and national pride.\n  Today we pause to commemorate our Nation's most clear symbol--our \nflag. An early account of a day of celebration of the flag was reported \nby the Hartford Courant suggesting an observance was held throughout \nthe State of Connecticut, in 1861. The origin of our modern Flag Day is \noften traced to the work of Bernard Cigrand, who in 1885 held his own \nobservance of the flag's birthday in his one-room schoolhouse in \nWaubeka, WI. This began his decades-long campaign for a day of national \nrecognition of the Flag. His advocacy for this cause was reflected in \nnumerous newspaper articles, books, magazines and lectures of the day. \nHis celebrated pamphlet on ``Laws and Customs Regulating the Use of the \nFlag of the United States'' received wide distribution.\n  His petition to President Woodrow Wilson for a national observance \nwas rewarded with a Presidential Proclamation designating June 14, 1916 \nas Flag Day. On a prior occasion President Wilson noted:\n\n       Things that the flag stands for were created by the \n     experiences of a great people. Everything that it stands for \n     was written by their lives. The flag is the embodiment, not \n     of sentiment, but of history. It represents the experiences \n     made by men and women, the experiences of those who do and \n     live under the flag.\n\n  Flag Day was officially designated a national observance by a Joint \nResolution approved by Congress and the President in 1949, and first \ncelebrated the following year. This year then marks the 50th \nanniversary of a Congressionally designated Flag Day.\n\n[[Page S5061]]\n\n  It is appropriate that we pause today, on this Flag Day, to render \nour respect and honor to the symbol of our Nation, and to review our \ncommitment to the underlying principles it represents. Today, let us \nreflect on the deeds and sacrifices of those who have gone before and \nthe legacy they left to us. Let us ponder our own endeavors and the \ninheritance we will leave to future generations.\n  Finally, as we commemorate the heritage our flag represents, may we \nas a nation pledge not only our allegiance, but also our efforts to \nfurthering the standards represented by its colors--courage, virtue, \nperseverance, and justice. Through these universal concepts, We the \nPeople can ensure better lives for ourselves and our children, for \nthese are the characteristics of greatness. In doing so, we can move \ncloser to the goal so well stated by Daniel Webster at the laying of \nthe cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument on June 17, 1825. On that \noccasion he said:\n\n       Let our object be our country, our whole country, and \n     nothing but our country. And, by the blessing of God, may \n     that country itself become a vast and splendid monument, not \n     of oppression and terror, but of Wisdom, of Peace, and of \n     Liberty, upon which the world may gaze with admiration \n     forever.\n\n  I have long supported legislation which imposes penalties on anyone \nwho knowingly mutilates, defaces, burns, tramples upon, or physically \ndefiles any U.S. flag. I have also supported a constitutional amendment \nto grant Congress and the States the power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the U.S. flag. I regret that earlier this year this \nSenate failed to adopt a Resolution for a flag protection \nConstitutional amendment.\n  I am pleased that last year the Senate adopted a Resolution to \nprovide for a designated Senator to lead the Senate in reciting the \nPledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States. This has added \ngreatly to the opening of the Senate each day.\n  Mr. President, today I encourage my colleagues and all Americans to \ntake note of the history and meaning of this 14th day of June. We \ncelebrate our Flag, observing its 223rd birthday, and the 225-year-old \nArmy which has so proudly and valiantly defended it and our great \nNation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank Mr. Warner, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Virginia, and Mr. Harry Reid, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada, for accommodating the President pro tempore, Mr. Thurmond, \nand me at this time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5061-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5061-S5063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESIDENTIAL POWER\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Friday, June 9, I noted with particular \ninterest the headline in The Washington Post which read, ``Bush Aims at \n`Discord' in Capital.'' Not surprisingly, candidate Bush's solution to \ntoo much partisanship in Washington is to increase the power of the \nPresidency.\n  We have heard that before. We have heard it from the current \nPresident, and we have heard it from previous Presidents. But now we \nhear it again. Imagine that. The solution to too much partisanship in \nWashington is to increase the power of the President.\n  Now imagine that! Among the ``power grabs'' the candidate advocates \nare biennial budgeting, a congressional budget resolution which would \nhave to be signed by the President--get that--a version of the line-\nitem veto--how preposterous--and a commission to recommend ``pork-\nbarrel projects for elimination.'' What a joke.\n  While I readily agree with candidate Bush that there is too much \npartisanship in Washington, and have said so repeatedly for years, the \nsolutions candidate Bush proposes will do absolutely nothing to \neliminate partisanship. In the highly unlikely event that any of these \nproposals will ever be enacted, their most likely impact would be to \nhand the next President a club with which to beat into submission \nmembers of Congress who might not be leaning the President's way on key \nissues of importance to him.\n  None of these reported Bush solutions to disharmony in Washington are \nnew, nor are they ``news.'' Every President in recent history has tried \nto wrest more power from the people's duly elected representatives and \ntransfer it to the executive branch. The net effect of all such \ntransfers would be that unelected executive-branch bureaucrats, and, \nthe President, who is not directly elected by the people either, would \nenjoy an increased advantage in forcing their agenda on this Nation.\n  Make no mistake about it. The carefully crafted constitutional checks \nand balances between the branches of Government can slowly be subverted \nover time by just such proposals as these, which candidate Bush has \nmade. While I agree that the climate in Washington these days is less \nthan inspiring, the cure must never be to advocate a weakening of the \nconstitutional checks and balances under the false colors of \nconstructive reform.\n  Take, for instance, Mr. Bush's proposal to have a commission \nrecommend certain pork-barrel projects for elimination. This is an idea \nwhich, conceptually, goes straight at the heart of representative \ndemocracy and at its most important tool, the power of the purse. It is \na proposal which exposes an absolute ignorance and disregard of the \nconstitutional grant of spending power to the representatives--and I am \none of them--of the 50 States. Moreover, when examined closely, the \narrogance of such an approach is close to appalling.\n  To suggest that an appointed commission could somehow understand the \nneeds of the 50 States in terms of public works better than the men and \nwomen who are sent here to represent those States, defies logic and \ndenigrates the people's judgment in the choice of their own Members of \nCongress. Imagine a commission that would be set up to make judgments \nabout appropriations concerning infrastructure, about bridges, roads, \nhighways, canals, harbors, rivers in this country. That is why the \npeople sent us here; that is our responsibility. No member of a \ncommission can possibly understand the needs of the State I represent--\nI defy anyone to contend otherwise--and have been proud to represent \nfor 54 years, better than I, and others in the West Virginia \ndelegation. No commission can tell me or tell the people of West \nVirginia what they need by way of infrastructure, so-called ``pork \nbarrel'' projects. The same can be said about the Members from other \nStates. I defy anyone to claim that sort of wisdom to the satisfaction \nof myself or the citizens of my State. Such a claim would be sheer and \nutter nonsense!\n  I realize that the term ``pork-barrel'' has become symbolic in modern \nparlance of everything that is wrong with Government. But, in fact, one \nman's ``pork-barrel'' project is another man's essential road, another \nconstituency's essential road or bridge or dam. What is totally \nforgotten is that many of these so-called ``pork barrel'' projects are \nthe sort of infrastructure improvements which, State by State, combine \nto help to make this country the economic power house that it has \nbecome. Now, Webster debated with Hayne in 1830. That has all been \nplowed over by Webster at that time.\n  It is easy to oppose infrastructure projects in another Member's \nstate. I wouldn't do it unless there was outright fraud involved. It is \neasy to claim that if a project does not benefit me or my State, then \nit must be wasteful. Of course, when it comes down to it, they don't \nbenefit me personally. They benefit the people I represent. But, the \nMembers of Congress on both sides of the aisle generally grant each \nother the expertise to know what is essential for their own State's \nwell-being. I believe that I would be a poor judge, indeed, of what is \ngood for California or New Mexico or Arizona, and so I generally rely \non the Members of those States when it comes to projects which they \ndeem important.\n  I also assume that the elected representatives of those states have \nthe wisdom and integrity not to advocate foolish or wasteful endeavors. \nFederal dollars are and have been scarce for years. Congressional \nspending is watched closely by representatives of the media and by the \nvoters who send us here. What is not watched so closely by the media or \nthe voters who send us here or the voters who indirectly send the \ntopmost occupant of the White House to his position is executive branch \nspending. Although the voters may be only dimly aware of waste and \nduplication vigorously advocated and defended each year by the \nexecutive\n\n[[Page S5062]]\n\nbranch, I can assure everyone within the sound of my voice and everyone \nwatching through the electronic eye that it exists in the executive \nbranch.\n  Talk about pork barrel; take a look at the executive branch! A more \nuseful commission might be one that is charged to look at executive \nbranch excesses and report yearly to the Congress.\n  How about that? Let the candidates for the Presidency and Vice \nPresidency take that on. Let both candidates, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore, \ntake that on. Look at the executive branch, see what the excesses are \nthere, weed out the pork barrel.\n  As for any attempt to negate the decisions of the people's duly \nelected representatives through any form of line-item veto process, I \nassure the new President--and I don't know who will be the new \nPresident just yet, but I can assure the new President, whether he be a \nRepublican or a Democrat, whether he be Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore--it \ndoesn't make any difference to me in this respect--whichever party he \nmay represent, that that proposal concerning a line-item veto will \nencounter a solid stonewall from this Senate, as it has always \nencountered such a wall.\n  We slew that dragon once in the courts, didn't we? Yes, we slew that \ndragon in the courts. Thank God for the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, certainly in that incidence. We slew that dragon once in the \ncourts, and it will raise its ugly head again only with very great \ndifficulty. Any proposal which seeks to bury a dagger in the heart of \nthe most powerful check which the Constitution provides on an \noverreaching President will encounter serious opposition right here on \nthis floor, and right here at this desk. Amen! May God continue to give \nme the voice with which to speak and the legs on which to stand to \nfight this dragon, wherever it may appear.\n  The power over the purse--a power derived through centuries of \nstruggle and bloodshed--a power that protects the people of this Nation \nfrom the whims of a fool or knave in the White House--has been \nbequeathed to the people's branch in our national charter. It is not \nthere through any accident. It is there through no luck of the draw. It \nis there because the framers understood the lessons of history and had \nthe wisdom to know that a King or a President must be made controllable \nby the people in this most fundamental, this most basic way.\n  By its very nature, any proposal which hands to the President an easy \nmeans by which to threaten a Member with the cancellation or \nredirection of moneys for that Member's State, after those moneys have \nbeen appropriated in law by the Congress, gives the President undue and \nunwise leverage over Members of Congress in a way that completely \nalters the nature of the separation of powers.\n  Ask any Governor or former Governor who has had the tool of a line-\nitem veto at his disposal what he found to be its principal value. You \nwill probably get an answer that indicates that the major usefulness of \nthe line-item veto is a means to bully certain uncooperative members of \nthe State legislature. I urge candidate Bush and I urge candidate Gore \nand all of their advisers to read afresh article I of the U.S. \nConstitution. Read it again. Pay particular attention to it. The intent \nof the framers is crystal clear.\n  As for biennial budgeting, at the moment, I am not so sure about \nthat. With respect to biennial appropriations, however, I am very sure. \nI would be very opposed to that. I fear that with biennial budgeting \nthere may be some unintended consequences. With respect to biennial \nappropriations, I still fear that the consequences of such a change \nmight ultimately mean massive supplemental appropriations bills to \ncover contingencies which no human mind can predict, such as \nearthquakes, floods, droughts, wars, or recessions.\n  While biennial appropriations are always touted for their supposed \nnatural byproduct--more oversight--I believe that, in the real world, \nthe kind of massive supplemental appropriations bills which will likely \noccur as a result of any such biennial appropriations, if we ever reach \nthat point, will receive very little in the way of thorough oversight.\n  In truth, most of our serious budget problems derive not from yearly \nappropriations, but from the ever-growing mandatory spending and \nentitlement programs. Dealing with politically difficult entitlement \nand mandatory spending reform demands the kind of study, analysis, \nconsensus, leadership, and courage that no process tinkering can \nreplace. One thing I have learned after 48 years in this town is that \nwhen hard decisions press down on politicians, process reform often \nbecomes the solution of choice.\n  I also noted in the same Post article--and I must admit with some \namusement--that while candidate Bush decries polling, he appears to \nhave been paying at least some modicum of attention to the polls, else \nhow would he know that ``Americans look upon the spectacle in \nWashington and they do not like what they see''? I am quoting from the \nreported story. Perhaps he has found some direct way to channel the \nviewpoints of the people, but I rather think he has been doing a little \npoll watching of his own.\n  The trouble with election year poll watching is that it makes us \npoliticians think we have to instantly respond, either to get a \nheadline or get a vote. As one might expect, these quickie candidate \nresponses are often neither very responsive nor very wise.\n  No, the climate in Washington today cannot be improved by any such \ncommission, as has been recommended, or any budget process change, or \nany power grab by the executive branch. The problems here have to do in \npart with this being an election year and in part with more fundamental \nmatters. If we in this body could just begin to do away with the \nsimplicity of labeling each other as devils, and each other's proposals \nas ruinous to the Republic and, instead, worked to promote a freer, \nless rancorous exchange of debate and discussion on this floor, I \nbelieve that much of the pointless partisanship might begin to \ndissipate.\n  The partisanship we all complain about is born, at least partially, \nfrom the frustration of not being permitted to adequately and openly \ndebate issues and ideas important to our constituencies and to the \nNation.\n  I believe that once we begin to do what our people sent us here to \ndo, which is grapple with the nation's challenges, exchange views, and \nlearn and profit from those exchanges, we will see a return of most of \nthe lost public confidence which may have been reflected in somebody's \npolls. Legislating in a Republic--and it is a republic, not a \ndemocracy. I want to say that again. We pledge allegiance to the flag \nof the United States of America and to the Republic--not to the \ndemocracy.\n  Well, legislating in a republic can never be a totally neat, \nefficient, and tidy endeavor. In a nation as large and diverse as our \nown, which bears heavy responsibilities both domestically and \ninternationally, the way to wisdom usually lies in the often tedious, \nrarely orderly, free flow of informed debate. Consensus is what we need \nto aim for, and consensus is best built by an airing of views. The \nFramers knew this and gave the Congress the power to legislate, tax and \nappropriate because of that fundamental understanding. But, absolutely \nbasic to that kind of informed discussion and debate is respect among \nthose of us charged with conducting it, for the motives, experience, \nexpertise, and opinions of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. \nRegrettably no shop-worn set of budget process changes can mandate \nthat. And the American people should view with an especially jaundiced \neye any finger wagging presidential candidate with an agenda all his \nown who wants to transfer power to himself in order to quiet \ncongressional ``discord.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the June 9, 2000 \nWashington Post article.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 9, 2000]\n\n                  Bush Aims At ``Discord'' In Capital\n\n                           (By Dana Milbank)\n\n       Knoxville, TN, June 8.--Texas Gov. George W. Bush today \n     offered a broad plan to take the partisan poison out of \n     Washington--in large part by transferring power from Congress \n     to the president.\n       The GOP presidential candidate pointed to the budget and \n     confirmation battles of the last decade that have left scars \n     on Republicans and Democrats and have turned off many \n     Americans.\n       ``If the discord in Washington never seems to end, it's \n     because the budget process never seems to end,'' Bush told \n     about 600 people in\n\n[[Page S5063]]\n\n     brilliant sunshine outside the Knoxville Civic Auditorium. He \n     decried an environment of ``too much polling and not enough \n     decisionmaking.''\n       ``Americans look upon the spectacle of Washington and they \n     do not like what they see,'' Bush declared. ``I agree with \n     them. It's time for a change.''\n       Bush proposed revamping the federal budget process to shift \n     budget-making from an annual to a biennial exercise and to \n     require the president and Congress to agree on spending \n     targets early in the process, to prevent government \n     shutdowns.\n       Bush also said he would target wasteful spending by \n     restoring a version of the line-item veto and installing a \n     commission to recommend pork-barrel projects for elimination, \n     a nod to one of the favored issues of his former rival Sen. \n     John McCain (R-Ariz.). In addition, he proposed soothing \n     partisan tensions by calling on Congress to approve the next \n     president's executive and judicial nominations within 60 \n     days.\n       Even on their day of bipartisanship, Bush and his \n     supporters took a couple of partisan shots. ``All we have \n     heard from my opponent are the familiar exaggerations and \n     scare tactics,'' Bush told the crowd in Vice President Gore's \n     home state. ``Proposals he disapproves of are never just \n     arguments; they're `risky schemes.' This kind of unnecessary \n     rhetoric is characteristic of the tone in Washington, D.C. \n     It's the `war room' mentality.''\n       Gov. Don Sundquist (R) introduced Bush by saying of his \n     proposals: ``You're right on every one and Gore is wrong.''\n       The likeliest opponents of Bush's proposals are members of \n     Congress in both parties, particularly those in charge of \n     spending legislation. Many of Bush's proposals--biennial \n     budgeting, the line-item veto, the anti-pork commission and \n     limiting the confirmation process--amount to a transfer of \n     power from the legislative to the executive branch. When the \n     House recently attempted to add a biennial budgeting proposal \n     to a budget reform measure, 42 Republicans joined a large \n     number of Democrats in killing it.\n       The Clinton administration has supported the line-item veto \n     and biennial budgeting, and Gore advisers said most of the \n     rest of Bush's proposals are unobjectionable. But Chris \n     Lehane, Gore's spokesman, sought to undermine Bush's \n     credibility as a reformer. He said that Bush promised to \n     create an office overseeing the reform of Texas government \n     but that, ``to date, no such office has been put together.''\n       This is the second time this spring Bush has focused a \n     major speech on changing the tone of Washington. While some \n     of the details in today's speech will resonate more with \n     political insiders, the overall message, as with his earlier \n     remarks at a GOP fundraiser in Washington, is aimed at a \n     broader audience.\n       ``I recognize it's a little dry, but it's a necessary \n     reform,'' Bush told the crowd. ``If anybody pays attention, \n     people in Washington will pay attention.'' He added: ``I \n     don't see this resonating with intensity across America.''\n       Bush said he got encouraging responses from McCain and \n     Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete V. Domenici (R-N.M.).\n       House and Senate members said Bush's ideas would get a \n     respectful hearing on Capitol Hill, although proposals \n     requiring Congress to relinquish power over the nation's \n     purse strings likely would encounter resistance. As for \n     Bush's call for cracking down on pork-barrel spending, Rep. \n     David L. Hobson (R-Ohio), a senior member of the \n     Appropriations Committee, said: ``In the abstract it sounds \n     good, but in the real world of government there's always \n     going to be some of that.''\n       Today's speech is part of a package of reform proposals. On \n     Friday, Bush will speak about cutting the budget and making \n     government services more efficient. Among other things, he \n     will propose devoting the off-year in the biennial budget \n     process to examining which government programs should be \n     eliminated.\n       Biennial budgeting, used in about 20 states, including \n     Texas and Virginia, would free lawmakers to devote more time \n     to other duties. Bush also would write the budget in non-\n     election years to reduce partisan tensions. He told reporters \n     aboard his campaign plane that his proposals would \n     ``contribute to fiscal sanity.'' However, Bush advisers \n     acknowledged, it would be easy for Congress to pass \n     supplemental spending measures, even in non-budget years.\n       As part of Bush's budgeting proposal, he would require a \n     joint budget resolution to be signed by the president to \n     provide a framework. If Congress and the president couldn't \n     agree, they would use the president's budget or the previous \n     year's, whichever were lower, to prevent a government \n     shutdown. A similar process was used with continuing budget \n     resolutions in the 1980s. The anti-shutdown provision is the \n     one proposal that could draw serious objections from Gore. \n     One Democrat argued that it would ``put Congress on \n     autopilot.''\n       Bush's line-item veto provision seeks to avert the pitfalls \n     that caused a similar measure passed by Congress to be struck \n     down by the Supreme Court. Instead of giving the president \n     the power to cancel spending outright, it would allow him not \n     to release certain funds. This is similar to the \n     ``impoundment'' power used by presidents until Watergate-era \n     reforms took it away because of President Nixon's zealous use \n     of it.\n       In his speech, Bush decried the ``unreasonable delay and \n     unrelenting investigation'' in the approval of presidential \n     nominations, an implicit rebuke of Senate Republicans. But he \n     did not recommend that the Senate act on President Clinton's \n     long-delayed appointments.\n       Bush said the 60-day provision should apply to whoever is \n     the next president. But he seemed to have a pretty good idea \n     of who that will be. ``As president, I'm here in Knoxville, \n     Tennessee,'' he said at one point during his speech.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, is it the case we are in a period of \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5063-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5063-S5064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SANCTIONS ON FOOD AND MEDICINE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, while we are waiting for the managers of \nthe Defense authorization bill to continue--I understand they are \ntrying to work out some arrangements on the bill itself--I wanted to \nmake a couple of comments about an issue I intend to raise as an \namendment on the Defense authorization bill. At the risk of being \nrepetitious, which I think is probably advantageous in this Chamber, I \nwant to speak again about the issue of using sanctions that are now \nbeing employed by the United States of America on the sale or shipment \nof food and medicine to other countries. Those sanctions are wrong. We \nought not use sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine to other \ncountries. Yet we are, so far, unable to repeal sanctions on the \nshipment of food and medicine.\n  We almost got it repealed last year. Seventy Senators voted to repeal \nthe use of sanctions by the United States on the shipment of food and \nmedicine to other countries--70 Senators voted for that--but we went \ninto a conference and we were hijacked, literally legislatively \nhijacked by the Members of the House. So we still have sanctions on the \nshipment of food and medicine to many parts of the world.\n  I also have included this year in the Agriculture appropriations \nbill, a repeal of the use of sanctions for food and medicine shipments. \nThat appropriations bill will come to the floor of the Senate at some \npoint. But I understand, procedurally, the legislative leaders can \nhijack it once again with a number of parliamentary approaches. I may \nvery well be in a situation where I, Senator Gorton, who cosponsored \nthe bill in the Appropriations Committee, Senator Ashcroft, and others, \nwould have a wide majority of Senators and Representatives who believe \nthe sanctions that exist on the shipment of food and medicine to other \ncountries in the world should be repealed. But despite the fact we \nperhaps have 60, 70, or 80 percent of the entire Congress who believe \nthat, we have been unable to get it done. For that reason, I intend to \noffer it as an amendment on the Defense authorization bill.\n  Let me describe just a bit what this issue is. First of all, this is \nvery unfair to America's family farmers. I represent a farm State. Our \nfamily farmers are told you should have the freedom to farm. That is \nthe title of the farm bill we have--Freedom to Farm. That all sounds \ngood except farmers don't have the freedom to sell. Our farmers raise \ngrain and they can't sell it in Cuba, they by and large haven't been \nable to sell it in Iran, they can't sell it in Libya, Iraq, Sudan, \nNorth Korea--why? Because we believe these countries are operating \noutside the international norms. We don't like these countries. We \ndon't like what Cuba does. We don't like the behavior of Libya or Iraq \nor North Korea. So we say we are going to have a set of sanctions to \npenalize these countries--economic sanctions. That is fine with me. I \nam all for creating economic sanctions to try to hurt Saddam Hussein.\n  But I would say this: Everybody in this Chamber knows when you take\n\n[[Page S5064]]\n\naim at a dictator by imposing sanctions on food and medicine, you aim \nat the dictator and you hurt hungry people; you aim at a dictator and \nyou hurt sick people; you aim at a dictator and you hurt poor people. \nIt is true in every one of these countries. Sanctions are fine, but we \nought never include sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine.\n  This country needs to understand that and learn that. The legislation \nI have introduced with my colleagues, Senator Gorton from the State of \nWashington, Senator Ashcroft, Senator Dodd, and others, is very simple. \nIt says all current sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine \nshall be abolished within 180 days--gone. This country will not use \nfood and medicine as a weapon.\n  Second, no President will be able to impose sanctions on the shipment \nof food and medicine unless he comes to the Congress and gets an \naffirmative vote by the Congress to do so. In other words, this ends \nthe sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is a subject in which I have been heavily involved, \nas have others. Senator Dodd and I on repeated occasions have put \nlegislation up, I presume comparable to what the Senator has in mind. I \nclearly associate myself with the Senate's goals.\n  As a matter of fact, on the authorization bill for the Department of \nDefense, there is a Warner-Dodd amendment which asks for the \nappointment of a commission, to be appointed by President Clinton, \ndrawing on nominees from not only the President but the majority, the \nDemocratic leader, and others in the Congress, to begin to focus on a \nbroad range of policy considerations with regard to the relationship \nbetween the United States and Cuba. So I am highly supportive. I have \nlistened to the Senator enumerate a few Senators, and with a lack of \nhumility I ask my name be included among those who strongly support, as \nI have now for 2 years, with Senator Dodd and others, the lifting of \nparticulars. If we are to make any inroads on the Government in Cuba, \nit has to be done people to people. What better way than food and \nmedicine because if there is anything that does not have the taint of \npolitics, it should be food and medicine. So I commend my colleague.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Virginia, of course, has been involved \nin this issue. I certainly agree the embargo has not worked. I mean, 40 \nyears of embargo with respect to Cuba, speaking only now of Cuba, ought \nto tell us that when a policy doesn't work, you should change the \npolicy--especially that portion of the policy that deals with food and \nmedicine. It is immoral, in my judgment, for this country to use food \nas a weapon. It is not only unfair to our farmers--I have talked about \nthat at some length-- It is unfair to say to farmers we have the \nfreedom to farm but not the freedom to sell. But it is immoral for this \ncountry to use food as a weapon. I want to change it.\n  The Senator from Virginia described the support for this. I don't \nknow if he heard me say I intend to offer it as an amendment on the \nDefense authorization bill. That will not be deemed a great pleasure by \nthe Senator from Virginia, I am sure, but the only opportunity I have \nto get this done is to put it in legislation that is going to go to the \nPresident.\n  The legislative leaders have the opportunity in the appropriations \nprocess to strip this from the appropriations bill. They did it last \nyear and they are going to do it this year. This year I am not going to \nsit back and say: That's fine; we do all this work and we get rid of \nthe food and medicine sanctions in appropriations, only to have you \nhijack it in conference or with some parliamentary procedure, and at \nthe end of the day this country still prevents the sale of food and \nmedicine to the poor people in Cuba and Iraq and Libya. That is not \nsomething I am willing to accept. It is not going to happen anymore.\n  I mentioned previously I sat in a hospital in Havana, Cuba, last year \nwhen I visited Havana--sat in a hospital in an intensive care room and \nwatched a 12-year-old boy in a coma. His mother, at a bedside vigil, \nwas holding this boy's hand--and in an intensive care room--there was \nno beeping going on because there was no machinery or equipment there. \nThis hospital had no equipment for a young boy in a coma in intensive \ncare. The doctor at that hospital said, ``We are out of 250 different \nkinds of medicine; we don't have it. We are just out of it.''\n  And our country says we cannot move medicine to Cuba? We cannot sell \nmedicine to Cuba? We can't sell food to Cuba? It doesn't make any sense \nto me.\n  I have been to many of the poor countries around the world. I do not \nwant to be a part of a government that says we want to continue to use \nfood as a weapon; we want to continue to use food and medicine as \nweapons. That is fundamentally wrong. It is a wrongheaded public \npolicy.\n  Again, I say to the Senator from Virginia, I do not think he heard \nme. He has been a strong supporter of these issues. I have great \nrespect for him. He will not be pleased that I intend to offer this as \nan amendment to the Defense authorization bill at some point. I feel I \nmust do that because it is the only way we will get it done. The \nlegislative leaders intend to strip this out of the appropriations \nprocess. The only opportunity for the Members of the House and Senate \nto express their will is to put this in a bill that is going to be \nsigned by the President.\n  Do I understand the managers wish to do some business?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will be kind enough to withhold, without \nlosing his right to the floor, we have a unanimous consent agreement we \nwould like to have entered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5064-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5064-S5065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection, Mr. President. We support this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, just further administrative observation by \nmyself, I thank the distinguished colleagues on the other side for \ntrying to work it out such that at some point this morning Senator \nLevin and I may move to consideration of 40 or more cleared amendments \non the Defense authorization bill.

Mr. President, I apologize to my friend from North Dakota. \nI hope during the next hour and 15 minutes we can also make some \nprogress toward getting rid of a number of the amendments, in addition \nto those cleared. I hope we can move in an orderly fashion to dispose \nof the Smith amendment, as amended. We can move forward and give \nSenator Dodd an opportunity to move forward with what he desires to do.\n  In effect, I hope we can do more than just deal with cleared \namendments. The arrangement between Senators Lott and Daschle is that \nwe would have the right on a subsequent piece of legislation to \nlegislate. That is what we want to do. We have cooperated. We have \nmoved expeditiously in getting rid of that very large Defense \nappropriations bill in a matter of a day and a half. I hope in the next \nhour and a half we are able to come up with a formula whereby we move \nto the legislative authorization bill and do some legislating.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will consult with my distinguished \nleader on that subject.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator from Virginia will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I agree with the comments that were made, \nand I know the desire is to move the Defense authorization bill forward \nwith some dispatch. I indicated previously that I intend to offer an \namendment dealing with sanctions on food and medicine. There are \nnational security issues which have compelled us to impose sanctions, \nwhich include food and medicine, on countries.\n  We have debated this at great length. We had 70 votes for this policy \nlast year in the Senate. Seventy percent of the Senate said they want \nto strip out food and medicine sanctions. We also have this in our \nappropriations bill, but I understand the legislative leadership is \ngoing to strip it out, and they have the capability from a \nparliamentary standpoint to do that.\n  The only option for those of us who want to get this policy done is \nto put it in a bill that is amendable, like this bill. It is my \nintention to offer an amendment. I will accept a short time limit when \nI do so. It is not my intention to hold things up. This has been \ndebated at great length, and 70 percent of the Senators said we want to \nend sanctions on food and medicine with respect to sanctions that exist \naround the world.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I advise my distinguished colleague of the \nfollowing situation: One of the amendments pending at the desk is a \nWarner-Dodd amendment which establishes a Presidential commission to \nexamine the overall policy between the United States and Cuba. It is my \nintention, if the parliamentary situation develops and I can do this, \nto ask that that amendment be withdrawn.\n  I do that with the greatest reluctance, but I have an obligation as \nmanager of this very critical piece of legislation, the annual \nauthorization for the Armed Forces of the United States, to compromise \nin my own objectives. One of them, of course, is to support the \nSenator's goals and to support the establishment of a commission. I \nhave to do that because two colleagues, very respectfully, in a very \nfriendly and forthright manner, told me that if the Warner-Dodd \namendment remains on the authorization bill, we can anticipate--and I \nuse the magic words--a prolonged debate on the Warner-Dodd amendment. \nThat prolonged debate, I have to interpret, is a means by which to \ndeprive the ability of the managers to move forward in an expeditious \nmanner on the authorization bill.\n  In recognition of that, I have indicated to my two distinguished \ncolleagues and good friends that I am going to withdraw my amendment, \nif I can, from a parliamentary standpoint. I can only anticipate those \ntwo Members, and indeed probably others, will indicate to the managers \nthat should the distinguished colleague from North Dakota desire to \noffer that amendment, whether it is today or at some future time that \nwill be available, we can anticipate prolonged debate on the armed \nservices authorization bill. That is as much as I can say at this point \nin time.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand that. The two managers, \nSenator Warner and Senator Levin, are doing a remarkable job of trying \nto move this legislation forward. It is not my intent to cause \ndifficulties, but I do not want one or two Senators holding up the will \nof 70 percent of the Senate, saying this country ought not use food and \nmedicine in sanctions anymore.\n  If I were assured by somebody that the efforts we have underway--\nSenator Ashcroft, myself, Senator Gorton, Senator Dodd, and others--to \nstrike these sanctions of food and medicine in other pieces of \nlegislation that are coming to the floor were somehow protected, that \nwould be one thing. It is quite clear to me, and the leadership said to \nme publicly: We intend to dump them; it does not matter how many people \nsupport it, we intend to dump them, get rid of them.\n  The only opportunity I have is to force my way into this bill. If we \nhave an up-or-down vote on this, 70 percent of the Senate and 70 \npercent of the House says this country will never use sanctions on the \nshipment of food and medicine, which is wrong, and the only chance I \nhave to do that is on a piece of legislation such as this.\n  As my colleague knows, we seldom have a piece of legislation on the \nfloor that is open for amendment. This one is. I give the Senator my \nassurance that we do not need long debate on this at all. We can debate \nthis in a very short order because we had extensive debate last year. \nSeventy Senators said let us not any longer use food and medicine on \nsanctions.\n  Mr. WARNER. The distinguished Senator knows the rules of the Senate, \nand further I sayeth not.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend from North Dakota \nwill yield.\n  First, I join Senator Warner in thanking him for allowing, with such \ngraciousness, as always, the interruption of his presentation.\n  Secondly, he has a very important amendment. It is an amendment on \nwhich this Senate has voted, and this vehicle is a perfectly legitimate \nvehicle for legislation. It is one of the few opportunities we have for \nlegislation. It is because there are such few opportunities that it has \nattracted this many potential amendments. I do not think anyone needs \nto apologize for that.\n  Senator Warner--the way he works so well--and I will attempt to work \nwith him and attempt to accommodate Senators who wish to offer \namendments to this legislation. They need no apologies. We will try to \nwork through it.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for not just intending to offer \nan important amendment again, but being willing to take a very short \ntime agreement on it, which means we can move the bill along.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my good friend from Michigan and I have a \nresponsibility to get the bill passed. I have been discouraging, as \nbest I can, colleagues from bringing to the floor amendments which are \nnot clearly germane to the central purposes of the annual authorization \nbill.\n  I hope I am not interpreting his comments as inviting, in contrast to \nmy discouraging, such amendments. It is going to take a joint effort.\n  I commend our distinguished colleague, Senator Reid of Nevada. He has \nbeen most helpful, and Senator Lott on my side has supported me in \ntrying to get this bill moving. As a matter of fact, Senator Lott has \ngiven us this time this morning. He has represented to me he will try \nhenceforth to give us time in between appropriations bills, which \nunderstandably is the prime function of the Senate.\n  Please, let us not encourage matters by way of amendment which are \nnot clearly germane to this bill.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. If my good friend will yield for a comment on that, I \nhappen to share with him the desirability of moving this bill, but I \nalso understand the need of colleagues to offer legislation in the \nSenate. That is why we are here.\n  The way I would accomplish the goal which the good Senator from \nVirginia has just laid out--a goal I share--would be to encourage \ncolleagues who feel strongly about amendments, as the\n\n[[Page S5066]]\n\nSenator from North Dakota does, and understandably so, to agree to \nshort time agreements. The shorter the time agreement we can get on \nsome of these amendments, particularly amendments which have been \ndebated for a long time before, is a way in which we can expedite the \npassage of the bill, and that is the way in which I think effectively \nwe can do that.\n  Mr. WARNER. We ought to conclude this saying no matter how laudatory \nit is to get short time agreements, practically speaking I can think of \nseveral amendments on our side which will not be given short time \nagreements on the other side and reciprocally is the situation. We \nought to stick to the premise of bringing up those matters that are \ngermane.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I can think of amendments on both sides that could require \nextensive debate, but there may be occasions where cloture is an \nappropriate way in this Senate. We have rules for that. With some of \nthese amendments which have been waiting to be offered for so many \nmonths, I think the best way to do it is deal with them within the \nrules of the Senate. Happily, this is not one of those amendments. We \nshould not in any way suggest the amendment of the Senator from North \nDakota is involved in that particular issue. He is willing to take a \nshort time agreement. I think we ought to put that in the bank, get \nthis amendment up early, and dispose of it.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, given the shortness of the hour, we should \nyield the floor so our colleague can finish. Perhaps there are others \nwho wish to speak, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5066-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5066-S5067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SANCTIONS IN FOOD AND MEDICINE--Continued\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might continue, let me again speak of \nmy admiration for the two managers. This isn't a case, however, of \nbeing either encouraged nor discouraged with respect to amendments. It \nis about the rules of the Senate. And I know the rules. I have the \nright to offer the amendment, and I will do that, but I will do that \nwith consideration to the two managers, understanding that they have a \njob to do to try to get this bill out. So I will do it in a manner that \nsays, let's have a reasonable time agreement.\n  But this is about national security. The reason we have imposed \nsanctions on other countries is because we have national security \ninterests about the behavior of these countries. And if, in the \ninterest of national security, we have said this country shall continue \nto impose sanctions on the shipments of food and medicine, then I say \nthis country is wrong, and we must change the law.\n  We had been close to changing the law last year but failed, because \nthere are only a few people--a handful of people; determined people--in \nthe Congress who insist that they want to continue using food and \nmedicine as a weapon.\n  The absurdity of it, of course, is that Saddam Hussein has never \nmissed a meal. Does anybody think Saddam Hussein has ever missed \nbreakfast because we are not able to send much food to Iraq? Does \nanybody think that Fidel Castro has missed dinner because we have \nimposed sanctions on the shipment of food to Cuba? If either of them \ntake medication, do you think they miss their daily dose of medication \nbecause we have sanctions? Of course they have not missed either dinner \nor medication. Saddam Hussein and Fidel Castro do just fine, thank you.\n  It is hungry people, sick people, and poor people who live in their \ncountries who are injured by this. It is not the best of America to say \nwe want to include sanctions on the shipment of food and medicine to \nother parts of the world because we are concerned about the behavior of \ntheir leaders. That is not the best of what America has to offer.\n  There are a couple of reasons I have to describe this issue in such \nrepetitive terms. One is, I represent a farm State. Our family farmers \nsay all the time: You tell us to go operate in the open market, to \nproduce our grain and then go sell it in the open market. We have these \nfolks who created this farm program called Freedom to Farm, but some of \nthem have forgotten there also ought to be a freedom to sell. What \nabout the ability to sell that grain to these countries?\n  There are $7.7 billion in agricultural sales--nearly 11 percent of \nall the wheat purchases in the world--by the countries with which we \nhave sanctions. So we say to farmers: You have the freedom to farm, but \nyou do not have the freedom to sell. You cannot move your wheat to \nCuba. We will let Cuba buy its wheat from other countries--from Europe, \nfrom Canada, from Argentina. They all sell, but the United States will \nnot.\n  Farmers have the legitimate right to ask the question: Why? Why would \nyou do this to family farmers? Why would you penalize family farmers by \nmaking so much of the world's wheat market and so much of the world's \ngrain market off limits to family farmers?\n  This chart shows a list of farm groups that support lifting the \nsanctions on food and medicine. It is a list that includes virtually \nall of them. I do not know of any farm group that thinks this policy is \nsmart, thoughtful, or reasonable. Every farm organization in the \ncountry representing family farmers believes we ought to discontinue \nusing food as a weapon.\n  What about medicine? Dr. Patricia Dawson, a breast surgeon from \nSeattle, WA, Providence Hospital, says:\n\n       The embargo appears to have a disproportionate impact on \n     women and children by limiting access to new medications and \n     technology.\n  In every one of these countries with which we have sanctions, I bet \nyou will find a disproportionate impact on women and children. If \nanyone has the time, go talk to Congressman Tony Hall who went to North \nKorea and came back and made the report about hunger and malnutrition \nin North Korea. See what is going on in that country. Then ask \nyourself: Does it make any sense at all for this country to withhold \nfood shipments to North Korea, or anywhere for that matter? The answer \nis a resounding no, of course not.\n  As I indicated when I started, there are two reasons for me to \nbelieve so strongly about this. One, this country has developed a \npolicy that is wrong at its core. It is wrong for America. It is wrong \nfor our family farmers. It is morally wrong, in my judgment, for a \ncountry that is the breadbasket of the world and produces such a \nprodigious amount of food to be telling other countries that, by the \nway, we will use our food in a punitive way if you do not behave. Mr. \nor Mrs. Leader of Another Country, we will decide that food is off \nlimits to those who want to purchase commodities for your country.\n  What on Earth could provoke a country such as ours to believe that is \na smart, sensible, or reasonable policy? It is not reasonable. It is \nnot moral.\n  From a more selfish standpoint, I would say it is not fair to our \nfamily farmers. This morning someplace in my home State of North Dakota \nthere is a family farmer who is driving a load of grain to a country \nelevator someplace. When that farmer gets to the country elevator, that \nfarmer is going to be told that the food he produced--starting in the \nspring, gassing up the tractor, plowing a straight furrow, planting \nsome seeds, and hoping and praying that seed is going to grow; and when \nit grows, finally being able to come out with a combine and harvesting \nthe crop, and putting it in the bin, and then putting it in the truck, \nand then the elevator--that farmer is going to be told at the elevator \nthat the food he produced from the work he did has no value; that food \nis food that does not have much value for the world at all.\n  So the price is collapsed. And the farmer scratches his or her head \nand says: I don't understand that. We have more than half a billion \npeople going to bed with an ache in their belly because they didn't \nhave enough to eat yesterday. Every single minute, up to eight \nchildren, die--every single minute--because of the winds of hunger \naround the world. Yet our farmers are told somehow their food does not \nhave value, and those poor people who live in these countries--Cuba, \nIran, Libya, North Korea, Sudan, and Iraq--are told American food, by \nthe way, is off limits to you because we do not like the way your \nleaders behave.\n  So you poor folks in those unfortunate countries, you can't do much \nto kick Saddam Hussein out of Iraq, but we can prevent you from having \naccess to American food. You can't even buy it.\n\n[[Page S5067]]\n\n  That is just wrongheaded public policy. I intend to change it. As I \nindicated, Senator Gorton from Washington cosponsored the amendment I \noffered on the Agriculture appropriations bill. Senator Ashcroft \noffered a nearly identical amendment on the floor of the Senate last \nyear. The Senate will be dealing with this.\n  Finally, as I conclude, I say to those Senate leaders who believe \nthey are going to be able to strip it out of the legislation this year, \nstrip it out of the appropriations bill where I added it to the \nAgriculture appropriations bill, I am not going to let you do that. You \nmight have the capability of stripping it out of that bill. I have the \ncapability and the right on the floor of the Senate to add it to this \nbill.\n  Some say they don't want to do it because it does not pertain just to \ndefense. It pertains to national security. I have a right under the \nrules to add it. I have to get a vote on it, but I have every right to \noffer it as an amendment. I intend to offer it. I will accept a short \ntime agreement, but I intend that this Congress, with a wide majority \nof Senators and Representatives, will support this. I intend that this \nCongress will not be hijacked by a handful of legislative leaders who \nare trying to protect a dinosaur of a policy that represents the worst \nof America--the use of food and medicine as a weapon in economic \nsanctions.\n\n  So if we have not gotten a decade past that mentality then something \nis fundamentally wrong with this country. This country should stand up \nfor its family farmers, first, to say that you have the freedom to \nsell; and, second, it ought to stand up as a world leader to say that \nwe will not use food as a weapon. Poor people around the world, people \nwho live in countries that need our food, have the right to buy it, \nhave the right to expect it, and have the right to have access to it \nunder a range of programs. This country should no longer penalize those \npoor people and those hungry people.\n  I came to the floor as I saw there was a morning business opportunity \njust to say to the two managers--I like them, they are good friends; \nand they will grit their teeth and wring their hands and mop their \nbrows--but I intend to offer this amendment. I have a right to do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5067-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, momentarily, we will vote on the \nnomination of a very distinguished citizen of our country. I want to \nelaborate in these few minutes about his distinguished career.\n  We know he has been nominated to be the first Under Secretary for \nNuclear Security, as well as the first administrator of the National \nNuclear Security Administration at the Department of Energy. We are all \nfamiliar with General Gordon's record. He took on many challenging \nassignments over these years in the Department of Defense and currently \nis Deputy Director for the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  I would like to go back and give a brief history of the establishment \nof the National Nuclear Security Administration and the position for \nwhich General Gordon has been nominated.\n  The Administration was established by title 32 of the National \nDefense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2000. That consolidated all \nof the national security functions of the Department of Energy under a \nsingle, semi-autonomous organizational unit. This reorganization \nrepresents the most significant reorganization of the Department of \nEnergy in more than 20 years.\n\n  The Congress did not take this action lightly. We established this \nnew entity in response to a multitude of reports and assessments which \ncalled for changes in the Department of Energy's ``dysfunctional'' \norganization structure. The reports include the 1997 ``120-day study'' \nissued by the Institute for Defense Analysis, the 1999 Chiles \nCommission report, and the 1999 Foster Panel report--just to mention a \nfew. However, the most compelling report was issued by President \nClinton's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in June 1999. That \nbipartisan report stated that:\n\n       . . . real and lasting security and counterintelligence \n     reform at the weapons labs is simply unworkable within DOE's \n     current structure and culture. To achieve the kind of \n     protection that these sensitive labs must have, they and \n     their functions must have their own autonomous operational \n     structure free of all the other obligations imposed by DOE \n     management.\n\n  The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board went on to make \nthe following recommendations to the President and Congress, (1) create \na new semi-autonomous agency and (2) streamline the management of the \nDOE weapons labs management structure by abolishing ties between the \nweapons labs and all DOE regional, field and site offices, and all \ncontractor intermediaries. The committee was very careful to fully \nimplement the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board's \nbipartisan recommendations, exactly as they were presented to President \nClinton.\n  The overarching goal was to establish, for the first time in many \nyears, a clear chain of command for the Department's national security \nprograms. Some disagree with the final product, but I believe we \naccomplished that goal. It is now time for General Gordon to make this \nnew entity work.\n  I have been trying for some weeks to get this nomination up. Just \nthink: Last year, we passed structural reforms. It was signed into law \nby the President. And here we are almost a year later--just today--\nabout to confirm the President's nominee to head this new entity.\n  We have vested a considerable amount of authority in the \nAdministrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration; that is, \nGeneral Gordon. We trust that he will use it in the best of U.S. \nnational security.\n  I have come to know this fine man very well over the months that I \nhave worked with him in connection with this nomination. I can tell the \nSenate without any equivocation that I do not know of a more qualified \nperson, a man whose background, whose achievements, whose every step in \nlife better qualifies him, including a character I think that is beyond \nquestion, to take on this important responsibility.\n  With regard to some details about him, the general entered the Air \nForce through the Reserve Officer Training Corps Program in 1968.\n  His early assignments were in research and development and \nacquisition where he was involved in improving the Minuteman \nIntercontinental Ballistic Missile--ICBM--and in developing and \nacquiring the Peacekeeper ICBM. He served with the U.S. Department of \nState in the politico-military affairs. Later, he commanded the 90th \nStrategic Missile Wing, the only Peacekeeper ICBM unit. He served in \nthe National Security Council in the areas of defense and arms control, \nincluding oversight and completion of START II negotiations. The \ngeneral then became senior member of the staff of the Secretary of \nDefense, and later the Director of Operations, Air Force Space Command, \nresponsible for overseeing\n\n[[Page S5068]]\n\nand developing policy and guidance for the command's operational \nmissions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe biography of General Gordon.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Biography--General John A.

General Gordon has served his country for more than 30 years, \nmost recently as the Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence \nAgency. He was recommended for this position by a panel of highly \nqualified experts headed by former Deputy Secretary of Energy Charles \nCurtis.\n  It is hard to imagine an individual with more experience than General \nGordon with all aspects of the nuclear forces of the United States. \nDuring his long and distinguished career in the United States Air \nForce, General Gordon worked in the research and development of nuclear \nweapons programs as a physicist and technician; he is familiar with the \noperational requirements of our nuclear forces from his tours of duty \nwith U.S. strategic missile forces, including service as vice commander \nand commander of a Strategic Missile Wing; and he worked at the highest \npolicy levels of the Executive Branch during his four years on the \nNational Security Council as special assistant to the President for \nnational security affairs and senior director for defense policy and \narms control.\n  Upon confirmation, General Gordon will take on one of the most \nchallenging assignments in the federal government. The Administrator of \nthe new National Nuclear Security Administration is responsible for \nmaintaining the safety and reliability of our nation's nuclear \nwarheads; for addressing security problems that continue to undermine \npublic confidence in the Department of Energy; for managing the \nDepartment of Energy laboratories; and for cleaning up some of the \nworst environmental problems in the country.\n  Moreover, the Administrator will face these assignments as the head \nof an agency so plagued with ``convoluted, confusing and \ncontradictory'' reporting channels that the President's Foreign \nIntelligence Advisory Board last year characterized the entire \nDepartment of Energy as a ``dysfunctional'' organization. Although I \nbelieve that some of the legislation Congress has passed and is \ncurrently considering will make General Gordon's job harder and not \neasier, I pledge to work with General Gordon, Secretary Richardson and \nmy colleagues in the Congress to do everything I can to give General \nGordon the support he will need to be successful in this demanding job.\n  I think all of us appreciate General Gordon's willingness to serve \nhis country on this continuing basis and to take on a very difficult \nassignment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to show my support for \nGeneral John Gordon to be the Director of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministration or the NNSA. But before I do that, I need to mention a \nrelated item, the lack of security protections at the Los Alamos lab.\n  On Monday, June 12, the New York Times reported that computer hard \ndrives containing valuable nuclear weapons data and other highly \nsensitive information were found missing from the Los Alamos National \nLaboratory on May 7th. These classified hard drives were stored in \nlocked containers in a vault at the weapons X Division at the lab. The \ncontainers were found but the hard drives are gone. According to \nreports, the material missing is American nuclear weapons data that the \nNuclear Emergency Search Team needs to disarm nuclear devices during \nemergencies. Also missing is the intelligence information on the \nRussian nuclear weapons program. To make matters worse, the Lab did not \nbegin an intensive search until May 24. I realize that a fire was \nraging in the area and\n\n[[Page S5069]]\n\nthat people were focused on that, but to wait that long makes little \nsense. I understand that the law now requires that any such incident \nmust be reported to the Department of Energy within 8 hours. Finally, \nDOE headquarters was informed of the missing data on June 1.\n  While it may seem premature to speculate foul play, I must say that \nneither DOE nor the Administration have a strong track record in the \narea of safeguards and security. Unfortunately, this is not the first \nincident of lax security during this Administration.\n  Here are just a few of the reported incidents.\n  March 1999--It was determined that the Chinese had penetrated Los \nAlamos Laboratory and stole our nuclear secrets.\n  Last December--A Russian diplomat is ordered to leave after a \nmicrophone transmitter is discovered on the 7th floor of the State \nDepartment, only a short walk from the office of Secretary Albright.\n  Then there is the case of the missing laptops at the State Department \nand the situation with the former CIA Director John Deutch, who since \nhas lost all his clearances, of mishandling classified information.\n  While not all these cases are related to the newly created NNSA, they \ndo show that a new attitude and new ethic must be incorporated into \nthis Administration. We have had too many problems at too many places.\n  That is why I am glad that General Gordon is finally being voted on \nby this Senate. I am sorry that this vote took so long to take place. \nThis vote was objected to by some who wanted to get a better deal on a \nfew items in the Defense authorization bill relating to the NNSA. It \nwas my belief there would be obstacles in this job, but I never \nbelieved it would happen before he got to the NNSA. However, now that \nthe objection to General Gordon's nomination has been lifted, we can \nfinally move this nomination. Gen. Gordon's position is far too \nvaluable to be made a political pawn and the latest incident at Los \nAlamos proves that.\n  Also, I let him know that I don't expect miracles, I just expect our \nnational security be treated as such. No longer should science and \npersonnel matters out rank security. We must change this culture and I \nbelieve that General Gordon is the right person for this job. I want to \nthank General Gordon for his dedication and commitment to his country \nand for serving in this new position.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I look forward to the hearings on the latest \nincident at the lab. For too long I have heard this administration \ncrowing that they are taking care of the security problems, but this \nlatest incident shows that their actions don't match their words. While \nthis administration crowed they attempted to undermine what Congress \nhad done last year to strengthen security in the Department of Energy \nthrough amendments in the Strategic Subcommittee of the Armed Services \nCommittee. As chairman of that committee I was appalled at the action \nof Democrat members of the committee as well in their attempts to stop \nthe nomination of General Gordon. We must and will get to the bottom of \nour nation's security problems.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  All time having expired, the question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Gen. John A. Gordon, United States Air \nForce, to be Under Secretary for Nuclear Security, Department of \nEnergy? On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, let me make a very important correction. The \ngentleman I am going to speak about briefly is going to be moving to \nSouth Dakota, not South Carolina. He obviously likes cooler weather and \nnot hot weather. He deserves to be able to go wherever he chooses after \nthe great service he has provided to the Congress.\n  I want to take a moment to say goodbye on behalf of the Senate to a \nman we know quite well. I know Senator Daschle is going to join me in \nthis and make some comments, either in a few minutes or later. I am \ntalking about Jim Talbert, who is Superintendent of the Senate's \nPeriodical Press Gallery and is retiring this week after 32 years of \nservice.\n  Jim and I came to the House of Representatives in the same year, \n1968. He was hired in the House Daily Press Gallery, and I was hired as \nan aide to then-Congressman Bill Colmer, chairman of the Rules \nCommittee. Twenty-three years and five Speakers later, Jim crossed the \nDMZ in the Capitol to the Senate to be Superintendent of the Periodical \nPress Gallery.\n  Early on, Jim figured out what it took to get things done around \nhere: know the rules. He knew them. That is why he became such a \nvaluable resource. His expertise on congressional procedure is widely \nrecognized and consulted by rookie reporters, veteran correspondents, \nand, yes, even by an occasional Senator or House Member who knows that \nhe spent those many years in the House. His generosity in sharing his \nknowledge and time has brought him a great many friends on the second \nand third floors of this Capitol.\n  I have a letter from the Executive Committee of Correspondents that \ndescribes in the reporters' words all Jim has accomplished on their \nbehalf in the Senate. I ask unanimous consent that that letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S5070]]\n\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                              Senate Periodical Press Gallery,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2000.\n     Jim Talbert,\n     Superintendent, Senate Periodical Press Gallery, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jim: The Executive Committee of Correspondents conveys \n     its gratitude on behalf of the more than 250 publications and \n     1,700 reporters who benefited from your nine years as \n     superintendent of the United States Senate Periodical Press \n     Gallery.\n       The transformation you have made running the press gallery \n     has been nothing short of historic. The gallery has never \n     operated in a more professional manner. The gallery staff was \n     never better educated about the legislative process nor more \n     knowledgeable of what is happening at any given moment on the \n     Senate floor. Reporters never had a better opportunity of \n     snagging a seat and testimony at a crowded hearing. Functions \n     such as accrediting reporters and publications never operated \n     in a more even-handed, efficient manner.\n       During your tenure, there was never a doubt that a reporter \n     calling the gallery to ask about pending legislation would \n     get an immediate and informed answer.\n       You deserve credit for what you have accomplished. You also \n     earn our praise for leaving in your wake a highly trained and \n     motivated staff. The personal zeal you displayed in \n     understanding the often complicated legislative process was \n     infectious and you were a good teacher.\n       While replacing Jim Talbert is out of the question, since \n     you certainly are one of a kind, the mark you leave on the \n     gallery will remain long after you enter your well-deserved \n     retirement. The seeds you sowed will help reporters covering \n     Congress for years to come.\n       We wish you and Judy a happy retirement to South Dakota \n     filled with good health and mild winters.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rick Maze,\n       Chairman.\n     Cheryl Bolen,\n       Secretary-Treasurer.\n     Richard E. Cohen.\n     Jay Carney.\n     Heidi Glenn.\n     Amy Borrus.\n     Tim Curran.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. While Jim no longer will be toiling with us every day, he \nis keeping his favorite jobs: husband, father, and grandfather. I am a \nlittle envious, to tell the truth. He and his wife, Judy, whom he met \nwhile working in the Capitol, are moving to her native South Dakota.\n  It is typical of Jim that he didn't want a big bang, a big fuss over \nhis departure. But we couldn't let him go without first wishing him \nwell and saying, ``Thanks, Jim. You have earned it.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join the majority leader in his \ncommendation of an extraordinary part of this wonderful institution. \nJim Talbert, as the majority leader has indicated, is retiring at the \nend of this week as the Superintendent of the Senate Periodical Press \nGallery. He is one of hundreds of members of our Capitol family whom C-\nSPAN viewers never see but without whom this institution would simply \nnot function. He has served Congress with distinction for 32 years.\n  Born on February 22, 1943, in Washington, D.C., he has resided here \nall of his life. He graduated from the University of Maryland with a \ndegree in journalism in 1964 and began his career on Capitol Hill in \n1966, covering politics for the Timmons News Service.\n  In 1968, he joined the House Daily Press Gallery where he worked for \n23 years. Much to our good fortune, he came to the Senate in 1991 as \nthe Superintendent of the Senate Periodical Press Gallery. The \nperiodical gallery is one of three press galleries in the Senate. It is \nthe nerve center for Capitol Hill reporters representing national and \nlocal magazines and newsletters. More than 1,700 journalists \nrepresenting 250 different news organizations are credentialed to use \nthe Periodical Press Gallery to file stories, stay in contact with home \noffices, and get information on Senate activities. As head of the \nperiodical gallery, Jim approves credentials for reporters covering \nCapitol Hill. He acts as a liaison between the press and Senate staff \nand keeps up-to-the-minute information on what is happening on the \nSenate floor.\n  Reporters do not turn to Jim simply for information about where a \npress conference is being held or when a bill might be coming to the \nfloor. They also depend on his vast knowledge of Senate history and \nlegislative procedure to make sense of our sometimes confusing \nparliamentary rules. He is a professional, an efficient and fairminded \nperson in carrying out all of his duties. He is also generous and \nalways has a humorous story to share.\n  While his departure will have reporters scrambling to find a good \nsource on Senate procedure, he can leave knowing that the periodical \ngallery staff he has worked so hard to train is committed to \nmaintaining his same high standards.\n  Besides his retirement, Jim will celebrate another happy milestone \nthis year. In 1995, Jim was diagnosed with throat cancer. In his 5-year \nfight to beat cancer, he endured several rounds of radiation treatment \nand surgery and missed only 1 month of work. Recently, Jim was declared \ncancer free.\n  Finally, I always sensed that there was something unusually wise \nabout Jim. That hunch was confirmed recently when I learned that he and \nhis wife, Judy, will be moving to her hometown, Brookings, SD, home of \nSouth Dakota State University. I can't think of a better place to \nretire. I am glad to call them constituents and look forward to seeing \nthem many times in my State and now their State.\n  I wish Jim and Judy well. Jim has served this Senate with dedication \nand distinction. I look forward to being able to serve with him, for a \nchange, as his Senator. I wish him and Judy all of the best as they \nbegin their new life in South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5070-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5070-S5071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Virginia be recognized to offer a series of cleared amendments to \nthe pending DOD authorization bill, and following the disposition of \nthe 41-plus cleared amendments, the DOD authorization bill be laid \naside and that the Senate then turn to the House Transportation \nappropriations bill and the Senate bill be immediately offered as an \namendment in the nature of a substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I also had intended to ask consent that when \nthe Senate resumes the DOD bill, the Smith amendment be laid aside and \nSenator Dodd be recognized to offer his amendment regarding a Cuba \ncommission. I am informed that Senator McCain would object to that, but \nI assure Senator Daschle and Senator Dodd and Senator Mack and Senator \nLevin and Senator Warner, everybody, we will keep working to see if we \ncan get this done. I think that is what we should do.\n  We are going to go back to DOD authorization in the morning in some \nform. Everybody is wanting to get in line or get their position first, \nor they don't want us to allow that second-degree slot to be opened, I \nguess, to the Smith amendment. Others want it to be open. It is kind of \ncomplicated. A lot of Senators are invoking their rights. They have a \nright to do that.\n  I do plead with the Senate, Republicans and Democrats, to work with \nus to try to get our appropriations bills done. I am going to continue \nto try to keep my word. Senator Daschle is working with me, and \nSenators are cooperating on both sides to come back to make progress on \nthe Department of Defense authorization bill.\n  We were prepared to go to the Murray amendment, which is germane to \nthe Defense bill. It is a Defense amendment. But I believe Senator \nFeingold or somebody objected to that. We will keep working here. I \nthink we can work through this in a way that will allow us to come back \nto the Defense authorization bill and deal with Defense-related \namendments, which is what I prefer. It is our national security we are \ntalking about. But there are amendments that Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle want to offer that are not germane. We will try to find an \norderly way in which to do that.\n  At this point, I am advised that there will be objections on this \nside on one approach and on that side on another approach. Let's keep \nworking to find a way to get this done.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I just urge the cooperation of all \nSenators. The only way this dual track is going to work is if we can \naccommodate each other's needs. That is what generated our agreement to \naddress both bills in this fashion. Senators on both sides want to be \naccommodated. They have amendments to offer. This allows for that \nprocess to continue--to allow amendments on Defense authorization\n\n[[Page S5071]]\n\nin the morning up until early afternoon, and then to take up \nappropriations in the afternoon--so that we can work through the \nappropriations bills that we know we must get done.\n  We will be unable to go to appropriations bills in the future if we \ncan't continue to accommodate each other's needs. I think this is \nworking well. I hope we can continue to work well to work off the list \nof amendments. Senator Reid does his magic with our list, and I know we \nhave our colleagues on the other side who are attempting to do the same \nthere. But we ought to have these votes and debates. I think it is good \nfor the country and good for the institution to be able to have the \nopportunity to debate some of these issues. That is what we are doing, \nand that is why you see the cooperation you have this week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, one of the reasons Senator Daschle and I \ndecided to try to proceed on this dual track, trying to work on the \nDefense authorization bill in the morning and appropriations bills in \nthe afternoon--it was Senator Daschle's suggestion that we do that for \nthe very purpose we are achieving here. It keeps people focused. Out of \nsight, out of mind. If we were not trying to come back to DOD \nauthorization, everybody would go off to committee hearings and other \nwork and would not focus on trying to get an orderly way to do it. So \nwhile it is not agreed to yet, it is exactly what we had in mind--to \nmake everybody understand we are going to keep trying to do the \nTransportation appropriations bill, and we are going to focus on \namendments and try to get order and process to go back to the \nDepartment of Defense authorization.\n  John Warner and Senator Levin, the two managers of this legislation, \nare trying very hard to find a way to work through this maze that they \nare faced with to get a Defense authorization bill for the national \nsecurity of our country. Senator Warner, working with others, has 41 \namendments that we can clear. At that rate, in 2 or 3 days, maybe we \ncan eliminate a couple hundred amendments. So we will keep trying to do \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5071-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5071-S5083]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001--Continued\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 3382 through 3424, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I am offering a bipartisan amendment with \nmy distinguished colleagues, Mr. Lugar and Mr. Leahy. This amendment \nwould simply change the rules on eligibility of overseas troops for the \nsupplemental nutrition program to be the same as the rules for troops \nin the United States. It corrects an inequity that would otherwise harm \nthousands of our troops overseas.\n  We have had much discussion of the disgrace that some of our men and \nwomen in uniform, who are risking their lives to serve our nation, have \nto rely on welfare to feed their families. Thousands of our troops are \neligible for food stamps and WIC, the supplemental nutrition program. \nThis is an outrage, and I will continue to work to increase the pay of \nour enlisted men and women, the real solution to this problem.\n  But it is even more outrageous that some of our troops who need this \nassistance cannot get it, just because of where they are stationed. WIC \nis administered by the States. Since our troops overseas are not in a \nState, in the past they have not received any\n\n[[Page S5072]]\n\nsupport from WIC. When they are stationed here, they can get the food \nthey need to feed their families; they get transferred overseas, and \nsuddenly they are ineligible, and the assistance on which they have \ncome to rely disappears. No wonder it's so hard to convince them to \nsign up for another tour.\n  Last year this body passed an amendment I proposed to end this \nunfairness by having the Defense Department provide WIC assistance to \ntroops overseas. The amendment simply required the Defense Department \nto set up a WIC program similar to those run by the states that would \nserve Department personnel who are overseas. The Department is \nproceeding to implement that program. In fact the Department is \nuniquely situated to efficiently run such a program because of the \nnetwork of medical treatment facilities and commissaries that is \nalready in place. But in conference a significant change was made to \nthe provision. A sentence was added that requires the Department to \ninclude the value of on-base housing in calculating income to determine \neligibility for the program. That one sentence knocked more than half \nof those who should be eligible from the program.\n  It also failed to correct the fundamental unfairness. The regulations \ngoverning WIC specifically prohibit states from counting in-kind \nhousing and other in-kind assistance in appplicants' income when \ndetermining eligibility. They bar states from doing what we required \nthe Pentagon to do. That makes no sense. It means that people who were \nreceiving food stamps in the U.S. still may be kicked out of the \nprogram when their period of eligibility is up, even though their \nincome and expenses have not changed, just because they were \ntransferred out of the country. And when my staff talked with the \nDefense Department officials who are setting up the program, they \nagreed that the rules should be changed so that eligibility overseas \nwould match eligibility in the U.S.\n  So this amendment strikes the one sentence, leaving the overall \nprinciple that the Secretary of Defense should seek to apply the \neligibility rules in the regulations governing state implementation of \nWIC.\n  Those regulations leave one ambiguity, however. I have talked about \nin-kind housing, that is housing on military bases. Troops who live \noff-base instead receive a basic housing allowance to help them pay for \ntheir own housing. As directed in the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, the \nrules on WIC state that states have the choice in determining income \neligibility of whether to count the basic housing allowance received by \nmilitary personnel living off the base. I understand that as of 1994, \nthe last time states were surveyed, not one of the fifty states had \nchosen to include the housing in income. That only makes sense. It \nwould be patently unfair to let troops living on-base receive support, \nbut withhold it from troops living off-base whose real income is no \nhigher. In fact the troops off-base usually have higher expenses \nbecause the housing allowance usually does not fully cover their \nhousing expense.\n  So this amendment directs the Secretary of Defense to follow the \ncurrent practice of the states in excluding the basic allowance for \nhousing when determining income eligibility. Thus it would allow the \nSecretary to restore full fairness by treating troops overseas the same \nas troops at home, and troops who live on-base the same as troops who \nlive off-base. And most importantly it would allow thousands of troops \nto receive the food they need to keep their families healthy.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their favorable \nconsideration and am glad that this correction has been accepted as a \nmanager's amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3387\n\n(Purpose: To improve access to health care under the TRICARE program by \n    prohibiting a requirement for statements of nonavailability or \n       preauthorization for certain services under that program)\n\n       On page 251, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 714.

Mr. President, today I offer an amendment that will \nrestore a measure of pay equity for our nation's Guardsmen and \nReservists. I offered this same amendment last year to S. 4, the \nmilitary pay increase bill, and it was adopted by voice vote.\n  I understand that this amendment is acceptable to the managers on \nboth sides, and I thank the chairman and the ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee for their continuing cooperation on this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. President, the men and women who serve in the Guard and Reserves \nare cornerstones of our national defense and domestic infrastructure, \nand they deserve to be adequately and equitably compensated for their \ndedicated service to this country.\n  The Guard and Reserve are integral parts of overseas missions, \nincluding recent and ongoing missions in places, including Iraq and the \nBalkans. According to statements by Department of Defense officials, \nGuardsmen and Reservists will continue to play an increasingly \nimportant role in our national defense strategy as they are called upon \nto shoulder more of the burden of military operations both at home and \nabroad. The National Guard and Reserves deserve the full support they \nneed to carry out their duties.\n  Mr. President, my amendment would correct special duty assignment pay \ninequities between the Reserve components of our Armed Forces and their \nactive duty counterparts. These inequities should be address to take \ninto account the National Guard and Reserves' increased role in our \nnational security, especially on the front lines.\n  My amendment allows a Guardsmen or Reservist who is entitled to basic \npay and is performing a special duty to be paid special duty assignment \npay.\n  Right now, Guardsmen and Reservists are getting shortchanged despite \nthe vital role they play in our national defense. The special duty \nassignment pay program ensures readiness by compensating specific \nsoldiers who are assigned to duty positions that demand special \ntraining and extraordinary effort to maintain a level of satisfactory \nperformance. The program, as it stands now, effectively reduces the \nability of the National Guard and Reserve to retain highly dedicated \nand specialized soldiers.\n  The special duty assignments pay program provides an additional \nmonthly financial incentive paid to enlisted soldiers and airmen who \nare required to perform extremely demanding duties that require an \nunusual degree of responsibility. These special duty assignments \ninclude certain command sergeants major, guidance counselors, retention \nnon-commissioned officers (NCO's), drill sergeants, and members of the \nSpecial Forces. These soldiers, however, do not receive special duty \nassignment pay while in on IDT status (drill weekends).\n  I am pleased that the underlying bill as reported by the Armed \nServices Committee contains a provision that increases the maximum rate \nfor special duty assignment pay from $275 per month to $600 per month. \nThis modest increase, coupled with my amendment, will help to ensure \nthat our Guardsmen and Reservists are fairly compensated for their \nservice.\n  This is especially important since National Guard and Reserve members \ngive up their civilian salaries during the time they are called up for, \nor volunteer for, active duty.\n  Mr. President, as the U.S. military prepares to face the challenges \nof the next century and beyond, the National Guard and Reserves will be \ncalled more frequently to active duty for domestic support roles and \nvarious peacekeeping efforts abroad. They will also be vital players on \nspecial teams trained to deal with emerging threats, including the \npossibility of the deployment of weapons of mass destruction within our \nown borders. According to many military experts, this represents a more \nsalient threat to the United States than the threat of a ballistic \nmissile attack that many of our colleagues have spent so much time \naddressing.\n  Mr. President, I have had the opportunity to see some of these \nsoldiers off as they embarked on these missions and have welcomed them \nhome upon their return. I am struck by the courage and professionalism \nthey displayed as they prepare to meet these varied assignments. In \nWisconsin, the State Guard provides vital support during natural \ndisasters and state emergencies, including floods, ice storms, and \ntrain derailments.\n  We have a duty to honor the service of our National Guardsmen and \nReservists. One way to do that is to equitably compensate them for \ntheir service.\n  Again, I thank the managers of the bill for their courtesy and for \ntheir cooperation on this important amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3391\n\n (Purpose: To authorize the expansion of service areas for transferees \nof former uniformed services treatment facilities that are included in \n          the uniformed services health care delivery system)\n\n       On page 270, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 744.

TREATMENT OF PARTIAL PAYMENTS UNDER SERVICE \n                   CONTRACTS.\n\n       For the purposes of the regulations prescribed under \n     section 3903(a)(5) of title 31, United States Code, partial \n     payments, other than progress payments, that are made on a \n     contract for the procurement of services shall be treated as \n     being periodic payments.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and Senator \nLieberman, the Committee's ranking minority member, and Senators Warner \nand Levin, the chairman and ranking minority member of the Armed \nServices Committee. Senator Lieberman and I thank the Armed Services \nchairman and ranking member for their cooperation and assistance in \npreparing this amendment which will benefit not only the procurement \nprocess within the Department of Defense, but other agencies across the \nFederal government as well.\n  The amendment which we offer today began as a request from the \nadministration and others to include additional procurement-related \nreforms to those enacted over the past several years and those already \nincluded in S. 2549. Our amendment includes language which would (1) \nexpress a governmentwide preference for performance-based service \ncontracting; (2) move the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) Board out of \nthe Office of Federal Procurement Policy, making it a separate office \nwithin the Office of Management and Budget, and conform the delegation \nof authority levels relating to the CAS with those for the Truth in \nNegotiations Act; (3) extend the authority of certain pilot programs \nunder the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996; (4) prohibit the use of mandatory \nminimum educational and experience requirements on performance-based \nservice contracts and certain other contracts; and (5) ensure that the \nimplementing regulations\n\n[[Page S5075]]\n\nof the Prompt Payment Act treat partial payments on contracts for \nservices as periodic payments covered by the Act. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a joint statement of sponsors explaining the amendment be \nplaced in the Record immediately following my statement. This statement \nrepresents the consensus view of the sponsors as to the meaning and \nintent of the amendment.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Joint Statement of Sponsors Regarding the Thompson-Lieberman-Warner-\n                Levin Procurement Streamlining Amendment\n\n     1. Performance-based service contracting\n       The amendment would make government-wide a provision \n     included in section 801 of the bill, which establishes a \n     preference for performance-based service contracting. \n     Successful performance of services contracts throughout \n     government can be ensured by establishing clear goals which \n     give vendors the flexibility to propose different approaches, \n     while giving the government a firm basis for cost and quality \n     comparison.\n     2. Organization of the Cost Accounting Standards Board\n       The Cost Accounting Standards (CAS standards) are a set of \n     19 accounting principles developed and maintained by the Cost \n     Accounting Standards Board (CAS Board), a body created by \n     Congress to develop uniform and consistent standards. The CAS \n     standards require government contractors to account for their \n     costs on a consistent basis and prohibit any shifting of \n     overhead or other costs from commercial contracts to \n     government contracts, or from fixed-price contracts to cost-\n     type contracts.\n       Currently, the CAS Board is located in the Office of \n     Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and chaired by the \n     Administrator of OFPP. Concerns have been raised that OFPP's \n     broader procurement policy mission has distracted past \n     Administrators from the task of maintaining the CAS \n     standards. In order to ensure that the CAS standards receive \n     the focused attention of qualified accounting professionals, \n     the amendment would remove the CAS Board from OFPP and make \n     it an independent board within the Office of Management and \n     Budget.\n       The amendment would retain the CAS Board's ``exclusive \n     authority'' to make, promulgate, amend, and rescind cost \n     accounting standards and interpretations thereof. Because of \n     the need for consistent cost accounting standards for all \n     government contracts, no other Federal agency is authorized \n     to issue cost accounting standards or regulations. However, \n     the amendment would make the CAS Board's authority ``subject \n     to the direction of the Director of the Office of Management \n     and Budget'' in recognition of the existing relationship of \n     the CAS Board with the Director of OMB and the requirement \n     that federal rules and regulations be adopted by an \n     officer with the authority to take such action.\n       Further, the amendment clarifies the level to which Federal \n     agencies may delegate authority to waive the applicability of \n     CAS standards in certain circumstances, to conform to waiver \n     authority under the Truth in Negotiations Act and ensure that \n     the same official may waive the requirements of both statutes \n     in cases where it makes sense to do so.\n     3. Revision of authority for solutions-based contracting \n         pilot program\n       The amendment would amend section 5312 of the Clinger-Cohen \n     Act, the solutions-based contracting pilot program, to remove \n     detailed statutory requirements concerning the development of \n     a pilot plan, including the requirement to form a public-\n     private working group. The elimination of this requirement is \n     intended to avoid concerns raised regarding which private \n     industry specialists would participate on working groups and \n     the extent to which it would be appropriate for such \n     participants to compete for later solutions-based contracts. \n     The provision also would eliminate a requirement to fund the \n     awardee's efforts during the program definition phase and \n     instead leave this decision to the contracting officer's \n     discretion on a case-by-case basis.\n     4. Appropriate use of personnel experience and educational \n         requirements in the procurement of information technology \n         services\n       Many in the information technology industry have argued \n     that minimum education or experience requirements included in \n     agency solicitations for information technology services are \n     contributing to the serious worker shortage by requiring \n     contractors to use more highly trained and educated workers \n     to perform some services required by government contracts \n     that could be done just as well by less educated or \n     experienced workers. They argue that these mandatory minimum \n     requirements are often included in information technology \n     service contracts without regard to whether it is necessary \n     to perform the work and that it drives up the cost of \n     contracts.\n       The amendment would prohibit the use of minimum experience \n     or educational requirements for contractor personnel in \n     performance-based services contracts. Minimum experience \n     requirements are inappropriate for such contracts, which are \n     supposed to be awarded on the basis of measurable outcomes. \n     The provision would also require the issuance of regulations \n     on the appropriate use of minimum experience or educational \n     requirements for other services contracts other than \n     performance-based contracts.\n       It is the sponsors' view that this amendment will have no \n     negative impact on Federal employees performing similar \n     information technology work for the Federal government.\n     5. Treatment of partial payments under service contracts\n       When the Prompt Payment Act was amended in 1988, Congress \n     recognized the failure of Federal agencies to implement the \n     requirement in the Act to pay, during the contract period, \n     for the periodic delivery of supplies or the periodic \n     performance of services if permitted by the contract. As a \n     result, the Act was amended to require that periodic payments \n     were covered by the Act's requirement that agencies pay \n     interest on late payments.\n       The amendment would clarify that partial payments, other \n     than progress payments, made under service contracts are \n     periodic payments for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act and \n     that interest must be paid on such partial payments which are \n     not paid timely.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3393\n\n (Purpose: To increase by $2,500,000 the amount provided for the Army \nfor operation and maintenance for the ceremonial rifle program; and to \noffset that increase by reducing by $2,500,000 the amount provided for \n    operation and maintenance, Defense-wide, for spectrum database \n                               upgrades)\n\n       On page 54, line 11, strike ``$19,028,531,000'' and insert \n     ``$19,031,031,000''.\n       On page 54, line 11, strike ``$11,973,569,000'' and insert \n     ``$11,971,069,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3394\n\n(Purpose: To set aside up to $1,000,000 for the support of programs to \n  promote informal region-wide dialogues on arms control and regional \n  security issues for Arab, Israeli, and United States officials and \n                                experts)\n\n       On page 462, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1210.

Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is designed\n\n[[Page S5076]]\n\nto ensure the continued viability of and effectiveness in a vital Air \nForce asset--the Air Force Institute of Technology, known as AFIT. \nAFIT, located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, \nprovides defense-focused graduate and continuing education, research, \nand consultation to the Air Force and the Department of Defense.\n  The U.S. Army established AFIT in 1919, as the Air School of \nApplication. This school, located at historic McCook field in Dayton, \nOhio, provided technical training to pilots. In 1926, the Army Air \nCorps relocated the engineering school to Wright Field. In 1947, when \nthe Air Force became a separate service, the school assumed its current \nname. Under the guidance of Theodore Von Karman, AFIT developed a \ngraduate education program to support the vision of a technologically \nsuperior Air Force.\n  Today, the AFIT Graduate School of Engineering and Management offers \nMasters of Science degrees in 20 areas of defense-focused \nspecialization, and Doctors of Philosophy (PhD) in 13 of these areas. \nAt any one time, AFIT has 400 full-time graduate students, including \nofficers and civilians from the Air Force, sister services, and allied \nand foreign services. International students from more than 50 \ncountries have participated since 1961, and 21 international students \nare currently enrolled. AFIT has awarded more than 13,000 Masters and \n300 PhD degrees since it became accredited in 1954. Among AFIT's \nillustrious graduates are 11 current and former astronauts, including \nSteve Lindsay, the pilot of the shuttle mission of our former \ncolleague, retired Senator John Glenn.\n  Mr. President, AFIT is critical to the Air Force's long-term ability \nto retain technological superiority. AFIT trains the mid-career \nofficers and civilians required to provide the expertise necessary to \nact as informed, technically astute buyers in our acquisition corps and \nskilled innovators in our laboratories. AFIT graduates eventually \nprogress through their careers to become senior level leaders with the \ntechnical backgrounds needed to provide the vision for the Air Force to \nretain its ability to provide air superiority well into this century. I \nhave long said that Wright-Patterson is the brain power behind our air \npower. AFIT is the source of a great deal of that air power.\n  Despite this past success, AFIT's future is uncertain. AFIT's Board \nof Visitors completed a troubling report on the long-term viability of \nthe school. The report states that the Institute is ``in passive, but \ninexorable shutdown mode'' due to an attitude of ``studied inaction by \nthe Air Force at all levels.'' In response to this report, I joined \nwith Senator Voinovich and Congressmen Hobson and Hall in a letter to \nAir Force Secretary Peters, calling on the Air Force to respond to the \nBoard of Visitors' disturbing findings. The amendment I have offered \ntoday is designed to reinforce the importance of AFIT by giving it a \nstatutory designation in the U.S. Code. My amendment also contains a \nsense of the Senate that details the issues that need to be reviewed by \nthe Air Force leadership if AFIT is to continue to be a significant \ncontributor to our nation's aeronautical dominance.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this important \namendment.\n\n\n                amendment no. 3396 to amendment no. 3237\n\n               (Purpose: To make a technical correction)\n\n       On page 2, line 15, strike ``$1,500,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,500,000''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3397\n\n    (Purpose: To increase the TRICARE maximum allowable charge for \nphysicians in rural States, and to require a report on nonparticipation \n               of physicians in TRICARE in rural States)\n\n       On page 251, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 714.

Mr. President, I commend Chairman Warner for the \nsignificant improvements he and his committee have proposed for the \nTRICARE system. However I am concerned that the current proposals do \nnot address access problems in rural states, and I am offering this \namendment to alleviate this problem.\n  Military healthcare is one of the most important quality of life \nissues for my constituents. I have heard countless times how civilian \ndoctors are refusing to see TRICARE patients because of the extremely \nlow rates at which they are reimbursed. Because an adequate civilian \nhealthcare provider network is required to supplement the military \nhealthcare system, especially in rural states, TRICARE is failing to \nprovide the kind of healthcare our service members, retirees and their \ndependents deserve.\n  In rural states like my home state of Alaska, this is a huge problem. \nMedical costs are much higher than average, and there are fewer \ndoctors. Having fewer doctors to compete with reduces physicians' \nincentive to accept the extremely low pay from TRICARE. In fact, in \nAlaska, doctors who see TRICARE patients are paid less than when they \nsee Medicaid patients.\n  Frankly, I am very concerned that the government would consider those \nwho serve in our armed forces as less worthy of quality care than \nwelfare recipients. When doctors refuse to see TRICARE beneficiaries \nand their dependents, they are forced to pay for their care themselves, \nor go without it all together. I have heard too often from Alaskans in \nthe military who are frustrated that they cannot receive care because \ndoctors cannot afford to see them. I would like to read the following \nletter from one of my constituents and ask unanimous consent that it be \nentered into the Record.\n  The Department of Defense has the authority to raise the rates they \npay doctors if they decide that a region has access problems. In fact, \nthey are in the process of doing this in parts of Alaska. However they \nhave excluded Anchorage, the largest city in the state. This is where \nthe largest portion of beneficiaries live, and where the largest access \nproblem exists. It is clear to me that the Department of Defense is not \nproperly assessing where access is a problem. Because of this, it is \ntime for Congress to act.\n  My amendment will raise the rates the Department of Defense pays to \ncivilian doctors who see TRICARE patients. It also calls on the \nDepartment of Defense to conduct a study assessing access problems in \nrural states, and present Congress ways to solve these problems.\n\n[[Page S5077]]\n\n  When men and women in the armed services, retirees and their \ndependents are refused treatment by civilian doctors, it has a direct \neffect on morale. They begin to think twice when it comes time to \nreenlist or leave. I am sure they are not recommending service to the \nyoung people in their family and community. With our current \nrecruitment and retention problems in the military, I think it is our \nresponsibility in the Senate to give TRICARE beneficiaries the kind of \nhigh quality healthcare they have earned through their dedication to \nthis nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to accept this important amendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3398\n\n(Purpose: To extend the authority of the Federal Government to conduct \n    public interest law enforcement conveyances of surplus property)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . IMPROVING PROPERTY MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 203(p)(1)(B)(ii) of the Federal \n     Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. \n     484(p)(1)(B)(ii)) is amended by striking ``July 31, 2000'' \n     and inserting ``December 31, 2002''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment.--Section 233 of Appendix E of \n     Public Law 106-113 (113 Stat. 1501A-301) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the bill's managers, the Senior \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, and the Senior Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin, for assisting me with this amendment. I also \ndeeply appreciate the efforts of the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nThompson, who joins me as a co-sponsor of this amendment, and of his \nstaff who assisted my staff in developing an acceptable final version.\n  This amendment extends the authority of the General Services \nAdministration to convey surplus property to local governments for law \nenforcement purposes for two years until the end of December 2002. This \namendment will help a number of communities across the country seeking \nto use surplus property to protect their citizens and provide safe, \nsecure facilities for their police departments. Without this amendment, \nthe authority to convey surplus property for law enforcement purposes \nwould expire at the end of July, 2000. Communities that want to use the \nGSA process, and have counted upon doing so, to negotiate the use of \nproperty for law enforcement purposes at a reduced cost would have been \nshut out in the matter of a few weeks.\n  In fact, Mr. President, I have just such a situation in my own home \nstate. The City of Kewaunee, Wisconsin wants to acquire the city's Army \nReserve Center, which is a former federal armory building. The City \nintends to use the property as a municipal building in which they would \nhouse their police force and other municipal offices.\n  Congress has specified a number of public purpose uses for which \nproperty can be transferred to local governments at a reduced cost. The \nFederal Property and Administrative Services Act allows property to be \ntransferred to public agencies and institutions at discounts of up to \n100 percent of fair market value for a number of purposes: public \nhealth or educational uses, public parks or recreational areas, \nhistoric monuments, homeless assistance, correctional institutions, \nport facilities, public airports, wildlife conservation, and self-help \nhousing. This type of transfer is called a public interest conveyance.\n  I strongly believe that law enforcement is an important public \npurpose for which surplus property should be used. Moreover, in \nfairness to local communities with tight budgets, Congress needs to \npreserve this option for communities that are counting on being able to \nuse this authority.\n  Again, I am delighted that the bill managers have decided to accept \nthis amendment, and I hope that this provision will be retained in \nConference.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3399\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on the status of domestic preparedness \n              against the threat of biological terrorism)\n\n       On page 378, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1027.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) during September 1999, Hurricane Floyd ran a path of \n     destruction along the entire eastern seaboard from Florida to \n     Maine;\n       (2) Hurricane Floyd was the most destructive natural \n     disaster in the history of the State of North Carolina and \n     most costly natural disaster in the history of the State of \n     New Jersey;\n       (3) the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared \n     Hurricane Floyd the eighth worst natural disaster of the past \n     decade;\n       (4) although the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     coordinates the Federal response to natural disasters that \n     exceed the capabilities of State and local governments and \n     assists communities to recover from those disasters, the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency is not equipped to \n     provide long-term economic recovery assistance;\n       (5) it has been 9 months since Hurricane Floyd and the \n     Nation has hundreds of communities that have yet to recover \n     from the devastation caused by that disaster;\n       (6) in the past, Congress has responded to natural \n     disasters by providing additional economic community \n     development assistance to communities recovering from those \n     disasters, including $250,000,000 for Hurricane Georges in \n     1998, $552,000,000 for Red River Valley Floods in North \n     Dakota in 1997, $25,000,000 for Hurricanes Fran and Hortense \n     in 1996, and $725,000,000 for the Northridge Earthquake in \n     California in 1994;\n       (7) additional assistance provided by Congress to \n     communities recovering from natural disasters has been in the \n     form of community development block grants administered by \n     the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n     Administration;\n       (8) communities affected by Hurricane Floyd are facing \n     similar recovery needs as have victims of other natural \n     disasters and will need long-term economic recovery plans to \n     make them strong again; and\n       (9) on April 7, 2000, the Senate passed amendment number \n     3001 to S. Con. Res. 101, which amendment would allocate \n     $250,000,000 in long-term economic development aid to assist \n     communities rebuilding from Hurricane Floyd, including \n     $150,000,000 in community development block grant funding and \n     $50,000,000 in rural facilities grant funding.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) communities devastated by Hurricane Floyd should know \n     that, in the past, Congress has responded to natural \n     disasters by demonstrating a commitment to helping affected \n     States and communities to recover;\n       (2) the Federal response to natural disasters has \n     traditionally been quick, supportive, and appropriate;\n       (3) recognizing that communities devastated by Hurricane \n     Floyd are facing tremendous challenges as they begin their \n     recovery, the Federal agencies that administer community and \n     regional development programs should expect an increase in \n     applications and other requests from these communities;\n       (4) community development block grants administered by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, grant programs \n     administered by the Economic Development Administration, and \n     the Community Facilities Grant Program administered by the \n     Department of Agriculture are resources that communities have \n     used to accomplish revitalization and economic development \n     following natural disasters; and\n       (5) additional community and regional development funding, \n     as provided for in amendment number 3001 to S. Con. Res. 101, \n     as passed by the Senate on April 7, 2000, should be \n     appropriated to assist communities in need of long-term \n     economic development aid as a result of damage suffered by \n     Hurricane Floyd.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3422\n\n (Purpose: To amend S. 2549, to provide for the coverage and treatment \n of unutilized and underutilized plant-capacity costs of United States \n  arsenals when making supplies and providing services for the United \n                          States Armed Forces)\n\n       At the end of title III, subtitle D insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, this is an amendment that corrects a \nflaw in Department of Defense procurement rules that has increased \nmilitary costs and had a severe impact on this nation's arsenals. \nRecently implemented rules requires U.S. arsenals to overstate their \ntrue cost of supplying goods and services to the military. As a result, \narsenals have been losing bids\n\n[[Page S5082]]\n\non contracts under competitive bidding procedures, even when use of an \narsenal would lead to lower overall costs for the Department of \nDefense. This quirk in the rules has not only increased Department of \nDefense expenditures; it has also led to severe underutilization of the \narsenals, threatening the viability of an invaluable national resource.\n  Under Defense Working Capital Fund procurement rules, which were \nimplemented in 1996, government-owned military suppliers are required \nto charge the military the full cost of any good or service that they \nsupply to the Armed Forces. The idea behind these rules was to \ndiscourage overconsumption of goods and services by the military, and \nto promote cost transparency--to make it clear to the government how \nmuch it was paying to have a good or service supplied by a government-\nowned facility. Individual military departments were encouraged to seek \nthe lowest price available for goods and services--and to allow private \ncompanies to compete with government-owned facilities for military \ncontracts.\n  Unfortunately, the DWCF rules also include a number of provisions \nthat place domestic facilities at a substantial disadvantage to their \nprivate competitors. The domestic suppliers are required to include a \nnumber of items in their contract bids that are unrelated to their \nmarginal cost of actually supplying a good or and service to the \nmilitary. For example, suppliers are now required to bill their net \ncapital investment costs in a given year to all of their customers in \nthat year--even if the equipment that was purchased has no relation to \nthe customers' contracts. More severe for the arsenals is the DWCF \nrules' treatment of reserve capacity. All U.S. arsenals are required to \nmaintain excess capacity, in order to be able to ramp up production \nimmediately in the event of a war or military crisis. This unused plant \ncapacity is something that no private business would maintain--a \nprivate business would simply sell off or lease out its unused assets. \nAnd the costs of maintaining this capacity are substantial. But DWCF \nrules, as they presently exist, require the arsenals to include reserve \ncapacity costs in their bids when they compete with private companies \nfor military contracts.\n  The results of this system have been predictable. Arsenals have \nrepeatedly lost work to private companies, even when the true marginal \ncost of having the work performed by an arsenal is less than the price \ncharged by a private contractor. Moreover, the United States government \nends up paying for the arsenals' unused capacity anyway--either through \nhigher costs on other arsenal contracts, or through accumulated \noperating deficits built up by the arsenals. Though the individual \nmilitary department saves money when its purchasing agents buy from a \nprivate contractor instead of an arsenal, when those purchasing \ndecisions are driven by avoidance of reserve capacity costs, the \nmilitary as a whole loses. The government pays for reserve capacity \nanyway, and the military pays more to have the work done by a private \ncompany that the true marginal cost of having it done by an arsenal.\n  These conclusions are confirmed by a 1999 Department of Defense \nreport on the DWCF system. The Defense Working Capital Fund Task \nForce's Issue Paper emphasizes that under the current system, though \nimmediate purchasers may pay a lower price, ``the DoD will ultimately \npay twice for maintaining both the essential organic capability as well \nas contracting out'' for the good or service. The DWCF rules' \noverpricing of arsenal services not only ``encourage[] behavior that is \nnot optimal for the military as a whole,'' it also leads to an \nincreasing disparity between military and private suppliers that \n``results in an increasing abandonment of DWCF services.''\n  For these reasons, I introduce the present amendment. This amendment \nprovides for direct funding of unused plant-capacity costs at United \nStates arsenals. By removing these reserve-capacity costs from arsenal \nbid prices, the amendment would allow arsenals to compete on an equal \nfooting with private companies. And by allowing arsenal prices to \nreflect true marginal costs, it would not only bring more business to \nthe arsenals; it would save money for the government. No longer would \nmilitary purchasers be discouraged from using an arsenal when its \nactual marginal costs--those that would be charged by a private \nbusiness--are less than the prices charged by a private contractor. And \nfinally, direct funding would promote the goal of cost transparency--\nthe original goal of the DWCF system. Separately budgeting for reserve \ncapacity--while also allowing arsenal prices to reflect the true costs \nof providing goods and services.\n  Finally, I wish to emphasize that allowing the arsenals to fall into \ndisuse would be a grave loss for the United States military. In my home \nstate of Illinois, the Rock Island Arsenal has long been an important \nmilitary resource. It is a proven, cost-effective producer of high-\nquality military equipment. It has also served as a valuable supplier \nof last resort, providing mission-critical parts and services to the \nDepartment of Defense when private contractors have lacked capacity or \nbreached their contracts. The arsenal has been called on to provide M16 \ngun bolts when a private contractor defaulted on a contract. It has \nalso produced mission-critical shims and pins for the Apache helicopter \nwhen outside suppliers were unable to meet the Army's deadline.\n  The U.S. government acquired Rock Island, which lies in the \nMississippi River between Illinois and Iowa, in 1804. The first U.S. \nmilitary base on the island was Fort Armstrong, established in 1816. In \n1862, Congress passed a law that established the Rock Island Arsenal. \nConstruction of the first manufacturing buildings began in 1866 and \nfinished with the last stone shop in 1893.\n  In the late 1980s, the Department of Defense invested $222 million in \nRock Island Arsenal's capabilities. The arsenal is now the Department \nof Defense's only general-purpose metal manufacturing facility, \nproviding forging, sheet metal, and welding and heat treating \noperations that cover the entire range of technologically feasible \nprocesses. The Rock Island Arsenal also has a machine shop capable of \nspecialized operations such as gear cutting, die sinking, and tool \nmaking; a paint shop certified to apply chemical agent resistant \ncoatings to items as large as tanks; and a plating shop that can apply \nchrome, nickel, cadmium, and copper and can galvanize, parkerize, \nanodize, and apply oxide finishes.\n  Direct budgeting of unused plant capacity will allow arsenals' bids \nto reflect their true marginal costs of production and service, thereby \nincreasing efficient use of the arsenals, reducing costs for the \nDepartment of Defense as a whole, and preserving an invaluable military \nresource.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3423\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, today is the 223rd anniversary of the \nadoption, by the Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia, of a \nresolution establishing a new symbol for the new nation that was then \nin its birth throes. The resolution, passed on June 14, 1777, was a \nmodel of simplicity, specifying only ``that the flag be 13 stripes \nalternate red and white; that the union be 13 stars, white in a blue \nfield, representing a new constellation.'' Although the flag reputedly \nstitched by Betsy Ross arranged the stars in a full circle, other \nversions of this first flag placed the stars in a half circle or in \nrows, as the resolution did not state how the new constellation was to \nbe configured.\n  This first flag, like the Constitution to follow it in 1787, was not \nentirely new, but rather predicated on flags that had come before it. \nAn English flag, known as the Red Ensign, flew over the thirteen \ncolonies from 1707 until the Revolution. The body of this flag was red, \nwith a Union Jack design in the upper left corner composed of the \ncombined red-on-white Cross of St. George, patron of England, and the \nwhite-on-blue diagonal cross of St. Andrew, patron of Scotland. The Red \nEnsign was the merchant flag of England, reinforcing for the colonists \nand their status as an unequal and lesser partner in their relationship \nwith Mother England.\n  The Grand Union flag that first succeeded the Red Ensign was raised \non January 1, 1776, approximately a year after the American Revolution \nhad begun, over George Washington's headquarters in the outskirts of \nBoston. The Grand Union flag retained the Union Jack in the upper left \ncorner, but the solid red body of the English trade flag was now broken \nby six white stripes. However, the stripes alone did not represent \nenough of a separation from England, and, a year later, the patron \nsaints of England and Scotland were removed from the flag, to be \nreplaced by the ``new constellation,'' more representative of the new \nnation which was then decisively vying for freedom.\n  In the ensuing years, stars and stripes were added to the flag, \nreflecting the growth of the young nation. The flag flying over Fort \nMcHenry during the naval bombardment of September 13 and 14, 1814, that \ninspired Francis Scott Key to compose the immortal words that became \nour national anthem, contained fifteen stars and fifteen stripes. By \n1818, the number of stars had climbed to twenty, while the number of \nstripes had shrunk back to the more manageable thirteen. On April 4, \n1818, Congress adopted another resolution to specify that the number of \nstripes on the flag would forever remain at thirteen, representing the \noriginal thirteen colonies, while a star would be added to the flag for \neach new state to join the union.\n  Henry Ward Beecher once said:\n\n       A thoughtful mind, when it sees a Nation's flag, sees not \n     the flag only, but the Nation itself; and whatever may be its \n     symbols, its insignia, he reads chiefly in the flag the \n     Government, the principles, the truths, the history which \n     belongs to the Nation that sets if forth.\n\n  Certainly, knowing the history and evolution of the American flag \nfrom the Red Ensign, through the Grand Union flag, to the Stars and \nStripes,\n\n[[Page S5084]]\n\none can see clearly into the early history of our nation. The symbolism \nof the flag also echoes the principles of our government, with each \nstate represented by its own star in the constellation, equal to all \nthe other stars, and each one a vital part of the constellation as a \nwhole.\n  I think that it is also reflective of our nation of free people that \nthe idea for Flag Day arose, not from a Governmental decree, but from \nthe people. The idea of an annual day to celebrate the Flag is believed \nto have originated in 1885, when B.J. Cigrand, a school teacher from \nFredonia, WI, arranged for pupils of Fredonia's Public School District \n6 to celebrate June 14 as ``Flag Birthday.'' Over the following years, \nMr. Cigrand advocated the observance of June 14 as ``Flag Birthday'' or \n``Flag Day'' in magazine and newspaper articles, as well as public \naddresses.\n  In 1889, George Balach, a kindergarten teacher in New York City, \nplanned Flag Day ceremonies for the children in his school. His idea of \nobserving Flag Day was subsequently adopted by the State Board of \nEducation of New York. In 1891, the Betsy Ross House in Philadelphia \nheld a Flag Day celebration, and in 1892, the New York Society of the \nSons of the Revolution held similar festivities.\n  The Sons of the Revolution in Philadelphia, and the Pennsylvania \nSociety of Colonial Dames of America, further encouraged the widespread \nadoption of Flag Day, and on June 14, 1893, in Independence Square in \nPhiladelphia, Flag Day exercises were conducted for Philadelphia public \nschool children. The following year, the Governor of New York directed \nthat American flags be flown on all public buildings on June 14, while \nin Chicago, more than 300,000 children participated in that city's \nfirst Flag Day celebration.\n  On May 30, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson established by proclamation \nthe first official Federal Flag Day on June 14. On August 3, 1949, \nPresident Harry S Truman signed an Act of Congress designating June 14 \nof each year as National Flag Day.\n  So now, thanks to the inspiration of a pair of elementary school \nteachers who had the vision to bring to life a vivid bit of history for \ntheir young students, we are reminded to look out our windows for a \nbright bit of cloth floating on the breeze, and to recall the struggle \nthat created it, and the great country which it represents so ably and \nso proudly. There is just nothing like it, nothing like the Stars and \nStripes. For in that couple of yards of fabric, we can see the origin \nof our Nation, its beginnings. We can see the bit of British history \nthat we all share, whether or not any English blood actually flows in \nour veins. It is in the very shape of our flag, with its red field \nsplit by white stripes of separation, in the white stars on a blue \nfield supplanting the British crosses. We can sense the oppression of \nthat unequal partnership. We can feel the frustration of being a \nsubject colony in those white stripes that separate and break up the \nred field of the British trade flag. And, we can sense the purpose and \noptimism of the new nation, so eloquently portrayed by the ``new \nconstellation'' of white stars against a deep blue sky.\n  I am proud to follow in the footsteps of B.J. Cigrand and George \nBalach, and pay homage to this anniversary date. I hope that my \ncolleagues and those who are listening and watching through those \nelectronic eyes, might offer their own salutes to the flag today, and \nresolve to celebrate today or future Flag Days by unfurling their own \nflags and flying them proudly. In my own house, over in McLean, I fly \nthe flag when I am there and can watch the flag and take it down if \nraindrops start to fall. I hope that more Americans, and more American \nchildren, might be inspired by the sight of that flag and might do \nlikewise, and that they might learn the history of their flag, and \nlearn to honor and cherish and respect it, on Flag Day and every day.\n  I close with the stirring words of Henry Holcomb Bennett, who wrote \n``The Flag Goes By:''\n\n       Hats off!\n       Along the street there comes\n       A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums,\n       A flash of color beneath the sky:\n       Hats off!\n       The flag is passing by!\n\n       Blue and crimson and white it shines,\n       Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines.\n       Hats off!\n       The colors before us fly;\n       But more than the flag is passing by:\n\n       Sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great,\n       Fought to make and to save the State;\n       Weary marches and sinking ships;\n       Cheers of victory on dying lips:\n\n       Days of plenty and years of peace;\n       March of a strong land's swift increase;\n       Equal justice, right and law,\n       Stately honor and reverend awe;\n\n       Sign of a nation great and strong\n       To ward her people from foreign wrong:\n       Pride and glory and honor, all\n       Live in the colors to stand or fall.\n\n       Hats off!\n       Along the street there comes\n       A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums;\n       And loyal hearts are beating high:\n       Hats off!\n       The flag is passing by!\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, while we are in this morning business \nperiod, I want to take a few minutes to advise the body about a bill \nthat has cleared through the House and we have held two hearings on in \nthe Foreign Relations Committee and one I hope we are going to be able \nto clear through here and pass into law during this session.\n  It is a bill dealing with one of the darker sides of the \nglobalization of the world's economy that has occurred around us. \nGlobalization of the world's economy has been, by and large, a very \ngood thing, a positive thing for growth and opportunity, but it also \nhas a seamier side to it. One of the seamier issues that is coming to \nlight now is the international trafficking of primarily young girls in \nthe sex trade, or as its known, international sex trafficking.\n  One is astounded by the level at which this is occurring today around \nthe world. By our own Government's numbers, approximately 600,000 \nprimarily young girls are trafficked from one country to the next for \nthe business of prostitution.\n  There are about 50,000 girls who are, against their will, trafficked \ninto the United States each year into this terrible sort of activity.\n  In January of this year, I was in Nepal and visited a home where \ngirls who have returned from this terrible trafficking of human \nindividuals live. What I saw there was a ghastly sight. There were \nyoung girls, 16, 17, 18 years of age, most of whom had been tricked out \nof their villages in Nepal and promised a job at a carpet factory or a \njob as a housekeeper in Katmandu--sometimes in Bombay, India these \ngirls took the job offered, not having any other economic opportunities \navailable to them. Once taking the job and moving out of their villages \nand away from their families they were forced into a brothel. They were \nlocked in a room, beaten, starved, and submitted to the sex trade, at \ntimes being subjected to as many as 30 clients a night.\n\n  I saw them after they had escaped. Or in this case, there was a \nnongovernmental organization, private sector group that was actually \norganized to try to return the young girls to Nepal. Once they were \nfreed and got back to Nepal, most of these girls returned only to die. \nTwo-thirds of them come back with such things as AIDS or tuberculosis. \nThey are coming back to die.\n  It is a disgusting, terrible thing that is taking place. We held two \nhearings in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. We have had \nwitnesses before the committee who had been forced into this trade, \ntricked into it, deceived into it, or thought they were going to do \nsomething else, and were ultimately trafficked into different places \naround the world.\n  Dr. Laura Lederer of Johns Hopkins University has spent several years \ntracking this flow. The committee heard from women from Eastern Europe \nand Europe who had been trafficked into Israel, people who had been \ntrafficked throughout Asia and then\n\n[[Page S5085]]\n\ninto the United States from Mexico. Most of the trafficking into the \nUnited States occurs from Asia.\n  They described the conditions surrounding their being bought and \nsold. After they are forced into one brothel, if the brothel owner \nwants somebody else, they will sell this person to another brothel. \nThey told us $7,000, $8,000 will exchange hands for the sale of human \nflesh from one place to another--all against this person's will. They \nhated the conditions that they were in, and yet they found themselves \nunable to escape.\n  This bill that I mention has passed the House of Representatives. It \nis a bipartisan bill that Congressmen Chris Smith and Sam Gejdenson \nhave pushed to get passed through the House of Representatives.\n  Senator Wellstone and I have the Senate version of this bill. While \nours is a different bill, there are a lot of similarities with the \nHouse bill--which is at the desk. We are seeking to get it passed, we \nhope by unanimous consent, by this body because the issue is so \nterrible, so disgusting, and awful. We need to put some focus on this \nand have some remedies to it.\n  Increasingly, you are seeing international organized crime groups \ngetting involved in the trafficking of human flesh. Apparently, they \nbelieve this is a business they can be successful at, that unlike \ndrugs, it does not involve as many criminal activities because much of \nthis has not been criminalized. They are saying it is a situation where \nthey can resell their ``property.'' Unlike drugs they sell once, they \ncan sell human flesh multiple times.\n  It is just a ghastly, terrible thing that is taking place. Organized \ncrime is increasing its activity in this arena, trafficking. We need to \nstep up and address it.\n  The bill we have put forward would allow the prosecution of people \nwho traffic in human flesh and increase the criminal penalties for \ndoing such. It would provide visas for people who are trafficked into \nthis country, so they can stay and provide evidence, testifying against \nthose who have trafficked them into this country.\n  This bill would provide some help to the countries they come from by \nproviding educational assistance to work with those governments, to \nwork with people that are in-country to work against this sort of \nactivity, and to provide more information to people that sex \ntrafficking is going on on an expanded, global scale. Nearly some \n600,000 people a year are trafficked in human flesh. Much of this \nhappens in the United States, 50,000 people are trafficked into the \nUnited States on an annual basis.\n  I will happily provide to any offices interested in this issue the \nhearing record Senator Wellstone and I have compiled on this bill, so \nMembers can look into this issue. If they seek to make modifications to \nimprove the bill, our office will be open to work with any office so we \ncan reach unanimous consent on this important issue. It is something we \nneed to and can address. The Administration wants this addressed as \nwell and is working with us to make that happen. The focus on this \nissue is increasing. In fact, you may have seen one of the recent news \nreports about this hideous practice.\n  I am hopeful the time is coming where this body will address this, \nthat it will not get held hostage to any other legislative matter that \nmight be having problems. I am hopeful that we see this as clearly \nsomething we can address and that needs to be addressed. I will be \nbringing to the Senate individual stories of people who have been \ntrafficked because they really tell the terrible plight.\n  One lady testified in our committee who was trafficked out of Mexico \nwho thought she was going to get a job washing dishes at a restaurant \nin Florida. She agreed to having somebody take her across the border \nillegally. Once in the United States, she was their hostage, she was \ntheir slave, if we want to put it in those gross types of terms. They \nsaid: Instead of being a dishwasher, you will be a prostitute for us. \nWe are going to move you around in trailers to use, and we will subject \nyou to 30 clients a day and, after that is done, to the owners of this \nbrothel as well.\n  This was the testimony of a witness who reported on activities \noccurring in this country within the past several years. It is \noccurring on a large scale. We need to address it; we need to deal with \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5085-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5085]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GAMBLING ON INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, another issue I am hopeful of getting \nin front of the Senate this year is a bill to ban gambling on \nintercollegiate athletics.\n  Yesterday the House held a hearing in the Commerce Committee and a \nmarkup on a bill to ban gambling on intercollegiate athletics in the \nUnited States. There is only one State in which that can occur today. \nIt is in Nevada. There is clearly a problem we need to address. We have \nhad more points shaving scandals in collegiate sports in the decade of \nthe 1990s than all prior decades combined. There is about $1 billion a \nyear bet on our student athletes. It has been a big problem on our \ncollege campuses and is growing. We have one State where it is still \nlegal. In all the rest of the States, this is illegal. In order to deal \nwith the problem of collegiate gambling, we need to make the gambling \non our kids illegal. Again, currently it is legal in only one State, \nand that is Nevada.\n  The NCAA is a strong supporter of banning gambling on college sports \nas are all the coaches. Yesterday, the House Judiciary Committee heard \nfrom Tubby Smith from the University of Kentucky and Lou Holtz, \nfootball coach. Both testified strongly in favor of this bill. They \nwant to get this gambling influence contained at the collegiate level.\n  I am hopeful we will reach agreement to have a vote on this issue \nsometime before the legislative year expires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a few days ago, June 12, we were \nadvised of a security incident associated with our Los Alamos National \nLaboratory in New Mexico. The particular notification initially came \nout in a press release from Los Alamos, unlike a press release from the \nDepartment of Energy. It specifically stated that the Los Alamos \nNational Laboratory announced a joint Department of Energy-Federal \nBureau of Investigation inquiry underway into the missing classified \ninformation at the DOE Laboratory. The information was stored on two \nhard drives. It was an electronic transfer. These two hard drives were \nunaccounted for.\n  This is a serious matter, to say the least. The press release \nindicated that at this point there is no evidence that suggests \nespionage involved in this incident.\n  Today we had an opportunity to hold a joint hearing between the \nIntelligence Committee, chaired by Senator Shelby, and the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, which I chair. It was rather enlightening \nbecause the Secretary of Energy was not there, although he was invited. \nThe significance of what we learned was that no one bears the ultimate \nresponsibility. The Department of Energy suggests that they designated \ncertain people to bear this responsibility. There was a process and \nprocedure underway, but circumstances associated with the disastrous \nfire, the need for evacuation and other factors, all led to the missing \ndocumentation and the two hard drives.\n  I can generalize and suggest that, well, our national security to a \ndegree went up in smoke at the time of the disastrous fires in New \nMexico. You can lose your car keys, but you don't lose these hard \ndrives.\n  What we are talking about is the very highest security interests of \nthis Nation. Missing on the hard drives is the highly sensitive \ninformation that covers not only the Russian nuclear weapons programs \nbut how we arm and disarm nuclear devices. Imagine what\n\n[[Page S5086]]\n\nthis would mean if it fell into the hands of terrorists. They could \ntheoretically steal a nuclear device and either arm it or disarm it. \nThat is the kind of information for which we cannot account.\n  Earlier today this body voted 97-0 to confirm the new czar, Gen. John \nGordon, who has been waiting since May for confirmation. It had been \nheld up by Members on the other side who had a hold on his nomination. \nThe question of responsibility is a reasonable one. We had the \nassurance of the Secretary of Energy that he bore the responsibility \nfor security in the laboratories after we had the Wen Ho Lee incident. \nThat was widely publicized; it was widely debated. Not only that, at \nthat time, Members will recall, there was a special commission set up. \nThis commission came as a result of a report from the House. That \nreport ultimately resulted in the appointment of a former respected \nSenator, Warren Rudman, who has since retired. The purpose of that \nreport was to analyze the security at the laboratories at that \nparticular time.\n  I will read a couple of inserts and findings from that report because \nI think they bear on the credibility of what we are hearing from the \nDepartment of Energy. One of the findings stated:\n\n       More than 25 years worth of reports, studies and formal \n     inquiries--by executive branch agencies, Congress, \n     independent panels, and even the DOE itself--have identified \n     a multitude of chronic security and counterintelligence \n     problems at all of the weapons labs.\n       Critical security flaws . . . have been cited for immediate \n     attention and resolution . . . over and over and over . . . \n     ad nauseam.\n\n  They haven't been corrected.\n  Further, the report again was the Rudman report. The open-source \ninformation alone on the weapons laboratories overwhelmingly supports a \ntroubling conclusion: Their security and counterintelligence operations \nhave been seriously hobbled and relegated to low-priority status for \ndecades.\n  That, again, is associated with the Wen Ho Lee security breach.\n  Finally, Senator Warren Rudman indicates:\n\n       The Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy \n     that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself. \n     Accountability at DOE has been spread so thinly and \n     erratically that it is now almost impossible to find.\n\n  Well, we heard this morning that the Secretary is going to appoint--\nor has appointed--our respected colleague, Senator Howard Baker, and a \nvery distinguished House Member, Lee Hamilton, to give a report on the \nfindings as to the security adequacy at the labs. Well, I welcome this \nin one sense, and I reflect on it with some question in another, \nbecause clearly what Senator Rudman recommended in his report, \n``Science at its Best; Security at its Worst'' was not followed by the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  The action taken by both the Senate and the House in the manner in \nwhich we proceeded with legislation to authorize an energy czar was \nobjected to by the Secretary of Energy through the entire process, \nalmost to the point of eluding congressional intent in the law, and the \nfact that others felt inclined to hold up his nomination until the vote \ntoday, 97-0. I think that reflects on the squeaky wheel theory. The \nwheel squeaks enough today, and we finally put our czar, Gen. John \nGordon, in a responsible position.\n  But the barn door has been left open, and it is inconceivable to me \nthat we have not had adequate explanations of how this could occur. You \ncan go to the library and get a card, take out a book, and they know \nwho took out the book. If you are overdue, you pay a penalty. But not \nin the Department of Energy secured area. They have their so-called \nnest people who have access to this. It is estimated that that number \nis 86 or so. They take this material in and out.\n  What happened is rather interesting on this particular day, according \nto the testimony we had. I will leave you with this concluding thought: \nOn May 7, the fire was moving toward the laboratory. The obligation of \nthis nest group is to ensure that if the laboratories were to fall \nvictim to the fire so that no one could get in for a period of time, \nthey would have these hard drives available if somewhere there were a \nnuclear device that was prepared to or exposed somewhere to go off, \nthat this team could take this technology on these two hard drives and \ngo off and disarm them. They had that obligation. So they proceeded to \ngo into the secured area and they asked permission and got permission \nfrom one of the deputies to enter. They went to remove the two hard \ndrive disks, and they found that they were gone; they weren't there.\n  Now, what they did is rather interesting. They didn't notify their \nsenior officials. They simply moved over to another shelf where a \nduplication of these hard drives was available and they took those. \nThen, after the fire, they went back and searched the place, could not \nfind it, and finally they reported it, I think, on May 24. It was a \ntimeframe from May 7, when the fire started, and on May 24 a team went \nback and searched again, and then at about the end of May, they called \nthe DOE and in early June the story broke.\n\n  Those are the facts up until now. When you hear the explanations, you \njust shake your head and say, how could this happen? And then, of \ncourse, the questions we have are: Who might have this information? If \nthey had it, what might they be able to do with it?\n  Some of these questions have to be responded to in a secure \nenvironment because of the national security interest. Some have said, \nwell, the appropriators didn't give them enough money to ensure a \nfoolproof system. They asked for $35 million and I think they got $7 \nmillion. It doesn't take $7 million to put in a foolproof checkout \nsystem. They don't even have cameras in these secured areas. They don't \nknow who is going in and out--other than they have to have a certain \nsecurity clearance to go in. But there is no checkout system. It is \nunbelievable.\n  We need answers and we are going to pursue this matter. As a \nconsequence of the situation to date, clearly, the DOE and the labs \nhave not been under control. I hope now that we have cleared the \nnomination, with the vote of 97-0, of the National Nuclear Security \nAdministrator, that process can get underway. But there are a lot of \nquestions that remain. The two missing hard drives contain secrets \nabout every nuclear weapon in the world--just not ours. We should \npursue this matter because clearly the buck has to stop somewhere.\n  When Congressmen Norm Dicks and Christopher Cox in their report \nconcluded that China had design information--the Wen Ho Lee case--that \nshould have been enough. The report by Senator Warren Rudman should \nhave been an alarm, and the action by the Senate and the House to \nestablish the energy czar should have been enough. But it wasn't. \nToday, as I said, the squeaky wheel got some grease. We have Gen. John \nGordon in the position, but we have a lot of questions unanswered and a \nlot of people who assured us that they bore the responsibility that \neverything was under control. We found out today that it isn't.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have come to the floor for the next few \nminutes to talk about something that is\n\n[[Page S5087]]\n\nvery important to our country. Last week, I rose in defense of the \nsecond amendment to our Constitution. Why? Because it is under \nrelentless attack at this moment by our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle. It is under relentless attack by the White House and has \nbeen now for nearly 8 solid years. They want to deny that there is a \nsecond amendment, or that there are legitimate rights under that \namendment, and they simply want to control or shape what many Americans \nbelieve to be their constitutional right under the second amendment, \nand that is the right to own a firearm in this Nation.\n  The second amendment reads:\n\n       A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security \n     of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear \n     Arms, shall not be infringed.\n  It is a simple amendment, but, oh, what a powerful force it brings; \nand, oh, what important emotions it engenders in our country.\n  The enemies of the right to keep and bear arms tell us that because \nthe word ``militia'' is present, the second amendment only protects the \nright of the Government to keep and bear arms.\n  If anyone in this body is a student of American history and \nunderstands the thinking of our Founding Fathers, they recognize their \nhostility toward a central government and their willingness to control \na central government and give the citizens the greater expression of \nfreedom but, most importantly, power over that central government.\n  Somehow, our colleague would like to ignore those thoughts and the \nmind set and the belief of the framers of our Constitution. But let me \ntell you that our framers knew what they were talking about. They said, \n``A well regulated Militia'' means, in the words of George Mason, ``the \nwhole people''--``the whole people'' was the regulation militia--\n``except a few public officers.''\n  So never mind their restrictive reading of the Constitution. I think \nour scholars of history have widely recognized and rejected the idea \nthat there is a narrow interpretation.\n  They tell us the second amendment only protects hunting and sport \nshooting. Read the Constitution. It is so very clear. It doesn't even \nmention the words ``hunting and sport shooting.'' I don't believe the \nterm ``sport shooting'' was something used in those days. Hunting \ncertainly was perceived to be a right, and even a responsibility, and a \nnecessary tool of many families to put food on the table.\n  They cite Supreme Court cases--such as United States v. Miller--that \nstate the second amendment protects private ownership of military-style \nweapons; then they try to ban private ownership of military-style \nweapons. How can you use the argument to argue its purpose and then \nturn and try to do quite the opposite?\n  I will simply point out for a few brief moments this afternoon the \nreal inconsistencies in the argument that is presented by my colleagues \non the other side and the blatant ignoring of our Constitution by the \nWhite House. But then those of us who are observers of the White House \nare not terribly surprised by that.\n  Am I being harsh? I don't think so, Mr. President. I think I am being \nvery clear in what I say.\n  Senate gun controllers have said they do not want to confiscate the \nguns of Americans. But then other leaders in other countries--including \nGreat Britain, Nazi Germany, Cambodia, Australia, Cuba, and Soviet \nGeorgia--have said the same, and they would only license and register, \nand not confiscate. And, of course, they did license, they did \nregister, and then they confiscated.\n  With my time remaining, let me point to a few examples as to why our \nGovernment said there was a right and why our Founding Fathers said \nunder our Constitution there is a right.\n  Every 13 seconds, the stories I am about to tell you are repeated \nacross this Nation. Every 13 seconds in America, someone uses a gun--\nnot to kill someone else, but to stop a crime, to protect their \nproperty, to protect their life. Every 13 seconds across America, our \ncitizens do what our Founding Fathers knew they must do as a free \ncitizen; that is, protect themselves in the right of self-defense. That \nis so much what our second amendment is about.\n\n  Let me tell you about this lady, whom I show here on the chart, from \nSpring Hill, FL, May 24 of this year. It says: ``A pistol-packing \ngrandmother with a license to carry calmly approached a man with a \nknife who was scuffling with employees at a Wal-Mart and ordered him to \ndrop'' the knife. He dropped the knife. She held him at bay. They \ncalled the cops, and the cops arrested him.\n  Thank you, grandma, for being willing to defend your rights and the \nintegrity of others.\n  Let me talk about someone who invaded the home of one of our citizens \nin Benton Harbor in Berrien County.\n\n       Prosecutor Jim Cherry announced Thursday he will not file \n     homicide charges against a man who shot and killed Rodney Lee \n     Moore last month at a Benton Harbor housing complex.\n\n  Why? Because this man was defending his life and defending the life \nof his family. He had been attacked. He had been injured. And yet, he \nstruggled, he found his gun, and he protected his person by taking the \nintruder's life.\n  That is the right of a free citizen in a free society--to defend \noneself and one's property.\n  One more example. I know there are other colleagues on the floor who \nwish to speak on other issues. But it is an important example.\n  It was the night of January 31 of this year in Apache Junction, AR, \n25 miles from Phoenix. It began when a woman was getting into her SUV \nin a Wal-Mart parking lot in nearby Chandler. She was approached by a \nman riding a bicycle. He pulled out a gun, forced her into her SUV, and \nmade her drive to an isolated area 15 miles away. He raped her. Then he \nabandoned her in the desert.\n  According to the Chandler Police Department sergeant, Ken Phillips, \n``He left her in a desert area and starts to drive away, but turns \naround, comes back, and he shoots her twice.'' The woman, suffering \nfrom bullet wounds in her face, her chest, and her arm, was \nmiraculously able to walk a quarter of a mile for help.\n  This dangerous criminal then drove his victim's SUV to the home of \nhis former boss, Jeff Tribble. In that home, Mr. Tribble, his 28-year-\nold wife Bricie, and their 9-year-old nephew resided. The criminal \nbroke into their house. What happened? Sergeant Phillips said that this \ngentleman's wife, Mr. Tribble's wife, got her gun and shot the criminal \ntwice--once in the face and once in the chest--and he dropped dead. \nThen she called 911 to report the shooting of an intruder who had just \nhours before raped and shot another person.\n  Those are the stories that are not being told to America today. And \nthey happen every 13 seconds across our Nation. Two and one-half \nmillion Americans annually use the second amendment right to protect \nthemselves, their property, their children, and their spouses. That is \nthe right of a free citizen. That is why the second amendment is in the \nConstitution.\n  I do not in any way by these statements fail to recognize the \ntragedies that occur when a gun is misused in our society. It is \nmisused much too often. But it is time we speak out.\n  I have said several times to those who may be listening or who might \nread my statement to call me or write me. Tell me about your story. \nTell me about what happened in your community. Literally, citizens are \nnow doing that. Tell me about the right of the free citizen to protect \nthemselves and their property.\n  It is very simple. It is, Larry Craig, U.S. Senator, Washington, DC, \n20510.\n  I would like to hear from you. I think it is time America is heard, \nabout how other Americans use their sacred right of the second \namendment to protect themselves and their loved ones.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5087-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5087-S5088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNITED STATES NONMILITARY ARSENALS\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee, Chairman Warner, and also the ranking member, Senator Levin, \nfor the amendment I offered, that they have accepted, I am told. My \namendment addresses the situation with our Nation's military arsenals.\n\n  We have the Rock Island arsenal in Rock Island, IL. It lies on an \nisland in the Mississippi River between the border of Illinois and \nIowa. The Rock Island Arsenal dates back to just about\n\n[[Page S5088]]\n\nthe time of the Civil War. It has been producing outstanding equipment, \nwith outstanding personnel, to our Nation's military for well over 100 \nyears.\n  A few years ago, the military changed its procurement rules to \nrequire our Nation's arsenals, when they were bidding on a contract, to \nprovide military hardware to our Army or Defense Department. It \nrequires them to submit bids that not only include their marginal cost \nfor producing the product but, in fact, requires them to add into their \nbid the entire overhead.\n  This new policy which the Defense Department established a few years \nago has actually been harming taxpayers. Why, someone might ask, has \nthat been harming taxpayers? What has been happening, as our Nation's \narsenals--and there are three in this country; in addition to one in \nIllinois, there is one in New York and also one in Arkansas--go to bid \non projects to provide supplies to the military, and they have to not \nonly state their cost of building those supplies, they also have to add \nin the cost of their overhead. That means in analyzing those bids, the \nmilitary is always going to prefer the bid of the private contractor.\n  In fact, our arsenals have been losing business from the U.S. \nGovernment. This has been harming taxpayers. The reason it has been \nharming the taxpayers is because once we pay the private contractor to \nbuild the weapon or perform on the contract, we are still paying to \nkeep the arsenals open. So the taxpayers wind up paying twice for the \nproject.\n  For example, a few years ago the military requested a new Light Towed \nHowitzer. They wound up giving the bid to a British defense firm. The \nRock Island Arsenal lost out on the bid. The Government paid the \nBritish defense firm to start on the contract, but meanwhile, the \nGovernment and the taxpayers are still paying to keep the arsenals \nopen.\n  My amendment is designed to correct this flaw which is wasting \ntaxpayers' money. From now on, under this amendment, when domestic \norganic arsenals in this country bid on a military project, they will \nbe able to state their incremental cost for building the product, if it \nis a Howitzer or other weapon for the military. This way, it will be \nmore fair to the arsenals. They will be able to bid their actual cost \nand the playing field won't be tilted in favor of the private \ncontractors.\n  Actually, the Department of Defense convened a defense working \ncapital fund task force a couple of years ago that noted that the \ntaxpayers were being billed twice for these military contractors; that \nit didn't make any sense. In fact, that issue paper which came out on \nFebruary 25, 1999, and was issued by the defense working capital fund \ntask force, concluded that\n\n       [T]he Department of Defense will ultimately pay twice for \n     maintaining the essential organic capabilities as well as \n     contracting out for the goods or services.\n\n  It went on to say that these rules cause an artificial, a fictitious \nbookkeeping entry that overprices the arsenal services and not only \nencourages behavior that is not optimal for the military as a whole, \nbut also leads to an increasing disparity between military and private \nsuppliers that ``results in an increasing abandonment of arsenal \nservices.''\n  Mr. President, I compliment the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee and Chairman Warner and also the ranking member for accepting \nmy amendment. We should be able to help our Nation's arsenals and \nparticularly the Rock Island Arsenal in Rock Island, IL, as well as \nsave the taxpayers of this Nation some of their hard-earned money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It may have been a little difficult during basic training for \nsome, but as we progressed through basic training and became Army men \nand women, formed, shaped, and molded from raw recruiting into \nsomething that America could be proud of, and we could be proud of \nourselves, that touch, that impact, that molding, that shape, has \ndefined our country, has defined our culture, and has, in fact, defined \nthe world. The U.S. Army has had an incredible effect on our country \nand the world for the better.\n  ``Duty, honor, country'' is the motto of the U.S. Army. It is \nAmerica. It is who we are. Not one generation of Americans who have \nserved in the U.S. Army have gone untouched by not only what America is \nabout but what the Army is about. It is a shaping and molding that has \ntouched lives in ways that are hard to explain, just as the Army has \ntouched our national life and made the world more secure, more \nprosperous, and a better world for all mankind.\n  On this 225th birthday of the U.S. Army, as an old infantry-man who \nserved in the U.S. Army, I say happy birthday to the veterans of this \ncountry. We recognize and acknowledge and pay tribute to those \ngenerations who have served before some of us had the opportunity to \nserve a newer Army.\n  It is the Army that has laid the foundation for our services today \nand for a stronger America. To that, we say, again, happy birthday and \nthank you, in the great rich tradition of the U.S. Army.\n  Mr. President, we say ``hoo-ha.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I take a few moments to commend the Senator from Nebraska \nfor his remarks. I think he speaks for most of us, if not all of us. He \nspeaks eloquently in congratulating the Army. That is something we \nshouldn't forget: The role of the Army, what the Army stands for, what \nthe Army has done, often at a tremendous price, as we know. We \nshouldn't forget that.\n  I commend the Senator from Nebraska for his remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5088-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5088-S5099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 7475) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     September 30, 2001, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Under the previous order, the \nlanguage of S. 2720 is before the Senate as amendment No. 3426.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the pending business before the Senate is \nthe House bill, is that right, or the Senate bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The House bill, with the Senate language as an \namendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. We have some procedural obstacles to clear, is my \nunderstanding here. In the meantime, what I will do is go ahead and \nmake my opening statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, chairman Stevens and the leader asked us \nto move quickly on this year's Transportation appropriations bill, and \nI'm happy to say that with the assistance of the senior Senator from \nNew Jersey, we have reported a bill for the Senate's consideration. I \nam speaking of the Senate bill now. Considering that the Senate \napproved the Transportation appropriations bill in September last year, \nI suppose that presenting this bill during the second full week in June \nwould qualify as moving more quickly this year.\n  I commend Senator Stevens and Majority Leader Lott for pushing this \nagenda.\n  Both Senator Lautenberg and I strongly support this package, though\n\n[[Page S5089]]\n\nneither one of us agrees with every decision and funding level that is \nincluded in the bill and report. However, this bill contains the \nessential elements of a Transportation appropriations bill that meets \nthe challenge of adequately funding the Transportation programs within \nthe budget constraints that we have set for Federal spending in fiscal \nyear 2001.\n  I will spend a few minutes on the bill funding summary.\n  The bill provides a total of $54.7 billion, which is $4.7 billion \nmore than the fiscal year 2000 enacted level. Because the firewalled \nhighway and transit programs account for most of this growth--not to \nmention the increases in aviation capital investment anticipated in \nFAIR-21 that this body approved just a few months ago--we have been \nleft with no choice but to constrain the growth in the FAA and Coast \nGuard operations accounts and Coast Guard capital account. \nNevertheless, I am confident that, with responsible management, the \nfunding levels for FAA operations and for the Coast Guard are adequate \nto meet the challenges of safely and effectively managing the nation's \nairways and the execution of the Coast Guard missions.\n  I note that the administration requested 15 percent growth in the \nCoast Guard operations account and 12 percent in the FAA operating \nexpenses account. The bill before you today directly provides 9 percent \ngrowth in both those operating accounts with an additional 4 percent \npotential growth available to the FAA operations account if necessary \nto maintain aviation safety at the discretion of the Secretary of \nTransportation and the FAA Administrator.\n  That is a lot of money--and a great deal of growth under the \nbudgetary constraints we are operating under. At the same time, the \nfunding levels in our bill require the Secretary to balance the \ncritical needs of both the Coast Guard and the FAA as he (or she) \nmanages the Department. My concern is not that we haven't provided \nenough resources. My concern is that they won't be administered with an \neye towards saving the taxpayers money or toward seeking efficiencies \nin program execution.\n  We have rejected the administration's proposal to divert highway \nfunds in Revenue Aligned Budget Authority--or RABA--to other programs. \nThis unrealistic proposal raised expectations, but is nothing more than \na case of the administration wanting to say they support the highway \nfirewalls while proposing to spend the money on nonhighway activities. \nYou can't have it both ways.\n  We have also rejected the administration's proposal to levy new user \nfees. Three years ago during my first year as chairman of the \nTransportation subcommittee, we said no to the administration's new \nuser-fee taxes, 2 years ago, we said no again to the new and improved \nuser-fee taxes from the administration, and last year, we again said no \nthanks to the newly reconstituted user-fee tax proposal from the \nadministration. Guess what? This is my fourth year as chair of the \nTransportation appropriation subcommittee, and the President's budget \nagain includes $1.3 billion in new user-fees taxes--I am starting to \nrecognize a pattern. Is anyone in the administration listening to what \nCongress is saying about new user-fee taxes?\n  Along these lines, I would note that the shortfalls that the \nadministration will complain about in the FAA operations account in \nthis bill are far short of the user-fee proposals that they have \nproposed for the FAA, not to mention the Coast Guard. If the \nadministration would refrain from submitting budgets with new user-fee \ntaxes as a budget gimmick that they know will never be enacted to hide \nother non-transportation spending, it would make all our jobs a lot \neasier to meet realistic targets and expectations for these operations \naccounts.\n  The bill before you meets the TEA-21 firewall levels for highway and \ntransit investment. In highways, the RABA funding has all been \ndistributed to the states in accordance with each state's share of the \nprogram consistent with last year's Senate appropriations bill. In \nshort, every states gets more highway funds through the approach taken \nin the bill before you. I urge every Senator to refer to the table I \nwill insert in the Record to see the total highway funds that will be \navailable for highway construction in his or her state through the \napproach we propose.\n  The transit new starts and bus projects are not earmarked, which is \nthe way the Senate has handled these programs the last 2 years. This is \nan approach that has worked well for the Defense appropriations process \nwith respect to the National Guard equipment account, and I believe \nthat it is a good model for balancing congressional and administration \npriorities in the allocation of discretionary transit projects.\n  The bill provides $4.4 billion for the activities of the U.S. Coast \nGuard, and, as I mentioned earlier, there is an 9 percent increase for \nthe operating expenses of the Coast Guard. I think we can all agree \nthat it is essential to provide the Coast Guard with the resources they \nneed to continue their tradition of maritime search and rescues, \nprotecting the environment and our coastlines, and enforcing our laws \non the seas.\n\n  There are a few general provisions that I would draw to your \nattention. One requires the administration to submit with their budget \nrequest an accounting of what programs are to be cut if the Congress \ndoes not choose to enact the next complement of new user-fee tax-budget \ngimmicks.\n  Although there are other issues that will be discussed during \nconsideration of this bill, I will note one now. That issue is the \nnational ``.08'' blood alcohol content provision. Senator Lautenberg, \nwho is managing his last Transportation appropriations bill this year, \nmakes a compelling case for why the states should adopt ``.08''. This \nlanguage was included in the bill at his request and will vote to \nsupport its inclusion the bill the Senate passes. I urge you to look at \nit and consider it carefully.\n  The bill before the Senate sets the stage well for a conference with \nthe House. The House 302b for Transportation appropriations has \nsubstantially more budget resources than the bill before us today. As a \nresult, the House passed bill is higher in a number of accounts than \nthe bill before the Senate today. Notably, the Coast Guard has $150 \nmillion more in the Operating Expenses account, $100 million more in \nthe AC account--the Coast Guard's capital improvement account, and \nthe FAA operations account is $200 million higher than the Senate bill. \nWe have included a number of flexibility provisions for the Secretary \nof Transportation and for the FAA administrator to soften the impact of \nthose cuts from the President's budget request, but the fact remains \nthat we are below the House appropriated levels in those accounts in \nparticular. In addition, there are a number of specific projects or \nprocurements that are included in the House bill that are not in ours, \nand a number of initiatives in our bill that are not in the House-\npassed bill. I believe that we can resolve all of these issues in \nconference to the satisfaction of both bodies and present a conference \nreport that the President will sign.\n  We know of a few amendments to the bill and we would encourage those \nMembers who have amendments to come to the floor to offer them or to \nsee if they can be accepted. We want to work with Members where \npossible and will seek time agreements on amendments so we can move the \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I also would be remiss if I did not note my colleague, \nSenator Lautenberg, has joined us. He is the former chairman of this \nsubcommittee and is now the ranking Democrat. I have enjoyed working \nwith him on this subcommittee. This will be the last Transportation \nbill he will help manage. I can tell my colleagues that he has rendered \na great service to his State and to the country. He has been a lot of \nhelp to me as I have worked through this process, the same road which \nhe has been down many more times.\n  Before yielding the floor, I ask unanimous consent that a list of \nrevenue aligned budget authority be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\n\n\n                    REVENUE ALIGNED BUDGET AUTHORITY\n                        [In thousands of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                             Full RABA\n              STATE                 Admin.

Development Highway, High Priority Projects).\n\\2\\ Includes Territorial High Priority Projects.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, first, Senator \nShelby, with whom I have worked a number of years on more than one \ncommittee, has established a working relationship that, frankly, I \ntreasure as one of the best I have had since I have been in the Senate. \nWe rarely agree on policy differences, but one thing we do agree on is \nthat we have respect for one another. We listen and try to resolve our \ndifferences.\n  As everyone knows, the way we finally resolve differences is the \nmajority says this is what we are going to do, I concur, and we go \nahead and do it.\n  It has been a pleasure working with Senator Shelby and members of the \nsubcommittee over these past few years. This is my last Transportation \nappropriations bill. I look forward to reaching agreement among our \ncolleagues and sending the bill to the House, resolving whatever \ndifferences there might be, and the President signing it into law while \nthere is still time before we have an omnibus appropriations bill \nbefore us.\n  This is a decent bill. It was reported out of the Appropriations \nCommittee yesterday by a unanimous vote. I thank Senator Shelby for his \nleadership and skill in maneuvering around the number of obstacles that \ninvariably come up and still not have people angry or unwilling to \ndiscuss their issues.\n  During yesterday's markup, a number of amendments were adopted that I \nbelieve improve our initial subcommittee product. I, therefore, rise in \nstrong support of the bill and encourage my colleagues to support it as \nwell. Everybody is not going to get what they want in the bill. Senator \nShelby does not even though he is the chairman. I am the ranking member \nand I do not get what I want, for sure. I would have permitted Senator \nShelby to be even more generous than he has been. That is his choice. \nHe treated me and the members of the committee fairly.\n  Over the last 14 years, I do not believe I have ever managed this \nbill without expressing the importance of balancing how we address the \nNation's transportation needs, and that is to look at all modes. We \ncannot be attentive to highways without being attentive to transit, by \nway of example. It is not enough to look out for the marine safety \nagenda and the Coast Guard; we also have to pay attention to the \naviation safety needs of the FAA. We must recognize that while some \nStates are wholly dependent on highways and rural aviation to meet \ntheir transportation needs, other States depend heavily on commuter \nrail and Amtrak to move their citizens. A balanced approach is what is \nneeded, and I believe the bill before us embodies that balance.\n  This bill fully funds the growth in highway and transit funding we \ncalled for in TEA-21, the highway bill that was enacted a couple of \nyears ago. The bill also fully funds the request for Amtrak's core \ncapital grant. While the funding levels for certain accounts in the FAA \nand Coast Guard might appear to be austere, a more indepth review of \nthe bill before us and prior actions by the Senate sheds some further \nlight on this situation.\n  Specifically, the bill before us would cut the Coast Guard by $257 \nmillion. However, it is important to note that only a few weeks ago the \nSenate passed a supplemental appropriation of over $800 million for the \nCoast Guard, and all of that supplemental funding will be available on \na multiyear basis.\n  That is one of the anomalies: We give an agency such as the Coast \nGuard ever more responsibilities, whether it is just doing the \nnavigation assists, the buoys, and the charts, or whether it is \nstopping illegal immigration, or whether it is pursuing drug transport \nby boat, or whether it is managing the licensing of vessels that ply \nour waters making sure they stay up to date and do not violate the \nstandards that are required for ships entering our waters. They are now \nputting .50-caliber guns, and some larger, on helicopters in the Coast \nGuard to intercept or interrupt the drug flow that is devastating our \ncountry.\n  Whatever you need, the Coast Guard is always there. We are always \nsqueezing and squeezing, but this year we have figured out a way to \ntake care of it. There is no one who does not respect the Coast Guard \nfor the job they do and looks to them when an emergency arises. Whether \nthere is an oilspill or some other disaster that includes travel on the \nseas, the Coast Guard is there.\n  In the case of the FAA's operations account, it appears we reduced \nthe administration's request by more than $240 million. It is important \nto note that within the appropriations for the FAA's facilities and \nequipment account, the bill includes $64 million for operating \nexpenses. That shortage we talked about, again, was the operations \naccount.\n  Moreover, as a result of an amendment I offered during the full \ncommittee markup, there is now an additional $120 million available for \noperating expenses from the $3.2 billion appropriations for airport \ngrants.\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\n  I want to clarify what I am discussing. I am talking about putting in \nover $3 billion in airport grants, airport improvements, be it \nterminals or access routes in and out. There are all kinds of things \nfor which the airports can use these funds so they can handle the \nexpanding need for passengers who want to take airplanes. I support it \n100 percent. We cannot continue to expand a facility without having \nenough of a crew--I will use the term--to manage it. One would never \ndream of taking a ship that needs a 1,000-person crew and saying: OK, \nwe are going to put in new electronics, but we are going to cut down on \nthe size of the crew. We would never understand it nor agree to it.\n  The changes we have made enable this bill to provide a $634 million, \nor 11-percent, increase for FAA operations. Nobody wants to be up in \nthe sky with too few controllers guiding the traffic as they do.\n  I fly a lot in the second seat in airplanes. That is the way I prefer \nto travel. I know when the controllers are stressed or when the flight \nservice stations are not giving the data needed or when it delays \ndepartures or takeoffs. We want to ensure safety, above all. When we \nput our families in an airplane, whether it is a flight from New York \nto Washington or whether it is a cross-country flight, we want to know \nthey are traveling in as safe a condition as possible. Our aviation \nsystem is safe. I point that out.\n\n  But when it is not operating as it should, it comes out in delays. It \nis akin to borrowing to pay your bills. The longer it takes to get a \nflight started, the worse things become later on. We know that whether \nit is a flight from New York to Washington, to use that example, or if \nit is a flight from Denver to Los Angeles; what happens on that leg \nfrom New York to Washington affects what happens on the leg from Denver \nto L.A. That is the nature of the system. It is a huge system. It is \nall interconnected. We have to have enough people in the key spots to \ntake care of things.\n  There are several other items of importance in this bill that I think \nbear mentioning at this time.\n  I thank my subcommittee chairman, Senator Shelby, for including \nprovisions in the bill to implement a national drunk driving standard \nof .08 blood alcohol content. This provision passed the Senate in 1998 \nby an overwhelming margin. However, the House never had an opportunity \nto vote on the measure.\n  The administration still strongly supports implementation of .08 as \nthe national standard for blood alcohol content. It has been said by \nseveral institutions that have studied this problem that by reducing \nthe standard across the country from .10--that is parts per million of \nalcohol to blood--we could save 500 to 700 lives a year. It does not \nsound like much in the abstract--500 to 700 lives a year--but if it is \na child in your household or a family member in your neighborhood or a \nfriend, the effects are devastating.\n  I remember one time I had a discussion with the occupant of the Chair \nabout a friend of his son's who was badly injured in an automobile \naccident. The pain that permeates a community is unmatched. Thank \ngoodness we are focused on what happens with our children. Whenever we \nhave a chance to do something to protect them, we do it--protecting any \nmember of a family.\n  So when we ask now for .08 to be the standard, we are saying to 500 \nto 700 families, who will never know they have been protected from \ndisaster, that it was because we demanded a better standard for \nautomobile safety.\n  This provision works in the same way as the minimum drinking age law \nwhich I authored back in 1984, signed into law by President Reagan, and \nassisted by Secretary Elizabeth Dole at the time. To this point in \ntime, it is estimated that the minimum drinking age law saves over \n1,000 lives a year. Over 15,000 families have been spared mourning over \nthe loss of a child because this applies almost exclusively to very \nyoung people.\n  The .08 provision holds the promise of saving the lines of an \nadditional 500 persons every year. So I thank Senator Shelby again for \nincluding this provision in the bill.\n  The Members should be aware there is a separate provision in this \nbill that prohibits the administration from implementing its newly \nproposed ``hours of service'' regulations pertaining to truck and bus \ndrivers. Many interested groups have voiced strong opposition to the \nadministration's proposed rule. I personally oppose certain aspects of \nit, as well. However, I have concerns with the remedy that is proposed \nin the bill.\n  The administration has already shown renewed willingness to \nreconsider aspects of this rule by extending the comment period on \ntheir proposal by 90 days. So it gives those who have views about what \nthis bill should look like or the conditions it should carry an extra \n90 days to present those views, and then perhaps we will take the \nsubject up again. I note that this prohibition is not included on the \nHouse side, so it is something that may come up in the conference.\n\n  I hope that before we go to conference, all concerned Members can \ndiscuss this issue in the time that is available with Secretary Slater, \nto discuss this issue and advance the cause of safety on our highways.\n  Finally, I thank all the members of the Transportation Subcommittee \nfor their friendship and assistance throughout the process. I am not \ntalking exclusively about the Democrats. We worked with Republicans. \nSometimes there are disagreements in policy that can't be bridged, but \nwe talk about it, and we try to iron out the problems and see if we can \naccommodate, by consensus, the bill. We have again delivered a \nunanimously supported bill to the floor.\n  I especially thank Senator Shelby again. His leadership of the \nsubcommittee has been excellent. He has always kept me, the minority \nranking member, informed of his plans for the subcommittee. He has been \nevenhanded in his approach to addressing Members' funding priorities. \nWe have developed a good friendship throughout this process.\n  I want to say, while the chairman of the full Appropriations \nCommittee is here, that I thank him, as well, for his willingness to \nlisten. Too much listening often kills the time that a chairman can get \nhis bill through, but Senator Stevens held his patience, his temper, \nand he permitted us to air our views, and we got the bill done in very \ngood form.\n  I also extend my thanks to Senator Robert C. Byrd, who is the ranking \nmember on the Appropriations Committee. I have worked with him since my \nfirst day in the Senate. He is a brilliant, patient man and has been a \nleader for me, a mentor for me. Even with all this white hair, we still \ncan have mentors and enjoy a relationship. We can still learn. I have \nfound that out. My kids teach me that every day. But the relationship \nbetween Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd is excellent, as we have \nalways seen in this Appropriations Committee.\n  I also give a special thanks to my team, to Peter Rogoff, who so \nskillfully manages the staff on our side, Denise Matthews, Laurie \nSaroff, and Mitch Warren on the Democratic side. And to Wally Burnett; \nhe always knows what side of the aisle he works for and makes sure he \nis diligent about it, but he makes certain that our messages get \nthrough and that they do have a hearing before the bill gets put to \nbed. I appreciate Wally's leadership, and Joyce Rose and Paul Doerrer, \nas well.\n  With that, if there are any amendments Members want to bring to the \nfloor, they ought to do that. This bill was moved expeditiously, \ncarefully through the process. It is here. So we can eliminate much of \nthe griping and complaining about having bills linger on forever and \nwinding up--in the final analysis, before the October 1 fiscal year \nstarts, the new year--in an omnibus bill, where a bunch of things are \ncrashed together, without having a good, comfortable feeling about what \nis in the bill: How does it affect my State? How does it affect the \ncountry? If you get it the last minute, you do not have a chance to \nreview those things.\n  Here we have a bill that has been carefully engineered and is ready \nto go. We would like to get it done. If I asked the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee when he would like to get it done, he would \nsay certainly this afternoon. But we will be taking amendments. That is \nthe process. Hopefully, we can get it over to the conference committee \nand maybe have this bill signed into law by the time the next break \ncomes at the end of June.\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the pending bill is on Transportation \nappropriations. I wish to comment not only on the content of the bill \nbut on the managers of the bill.\n  I am sorry they are not here, though I note the chairman of the full \ncommittee is.\n  I thank the chairman, Senator Shelby of Alabama, for the courtesies \nand cordiality he extended to me as he worked on the physical \ninfrastructure needs of Maryland. I am continually grateful for his \ncooperation.\n  I also want to say something about a very dear friend, and pay my \nrespects to someone I have worked with up and down the Northeast \ncorridor, on the highways and byways of Baltimore, of Maryland, and our \ncountry. That is, of course, the very distinguished Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Lautenberg.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1986 and was sworn in in 1987, I was the \nvery first Democratic woman ever elected to the Senate in her own \nright. At the time of my arrival, there was only one other woman in the \nSenate, the very wonderful Senator from Kansas, Ms. Nancy Kassebaum.\n  When I gave speeches out in the community, they would say: Senator \nMikulski, what is it like to be the only Democratic woman Senator? I \nwould say that although I was all by myself, I was never alone because \nthere were wonderful men in the Senate who helped me get started, who \nshowed me how to be effective, and how to be a very good Senator. Of \ncourse, I had a great senior Senator, Mr. Paul Sarbanes. I had the help \nof the then-chairman of the full committee, Senator Bob Byrd, and \nothers, such as Senator Kennedy and Senator Dodd.\n  But also right there in appropriations was someone who I counted on \nand looked up to, and who was really a help, my very good friend, \nSenator Lautenberg. That is why I was never by myself because I could \nturn to Senator Lautenberg.\n\n  What a way he had on appropriations--bringing his businessman's savvy \nand yet his total compassion for people. He brought to the \nAppropriations Committee a need to see how we could be compassionate \nabout people today and yet look at the long-range needs of our country.\n  That is what he brought to the Transportation Subcommittee.\n  While we were working on how to build America and its physical \ninfrastructure, Senator Lautenberg looked beyond bricks and mortar. He \nwas looking at people.\n  It was under his leadership that he brought to our attention the \nissue related to terrorism and how we could protect our people, whether \nit was on the high seas or at airports.\n  He was the one who talked about the impact of smoking and what it \nmeant to both airline passengers as well as those who worked on the \nairlines.\n  Most recently, he has also talked about the issue of the impact of \nhigh blood alcohol levels on the whole issue of drunk driving.\n  Senator Lautenberg brought public health and a public safety agenda \nto the Transportation Subcommittee. It has served the Nation well \nbecause we not only built communities but we have been able to save \nlives because of what I call ``the Lautenberg approach,'' which is \nputting people along with bricks and mortar. We are building \ncommunities and saving lives.\n  I hope long after the distinguished Senator no longer officially \nserves the people of New Jersey that ``the Lautenberg approach'' can be \nan approach that the Senate continues always thinking about people--\nputting people first, looking at every opportunity to enhance the \npublic safety and the public health of the people of this country and \nthe people who visit this country.\n  Again, although I was all by myself, I was never alone. The American \npeople owe Senator Lautenberg a great debt of gratitude. People are \nalive because of him today. I owe him a debt that I can never repay, \nexcept to follow the Lautenberg method.\n  Senator Lautenberg will always be with me in every day as long as I \ncontinue to be a Senator and a public servant.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senators for their kind attention, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my pal from Maryland. We have \nbeen good friends. Senator Mikulski said something that got my \nattention. She said she has looked up to me. We have differences in \nheight in a lot of places, but no one has ever looked down to Senator \nMikulski. She is a giant. What a welcome addition she was when she \nfirst graced the Democratic Party with her presence, followed by nine \nothers.\n  What a difference women have made in this body--not just cleaning up \nthe language, which helped, but also in making sure that we understood \nthere was a far different point of view on many issues. As Senator \nMikulski so clearly said and has always said, she listened. We can \nsteal a couple of things from commercials to say that when Senator \nBarbara Mikulski speaks, people listen. The Members here listen.\n  We share a common background in many ways. We both have Polish roots. \nSecond, we both have what I call an ordinary person's background; she \nin the bakery, and me in the newspaper store with our families trying \nto eke out a living each and every day.\n  One of the things that I thought we ought to do here, although \nprobably would not get enough votes to carry, is every Senator ought to \nspend a week in poverty living with a family in either an urban our \nrural environment to kind of get a feeling for what it is to worry \nabout putting food on the table, about putting decent clothing on a \nchild's back, not stylish things but decent clothing, a roof over their \nheads, a grandparent or a parent aging and needing help. What a \ndifference.\n  Senator Mikulski brought that background, as I hope I did to our \nfunction here. That is why we have a special kinship because we care \nabout the people we serve.\n  One of the happiest moments I have had since I have been in the \nSenate was the other day. I went to visit a school for the blind in New \nJersey, the only one that operates in New Jersey. It is run by the \nSisters of Joseph of Peace. With help from colleagues on the \nAppropriations Committee and throughout the Senate, I was able to get \nsome funding so they could build a relatively modest facility. They \nnamed a room after me in an ``Independent Life Section'' where they try \nto educate people on how to live by themselves, though visually \nimpaired and sometimes in total blindness. How do you get by?\n  I came in and there was a little child. I have a weakness for little \nkids because my oldest grandchild is 6. I have seven, six following \nhim, and No. 8 is going to be on the way before No. 1 turns 7. They are \na beautiful litter of puppy dogs. They are so cute I can only smile \nwhen I think about them.\n  This little child was 7. She was smaller in stature because her \nmother was an alcoholic, and she has fetal alcohol syndrome, which \nreduces size, in effect, and physical and mental health. This child was \nas bright as any child I have ever met. I picked her up, she said: \nWhat's your name?\n  I said: Frank.\n  She said: OK, Frank.\n  She rubbed her hands through my hair. She said: It feels sticky. I \nsaid: Yes, I put stuff on my hair. She asked: What kind of stuff? I \nwasn't doing advertising so I didn't give her the name.\n  Her vision is impaired with similar to a mesh screen in front of her \neyes. The only way she can focus her vision is turning her head. Her \nvision is like Swiss cheese; she had to constantly turn her head to \ncatch the channel through which she could see.\n  She was so bright. We wound up with a picture of her and me in the \npaper, me laughing, with her hands running through my hair.\n  If there is ever a doubt about the work we do here, about what it is \nwe debate so harshly at times, the things we legislate, the laws we \nwrite, about the ultimate test of whether or not we have done the right \nthing, how does it affect people? What is the impact on a family? What \nis the impact on a child?\n\n[[Page S5093]]\n\n What is the impact of a loss due to a drunk driver in a family? What \nis the loss when a child 6 years old takes a gun and kills another 6-\nyear-old? What is the impact? It is not only that family; it is the \nentire community, the entire school. What affect did Columbine have? \nWas it only the kids who were shot at, the kids who were pleading for \nhelp from the police? The kids who were running away in fear? No, it \nwas the entire character of our country.\n  We have to think about those things and their impact. Are these a \nquestion of States rights, of rights other than the rights to bring up \na child in safety? What is the most important right?\n  What was the Million Mom March about? The million moms marched \nbecause they were so hurt, so anguished that no one was listening \nsufficiently to say, OK, sensible gun control. We weren't taking away \neverybody's gun. If people want to hunt, they have a right to hunt. \nPeople need them for law enforcement jobs. Or if someone really thinks \nthey need it for protection, let them get a license and be identified. \nA million moms were down here to say: Please help us.\n  That is the measure. That is what I have always found from Senator \nMikulski, who manages this very important bill, VA-HUD, that takes care \nof veterans, housing, the National Science Foundation, and NASA. She \ndoes a remarkable job and we keep squeezing.\n  My relationship with Senator Mikulski, my relationship with other \ndear friends in the Senate is what I will miss terribly. This has been \none great experience. My desk is a couple rows back. If only my father \nor my mother could have seen what happens when I open the top of my \ndesk. It says: Harry Truman, Missouri. He sat where I sit now. My \nparents came here from Ellis Island with not a dime. They didn't \nunderstand the language. My parents were brought here as little kids. \nThey wanted to be in America; they wanted to talk English; they wanted \nto be part of the society. And they worked at it.\n  We are in this illustrious place. As Senator Byrd will state, about \n1,800 Members have served in the Senate since the founding of this \ncountry. And here we are, two good friends, sharing the same.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, each and every one of my colleagues has \nreceived a letter signed by this Senator and by Senators Bryan and \nFeinstein on the subject of CAFE standards--that is to say, the \nCorporate Average Fuel Economy standards--relating to gas mileage of \nautomobiles.\n  In that Dear Colleague letter, we indicated there would be a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution on that subject that would come before the \nSenate during the course of the debate on this Transportation \nappropriations bill. The reason we had adopted that course of action, \nidentical to the course of action we took last year, is that the Senate \nbill itself has no reference, one way or another, to automobile and \nsmall truck fuel economy. The House bill, however--as it has for at \nleast 10 consecutive years--prohibits the use of any funds appropriated \nin this bill for even the study of increasing the mandated fuel economy \nof automobiles and small trucks in the United States.\n  As a consequence, it seemed to us the only way we could get at this \nsubject, and perhaps reverse that very head-in-the-sand policy that has \nplagued us for so long, was somehow or another to express the views of \nthe Senate on the subject.\n  A year ago, 40 Senators voted with us, if my memory serves me \ncorrectly; 57 voted against us.\n  This year, however, the situation on appropriations bills has \nchanged. It has changed effectively by the readoption of rule XVI and \nthe extension of rule XVI, not only to substantive amendments but to \nsense-of-the-Senate amendments as well. As a consequence, we now need \nto notify our colleagues we will deal with this question in a different \nfashion.\n  The proponents of better fuel economy standards have not yet met \nformally to discuss our various alternatives, but in my view they are \nbasically two in nature. Technically, what is before us at this point \nis the House bill, including the prohibition against spending any money \non Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, with an amendment that \nstrikes everything after the enacting clause and substitutes the \nSenate-reported bill for the House bill.\n  So at this point, an amendment is in order to strike that funding \nprohibition in the House bill, which will give us a direct vote on the \nissue, though that House provision, together with every other House \nprovision, will eventually be stricken in any event by the adoption of \nthe Senate amendment.\n  Our other option is to wait until the end of the debate, wait until \nfinal passage of the Transportation appropriations bill, and make a \nmotion to instruct the Senate conferees to uphold the Senate position, \nsomething the Senate conferees have notoriously failed to do during the \ncourse of the last decade.\n  I am inclined to favor that latter course of action, but the group \nhas not yet made its decision. But we do wish all of our colleagues to \nknow we are not going to be engaged in any procedural legerdemain by \nany stretch of the imagination. We will be debating this issue. We \nregard the issue as vitally important.\n  Perhaps most significantly, I should like to say the ground of the \ndebate may be somewhat different from the debate a year ago, for \nseveral reasons--at least three in number. The first of those reasons \nis we were still living as a country in a fool's paradise a year ago, a \nfool's paradise of abnormally low retail prices for gasoline. During \nthe course of the last 12 months, of course, we have been subjected to \na huge runup in gasoline prices motivated almost entirely by the \nreanimation of OPEC and its throttling back on petroleum production \namong its various members.\n\n  This left us earlier this year with what I considered to be the \nhumiliating spectacle of a Secretary of Energy traveling from one OPEC \ncountry to another, hat in hand, asking those OPEC countries: Please, \nplease, please, resume higher production of your product and, thus, \nlower those product prices.\n  The point was that we had no bargaining ability as the United States \nof America whatsoever to accomplish that goal, and while there was a \nbrief respite, though nothing like a return to the original status quo \nin gasoline prices, we now know they are, once again, very much on the \nrise: increases of 30 to 50 cents a gallon in many places in the \nMidwest that have special air pollution requirements, the highest \nprices reported yesterday in the Washington Post, perhaps forever.\n  We can look forward with apprehension but with a real expectation of \nregular gasoline prices hitting $2 a gallon in the relatively near \nfuture. I cannot possibly emphasize enough the fact that this is a \npricing structure that is simply beyond our control because we have \nallowed ourselves to become so dependent on foreign oil. The largest \nsingle percentage of our trade deficit, which is itself alarmingly \nhigh, is due to the importation of foreign oil. We have three possible \nanswers to that question: We must either increase domestic production, \nencourage to an even greater extent than we do the use of alternative \nfuels, or to use the fuels we have more efficiently and more \neffectively. The latter not only has a very positive impact on the cost \nof gasoline to every consumer in the United States but also will, in a \nvery significant fashion, help clean up our air. We will bring this \nsubject up once again.\n  Second is the proposition that last year we were told--I am not sure \nentirely accurately--the law under which fuel economy was mandated did \nnot allow the Department of Transportation to consider the safety of \nvehicles that would be designed to meet these standards.\n  It is our explicit intention this year, whatever the validity of that \nargument, to allow the Department of Transportation, in fixing new \ncorporate average fuel economy standards, to consider factors of \nsafety. That was a major argument a quarter of a century ago against \nthe original CAFE standards. We were told everyone would be driving a \nsubcompact and death rates would go up markedly. We\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\nare not driving subcompacts. Our highways are far safer than they were \n25 years ago, and will be, again, I am convinced, if we once again \nsignificantly increase our mandated fuel economy. In any event, we are \nexplicitly allowing that consideration.\n  Third, whether one is on this side of the political aisle or the \nother side of the political aisle, it is obvious this process will not \nbe completed during the course of this administration. It will be \nanother administration, whether a Democratic or a Republican \nadministration, that will make that final decision, and the final \ndecision will, for all practical purposes, be subject to the same kind \nof prohibition that has prevented the study of corporate average fuel \neconomy for the last two and a half decades.\n  This is a vitally important matter. I commend Chairman Shelby and \nChairman Stevens, once again, for not including any such prohibition in \nthe Senate bill. This time we want the prohibition stricken from the \nfinal package, as well as not being included in the Senate bill itself. \nIt seems to me to be paradoxical and foolish that the United States of \nAmerica should consistently say, in spite of our magnificent \ntechnologies, in spite of the huge advances in technologies in the last \ncouple of decades, that this is a subject we will not even study. And \nthat, in effect, is what the present law requires of us.\n\n  It makes Luddites of us. It says we are afraid of such a study. It is \nperfectly acceptable to increase our dependence on petroleum products \neach and every year; that in spite of the technology, we are going to \nbe as ostriches with our heads in the sand and not go forward at all.\n  I believe that to be an indefensible position, but as I say, this is \njust simply both the invitation to join us in this cause and a \nstatement that there will be a vote on this issue. Whether in the form \nof an amendment to the House bill or in the form of instructions to the \nconferees is not yet certain.\n  There will be plenty of additional time to debate this issue, and \ndebate it we will and vote on it we will. I am confident of a greater \nnumber of votes this year, for the reasons I have already outlined, \nthan was the case last year. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsaying the United States will, once again, lead not only in abstract \ntechnology but in applied technology, and begin at least not only to \nclean up our air but to reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and save \nmoney for our constituents every single day of their lives in which \nthey drive automobiles and trucks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3427 To Amendment No. 3426\n\n       (Purpose: To provide protection against the risks to the \n     public that are inherent in the interstate transportation of \n     violent prisoners.)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] for himself and \n     Mr. Ashcroft, proposes an amendment numbered 3427 to \n     amendment No. 3426.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my intention, just for purposes of \nunderstanding, to speak on this amendment for a few minutes. I \nunderstand that some will raise rule XVI on this issue. This is an \nimportant issue, and I want to have the opportunity, in this context, \nto discuss this legislation.\n  This amendment is in the form of a bill that I have introduced with \nmy colleagues, Senators Ashcroft, Grams,\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\nLeahy, and others. A bipartisan group of Senators introduced a bill \ndealing with the interstate transportation of violent criminals around \nthis country.\n  I want to describe why I think this is important. I have spoken about \nthis on the floor several times in the past.\n  I show you a picture of a man named Kyle Bell. Kyle Bell is shown \nstanding in this picture in shackles and handcuffs. He is a man who \nmurdered an 11-year-old girl in Fargo, ND. But that was not all of his \ncrime spree. He has committed other unspeakable acts, criminal acts. \nHis criminal behavior culminated in the murder of a young girl named \nJeanna North in Fargo, ND.\n  Kyle Bell was apprehended, sent to trial, and convicted of murder. \nWhen convicted of murder in the State of North Dakota, Kyle Bell was to \ngo to the penitentiary to spend the rest of his life. But instead, Kyle \nBell was put on a bus that was operated by a private company called \nTransCor. TransCor is a pretty good size company that hauls prisoners \naround America by contract. TransCor put Kyle Bell on a bus with about \n12 other prisoners. He was being transported, under the Prisoner \nExchange Program, to another prison in another State to be \nincarcerated.\n  They got to New Mexico. In fact, he was not going south, he was going \nstraight west, over to the State of Oregon. But they got to New Mexico, \nand this Kyle Bell escaped.\n  The bus stopped for gas, apparently. One security guard from this \nprivate company was buying gas. Another two were asleep in the bus. And \nanother was probably in buying a cheeseburger, as best we can tell. And \nso with both guards in the bus asleep--Kyle Bell apparently produced a \nkey for his shackles and handcuffs, crawled out the roof of the bus, \nand while he was in civilian clothing being transferred in this bus, \nwalked through the parking lot of a big shopping center, and they \ndidn't see him again.\n  Kyle Bell, this child killer, was on the loose for several months. He \nhas now been apprehended and he is back in prison. But I started \nevaluating what happened. It sounds as if the three stooges were given \ncustody of a convicted child killer: two guards asleep, another guard \nbuying a cheeseburger. What happened here? The more I look at it, the \nmore I understand that there is something fundamentally wrong on our \nhighways.\n  Do you know we have private companies taking possession of violent \noffenders, murderers, and others, to transport around the country, and \nthere is not one regulation they must meet in order to hire themselves \nout as transport companies? You can be a retired county sheriff, and \nyou and your brother-in-law and your wife can rent a minivan and say \nyou are in business to haul prisoners, someone will turn a convicted \nmurderer over to you, and away you go.\n  Interestingly enough, when they were transporting Kyle Bell, this \nchild killer--he escaped in New Mexico--do you know how long it took \nthem to understand he was gone, that he was not on the bus anymore? \nNine hours later they finally counted their prisoners on the bus, to \ndiscover they had lost a child killer--9 hours later.\n  We have a circumstance in this country where when you pull up to the \ngas pumps next to a minivan or a small bus, you may not know it but you \nmay be pulling up next to a minivan with four convicted murderers being \ntransported by a retired police officer and his brother-in-law.\n  In fact, in Iowa, a man and his wife, hiring themselves out as a \ntransport company, showed up at a prison to take possession of five \nconvicted murderers and a convicted kidnapper. And the prison warden \nsaid: You've got to be kidding me. You and your wife have come to take \npossession of five convicted murderers and a convicted kidnapper? The \nWarden said: You've got to be kidding me. But the warden turned the \nprisoners over to this man and his wife. And, of course, they escaped. \nIt is absurd for us to be turning violent criminals over to private \ncompanies that do not have to meet any basic or reasonable standards.\n\n  As I indicated, Kyle Bell is now back in prison.\n  We do not know what he did when he was on the loose. He was on the \nloose for some long while. They apprehended him in Texas, as a matter \nof fact.\n  Then, just a couple of weeks ago, I read in the newspaper that the \nState of Nevada was going to send a convicted murderer to North Dakota \nunder the Prisoner Exchange Program, a man named James Prestridge. So \nNevada was going to send a murderer to North Dakota. James Prestridge, \nalong with an armed robber, escaped in California while being \ntransported. The two of them were gone. Once again, we had apparently a \nkind of three-stooges approach by the people who were supposed to have \nbeen guarding these violent criminals.\n  They found the armed robber who escaped with Mr. Prestridge just \nsouth of the Mexican border with a bullet through his head, dead. They \napprehended James Prestridge recently. He is now back in prison.\n  Here is a man who is serving a life sentence without parole for \nfirst-degree murder, and he is turned over to a private company and \nthat private company loses him. Extraditions International is the name \nof that company.\n  My proposition is this. When we in our criminal justice system \nconvict violent criminals, convict people of murder, convict Kyle Bell \nof killing Jeanna North, I do not want those prisoners turned over to a \nprivate company that is going to put them in a minivan and transport \nthem across the country with guards who are ill-prepared and ill-\ntrained and follow no procedures. I do not want that to happen.\n  The private companies, if they are going to transport criminals \nacross State lines in this country, ought to have to meet basic \nstandards.\n  The amendment I have introduced--again, a bipartisan amendment--says \nthe Department of Justice should establish regulations that must be met \nby private companies that are going to haul violent offenders. The \nstandards should be no more than the standards that exist for law \nenforcement when they transport the same criminals.\n  I should mention, incidentally, the U.S. Marshals Service has a \nservice, for a flat fee, of taking these child killers and violent \noffenders anywhere in the country. In fact, I don't believe State and \nlocal governments ought to contract with private companies to transport \nviolent criminals, as they now do.\n\n  The legislation I propose would require that a private company that \nis preparing to do this must meet basic safety standards with respect \nto training and other kinds of security circumstances that would give \nthe American people some comfort that they are not in jeopardy by \ndriving down the highway only to confront a minivan or a bus carrying \n20 criminals coast to coast.\n  It might be useful to read into the Record other circumstances that \npersuade me there is something wrong in this area.\n  On January 22 of this year, three prisoners escaped while a van \ntransporting them stopped at a minimart for a restroom break. While the \ntwo guards weren't looking, two inmates jumped into the front seat \nwhere the keys had been left in the ignition. How much judgment did \nthat take? You are hauling criminals around the country. You stop at a \ngas station to go to the bathroom. You leave the keys in the vehicle. I \nam sorry; something is wrong. It is serious.\n  On July 24, last year, two men convicted of murder escaped from a van \nwhile being transported from Tennessee to Virginia. The two guards went \ninto a fast food restaurant to get breakfast for the convicts. When \nthey returned, they didn't notice the convicts had freed themselves \nfrom their leg irons, possibly with a smuggled key. While one guard \nwent back into the restaurant, the other stood watch--there is some \nimprovement; at least they are standing watch--but he forgot to lock \nthe van door. The inmates kicked it open and fled.\n  On July 30, 1997, convicted rapist and kidnapper Dennis Glick escaped \nfrom a van while being transported from Salt Lake City to Pine Bluff, \nAR. While still in the van, Glick grabbed a gun from a guard who had \nfallen asleep, took seven prisoners, a guard, and a local rancher \nhostage and led 60 law enforcement officials on an all-night chase \nacross Colorado. He was finally recaptured the next morning.\n  I won't read all of these, but there are plenty of them.\n  A husband-and-wife team of guards showed up at an Iowa State prison \nto transport six inmates, five of them\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\nconvicted murderers, from Iowa to New Mexico. When the Iowa prison \nwarden saw there were only two guards to transport six dangerous \ninmates, he reportedly responded: ``You've got to be kidding me.'' \nDespite his concerns, the warden released the prisoners into the \ncustody of the guards when told the transport company had a contract. \nDespite explicit instructions not to stop anywhere but the county jails \nor State prisons until they reached their destination, the guards \ndecided to stop at a rest stop in Texas. Of course, the rest is \npredictable. The six inmates escaped, stole the van, led police on a \nhigh-speed chase, and so on.\n  My point is, I wasn't aware, and I will bet most Members of Congress \nare not aware, that State and local governments are routinely turning \nviolent criminals over to the hands of private companies for transport \nacross this country. Yet there is no basic standard, no set of \nregulations to guarantee the safekeeping of those violent offenders. I \nbelieve there ought to be. Republicans and Democrats who have joined us \non this amendment believe there ought to be. That is the purpose of the \namendment.\n  I understand this will probably be subject to rule XVI. I also \nunderstand the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Shelby, is trying \nto get this subcommittee markup moving. I sympathize with that. Senator \nLautenberg wants the same thing. They want to get this through. I fully \nunderstand that. I hope the authorizing committee, where we hope to \nhave a hearing on this legislation, will allow us to get that hearing \nand to advance this matter in another way, if in fact it is subject to \nrule XVI.\n  It is my belief, and I think the belief of almost everyone, that \nsomething needs to be done in this area to set some commonsense rules. \nMy first choice would be, if you have a violent offender, a criminal \nwho has been judged violent by his or her behavior, they ought never \nleave the embrace of a law enforcement official. The address of someone \nconvicted of murder ought to be their prison cell until the end of \ntheir term, with no time off for good behavior. Convict them and put \nthem in prison.\n\n  Instead, what is happening is, too often they are being convicted and \nthen under prisoner exchanges turned over to a private company for \ntransport, only to discover that it is not very secure with respect to \nthis transport: Guards who are ill prepared, vehicles that are not \nsufficient, procedures that are nonexistent.\n  Lest one doubt that, when Kyle Bell escaped in New Mexico, a child \nkiller walked off the bus, a vicious child killer walked off the bus. \nThe guards in that bus didn't count heads to find out that 1 of their \ninmates had escaped for 9 full hours. They didn't miss a child killer \nfor 9 hours. Does anybody think this might be an area ripe for some \nthoughtful regulations and some thoughtful restraint? I think it is. \nThat is why I offer the amendment.\n  I thank the Senator for his indulgence. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, on behalf of the manager of the bill, I \nmake the point of order that the amendment violates rule XVI.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Conrad pertaining to the introduction of S. 2729 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a matter that will be \nbefore the body tomorrow. That is a motion to instruct conferees on an \nissue we have debated last year and in previous years dealing with \ncorporate average fuel economy, CAFE. That is an acronym that many \nAmericans are not familiar with, but it is something that can have a \nprofound and important impact on their lives. Perhaps a little \nbackground will be instructive.\n  In the early 1970s, our economy was sent into a convulsion as a \nresult of our dependence on imported oil, primarily from the Middle \nEast. The OPEC oil embargo, followed by the fall of the Shah of Iran \nlater in the decade, sent fuel prices skyrocketing, plummeted the \neconomy into a situation known as ``stagflation,'' and the effect was \ndevastating.\n  Congress responded in 1974 with a piece of legislation designed to \nmake the U.S. less dependent upon foreign oil and to provide for better \nfuel economy, thereby saving American consumers millions of dollars \neach year in fuel costs and improving the quality of the air and \nreducing our trade deficit.\n  In 1974, before these CAFE or fuel economies were established for the \nfirst time, the average fuel economy of all vehicles in America was \n13.8 miles per gallon. As a result of those CAFE standards adopted in \n1975, the current average is 28.1 miles per gallon. That is slightly \nmore than twice the average economy in 1974. The effect of that has \nproduced each and every day a savings of 3 million barrels of oil that \nwould otherwise have been consumed.\n  That issue was not an easy issue for the Congress to deal with in \n1974 because testimony before the congressional committees suggested if \nsuch standards were required, and they were set on an incremental basis \nto be expanded over the course of a decade, it was asserted that \nterrible things would happen in terms of consumer choice and size of \nthe vehicle. In 1974, the Ford Motor Company testified this proposal \nfor the fuel economy standards, which ultimately doubled fuel economy, \nwould require a Ford product line consisting of either all sub-Pinto-\nsized vehicles--some may recall that was the smallest automobile that \nFord made at the time--or some mix of vehicles ranging from a ``sub-\nsubcompact'' to perhaps a Maverick. The clear thrust of the testimony \nis, if these fuel economy standards are imposed upon the industry, a \nfull-sized four-door vehicle would be impossible to produce.\n  Let me skip for a moment to the present. Today, the largest \nautomobile--I am not talking about a sport utility vehicle--that Ford \nmakes has better fuel economy than the smallest produced in 1974. There \nis, indeed, a full range of vehicle choice available to American \nconsumers.\n  Chrysler Motors also joined in with the Big Three and made this \nstatement in 1974:\n\n       In effect, this bill would outlaw a number of engine lines \n     and car models, including most full-sized sedans and station \n     wagons. It would restrict the industry to producing sub-\n     compact-sized cars--or even smaller ones.\n\n  That was the testimony by Chrysler.\n  General Motors went on to say:\n\n       This legislation would have the effect of placing \n     restrictions on the availability of 5 and 6 passenger cars--\n     regardless of consumer needs or intended use of vehicles.\n\n  Once this legislation was enacted, the automotive industry, with some \nof the best and brightest engineering minds anywhere in the world, went \nto work. Indeed, astonishing technological developments occurred and \ntoday Americans enjoy a full range of automobiles in terms of size and \nchoice. We have been successful in saving 3 million barrels of oil each \nand every day, reducing to some extent our dependence on imported \nforeign fuel and alleviating, in part, the trade deficit.\n\n  Unfortunately, no new fuel requirements have been enacted since 1975. \nOnce again, the auto industry is suggesting that if, indeed, new fuel \neconomy standards are required, that customer choice, size of vehicle, \nand a whole host of safety concerns, will place the American public at \nrisk.\n  I am not sure what it is. I happen to be an automobile buff. I am of \nthe age that I can recall the excitement of the introduction each year \nof the new models, the changes and the configuration of lights, the \nchrome, the fins, all of the things that in my generation were pretty \nexciting stuff. And I love automobiles today.\n  So I come to the floor as a Member of this body not with any \nantipathy toward automobiles. I freely acknowledge both my dependence \nand my love of the American automobile. However, I must say there is \nsomething that\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\nmust be part of a corporate culture in the auto industry which has \nresisted over the years virtually any significant technological \nimprovement dealing with fuel efficiency, safety, or air pollution.\n  For decades, the automobile industry resisted the introduction of \nairbags. It took my colleagues, Senator Gorton and I, a decade ago to \nget that language changed. Today, Americans have a choice in their \nsafety. Many lives have been saved as a result of that. But the auto \nindustry strenuously resisted that effort.\n  Indeed, when catalytic converter technology came online, even though \nthe engineers acknowledged its significance, there was great resistance \nto requiring the introduction of catalytic converters. Our air is \ncleaner, our tailpipe emissions substantially less. Some of the major \ncities of America that still struggle with pollution now have perhaps \ntwice as many vehicles on the road, but their air is cleaner than it \nwould have been but for these technological advancements.\n  There must be something in the corporate culture of the automobile \nindustry that resists this technology. These are remarkably able and \ntalented engineers, the best and brightest. I wish they had more \nconfidence in themselves.\n  We are placed in an anomalous situation wherein none of the \ntechnology that has been available for the past quarter of a century, \n25 years, that might have enabled us to move forward and to improve \nfuel economy, to reduce our dependence on imported oil, has been used \nto help improve quality.\n  Since 1975, a rider has been added in the other body to this \nappropriations bill that prevents the Department of Transportation from \neven considering, even looking at any technological changes. In effect, \nit is a provision that requires us all to be deaf, dumb, and blind to \nany technology that has been developed in the last quarter century. I \nneed not remind my colleagues and the American public that the last 25 \nyears has been the most remarkable quarter of a century since human \nhistory was recorded in terms of technological advances; 25 years ago \nall but a handful of people would have been totally mystified if the \nterm ``Internet'' was used. E-commerce was not a part of our \nconversation. Nobody discussed e-mail or m-commerce. Indeed, most \nAmericans had never heard of cellular telephones. I just cite but two \nof the more obvious and more dramatic technological changes that have \nhad a profound impact upon our economy.\n  Here are the facts that we confront today. Unfortunately, once again \nin America we are becoming increasingly dependent on foreign oil. Mr. \nPresident, 54 percent of the oil consumed in America is imported.\n  That leaves us vulnerable to the vicissitudes of foreign policy \nconsiderations, instabilities, and political crises in the other parts \nof the world. Our thirst for fuel continues. Now, even more timely, we \nare seeing the price of gasoline rise to record levels. Earlier in the \nyear it achieved a high point, then dropped down, and now, with the \nonset of the heavy driving season in the summer, we are seeing those \nprices increase. So Americans are beginning to get hit in the \npocketbook. About 40 percent of all the oil we consume in America is \nconsumed by automobiles and light trucks or the sport utility vehicles.\n  So we have an opportunity to consider a number of public policy \nissues. No. 1, is it possible to achieve improved fuel economy, still \nleaving us a range of choice in selection of our vehicles? Would anyone \nargue that would be a bad result if it could be achieved? Fuel costs \nare responsible for roughly a third of the enormous trade deficit we \ngenerate each year in this country, the one economic indicator--in a \nfield which otherwise has nothing but bright horizons in front of us--\nthat is troubling to us economically. We cannot long sustain those \nkinds of trade imbalances, not for an indefinite period of time.\n  So we have the opportunity, by a policy initiative, to perhaps reduce \nat least the one-third of that trade deficit that is attributed to the \nforeign oil we import each year. Would anyone argue it would be a bad \npolicy for us to be less dependent and, therefore, to reduce our trade \ndeficit to an extent by improving fuel economy? I think not.\n  I believe this past winter was the warmest on record in the \nNortheast. There is no question dramatic changes are occurring to our \nclimate. Not everyone will agree those are attributable to global \nwarming, but I think there is a growing consensus in the scientific \nsector that global warming is for real, that there is an impact that is \noccurring. One of the elements that contributes to that global warming \nis carbon dioxide emissions. With improved fuel economy, we reduce \nthose emissions.\n  So there are three public policy initiatives that could all benefit \nif we could improve fuel economy. We would reduce the amount of fuel we \nconsume in the automotive sector; we could reduce our trade imbalance; \nwe could improve the quality of air; and as Americans are increasingly \nconcerned about the price of filling up at the gas station, we could \nsave Americans millions and millions of dollars each year.\n  Notwithstanding all those positive public policy potentials, we are \nleft with a situation that the legislation before us will preclude the \nDepartment of Transportation from even looking at the possibility that \nan increase could occur. So the purpose of the motion to strike, which \nSenator Gorton and Senator Feinstein and I and others will be offering \ntomorrow, is not to set a standard at a precise or numerical number--\nthat was done in 1975--but simply permitting the Department of \nTransportation to examine the technology that has been developed in the \nlast 25 years.\n  I believe it is almost impossible to argue that in a quarter of a \ncentury there is not new technology that could be applied to automobile \nefficiency that would not enable us to improve fuel economy. To resist \nthat argument is akin to saying, as some did in the early part of the \n19th century, we ought to lock up the U.S. Patent Office and close it \ndown because everything that can be invented has already been invented; \nthere are no new inventions. That is utter folly. We know the \ntechnology of the last 25 years has been remarkable, extensive, and \npervasive in its impact.\n\n  So our plea tomorrow as we go to the floor will be: Unmuzzle, \nunshackle, allow us to remove the blindfold and look at the technology \nin a way we can improve fuel economy, in a way that will produce real \nbenefits for consumers, reducing the amount they have to pay, helping \nclean up the environment, reducing the trade deficit, and reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  These are public policy issues that we ought to be able to examine \nwithout the restrictive riders that have been added each year since \n1995. I look forward, as part of a bipartisan effort, to continuing \nthis discussion and argument tomorrow as we further process this \nlegislation. My purpose today is simply to alert my colleagues that \nthis debate will occur sometime tomorrow and ask them--indeed, plead \nwith them--to simply allow us to look at the technology.\n  We are not mandating anything. We are not setting any standards. We \nare not making any policy judgments or pronouncements other than let's \ntake a look at what the technology of the last quarter of a century \nmight make possible and see if we cannot get better fuel economy, \nparticularly on the sport utility vehicles and light trucks that today \nmake up such a substantial part of the product mix that Americans are \npurchasing for their personal transportation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I do not believe any of my colleagues seek recognition. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be the only first-degree amendments in order to \nthe pending Transportation bill and subject to relevant second-degree \namendments only.\n  They include:\n  Three amendments by Senator McCain: One on Big Dig, one on airport \nrevenue, and one relevant;\n\n[[Page S5098]]\n\n  One amendment by Senator Gorton on CAFE;\n  One amendment by Senator Allard on debt repayment;\n  Two amendments by Senator Cochran: One technical amendment and one \nrelevant;\n  One amendment by Senator Collins on SOS on high gas prices;\n  One relevant amendment by Senator Warner;\n  One amendment by Senator Voinovich on passenger rail flexibility;\n  The managers' package by Senator Shelby, and two relevant amendments;\n  One amendment by Senator Nickles on BAC;\n  One relevant amendment by Senator Gramm;\n  One amendment by Senator Domenici on rural air service;\n  One amendment by Senator Baucus on the Beartooth Highway;\n  Two relevant amendments by Senator Byrd;\n  One amendment by Senator Boxer on proposed rule on trucking;\n  One relevant amendment by Senator Conrad;\n  Two relevant amendments by Senator Daschle;\n  One relevant amendment by Senator Feingold;\n  One amendment by Senator Feinstein on farm worker safety;\n  One sense-of-the-Senate amendment by Senator Kohl on Coast Guard \nfunding;\n  Two relevant amendments by Senator Lautenberg;\n  Two amendments by Senator Leahy: One on nonpublic personal \ndisclosure, and one which is relevant;\n  Three relevant amendments by Senator Levin;\n  Two relevant amendments by Senator Reed;\n  Two amendments by Senator Robb: One on the Bristol Rail, and one on \nthe Coal Fields Expressway;\n  Two relevant amendments by Senator Torricelli;\n  One relevant amendment by Senator Wellstone;\n  And, two relevant amendments by Senator Wyden.\n  Mr. President, Senator Domenici wants to be added as one amendment to \nthat list. It is described as rural air services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I hope in the morning or early afternoon \nwe can obtain consent on a time for these amendments to be filed so we \ncan determine what we can work out, what we can accept, and what will \nhave to be debated and voted on.\n  I also am anxious to deal with the problem of adoption of the basic \nbill that has come to the Senate from the Appropriations Committee. I \nwould like to also have that resolved tomorrow early in the afternoon, \nif possible.\n  I am constrained to say as chairman of the committee that this year \nis passing very quickly. We are now well into June. We have to have all \nof these bills finished by July before we go to the recess and the \nconventions during the August recess.\n  I urge Members to help us define the amendments that they wish to \noffer and enter into time agreements once we are certain they are going \nto offer them.\n  I thank the managers of the bill. I thank my friend, the chairman of \nthe committee, and the ranking member for what they are doing. I am \nhopeful we can move this bill along. We have other bills that will be \nready to go as soon as this one is finished.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I salute the fact that the \nappropriations chairman is anxious to get this finished. The \nsubcommittee chairman and I are also anxious.\n  But the one thing that concerns me--and I am not going to object to \nthe request that was made--is this: Normally, there is a time lapse for \nfiling the report during which there is time to review the report. \nSuddenly, we are at a pell-mell pace. I want to get it finished.\n  I think it is fair to Senator Shelby, myself, and the Appropriations \nCommittee chairman to make sure this doesn't trample on anybody's \nrights so that Senators have the opportunity to review. We are picking \nup the pace considerably. Thus far, we have had three bills: MILCON, \nlegislative, and Defense. So we are not in the back of the pack by a \nlong shot.\n  This is a bill in which lots of people have an interest. I want to \nensure that our people have a chance to look at the report which was \nfiled today. It won't even be seen until tomorrow. We may have to \nstretch our tolerance level a little bit to give folks a chance. I \ndon't want to drag my feet. Certainly, the Senator from Alabama knows \nthat. I want to be cooperative, and I want people to respond.\n  It is always a frustrating experience when we bring a bill to the \nfloor when time goes by and people who want to offer amendments don't \nbring them down.\n  I hope someday there will be reform--it won't be during my tenure--\nthat says if you have amendments, you have to bring them up but that \nyou have every right to examine the documents that relate to a bill \nbefore you are crowded out in a stampede. I offer that as a suggestion.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, is the unanimous consent request made by \nSenator Stevens, the chairman of the full Committee on Appropriations, \nbefore the Senate right now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That has already been agreed to.\n  Mr. SHELBY. What is the pending business at the moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The substitute amendment is the pending \nbusiness.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                amendment no. 3428 to amendment no. 3426\n\n      (Purpose: To modify a highway project in the State of Iowa)\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk, and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby] for Mr. Harkin, for \n     himself and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3428.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a vote occur in \nrelation to the pending amendment at 5:40 p.m. and no second-degree \namendments be in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in light of this agreement, on behalf of \nthe leader, I announce that there will be no further rollcall votes \ntonight.\n  It is the hope of the managers--Senator Lautenberg and I--that this \nbill will be passed by 1 p.m. on Thursday, tomorrow. All Members have a \nlot in this Transportation appropriations bill. I hope all Members who \nhave amendments will come forward. A lot of Members are already coming. \nWe are working them out. If we work together, I think we can work this \nout tomorrow.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thought there was supposed to be a time \nagreement for a vote on the amendment of Senator Voinovich. Was that \nnot in the agreement?\n  Mr. SHELBY. It is not.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I hope early in the morning we can get an agreement for \na specific time so we can move this bill forward. The other body is \nworking on the Health and Human Services bill. We have already reported \nthat bill out of committee. We were able to take that bill up. We also \nhave the foreign assistance bill that will be ready to be taken up on \nthe floor as soon as the House passes it. I hope we will be able to \nfinish this bill early tomorrow afternoon.\n  I thought we were going to get an agreement to vote on the Voinovich \namendment early tomorrow morning. But I hope we will be able to meet \nearly in the morning and get some timeframe on that amendment. I hope \nmy friends on the other side will agree with that.\n\n  We are coming in at 9:45, and the Voinovich amendment will be the \nfirst amendment. But there is no time limit to vote on it.\n  We are hopeful we can finish this bill sometime early in the \nafternoon, at 1 o'clock or so, go back to the Defense bill, and be \nready to take up another appropriations bill on Friday morning, the \nnext day.\n  I hope the parties will consider doing what we did in the Defense \nbill and set a time limit for when these amendments that were listed in \nthis agreement will be filed tomorrow so we can take a look at them \nand, hopefully, work many of them out without a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the managers of the bill and to the \nchairman of the full committee that on our side, in regards to the \nTransportation appropriations bill, we believe we are in very good \nshape to move forward just as quickly as the other side. We had one \namendment we were concerned about that would take a lot of time, but \nthe Senator stated that it will not be offered.\n  We are at a point where we think, if the Voinovich amendment doesn't \ntake very long, we can finish this fairly quickly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5099-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, recently Congress passed the \nAgricultural Risk Protection Act. This legislation provides reform for \nthe Federal Crop Insurance Program, economic assistance to farmers, and \nthe establishment of new, innovative programs to assist the \nagricultural community. One of the innovative programs established in \nthe bill is what I have termed the Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital \nFund.\n  The Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund will assist independent \ngrain and livestock producers nationwide develop new value-added \nagricultural opportunities. Independent producers will use these funds \nto develop business plans, feasibility studies, and business ventures \nwith packers and processors.\n  While I was able to garner the support of many of the nation's \nlargest commodity organizations, I met fierce opposition from the \nAmerican Meat Institute's Washington lobbyists. My floor statement \nduring the debate over the crop insurance conference report was highly \ncritical of their efforts. It is not my intent to attack the individual \nmembers of AMI, but I believe it is important that they understand my \nposition.\n  AMI's Washington lobbyists misrepresented the provision. A story \nwritten within ``Inside AMI'' recently explained:\n\n       Senator Chuck Grassley pushed conferees to provide for a \n     $35 million Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund. The \n     proposal was yet another attempt to fund an NPPC proposal \n     that seeks to secure government funding to establish a \n     national pork cooperative and use government funds to buy, \n     build or purchase equity in a pork slaughter and processing \n     facility.\n\n  This a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. My provision never had \nanything to do with publicly financing the construction of a pork \nplant.\n  My staff did contact AMI's Washington lobbyists who explained the \nopposition was based on the possibility of government-funded \ncompetition and specifically that funds would be used to develop a \nplant. In good faith, my staff offered AMI's Washington lobbyists an \nopportunity to offer their input on the legislation.\n  I cannot guarantee that AMI's input would have been acceptable to me, \nbut we will never know if a mutually beneficial position could have \nbeen established because my office never received a response. I have \nbeen a friend of the agriculture community for a very long time. I am \ndisappointed and dismayed by the way this was handled by AMI's \nWashington representatives.\n  As I promised in my crop insurance floor statement, I am today asking \nunanimous consent to place a list of AMI's member companies in the \nCongressional Record. Once again, I'm not saying that every processor \nor packer on this list knew what AMI's Washington lobbyists were doing, \nbut I hope to inform every member what happened and why independent \nproducers won't have the funds to reach out to processors in joint \nventures and receive working capital to help everyone survive and \nthrive. I am also enclosing the text of a letter I recently sent to \nAMI's members.\n  It is my hope that members of AMI see the value of my efforts and \nwork with me in the future to improve the plight of the independent \nproducer. Providing stability to family farmers through joint ventures \nwith AMI's membership would only serve to benefit both parties in the \nlong-run.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     June 9, 2000.\n       Dear AMI member: I am writing to express how disappointed I \n     am with your Washington lobbyists and their efforts to \n     misrepresent and thus undermine my attempts to help American \n     farmers.\n       You may have read a recent ``Inside AMI'' story claiming \n     that, ``Senator Grassley pushed conferees to provide for a \n     $35 million Agriculture Marketing Equity Capital Fund. The \n     proposal was yet another attempt to fund a National Pork \n     Producers Council proposal that seeks to secure government \n     funding to establish a national pork cooperative and use \n     government funds to buy, build or purchase equity in a pork \n     slaughter and processing facility.''\n       This claim is a blatant misrepresentation of the facts. The \n     truth is that the provision your lobbyists were attacking had \n     nothing to do with publicly financing the construction of a \n     pork plant. These funds are intended to be used by \n     independent grain and livestock producers to develop business \n     plans, feasibility studies, and business ventures with \n     packers and processors. While some may believe the truth is \n     no longer relevant in Washington, D.C., that attitude will be \n     given no quarter in dealings with me.\n       My staff reached out to your's to make certain they \n     understood the error in their representations of my proposal, \n     as well as to request alternative suggestions. No response \n     ever came. Unfortunately, many of my colleagues were misled \n     by your staff, and my proposal was gutted.\n       I wanted you to hear directly from me because I have had a \n     long and positive working relationship with many AMI members \n     over the years and I hope that this can be the case in the \n     future. I believe, however, that it would be appropriate to \n     investigate for yourself the concerns I have raised about \n     your Washington representatives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E.

RES. 319\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. Res. 319, which \nthe Senate approved on Friday, during National Homeownership Week. I \nthank my colleagues for supporting this important resolution which \naffects the security and welfare of Missourians and all Americans. This \nresolution addresses the importance of placing quality housing within \nreach of a greater number of Americans as well as improving housing \nopportunities for Americans at all income levels. I, along with my \ncolleagues, support the efforts of Habitat for Humanity and ``The House \nthe Senate Built'' project.\n  As you know, the largest debt most families take on in their \nlifetimes is a home. Over 65 percent of Americans own a home, as do \napproximately 80 percent of Americans over the age of 50. This \nrepresents real progress. In 1940, fully 56 percent of Americans were \nrenters. Clearly, America has come a long way. People buy homes for \ndifferent reasons. A home can be a place of safety to raise a family, \nthe potential of financial security, a sense of community. All around \nMissouri, and across this great nation, couples of all ages agree that \nbuying a home is among the essential steps a family takes to ensure \nstability and prosperity in their lives.\n  While homes are a worthwhile investment, they also are expensive. \nReal estate experts recommend that families buy homes valued at over \nthree times their annual income--a sum far greater than what families \ncould pay back in a year, or two, or even five. So, most Americans take \nout a mortgage. Once this burden of debt is behind them, they are free \nto dream new dreams --pay for their children's or grandchildren's \neducation, travel, or make other investments.\n  Homeownership is an important factor in promoting economic security \nand stability for American families. The level of homeownership among \nforeign-born naturalized citizens who have been in the United States \nfor at least six years is the same as the level of homeownership of the \nNation as a whole. When families such as these, who are new to our \nshores, prosper, we as a nation prosper.\n  This resolution expresses the Senate's concern for improving \nhomeownership in America. The resolution commends the nonprofit housing \norganization, Habitat for Humanity, and supports their commitment to \npartner with the United States Senate to strengthen neighborhoods and \ncommunities by building simple and affordable homes with low-income \nbuyers. I thank Senator Brownback for offering this resolution and \nendorse its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5101-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5101-S5102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ESTATE TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. \n1128, the Estate Tax Elimination Act.\n  Mr. President, I came to understand the impact of the federal estate \ntax during my first campaign for election to the U.S. Senate. As I met \nwith hundreds of small businessmen and women, timber lot owners, and \nfarmers and ranchers, I consistently heard the federal estate tax was a \nmajor road-block to the long-term success of their family operations.\n  But when I came to the Senate in 1993, it appeared it would be a long \ntime before Congress could take action on the estate tax, or any other \ntax issue for that matter. We faced deficits as far as the eye could \nsee. We had to make hard choices about spending cuts and tax relief for \nthe neediest families. I'm pleased that my colleagues and I on the \nDemocratic side made those tough choices in 1993 and in subsequent \nyears. Combined with a strong economy, those tough choices gave us the \nopportunity to be in the position we are in today.\n  The effort to roll back the federal estate tax, and provide relief \nfor farms and small businesses, started slowly. In 1995, I joined those \nefforts by introducing S. 161, the American Family Business \nPreservation Act. Senator Bob Dole was the prime Republican cosponsor \nof this measure. With respect to the estate tax, the Murray-Dole bill \nwould have reduced the maximum estate tax rate from 55 percent to 15 \npercent if the heirs continued to own and operate a business for ten \nyears after the death of the primary owner. Given the limited resources \nwe had, I believed this modest bill was a good step forward.\n  In 1997, Congress passed the Taxpayer Relief Act, a bipartisan effort \nto reduce taxes for working Americans. The bill provided for an \nincrease in the estate tax exemption over ten years, and created an \nadditional exemption for small business and farm assets. I supported \nthis bipartisan initiative to provide estate tax relief to my \nconstituents. As it is phased in, this law will help to ensure the very \nsmall percentage of estates subject to the estate tax bill grow even \nsmaller.\n  But we should all recognize the environment has changed. As projected \nsurpluses have grown, the debate about the estate tax has turned from \nincreasing the exemption to outright repeal. Estate tax opponents have \nmade their case for elimination, and it's compelling. The question for \nme is no longer whether the estate tax will or should be repealed, but \nhow and when it will be repealed. I believe one of the appropriate \nroles for Democrats in this debate--the same Democrats who helped \nbalance the budget--is to ensure that we promote as progressive an end \nto the estate tax as possible.\n  At this moment in time, I believe S. 1128 is the most progressive \nestate tax repeal vehicle that is under consideration. Instead of \ntaxing an estate when it is transferred to the next generation, \nit would require heirs to pay a capital gains tax on appreciated value \nwhen the asset is sold. This provides an effective mechanism for \ntransferring farm and business assets, while still maintaining a \nreasonably progressive tax structure.\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\n  I understand there is some debate about whether S. 1128 or similar \nproposals will increase the tax code's complexity. Now that the House \nhas overwhelmingly passed estate tax repeal, we have an ideal \nopportunity to engage in a serious, thoughtful debate about the current \neffects of the estate tax and the possible implications of various \nrepeal proposals. I believe by the end of this year, Congress, the \nAdministration, and the American public will have a better \nunderstanding of the complex choices we face.\n  I would like to make it clear that I do not believe estate tax repeal \nshould be the only tax priority of this or future Congresses. There are \nmany inequities, complexities, and inefficiencies in the tax code, many \nof which affect low- and middle-income working families who need tax \nrelief the most.\n  In the spirit of helping those who need it the most, I have \ncosponsored legislation to address the alternative minimum tax and the \nmarriage penalty. In addition, I have cosponsored tax legislation to \nexpand health insurance, improve the infrastructure of our nation's \npublic schools, encourage alternative energy sources, enhance the \nsafety net for farmers and ranchers, and increase the availability of \nchild care and long-term care. Last year, I sponsored tax legislation \nto protect forest and agricultural land, which passed the Senate in \nJuly.\n  Estate tax relief should certainly be an important component in any \nagenda to provide relief and economic opportunities to working families \nand family-owned businesses. Therefore, I support estate tax repeal in \nthe context of a modest, targeted tax cut benefitting working families.\n  Before the end of the year, Congress and the Administration will \nlikely reach agreement on a reconciliation package. Further reform--if \nnot repeal--of the estate tax should be a part of that package. While \nrepeal may not be possible this year, I look forward to strongly \nsupporting increased exemptions for small business and farm assets. At \nthe very least, we should guarantee a brighter and less complicated \nfuture for those families that need estate tax reform the most.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor S. 1128, and to work toward \nmeaningful action on the estate tax issue before Congress adjourns this \nfall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5102-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              225TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, Valley Forge, Gettysburg, Normandy, Pusan, \nPanama, and Kuwait are well-known names in our nation's history. I \nproudly rise to honor an American institution that has proven its \nunparalleled greatness time and again in battles such as these. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me in recognizing today as the 225th anniversary \nof the U.S. Army.\n  When the Second Continental Congress established the U.S. Army on \nJune 14, 1775, it set forth an organization that has repeatedly faced \nadversity straight in the eye and never backed down. From fulfilling \nthe promises of the Declaration of Independence to countering Saddam \nHussein's aggression in Kuwait, the Army's dedication to our nation's \nbedrock values and its protection of our cherished freedoms has been \nexemplary. For more than two centuries, Army personnel have rallied to \nboth defend our American shores and ensure the rights of citizens \naround the world.\n  The role of a soldier has changed drastically over the Army's rich, \n225-year history. Technological and political changes have altered the \nbattlefield landscape, but the core principles the Army consistently \nupholds have not changed. Those principles were captured by General \nDouglas MacArthur in his 1962 address at West Point:\n\n       Duty, honor, country: Those three hallowed words reverently \n     dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will \n     be. They are your rallying point to build courage when \n     courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there seems to be \n     little cause for faith, to create hope when hope becomes \n     forlorn.\n\n  While many of the Army's accomplishments have been in battle, others \nhave come during pivotal moments of peace. Since its inception, the \nArmy has been instrumental in humanitarian and disaster relief efforts \nthat have helped countless citizens in their greatest time of need. By \nhelping tornado victims throughout the American Midwest or assisting in \nthe flood-ravaged areas of Mozambique, Army personnel serve honorably.\n  The Army has a long history of turning ordinary men and women into \ndistinguished soldiers. Currently, there are about 480,000 soldiers on \nactive duty, comprising the premier fighting force in the world. \nWhether it is the most senior Army general or the soldier standing \nguard at the North Korean border, the quality of our soldiers is \nunsurpassed. It is consistently proven that the investment we make in \nour military personnel today reaps the leaders of tomorrow.\n  One of my highest priorities here in Congress is maintaining the \nstrength of that important investment, because it is crucial to our \nfuture. At the very root of our national security is the well-being of \nour soldiers. This includes supplying the best technologically advanced \nequipment in the world and ensuring our Armed Forces are funded at \nlevels that adequately compensate our dedicated servicemen and women.\n  The dedication and sacrifices demonstrated by millions of Army \nveterans must never be forgotten, nor should their needs be neglected; \nhonoring the commitments this nation has made to its veterans is vital.\n  As we celebrate the Army's 225th anniversary today, I encourage all \nAmericans to reflect on the blanket of freedoms we are blessed with, \nthanks to the sacrifices made by those who valiantly heed the call of \nduty by serving in the United States Army, both in war and peacetime. I \nam proud to join my colleagues in congratulating the Army on this \nimpressive milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5102-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5102-S5103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REPEAL OF THE TELEPHONE EXCISE TAX\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for a \nbill which I have co-sponsored. The bill, S. 2330, will repeal federal \nexcise taxes on telephone services.\n  This tax was first introduced as a temporary luxury tax in 1898 to \nfund the Spanish American War. However, over 100 years later this tax \nremain in effect. The definition of temporary should not span an entire \ncentury.\n  This tax is imposed on telephone and other services at a rate of 3 \npercent. Furthermore, these taxes are not applied to a specific purpose \nthat enhances telephone service in our nation--rather these taxes are \ndirected in the general revenue account. In other words, there is no \nreason we shouldn't repeal this tax. It means only one thing--Montanans \nend up paying one more tax to encourage government spending.\n  As I said a moment ago, this tax was enacted to fund the Spanish \nAmerican War. Considering that war was ended a mere six months after it \nbegan, I feel its time to repeal this tax. Instead, Montana consumers \ncontinue to pay this tax on all their telephone services--local, long \ndistance, and wireless.\n  It is time to eliminate this excise tax. At the time of enactment, \nthis tax was considered a luxury tax on the few who owned telephones in \n1898--this tax has now become an unnecessary burden on virtually every \nAmerican taxpayer. Repealing this excise tax on communications services \nwill save consumers over $5 billion annually.\n  Furthermore, this tax is regressive in nature. It disproportionately \nhurts the poor, particularly those households on either fixed or \nlimited incomes, Even the U.S. Treasury Department has concluded in a \n1987 study that the tax ``causes economic distortions and inequities \namong households'' and ``there is no policy rationale for retaining the \ncommunications excise tax.''\n  Rural customers in states like Montana are also disproportionately \nimpacted. This tax is even more of a burden on rural customers due to \nthe fact that they are forced to make more long distance calling \ncomparative to urban customers.\n  This tax also impacts Internet service. The leading reason why \nhouseholds with incomes under $25,000 do not have home Internet access \nis cost.

Mr. President, I submit for the Record the \nfollowing, written by Marshall H. Cohen, photojournalist, and honorary \nlife-member of the Association of Tall Ship, The Danmark, June, 2000.\n\n       Captain Vilhelm Hansen passed away at age 82 on May 3, \n     2000. Captain Hansen was master of the training ship the \n     Danmark for twenty-two years from 1964 until his retirement \n     in 1986. He was not only a legendary captain and educator, \n     training thousands of Danish men and women for maritime \n     careers, but also a familiar, and well-liked ambassador of \n     good will to the United States with his ready wit, his \n     unparalleled knowledge of seamanship, and his unbending \n     strong character. Whenever the Danmark anchored in various \n     East Coast ports, thousands of Americans, including members \n     of the U.S. Congress, have been welcomed on board this \n     beautiful full-rigged ship.\n       Captain Hansen received many honors and awards here in the \n     United States. He has been presented with the keys to many \n     U.S. cities, among them, Baltimore. He received the Danish-\n     American Society's ``Man of the Year'' award in New York City \n     in 1987, and this year (June 8, 2000) Captain Hansen \n     posthumously received the National Maritime Historical \n     Society Walter Cronkite Award for Excellence in Maritime \n     Education in a ceremony in Miami, Florida.\n       The Danmark has played a significant role in the maritime \n     history of the United States. In 1939, the Danmark was on a \n     routine training mission to the United States when the Second \n     World War began. The Captain at that time, Knud Hansen, was \n     informed that Germany had invaded Denmark, and consequently, \n     the Danmark remained in the United States for the duration of \n     the war. The Danmark was based in New London, Connecticut, \n     and served as a training ship for U.S. sailors.\n       The First Officer of the Danmark during the war was Knud \n     Langevad, and he was in charge of training more than 5,000 \n     U.S. cadets. He also convinced U.S. authorities of the value \n     of learning basic seamanship on a tall ship, and following \n     the war the U.S. Coast Guard purchased its well-known tall \n     ship the U.S. Eagle, to replace the Danmark.\n       Reflecting this special kinship between the two ships, the \n     Danmark sails as the first foreign ship behind the Eagle in \n     official Tall Ship Parades. It will be so honored again in \n     June and July, 2000 during the millennium voyage of tall \n     ships along the East Coast, from Miami to Boston.\n       On July 4, 1986 the Danmark was honored with the number two \n     position sailing behind the Eagle during the Parade of Tall \n     Ships celebrating the 100th birthday of the Statue of \n     Liberty. It was Captain Hansen's final voyage as master of \n     the Danmark prior to his retirement that year. Captain \n     Vilhelm Hansen, in his white uniform and gold braided cap, \n     steered his 253 foot ship into the South Street Seaport, New \n     York City, for the last time. He barked his final commands to \n     the officers, switched off the auxiliary engine, and ended \n     his distinguished career during this memorable event in \n     American history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5103-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5103-S5104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT GENERAL BLOUNT\n\n Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \npay tribute to a Rhode Island hero.\n  Mr. President, Lieutenant General John Bruce Blount was just given an \nHonorary Doctorate Degree from his alma mater, the University of Rhode \nIsland. A former star athlete, a decorated war hero of two wars, Korea \nand Vietnam, and a man who helped end the Army-McCarthy hearings of the \n1950s, Rhode Islanders were happy to welcome him home.\n  The Providence Journal ran this article, ``Hometown Hero Blount to be \nHonored at URI Graduation,'' about him.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the article be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n                     [From the Providence Journal]\n\n          Hometown Hero Blount To Be Honored at URI Graduation\n\n                           (By David Henley)\n\n       Kingston--A favorite son will be returning soon.\n       A decorated hero of two wars, a former star athlete who set \n     the still-standing high school basketball record for points \n     scored in a game over half a century ago and a man who helped \n     end the Army-McCarthy hearings of the 1950s, Lt. Gen. John \n     Bruce Blount will return to the University of Rhode Island in \n     a few weeks to pick up his latest recognition. Blount will be \n     one of four recipients of honorary doctorate degrees from his \n     alma mater at the school's 114th commencement May 20.\n       ``I'm 50 years away from Kingston, but this is a real \n     thrill,'' Blount said Monday from his home in Columbia, S.C. \n     ``My whole family is coming in, from Carolina, Florida, \n     Detroit. I've always maintained my connections back home, and \n     I knew people were trying to do this, but I guess the planets \n     were just in the right alignment.''\n       Blount, known as Bruce, is something of a local legend, \n     both at the university and at South Kingstown High school, \n     where he was a student when he scored his record-setting 66 \n     points. The team then played at the St. Francis Parish Hall \n     on High Street; the games lasted only 32 minutes and there \n     were no three-point shots then.\n       His military career has been written about many times. As \n     the only URI alumnus to achieve the rank of three-star \n     general, Blount's service in Korea and Vietnam earned him \n     dozens of medals and decorations, including the Silver Star, \n     the Bronze Star, the Korean Chung Mu Distinguished Service \n     Medal and a Purple Heart when he was injured in combat on \n     Korea's Old Baldy.\n       Blount became nationally famous when he stood his ground \n     under questioning at the McCarthy hearings, earning praise \n     even from Sen. Joseph McCarthy himself, and later produced \n     photographic evidence discrediting the senator by proving he \n     had doctored evidence.\n       But to many of his own generation, and to his elders, he is \n     probably best remembered as just a kid with a basketball \n     under one arm hitchhiking back and forth between Peace Dale \n     and Kingston.\n       Blount's family first moved into South County during the \n     Depression, according to his brother Frank, a retired \n     schoolteacher living on Great Island. The boys' father, \n     Joseph Blount, an insurance salesman from Illinois who had \n     met his Rhode Island bride while both served in the Navy in \n     World War I, came to the area looking for work, which he \n     found in local restaurants. Eventually Joe Blount opened \n     Joe's Diner in Peace Dale, where Patsy's Package Store is \n     now, and a second restaurant next to the Wakefield Diner on \n     Main Street. But Loretta Blount had bigger plans for her \n     children.\n       ``My mother knew she wanted her children to go to college, \n     so she moved us out of Peace Dale and out to Kingston, just \n     to be near the campus, when I was about 7,'' Bruce Blount \n     said. ``She financed the house by renting rooms out to \n     college kids. When I finally started at the university \n     myself, I was the only kid who actually was farther away from \n     campus in my frat house than I was at home.''\n\n[[Page S5104]]\n\n       Joe Blount contined in the restaurant business, opening the \n     original Ram's Den in the house next to the family home on \n     Upper College Road.\n       ``I can remember getting up with my dad at about 4 in the \n     morning and going down and getting the fires going,'' the \n     general said. ``He'd get the baking started for the day. By \n     the time I was 10 I was making the bacon and eggs, putting \n     them up for people. Basically, I was a short-order cook.''\n       By that time he also had become a favorite of the school's \n     basketball team, and particularly of its coach, Frank Keaney, \n     another local legend. In fact the whole family was more or \n     less adopted by the university community, to hear the sons \n     tell it. One day, Frank Blount remembers, Keaney came in to \n     see Joe Blount with an idea. It seems he had a team that \n     needed to work to eat, but needed flexibility for practice \n     and games; Joe hired them all as waiters, cooks and \n     dishwashers. When they were playing he tended not to have \n     that much business anyway. Loretta opened a soda shop at \n     Lippitt Hall and worked as a switchboard operator, the same \n     job she had had in the Navy. She became friends with each of \n     the university's presidents over the years, and for years it \n     was a tradition for the president to stop the commencement \n     march to walk over and shake hands with Loretta Blount.\n       ``She loved that,'' Frank remembered.\n       ``I started out as waterboy for the team, and later I was \n     the mascot,'' Bruce Blount said. ``I grew up knowing more \n     older men, and more athletes, than I knew of kids my own age. \n     ``Back then we didn't just walk around in sneakers, you had \n     regular street shoes, and coach wouldn't let me on the floor \n     with them on. So I would stand in the corners during \n     practice, and when the ball came to me, instead of tossing \n     them back in I would just put them up. I developed a really \n     different sort of shooting style, but I could hit from almost \n     anywhere.''\n       Once he started high school, Blount found himself \n     constantly traveling between gyms, from URI's Rodman Hall to \n     St. Francis and the Old Fagan's Hall in Peace Dale, the South \n     Kingstown team's alternate gym. With his gym bag over his \n     shoulder and a basketball under his arm, Blount became a \n     familiar sight on Kingstown Road.\n       ``I could get around better than anybody without a car,'' \n     he said.\n       That famous basketball career could have led Blount away \n     from Kingston but didn't. Despite being recruited by schools \n     like Brown and Harvard, Blount knew he wanted to attend URI, \n     then called Rhode Island State.\n       ``There was never any question,'' he said. ``I was \n     absolutely enthralled with the idea of playing for Rhode \n     Island, and Coach Keaney was an idol to me.'' On his way to \n     collecting more than 1,000 points in his college career, \n     Blount also acted as captain of both the basketball and \n     baseball teams. But he also found time to begin what would be \n     his ultimate career. As an ROTC cadet, Blount became cadet \n     colonel in his senior year and was commissioned in the \n     regular Army as a second lieutenant in the Infantry when he \n     graduated in 1950.\n       Starting out as a training officer in the 4th Infantry \n     Division and the 101st Airborne, he was made platoon \n     commander in Korea the next year, then company executive \n     officer, then company commander in the 45th Infantry. He was \n     selected as aide-de-camp by Maj. Gen. C.E. Ryan, commander of \n     the Korean Military Advisory Group, and returned to the \n     states with Ryan after his injury.\n       Since then he has worked his way up the ranks, spending \n     time as a staff officer at the Pentagon, in the Southern \n     Command in the Canal Zone and as commander of the 1st \n     Battalion, 12th Cavalry, 1st Air Cavalry in Vietnam. In 1969 \n     he was made secretary of the U.S. Army Infantry School in \n     Fort Benning, Ga., and in 1971 was assigned to the European \n     Command, eventually serving as community commander of the \n     American Military Community in Wurzburg, Germany.\n       Finally, in 1983, he was promoted to lieutenant general and \n     made chief of staff of the NATO Allied Forces South Command, \n     consisting of units from Greece, Turkey, Italy the United \n     Kingdom and the United States.\n       ``I always followed Bruce, did whatever he did, only not as \n     well,'' said little brother Frank Friday. ``When he was in \n     the NATO command, I thought that was a big deal. But I had \n     the most fun when he was on the general's staff at Dix when \n     he was stationed there. Whenever my company needed anything, \n     they would come to me and I would call up, say, the motor \n     pool and tell them I needed a Jeep. They'd ask who I was and \n     I would say, `This is Lieutenant Blount' in my best command \n     voice and get whatever it was I needed.\n       ``Of course it only lasted about a month before everybody \n     figured out there were two Lieutenant Blounts on base, but we \n     would begin to laugh our heads off whenever I told him what I \n     was doing.''\n       ``For the longest time in my life I was `Bruce Blount's \n     brother,' '' he said. ``And to this day I am very proud of \n     that.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5104-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING MS.

The Belles of Indiana, a choral group comprised of Indiana \nUniversity students, were the first singing group to perform overseas \nwith the United Service Organizations (USO). The Belles entertained \nsoldiers stationed in Japan and Korea, performing 75 shows in 77 days \nduring the summer of 1955. Their voices and energy brought great joy to \nall those who heard them perform. These singers displayed strong \npatriotism for their country and acted as outstanding ambassadors from \nIndiana.

I would also like to \nrecognize those members of the Belles of Indiana who are no longer with \nus: Eugene and Keitha Bayless, (Choral Director and his wife), Mary \nMauer, Irma Batley Corcoran, Mary Sinclair Baron, and Joan Drew Irwin.\n  I am pleased to pay tribute to these great Americans whose positive \nattitude and high energy boosted morale for our overseas troops. The \nhistory of America is replete with stories of its sons and daughters \nbeing summoned and responding to their nation's call to duty. It is a \nproud history of accomplishment, honor, and victory. The Belles of \nIndiana answered their nation's call to duty and diligently persevered \nto be emissaries for the families and friends of servicemen who were \nfar away from home.\n  I extend my congratulations to the Belles of Indiana for being the \nfirst entertainment group to travel and perform with the United Service \nOrganization.

Mezzo of New Jersey and the 4th Regiment of the United States \nMarine Corps, whose gallant actions in 1937 prevented an already \ntumultuous conflict from destabilizing further. The 4th Marines were \ndeployed near the Soochow Creek in China to diffuse tensions that \nemerged after Japanese forces penetrated Chinese boundaries. Further \nintensifying the situation, a Chinese officer killed two members of the \nJapanese military, creating a hostile climate that culminated in armed \nconflict. Amidst heavy gunfire from both Japanese and Chinese forces, \nMr. Mezzo and the 4th Marine Regiment demonstrated tremendous fortitude \nand resolve as they assisted in the stabilizing of the Soochow Creek, \nhalting what could have been a major international battle.\n  After all other American forces returned home, the 4th Marines \nremained in the Soochow Creek, accepting an even greater challenge of \nreturning a Chinese rice barge that had been captured by the Japanese \nto its rightful owner. Mr. Mezzo and his fellow Marines executed this \nrisky maneuver, thereby diffusing a situation which could have added \nfuel to an already volatile situation. The 4th Marine Regiment \ncourageously exhibited the Marine Corps standard of Semper Fidelis, \nwhich saving the lives of many people.\n  Although Mr. Mezzo and his comrades acted with bravery and \nselflessness, their efforts, and the efforts of many gallant veterans, \nhave gone virtually unrewarded and unappreciated. While their exploits \nmay not be found in history books, the services with which these \nveterans have provided our country are invaluable. I would like to \nrecognize Mr. Mezzo, the 4th Marine Regiment, and all veterans who have \nrisked their lives for the welfare of our country.

Mr. President, yesterday, I inserted into the \nCongressional Record the speeches of two graduates from Virginia Tech \nUniversity who addressed their class during its commencement ceremonies \nlast month. During the commencement ceremony, at which I had the \nprivilege of also speaking with the Class of 2000, I listened to the \neloquent and inspiring speeches of three Virginia Tech students, Class \nPresident Lauren Esleeck, Graduate Student Representative Timothy Wayne \nMays, and Class Treasurer Rush K. Middleton. Yesterday, I inserted Ms. \nEsleeck's and Mr. Middleton's speeches into the Congressional Record. I \nhave now obtained a copy of Mr. Mays' speech, and it is my pleasure to \nask that a copy of his speech also be printed in the Record.\n\n                Graduation Speech by Timothy Wayne Mays\n\n       Good morning. I'd like to begin with a brief story that I \n     recently read that illustrates the theme of my message today. \n     A successful business executive and former University of \n     Alabama football player was asked ``what was the first thing \n     coach Paul Bear Bryant said to you and the other scholarship \n     athletes after arriving on campus.'' Surprisingly, at the \n     first team meeting, Coach Bryant asked the group ``Have you \n     called your folks yet to thank them?'' After hearing those \n     words, the players looked confused--most had their mouths \n     open. They looked at one another with disbelief. Apparently, \n     not one of them had anticipated this question. These freshman \n     athletes had been on campus less than 24 hours, but they \n     already had their first lesson in team productivity. No one \n     in the room that day had acknowledged having called home with \n     a word of thanks. What was the essence of the lesson? Coach \n     Bryant followed up his initial question with a second \n     statement. ``No one ever got to this level without the help \n     of others. Call your folks. Thank them.'' [from The \n     Millionaire Mind (Stanley, 2000)]\n       When I was asked to speak at today's graduation ceremony, I \n     kind of struggled with what I wanted to talk about, but \n     preparing this speech gave me the opportunity to reflect on \n     how I got to this point in my life. And the main thing that \n     stood out to me was the significant influence that certain \n     individuals have had on my life. In some way or another, \n     these people gave me a chance or an opportunity that I would \n     not have had otherwise. Now some of these people are, of \n     course, my parents and other family members who have given me \n     a chance by raising me in a safe, loving, and spiritual \n     environment. In the most challenging times of my life, their \n     prayers and support have helped me stand strong, or \n     sometimes, just make it through.\n       In a different way, some of the people who have most \n     significantly influenced my life are friends, teachers, and \n     even just acquaintances that have taken an interest in me for \n     some reason or another. They have given me the guidance and \n     motivation that I need to succeed. As a recent example, when \n     I came to Virginia Tech, I wasn't sure what type of \n     structural engineering work I wanted to do after graduation. \n     Over the last four years, Dr. Tom Murray, in the Civil \n     Engineering department here at Virginia Tech, has helped me \n     find the specific type of work that I will enjoy. I will \n     surely remember his help in the years to come when I wake up \n     every morning happy to go to work. Also, it was Dr. Ray Plaut \n     who took a personal interest in me during my college visit \n     and brought me here to Virginia Tech. Everything that I have \n     accomplished here at Virginia Tech would have been impossible \n     without his help and guidance over the last four years. The \n     truth of the matter is this: Had some of these people not \n     entered my life, I definitely would not be here speaking \n     today.\n       As graduates of this great university, we really do have so \n     much for which to be proud. However, I challenge each of you \n     to take the time to reflect on the individuals who have \n     helped you get to this place in your life, and to personally \n     thank them for taking an interest in you.\n       At this chapter in our life comes to an end, a new chapter \n     begins, and one of the most exciting things to think about is \n     the new people we will meet and the impact they will have on \n     our lives. More importantly though, I hope that we can be \n     influential people in others lives. By always recognizing the \n     impact that other people have had on us, I believe that we \n     can. Thank you very much and God bless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5105-3", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5105-4", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON EXECUTIVE ORDER 12938--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM114\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Enclosed is a report to the Congress on Executive Order 12938, as \nrequired by section 204 of the International Emergency Economic Powers \nAct (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)) and section 401(c) of the National Emergencies \nAct (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)).\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2726\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Servicemembers' \n     Protection Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On July 17, 1998, the United Nations Diplomatic \n     Conference of Plenipotentiaries on the Establishment of an \n     International Criminal Court, meeting in Rome, Italy, adopted \n     the ``Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.'' The \n     vote on adoption of the Statute was 120 in favor to 7 \n     against, with 21 countries abstaining. The United States \n     voted against final adoption of the Rome Statute.\n       (2) As of May 30, 2000, 96 countries had signed the Rome \n     Statute and 10 had ratified it. Pursuant to Article 126 of \n     the Rome Statute, the Statute will enter into force on the \n     first day of the month after the 60th day following the date \n     that the 60th country deposits an instrument ratifying the \n     Statute.\n       (3) Since adoption of the Rome Statute, a Preparatory \n     Commission for the International Criminal Court has continued \n     to meet regularly to draft documents to implement the Rome \n     Statute, including Rules of Procedure and Evidence, \n     definitions of Elements of Crimes, and a definition of the \n     Crime of Aggression.\n       (4) During testimony before the Congress, the lead United \n     States negotiator, Ambassador David Scheffer stated that the \n     United States could not sign the Rome Statute because certain \n     critical negotiating objectives of the United States had not \n     been achieved. As a result, he stated: ``We are left with \n     consequences that do not serve the cause of international \n     justice.''\n       (5) Ambassador Scheffer went on to tell the Congress that: \n     ``Multinational peacekeeping forces operating in a country \n     that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the Court's \n     jurisdiction even if the country of the individual \n     peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty \n     purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States \n     armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably \n     prosecuted by the international court even if the United \n     States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is \n     this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty \n     law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use \n     its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in \n     multinational operations, including humanitarian \n     interventions to save civilian lives. Other contributors to \n     peacekeeping operations will be similarly exposed.''.\n       (6) Any Americans prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court will, under the Rome Statute, be denied many of the \n     procedural protections to which all Americans are entitled \n     under the Bill of Rights to the United States Constitution, \n     including, among others, the right to trial by jury, the \n     right not to be compelled to provide self-incriminating \n     testimony, and the right to confront and cross-examine all \n     witnesses for the prosecution.\n       (7) American servicemen and women deserve the full \n     protection of the United States Constitution when they are \n     deployed around the world to protect the vital national \n     interests of the United States. The United States Government \n     has an obligation to protect American servicemen and women, \n     to the maximum extent possible, against criminal prosecutions \n     carried out by United Nations officials under procedures that \n     deny them their constitutional rights.\n       (8) In addition to exposing American servicemen and women \n     to the risk of international criminal prosecution, the Rome \n     Statute creates a risk that the President and other senior \n     elected and appointed officials of the United States \n     Government may be prosecuted by the International Criminal \n     Court. Particularly if the Preparatory Commission agrees on a \n     definition of the Crime of Aggression, senior United States \n     officials may be at risk of criminal prosecution for national \n     security decisions involving such matters as responding to \n     acts of terrorism, preventing the proliferation of weapons of \n     mass destruction, and deterring aggression. No less than \n     American servicemen and women, senior officials of the United \n     States Government deserve the full protection of the United \n     States Constitution with respect to official actions taken by \n     them to protect the national interests of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF PROHIBITIONS OF THIS ACT.\n\n       The prohibitions and requirements of sections 4, 5, 6, and \n     7 shall cease to apply, and the authority of section 8 shall \n     terminate, if the United States becomes a party to the \n     International Criminal Court pursuant to a treaty made under \n     article II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to improve the health of older Americans and persons \nwith disabilities, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                medicare health improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we are introducing legislation to \nimprove the health of Medicare beneficiaries and the health of the \nMedicare program itself. Under Medicare, the health and quality of life \nfor millions of older adults and people with disabilities have \nsignificantly improved. The rate of chronic disability among adults \nover 65 continues to decline, but we can do better. A recent report by \nthe World Health Organization showed that the U.S. falls behind 23 \nother nations in ``healthy life expectancy.'' On average, Americans can \nexpect only 70 healthy years, compared to Japanese citizens who can \nanticipate 74\\1/2\\ years of life without disability. Chronic disability \nrobs too many older Americans of active and productive years, and adds \n$26 billion annually in health care costs as people over 65 lose their \nability to live independently.\n  In the next 30 years, the viability of Medicare will be challenged as \nthe baby boom generation ages. Nearly one fifth of the population will \nbe 65 and older by 2025, which means that a larger number of \nbeneficiaries will be supported by a smaller number of workers. The \ncurrent debate over the future of Medicare often revolves around \nbenefit cuts or tax increases. But an obvious alternative that should \nbe part of the debate is to reduce the demand for Medicare by improving \nthe health of senior citizens. Unfortunately, Medicare today contains \nfew incentives to encourage beneficiaries and providers to take health \npromotion and disease prevention seriously. This bill will help older \nadults and individuals with disabilities to improve their health. It \nwill also educate health providers about the best practices for \ntreatment of Medicare patients.\n  Older adults are generally health conscious and are interested in \ntaking steps to maintain their health and independence. Poor lifestyle \nfactors--which include lack of exercise, poor diet, at-risk behaviors, \nsmoking, and alcohol abuse--account for 70% of the physical decline and \ndisease that occur with aging. Experts agree that the potential for \nbetter health through health promotion and disease prevention is great. \nToo often, however, older Americans lack the accurate information that \nwould help them take advantage of these opportunities. This bill will \nensure that Medicare beneficiaries are better informed about the \nlifestyle changes they can make to improve their health, and the \npreventive health services they can use to prevent disease.\n  To encourage more beneficiaries to use the preventive services that \nMedicare currently offers, our legislation will eliminate cost-sharing \nfor these services. Prevention saves lives and saves money. The \nincidence of cancer in adults over 65 is approximately eleven times \nhigher than in persons under 65. Most cancers can be treated and many \ncan be cured if detected early. But cancer screening tests are \nsignificantly underused by Medicare beneficiaries. Thirty-eight percent \nof women over 65 who have survived breast cancer (and remain at risk) \ndo not receive an annual mammogram. Our bill will waive cost-sharing \nfor mammography, screening pelvic exams, colorectal cancer screening, \nprostate cancer screening, bone mass measurement, hepatitis B vaccine \nand its administration, and diabetes self-management training.\n\n  Despite the great potential of preventive services to improve the \nquality of life for older Americans, few clinical guidelines focus on \npreventive care for this population. Our bill calls for a task force to \nconduct studies to determine which preventive services in primary care \nare most valuable to senior citizens. A separate demonstration project \nwill determine effective means to reduce smoking by Medicare \nbeneficiaries. Cessation of smoking can reduce the risk of lung cancer, \nheart disease, and stroke. In 1997, smoking-related expenditures were \nestimated to cost the Medicare program a total of $20.5 billion.\n  There are substantial defects in the quality of care provided to \nMedicare beneficiaries. Medical research has established that early use \nof a beta blocker after a heart attack reduces the risk of mortality \nand rehospitalization. Yet 51 percent of older adults fail to receive \nthis treatment when it is indicated. In fact, patients at the highest \nrisk of death in the hospital are least likely to receive a beta \nblocker.\n  Every senior citizen deserves quality health care. The gaps between \nthe best medical practice and actual practice must be narrowed. Our \nbill asks the Department of Health and Human Services to determine \nwhich areas in the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries do not meet the \nhighest professional standards, and to determine the best practices in \nthose areas. Steps will then be taken to inform health care \nprofessionals about these standards for treatment.\n  The opportunities for better health care and budget savings are \ngreat, if care can be delivered to beneficiaries with high-cost chronic \nconditions in a more coordinated and effective way. Our legislation \nauthorizes demonstration projects to develop innovative approaches to \nincrease the quality of care and reduce costs for Medicare \nbeneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities. Similar demonstration \nprojects are authorized for beneficiaries with serious or chronic \nillness who do not reside in nursing facilities.\n  In ways like this, we do more--much more--to preserve and strengthen \nMedicare, and achieve substantial long-term savings as well. I look \nforward to working closely with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to achieve this important goal. I ask unanimous consent that the \nbill, the bill summary, and the relevant fact sheet be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2727\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF \n                   OLDER AMERICANS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than December 31, 2002, the \n     President shall convene a White House Conference on Improving \n     the Health of Older Americans.\n       (b) Goal of Conference.--The goal of the Conference shall \n     be to--\n       (1) develop a consensus on a program to enable older \n     Americans to protect and improve their own health;\n       (2) develop procedures to ensure that--\n       (A) older Americans are provided with the highest standard \n     of health care available, with an emphasis on assuring that \n     standard practice is also the best practice; and\n       (B) the needs of older Americans are more effectively met \n     through the benefits provided under the medicare program; and\n       (3) outline a research and demonstration agenda to further \n     the goals described in paragraphs (1) and (2).\n       (c) Conference Participants.--\n       (1) Participants.--In order to carry out the purposes of \n     this section, the Conference shall bring together--\n       (A) representatives of older Americans and those who care \n     for older Americans;\n       (B) researchers and research institutions with an expertise \n     in issues related to older Americans;\n       (C) health professionals and members of professional \n     societies with expertise in caring for older Americans; and\n       (D) other appropriate parties.\n       (2) Selection of delegates.--The participants shall be \n     selected without regard to political affiliation or past \n     partisan activity and shall, to the best of the President's \n     ability, be representative of the spectrum of thought in the \n     field of geriatric health care.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Medicare Health Improvement Act of 2000--Summary\n\n       The viability of Medicare is increasingly threatened as the \n     nation's population ages and as large numbers of \n     beneficiaries are supported by fewer workers. The current \n     debate over the future of Medicare often revolves around \n     benefit cuts or tax increases. But an alternative that should \n     be part of the debate is to improve the health of \n     beneficiaries and reduce the demand for Medicare. \n     Unfortunately, Medicare contains few incentives to encourage \n     beneficiaries and providers to take health promotion and \n     disease prevention seriously. This bill will help older \n     Americans and individuals with disabilities to improve their \n     health and will educate health care providers in the best \n     practices to achieve these goals.\n\n\n                    title i: hcfa mission statement\n\n       The purpose of this title is to establish a mission \n     statement for the Health Care Financing Administration, the \n     agency in the Department of Health and Human Services that \n     administers Medicare. The mission of HCFA would be to: (1) \n     effectively and efficiently administer health insurance \n     coverage; (2) assure that the health care provided to \n     Medicare beneficiaries is of the highest quality; (3) carry \n     out health promotion and disease prevention activities; (4) \n     and assure the highest possible level of functioning for \n     beneficiaries.\n\n\n  title ii: enabling older americans and persons with disabilities to \n                          improve their health\n\n       Cost-sharing is waived for the following preventive \n     services currently covered by Medicare--screening \n     mammography, screening pelvic exam, hepatitis B vaccine and \n     its administration, colorectal cancer screening, bone mass \n     measurement, prostate cancer screening, and diabetes \n     outpatient self-management training services.\n       An information campaign for individuals over age 50 and \n     individuals with disability will be conducted jointly by the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Commissioner \n     of Social Security to promote the use of preventive health \n     services, including services not covered by Medicare. The \n     campaign will also encourage the proper use of prescription \n     and over-the-counter medications, and the use of measures \n     such as exercise, proper diet, and accident prevention to \n     safeguard health.\n       A health status self-assessment program will be developed \n     to help Medicare beneficiaries identify health information, \n     risk factors, and symptoms that they should act on or discuss \n     with their health provider.\n\n\n   title iii: improving the quality of care for older americans and \n                       persons with disabilities\n\n       HHS, in consultation with other agencies, will conduct a \n     study to determine areas in the treatment of Medicare \n     beneficiaries that do not meet the highest professional \n     standards. The study will also determine the best practices \n     for treatment in these areas and inform Medicare \n     beneficiaries about the study results.\n       A program will be established to inform health \n     professionals of the best practices for treatment, and to \n     reduce hospital stays and outpatient visits attributable to \n     improper use of medications.\n       A task force will conduct studies to determine which \n     preventive services in primary care are most valuable to \n     older Americans.\n       A smoking cessation demonstration project will determine \n     how to reduce smoking most effectively among Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n\n\ntitle iv: demonstration projects to improve the care of skilled nursing \n              residents and persons with serious illnesses\n\n       HHS will conduct demonstration projects on case management \n     and disease management to increase the quality and reduce the \n     cost of care for Medicare beneficiaries in nursing \n     facilities. The projects will encourage contracts with \n     Centers of Excellence, and will be authorized to use \n     innovative payment techniques, explore services not normally \n     covered by Medicare, and experiment with reduced cost-sharing \n     requirements for beneficiaries. Similar demonstration \n     projects will be conducted to improve the care of \n     beneficiaries with serious or chronic illness who are not in \n     nursing facilities.\n\n\n   title iv: white house conference on improving the health of older \n                               americans\n\n       This title requests the President to convene a White House \n     Conference on Improving the Health of Older Americans. The \n     goals of the Conference will be to develop ways to enable \n     older Americans to improve their health, and to develop \n     procedures to ensure that they receive the highest quality of \n     care, including the development of a research and \n     demonstration agenda to advance these goals.\n\n\n                                  cost\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost of \n     this program will be $1.6 billion over 5 years and $5 billion \n     over 10 years.\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Medicare Health Improvement Act of 2000--Fact Sheet\n\n       The health and quality of life for millions of adults age \n     65 or older and people with disabilities have significantly \n     improved under Medicare. From 1982 to 1994, chronic \n     disability among Americans over 65 declined by 1.3% annually, \n     and has continued to decline through 1999. Nevertheless, a \n     recent report by the World Health Organization revealed that \n     the U.S. lags behind Europe, Australia, Canada, Israel and \n     Japan in ``healthy life expectancy.'' Americans have a life \n     expectancy of 76.7 years of which 70 will be without \n     disability, in comparison to Japanese citizens who can \n     anticipate 74.5 healthy years. Chronic disability robs older \n     Americans of active and productive years. It adds $26 billion \n     annually in health care costs for those over 65 who lose \n     their ability to live independently over the course of a \n     year.\n       In the next 30 years, the viability of Medicare will be \n     challenged as the baby boom generation ages. The percentage \n     of the population 65 and older is expected to increase from \n     13% to 19% in 2025, resulting in larger numbers of \n     beneficiaries who will be supported by fewer workers. If the \n     prevalence of chronic disability can be further reduced and \n     healthy life expectancy increased, the aging population will \n     enjoy a longer period of independence and general well-being \n     while using fewer medical services.\n       Medicare was enacted in 1965 to ensure acute medical care \n     for older adults and persons with disabilities. As the field \n     of medicine and the demographics of the American population \n     have changed, the purpose of Medicare has evolved to include \n     health promotion and disease prevention activities.\n       Older Americans and persons with disabilities can \n     contribute significantly to improving their health.\n       Medicare offers multiple preventive services, but current \n     cost-sharing requirements often deter people from using these \n     services. Additional measures such as exercise, proper diet, \n     accident prevention and appropriate use of medications, can \n     enable beneficiaries to prevent or delay the onset of \n     disability. According to Healthy People 2010, ``More than any \n     other age group, older adults are seeking health information \n     and are willing to make changes to maintain their health and \n     independence.'' Medicare can do more to inform people about \n     health promotion and disease prevention to help them improve \n     their health.\n       Lifestyle problems account for approximately 70% of the \n     physical decline and disease that occur with aging. The over-\n     65 population is increasingly knowledgeable about medical \n     issues and can be motivated to make behavioral changes to \n     improve their health.\n       Deaths from heart disease and stroke rise significantly \n     over age 65, accounting for more than 40% of all deaths among \n     persons aged 65 to 74, and almost 60% of deaths in persons \n     age 85 and older. Medication and dietary changes have been \n     shown to reduce risk factors for heart disease and stroke, \n     such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Other \n     lifestyle changes--including increased physical activity, \n     maintaining healthy weight and cessation of smoking--can \n     also be effective.\n       Osteoporosis leads to 300,000 hip fractures each year and \n     50,000 deaths from complications. 50% of fracture victims \n     lost their ability to walk independently. The direct and \n     indirect costs of osteoporosis are estimated to be $13.8 \n     billion annually.\n       Only 13% of people ages 65 to 74 engage in vigorous \n     physical activity that promotes cardiorespiratory fitness and \n     prevents osteoporosis. Only 11% engage in strengthening \n     exercises and only 22% engage in\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\n     stretching exercises. For those ages 75 older, the rates are \n     6%, 8%, and 21% respectively. Yet these activities help older \n     adults maintain their functional independence and quality of \n     life.\n       The incidence of cancer in adults ages 65 and older is \n     approximately 11 times higher than that for persons under 65. \n     Most cancers can be treated and many can be curd if detected \n     early, but cancer screening tests are underutilized by \n     Medicare beneficiaries. In 1998, only 42.7% of older women \n     obtained a Pap smear. One study showed that only 62% of \n     breast cancer survivors over 65 and at risk for recurrence, \n     obtained an annual mammogram.\n       Good health largely depends on taking responsibility for \n     one's own health. Studies support a role for educational \n     programs that provide relevant information and guidelines to \n     enable medical consumers to determine when professional care \n     is required.\n       Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to treatment that meets \n     the highest professional standards.\n       Medicare effectively pays the bills for covered health \n     services, but it is less successful in assuring that older \n     adults and persons with disabilities actually receive the \n     quality health care they need and deserve. Less than optimal \n     health care is extremely costly to Medicare.\n       Approximately 17,000 individuals aged 65 or older die of \n     influenza or influenza-related pneumonia each year. But in \n     1997, only 63% of non-institutionalized older adults received \n     the influenza vaccine, and only 43% received the pneumococcal \n     vaccine. For every 10,000 persons over 65 who receive the \n     pneumococcal vaccine, approximately $1.4 million in health \n     care costs are saved.\n       On average, older adults use 4.5 prescription medication at \n     the same time and are at higher risk of misuse or drug-drug \n     interactions. Hospitalization from drug reactions or \n     interactions is six times higher for older adults than for \n     the general population.\n       Aspirin is an effective therapy that can reduce the risk of \n     death and disability from coronary artery disease, including \n     heart attacks and strokes. Yet this inexpensive medication is \n     inadequately used, especially in community settings. \n     General practitioners (11%), family doctors (18%), and \n     internists (20%) are less likely to recommend the use of \n     aspirin than are cardiologists (37%). Aspirin is \n     especially underused in patients over 80 years old, even \n     though this population is likely to receive the greatest \n     benefit.\n       Early use of a beta-blocker reduces the rates of mortality \n     and rehospitalization after acute myocardial infarction. Yet \n     51% of older adults who are eligible for such therapy do not \n     receive a beta blocker after a heart attack. In fact, \n     patients at highest risk for death in the hospital were the \n     least likely to receive beta blockers.\n       Mental illness is not a part of normal aging. Depression \n     affects up to 20% of older adults in the community and up to \n     37% of older primary care patients, but often goes \n     unrecognized and untreated. Both major and minor depression \n     are associated with high use of health care services and poor \n     quality of life. Untreated, depression can worsen symptoms of \n     other illness, produce disability, and result in suicide. The \n     incidence of suicide is highest in the elderly population. Up \n     to 75% of older suicide victims are seen by their primary \n     care provider in the month prior to suicide, but are not \n     treated or referred for treatment of their depression.\n       Physicians diagnose only 30% of older adults who have an \n     alcohol problem. The effects of alcohol can be greater in \n     older patients, due to changes in body mass and metabolism. \n     Drinking is linked with falls, motor vehicle accidents, and \n     is often a factor in suicide and martial violence. Alcohol \n     interacts with may medications and impairs judgment and \n     cognition. The long-term abuse of alcohol increases the risk \n     for high blood pressure, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and \n     stroke, as well as certain cancers.\n       Smoking-related expenditures were 9.4% of Medicare \n     expenditures in 1993 and were estimated to cost Medicare \n     $20.5 billion in 1997. Cessation of smoking slows the rate of \n     decline of lung function, in addition to reducing the risk of \n     heart disease and stroke.\n       Improving the health of older adults and persons with \n     disabilities will also improve the health of Medicare.\n       Improving the health of older adults and persons with \n     disabilities is essential for its own sake, and is also one \n     of the most important ways to improve the health of Medicare, \n     even as enrollment increases.\n       Chronically disabled adults over 65 have health costs that \n     are seven times those of healthy individuals. Reduction in \n     the rate of chronic disability could maintain the current \n     disabled retiree to worker ratio through 2030, despite a \n     dramatic change in the overall retiree to worker ratio, with \n     potentially immense savings to Medicare.\n       Savings achieved by improving the health of Medicare \n     beneficiaries outweigh any costs associated with increased \n     longevity.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       Establishes a mission statement for the Health Care \n     Financing Administration, with new emphasis on health \n     promotion and diseases prevention.\n       Waives cost-sharing for preventive services currently \n     offered by Medicare, such as screening mammography, screening \n     pelvic exam, colorectal screening, bone mass measurement and \n     diabetes self-management training.\n       Provides an information campaign to promote the use of \n     preventive health services.\n       Authorizes the development of a health self-assessment tool \n     that includes assessment of mental health.\n       Promotes the use of best practices for treatment of \n     Medicare beneficiaries.\n       Establishes a demonstration project for smoking cessation.\n       Provides demonstration projects to improve the care of \n     residents in skilled nursing facilities and persons with \n     serious illnesses who are not in nursing facilities.\n       Requests a White House conference on improving the health \n     of older Americans.\n       The cost of these specific measures is estimated to be $1.6 \n     billion over 5 years and $5 billion over 10 years, but these \n     costs are likely to be offset by reductions in Medicare costs \n     as the measures become effective in improving the health of \n     senior citizens.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 2729. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nSurface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 to restore stability \nand equity to the financing of the United Mine Workers of America \nCombines Benefit Fund by eliminating the liability of reachback \noperations, to provide additional sources of revenue to the Fund, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                combined fund stability and fairness act\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon, legislation that we call the \nCombined Fund Stability and Fairness Act.\n  The Coal Act of 1992 represents an unbreakable commitment to retired \nminers, their spouses, and their dependents. But it is clear today that \nif we do not address the shortcomings of the 1992 Act, we will fall \nshort of keeping that promise.\n  Simply put, the Combined Benefit Fund needs to be put on a firm \nfinancial footing so that the miners and their family members--who \ndepend on the health benefits the Fund provides--can stop worrying \nabout when their benefits might be cut.\n  The Coal Act of 1992 cast a wide net in identifying companies that \nwould be obligated to pay into the fund. Not only were companies then \nin the coal mining business included, but the Act also brought in \ncompanies that were no longer in the bituminous coal mining business as \nwell as successor companies. Nearly eight years later, we know that \nCongress overreached.\n  Two years ago, the Supreme Court in Eastern Enterprises versus Apfel, \nheld that the so-called ``super reachback'' companies should not have \nbeen included among Combined Benefit Fund contributors in the first \nplace.\n  The logic of the Court's decision in Eastern appears just as \napplicable to the reachback companies. They should not have been \nincluded either.\n  The bill the Senator from Oregon and I are introducing today is not a \nbailout for the reachback companies. In fact, the reachbacks will not \nreceive one penny under this legislation. It provides relief to the \nreachbacks on a prospective basis only.\n  There are a limited number of companies that will receive payments \nunder this bill. One group--what we refer to as the ``final judgment'' \ncompanies--are companies in the same situation as Eastern Enterprises. \nHowever, they had been unsuccessful in litigation decided before the \nEastern decision, and were barred from recovery by the doctrine of res \njudicata. The other group--the ``stranded interim'' companies--are \ncompanies that were assessed following the enactment of the 1992 Act \nbut were never assigned any beneficiaries.\n  The total of the refunds to be paid to these two groups of companies \namounts to about $28 million. That is the only money under this bill \nthat would not go retired miners and their dependents.\n  I think this is a fundamental question of fairness and equity. Those \ncompanies ought to be treated the same way as those companies that were \nrelieved of the obligation because of the Eastern decision. That is \njust basic fairness.\n  To help ensure the solvency of the Combined Benefit Fund into the \nfuture, the legislation would extend the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fee \nprogram beyond its current expiration date of 2004 through 2010. The \ninterest earned on the Abandoned Mine Lands Fund would be made \navailable to the Combined Benefit Fund. This is similar to\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\nthe approach Congress took with respect to the AML fund in the 1992 \nAct.\n  It is important to stress that the AML fees would be lowered \nsubstantially from current levels. The rate on surface-mined coal would \ndrop from 35 cents per ton to 20 cents per ton; the rate on \nunderground-mined coal would drop from 15 cents per ton to 5 cents per \nton; and the rate on lignite coal would drop from 10 cents per ton to 5 \ncents per ton.\n  The legislation also authorizes the transfer of $38 million in \ngeneral fund revenues every year to cover any shortfall in the fund.\n  The combination of the AML Fund interest money, the premium \nadjustment mechanism, and the annual general fund transfers will ensure \nthat all Combined Benefit Fund obligations will be fully met.\n  The fundamental purpose of the Combined Fund Stability and Fairness \nAct is to provide a secure, sound and fair financial foundation for the \nbenefits miners have been promised. It is my hope that Congress will \nnot delay in addressing this issue.

A bill to amend title III of the Public Health Service Act \nto enhance the Nation's capacity to address public health threats and \nemergencies; to the Committee on Health, Education and Pensions.\n\n\n           Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President. I am pleased today to introduce the \n``Public\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\nHealth Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000'' with my colleague, \nSenator, Kennedy, to improve our public health infrastructure and to \naddress the growing threats of antimicrobial resistance and \nbioterrorism.\n  Over the last two years, we have held three hearings and forums on \nthese topics, and I also commissioned a GAO report on antimicrobial \nresistance. The outcome of all this research is clear; we need to \nimprove our public health infrastructure to be able to respond in a \ntimely and effective manner to these and other threats.\n  For too long, we have not provided adequate funding to maintain and \nimprove the core capacities of our nation's public health \ninfrastructure. As the GAO report found, many State and local public \nhealth agencies lack even the most basic equipment such as FAX machines \nor answering machines to assist their workload and improve \ncommunications.\n  We face a myriad of public health threats everyday, and besides \nimproving our core public health capacity, this act aim addresses two \nproblems in particular: antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism.\n  Antimicrobial resistance is a pressing pubic health problem. As a \nheart and lung transplant surgeon, I know all too well that the most \ncommon cause of death after transplantation of a heart or lung is not \nrejection, but infection. One hundred percent of transplantation \npatients contract infections following surgery. Infection is the most \ncommon complication following surgery, the leading cause for \nrehospitalization, and the most expensive aspect of treatment post-\ntransplantation. Antibiotics are a mainstay of treatment, yet we are \nincreasingly seeing resistant bacteria which are not killed by most \nfirst-line antimicrobials.\n  In fact, the New England Journal of Medicine has reported that \ncertain Staphylocci, which are a common cause of post-surgical and \nhospital acquired infections, are showing intermediate resistance to \nvancomycin, an antibiotic of the last resort. Just recently in mid-\nApril, the FDA approved the first entirely new type antibiotic in 35 \nyears.\n  How did we reach this point? For most of human history, infections \nwere the scourge of man's existence causing debilitating disease and \noften death. Antibiotics, when initially discovered more than 50 years \nago, were heralded as miracle drugs and quickly became our most lethal \nweapon in the crusade against disease-causing bacteria. Antibiotics \nwere widely dispensed and, in the 1970's premature optimism lead us to \ndeclare the war on infections won.\n  Unfortunately, we discovered that bacteria are cagey, tenacious \norganisms that swiftly developed resistance to antibiotics and adapted \nto drug-rich environments. In addition, the art of medicine evolved, \ncreating new opportunities for bacteria to cause infection from \ninvasive procedures using catheters to organ transplant recipients who \nare treated with immunosuppressive agents to prevent rejection. As a \nresult, we are both seeing more invasive, life-threatening infections \nthat require concurrent treatment with several antibiotics to control \nand infections that were on the decline, such as Tuberculosis, re-\nemerging in an antimicrobial resistant form.\n  While infections have plagued man's existence for most of human \nhistory, throughout civilization, bioweapons have been strategically \ndeployed during critical military battles. For example, in 1344, the \nMongols hurled corpses infected with bubonic plague over the city walls \nof Caffa (now Feodossia, Ukraine). During World War I, the Germans \nhoped to gain an advantage by infecting their enemies horses and \nlivestock with anthrax.\n  Bioterrorism is a significant threat to our country. As a nation we \nare presently more vulnerable to bioweapons than other more traditional \nmeans of warfare. Bioweapons pose considerable challenges that are \ndifferent from those of standard terrorist devices, including chemical \nweapons.\n  The mere term ``bioweapon'' invokes visions of immense human pain and \nsuffering and mass casualties. Pound for pound, ounce for ounce, \nbioagents represent one of the most lethal weapons of mass destruction \nknown. Moreover, victims of a covert bioterrorist attack do not \nnecessarily develop symptoms upon exposure to the bioagent. Development \nof symptoms may be delayed days long after the bioweapon is dispersed.\n  As a result, exposed individuals will most likely show up in \nemergency rooms, physician offices, or clinics, with nondescript \nsymptoms or ones that mimic the common cold or flu. In all likelihood, \nphysicians and other health care providers will not attribute these \nsymptoms to a bioweapon. If the bioagent is communicable, such as small \npox, many more people may be infected in the interim, including our \nhealth care workers. As Stephanie Bailey, the Director of Health for \nMetropolitan Nashville and Davidson County pointed out in our hearing \non bioterrorism, ``many localities are on their own for the first 24 to \n48 hours after an attack before Federal assistance can arrive and be \noperational. This is the critical time for preventing mass \ncasualties.''\n  If experts are correct in their belief that a major bioterrorist \nattack is a virtual certainty, that it is no longer a question of \n``if'' but rather ``when.'' In fact, my home town of Nashville last \nyear joined an ever-increasing number of cities to receive and respond \nto a package that was suspected of containing anthrax. Thankfully, this \nwas a hoax.\n  To address these concerns about our public health infrastructure and \nimprove our preparedness for the threats of antimicrobial resistance \nand bioterrorism, I have joined with Senator Kennedy to provide greater \nresources and coordination to address these issues.\n  The Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act, which we introduce \ntoday, will provide needed guidance, resources, and coordination to \nincrease the core capacities of the nation's public health \ninfrastructure. This Act will also improve the coordination and \nincrease the resources available to address the threats of bioterrorism \nand antimicrobial resistance.\n  Strengthening capacities to ensure that the public health \ninfrastructure is adequate to respond to carry out core functions and \nrespond to emerging threats and emergencies, the Public Health Threats \nand Emergencies Act authorizes: the establishment of voluntary \nperformance goals for public health systems; grants to public health \nagencies to conduct assessments and build core capacities to achieve \nthese goals; and funding to rebuild and remodel the facilities of the \nCenter for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  To strengthen public health capacities to combat antimicrobial \nresistance, the Act authorizes: a task force to coordinate Federal \nprograms related to antimicrobial resistance and to improve public \neducation on antimicrobial resistance; the National Institutes of \nHealth (NIH) to support research into the development of new \ntherapeutics against and improved diagnostics for resistant pathogens; \nand grants for activities to improve specific capacities to detect, \nmonitor, and combat antimicrobial resistance.\n  To strengthen public health capacities to prevent and respond to \nbioterrorism, the Act authorizes: two interdepartmental task forces to \naddress joint issues of research needs and the public health and \nmedical consequences of bioterrorism; NIH and CDC research on the \nepidemiology of bioweapons and the development of new vaccines or \ntherapeutics for bioweapons; and grants to public health agencies and \nhospitals and care facilities to detect, diagnose, and respond to \nbioterrorism.\n  Mr. President, this Act is necessary. We must take steps now to \nimprove our basic capacities to address all public health threats, \nincluding antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. I am hopeful this \nlegislation provides State and local public health agencies the \nresources to improve their abilities so that we better protect the \nhealth and well-being of our Nation's citizens.\n  I want to thank Senator Kennedy for joining me in this effort and for \nthe work of his staff. I would also like to thank Dr. Stephanie Bailey, \nthe Director of Health for Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County \nfor her assistance and input on this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, several months ago, my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Bill Frist, and I began to develop legislation \nneeded to enhance the nation's protections\n\n[[Page S5117]]\n\nagainst the triple threat to health posed by new and resurgent \ninfectious diseases, by ``superbugs'' resistant to antibiotics, and by \nterrorist attacks with biological weapons. Today, Senator Frist and I \nare introducing the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000. \nI commend Senator Frist for his leadership and commitment on this \nimportant legislation.\n  The bill that we are introducing today will provide the nation with \nadditional weapons to win the battle against the deadly perils of \ninfectious disease, antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. The \nPublic Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000 will revitalize the \nnation's ability to monitor and fight outbreaks of infectious disease, \ncontrol the spread of germs resistant to antibiotics, and protect the \nnation more effectively against bioterrorism.\n  Today we face a world where deadly contagious diseases that erupt in \none part of the world can be transported across the globe with the \nspeed of a jet aircraft. The recent outbreak of West Nile Fever in the \nNew York area is an ominous warning of future dangers. Diseases such as \ncholera, typhoid and pneumonia that we have fought for generations \nstill claim millions of lives across the world and will pose increasing \ndangers to this country in years to come. New plagues like Ebola virus, \nLassa Fever and others now unknown to science may one day invade our \nshores.\n  Less exotic, but also deadly, are the simpler infections that for \nalmost a century we have been able to treat with antibiotics, but that \nare now becoming resistant even to our most advanced medicines. Drugs \nthat once had the power to cure dangerous infections are now often \nuseless--because ``superbugs`' have now become resistant to all but the \nmost powerful and expensive medications. Strains of tuberculosis that \nare resistant to antimicrobial drugs are prevalent around the world, \nand are a growing danger in our inner cities and among the homeless. If \naction is not urgently taken, we may soon return to the days when a \nsimple case of food poisoning could prove deadly and a mere cut could \nbecome severely infected and cost a limb.\n  The growing financial burden of antimicrobial resistance on the \nhealth care system is staggering. Treating a patient with TB usually \ncosts $12,000. But when a patient has drug-resistant TB, that figure \nsoars to $180,000. The National Foundation for Infectious Diseases \nestimates that the total cost of antimicrobial resistance to the U.S. \nhealth care system is as high as $4 billion every year--and this figure \nwill only rise as resistant infections become more common.\n  But the most potentially deadly of these threats is bioterrorism. We \nare a nation at risk. Biological weapons are the massive new threats of \nthe twenty-first century. The Office of Emergency Preparedness \nestimates that 40 million Americans could die if a terrorist released \nsmallpox into the American population. Anthrax could kill 10 million. \nOther deadly pathogens known to have been developed in biological \nwarfare labs around the world could kill millions.\n  Our proposal will strengthen the nation's public health agencies, \nwhich provide the first line of defense against bioterrorism and many \nother threats to the public health. Our legislation authorizes the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to respond swiftly and \neffectively to a public health emergency, and provides the Secretary \nwith needed resources to mount a strong defense against whatever danger \nimperils the nation's health.\n  The bill calls upon the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nestablish a national monitoring plan for dangerous infections resistant \nto antibiotics, and to work closely with state and local public health \nagencies to ensure that this peril is contained.\n  It is also essential to educate patients and medical providers in the \nappropriate use of antibiotics. Too often, patients demand antibiotics \nand doctors provide them for illnesses which do not require and do not \nrespond to these drugs. Our legislation calls upon the federal \ngovernment to lead a national campaign to educate patients and health \nproviders in the appropriate use of antibiotics.\n  The threat of bioterrorism demands particular attention, because of \nits potential for massive death and destruction. Currently, dozens of \nfederal agencies share responsibility for domestic preparedness against \nbioterrorist attacks. This bill will enhance the nation's preparedness \nby improving coordination among federal agencies responsible for all \naspects of a bioterrorist attack. Better coordination will allow us to \ndevelop the public health countermeasures needed to defend against \nbioterrorism, such as stockpiles of essential supplies and effective \ndisaster planning.\n  Since the infectious organisms likely to be used in a bioterrorist \nattack are rarely encountered in normal medical practice, many doctors \nor laboratory specialists are likely to be unable to diagnose persons \nwith these diseases rapidly and accurately. Recognizing a bioterrorist \nattack quickly is a major part of containing it. This bill will improve \nthe preparedness of public health institutions, health providers, and \nemergency personnel to detect, diagnose, and respond to bioterrorist \nattacks through improved training and public education.\n  One of the highest duties of Congress is to protect the nation \nagainst all threats, foreign and domestic. Deadly infectious diseases, \nnew ``superbugs'' resistant to antibiotics, and bioterrorism clearly \nmenace the nation. We must resist these threats as vigorously as we \nwould fight an invading army. the Frist-Kennedy bill is intended to \nprovide the weapons we need to win this battle.\n\n

Roosevelt \n     issued Executive Order No. 8484, which froze Baltic assets in \n     the United States to prevent them from falling into Soviet \n     hands;\n       Whereas on July 23, 1940, Acting Secretary of State Sumner \n     Welles issued the first public statement of United States \n     policy of nonrecognition of the Soviet takeover of the Baltic \n     countries, condemning that act in the strongest terms;\n       Whereas the United States took steps to allow the \n     diplomatic representatives of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania \n     in Washington to continue to represent their nations \n     throughout the Soviet occupation;\n       Whereas Congress on a bipartisan basis strongly and \n     consistently supported the policy of nonrecognition of the \n     Soviet takeover of the Baltic countries during the 50 years \n     of occupation;\n       Whereas in 1959, Congress designated the third week in July \n     as ``Captive Nations Week'', and authorized the President to \n     issue a proclamation declaring June 14 as ``Baltic Freedom \n     Day'';\n       Whereas in December 1975, the House of Representatives and \n     the Senate adopted resolutions declaring that the Final Act \n     of the Commission for Security and Cooperation in Europe, \n     which accepted the inviolability of borders in Europe, did \n     not alter the United States nonrecognition policy;\n       Whereas during the struggle of the Baltic countries for the \n     restoration of their independence in 1990 and 1991, Congress \n     passed a number of resolutions that underscored its continued \n     support for the nonrecognition policy and for Baltic self-\n     determination;\n       Whereas since then the Baltic states have successfully \n     built democracy, ensured the rule of law, developed free \n     market economies, and consistently pursued a course of \n     integration into the community of free and democratic nations \n     by seeking membership in the European Union and the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization;\n       Whereas the Russian Federation has extended formal \n     recognition to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania as independent \n     and sovereign states; and\n       Whereas the United States, the European Union, and the \n     countries of Northern Europe have supported regional \n     cooperation in Northern Europe among the Baltic and Nordic \n     states and the Russian Federation in addressing common \n     environmental, law enforcement, and public health problems, \n     and in promoting civil society and business and trade \n     development: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 60th anniversary of the United States \n     nonrecognition policy of the Soviet takeover of the Baltic \n     states and the contribution that policy made in supporting \n     the aspirations of the people of Estonia, Latvia, and \n     Lithuania to reassert their freedom and independence;\n       (2) commends Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania for the \n     reestablishment of their independence and the role they \n     played in the disintegration of the former Soviet Union in \n     1990 and 1991;\n       (3) commends Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania for their \n     success in implementing political and economic reforms, which \n     may further speed the process of their entry into European \n     and Western institutions; and\n       (4) supports regional cooperation in Northern Europe among \n     the Baltic and Nordic states and the Russian Federation and \n     calls for further cooperation in addressing common \n     environmental, law enforcement, and public health problems, \n     and in promoting civil society and business and trade \n     development, and similar efforts that promote a peaceful, \n     democratic, prosperous, and secure future for Europe, Russia \n     and the Nordic-Baltic region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5119-2", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 323--DESIGNATING MONDAY, JUNE 19, 2000, AS NATIONAL \n                   EAT-DINNER-WITH-YOUR-CHILDREN DAY\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nBryan, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. Helms, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Inouye) submited \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) during September 1999, Hurricane Floyd ran a path of \n     destruction along the entire eastern seaboard from Florida to \n     Maine;\n       (2) Hurricane Floyd was the most destructive natural \n     disaster in the history of the State of North Carolina and \n     most costly natural disaster in the history of the State of \n     New Jersey;\n       (3) the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared \n     Hurricane Floyd the eighth worst natural disaster of the past \n     decade;\n       (4) although the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     coordinates the Federal response to natural disasters that \n     exceed the capabilities of State and local governments and \n     assists communities to recover from those disasters, the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency is not equipped to \n     provide long-term economic recovery assistance;\n       (5) it has been 9 months since Hurricane Floyd and the \n     Nation has hundreds of communities that have yet to recover \n     from the devastation caused by that disaster;\n       (6) in the past, Congress has responded to natural \n     disasters by providing additional economic community \n     development assistance to communities recovering from those\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\n     disasters, including $250,000,000 for Hurricane Georges in \n     1998, $552,000,000 for Red River Valley Floods in North \n     Dakota in 1997, $25,000,000 for Hurricanes Fran and Hortense \n     in 1996, and $725,000,000 for the Northridge Earthquake in \n     California in 1994;\n       (7) additional assistance provided by Congress to \n     communities recovering from natural disasters has been in the \n     form of community development block grants administered by \n     the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n     Administration;\n       (8) communities affected by Hurricane Floyd are facing \n     similar recovery needs as have victims of other natural \n     disasters and will need long-term economic recovery plans to \n     make them strong again; and\n       (9) on April 7, 2000, the Senate passed amendment number \n     3001 to S. Con. Res. 101, which amendment would allocate \n     $250,000,000 in long-term economic development aid to assist \n     communities rebuilding from Hurricane Floyd, including \n     $150,000,000 in community development block grant funding and \n     $50,000,000 in rural facilities grant funding.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) communities devastated by Hurricane Floyd should know \n     that, in the past, Congress has responded to natural \n     disasters by demonstrating a commitment to helping affected \n     States and communities to recover;\n       (2) the Federal response to natural disasters has \n     traditionally been quick, supportive, and appropriate;\n       (3) recognizing that communities devastated by Hurricane \n     Floyd are facing tremendous challenges as they begin their \n     recovery, the Federal agencies that administer community and \n     regional development programs should expect an increase in \n     applications and other requests from these communities;\n       (4) community development block grants administered by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, grant programs \n     administered by the Economic Development Administration, and \n     the Community Facilities Grant Program administered by the \n     Department of Agriculture are resources that communities have \n     used to accomplish revitalization and economic development \n     following natural disasters; and\n       (5) additional community and regional development funding, \n     as provided for in amendment number 3001 to S. Con. Res. 101, \n     as passed by the Senate on April 7, 2000, should be \n     appropriated to assist communities in need of long-term \n     economic development aid as a result of damage suffered by \n     Hurricane Floyd.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               FITZGERALD (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3422\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for Mr. Fitzgerald (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nGrassley, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Moynihan, and \nMr. Harkin)) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 2549, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of title III, subtitle D insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) during September 1999, Hurricane Floyd ran a path of \n     destruction along the entire eastern seaboard from Florida to \n     Maine;\n       (2) Hurricane Floyd was the most destructive natural \n     disaster in the history of the State of North Carolina and \n     most costly natural disaster in the history of the State of \n     New Jersey;\n       (3) the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared \n     Hurricane Floyd the eighth worst natural disaster of the past \n     decade;\n       (4) although the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     coordinates the Federal response to natural disasters that \n     exceed the capabilities of State and local governments and \n     assists communities to recover from those disasters, the \n     Federal Emergency Management Agency is not equipped to \n     provide long-term economic recovery assistance;\n       (5) it has been 9 months since Hurricane Floyd and the \n     Nation has hundreds of communities that have yet to recover \n     from the devastation caused by that disaster;\n       (6) in the past, Congress has responded to natural \n     disasters by providing additional economic community \n     development assistance to communities recovering from those\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\n     disasters, including $250,000,000 for Hurricane Georges in \n     1998, $552,000,000 for Red River Valley Floods in North \n     Dakota in 1997, $25,000,000 for Hurricanes Fran and Hortense \n     in 1996, and $725,000,000 for the Northridge Earthquake in \n     California in 1994;\n       (7) additional assistance provided by Congress to \n     communities recovering from natural disasters has been in the \n     form of community development block grants administered by \n     the Department of Housing and Urban Development \n     Administration;\n       (8) communities affected by Hurricane Floyd are facing \n     similar recovery needs as have victims of other natural \n     disasters and will need long-term economic recovery plans to \n     make them strong again; and\n       (9) on April 7, 2000, the Senate passed amendment number \n     3001 to S. Con. Res. 101, which amendment would allocate \n     $250,000,000 in long-term economic development aid to assist \n     communities rebuilding from Hurricane Floyd, including \n     $150,000,000 in community development block grant funding and \n     $50,000,000 in rural facilities grant funding.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) communities devastated by Hurricane Floyd should know \n     that, in the past, Congress has responded to natural \n     disasters by demonstrating a commitment to helping affected \n     States and communities to recover;\n       (2) the Federal response to natural disasters has \n     traditionally been quick, supportive, and appropriate;\n       (3) recognizing that communities devastated by Hurricane \n     Floyd are facing tremendous challenges as they begin their \n     recovery, the Federal agencies that administer community and \n     regional development programs should expect an increase in \n     applications and other requests from these communities;\n       (4) community development block grants administered by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, grant programs \n     administered by the Economic Development Administration, and \n     the Community Facilities Grant Program administered by the \n     Department of Agriculture are resources that communities have \n     used to accomplish revitalization and economic development \n     following natural disasters; and\n       (5) additional community and regional development funding, \n     as provided for in amendment number 3001 to S. Con. Res. 101, \n     as passed by the Senate on April 7, 2000, should be \n     appropriated to assist communities in need of long-term \n     economic development aid as a result of damage suffered by \n     Hurricane Floyd.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               FITZGERALD (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 3422\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for Mr. Fitzgerald (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \nGrassley, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Moynihan, and \nMr. Harkin)) proposed an amendment to the bill, S. 2549, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the end of title III, subtitle D insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3431) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. \n2614, the Certified Development Company Program Improvements Act of \n2000. This important legislation was recently considered by the \nCommittee on Small Business and approved by an 18-0 vote. I am also \noffering a ``Managers' Amendment,'' which has been approved on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  The purpose of H.R. 2614 is to make the 504 Certified Development \nCompany program a more effective and more efficient program. The 504 \nProgram is a key credit program run by the Small Business \nAdministration to provide access to capital to small business owners. \nIt was enacted to leverage private sector resources to fund larger \nprojects for small businesses to acquire, construct or expand their \nfacilities. Specifically, it was designed to create job opportunities \nand improve the economic health of both rural and inner city \ncommunities.\n  Unlike most government-guaranteed loan programs, the 504 loan is \nsubordinate to a loan made by a private lender. SBA guarantees 10- or \n20-year debentures issued by Certified Development Companies (CDC), and \nthe proceeds from the sales of these debentures to investors are used \nto fund the 504 loans. Usually, the conventional loan will finance 50 \npercent of the project's cost, and the SBA-guaranteed 504 loan cannot \nexceed 40 percent of the project cost. In the event of a default of the \n504 small business borrower, the bank's loan is senior to the SBA-\nguaranteed 504 loan.\n\n\n                    504 Loan Defaults and Recoveries\n\n  Over the past 5 years, the Committee on Small Business has devoted \nconsiderable attention to the 504 program. The committee has been \nparticularly concerned about reports and testimony from the SBA and the \nOffice of Management and Budget (OMB) about loan recoveries following a \ndefault by a borrowers on a loan made under the program. Historically, \nin nearly all cases when a 504 program borrower defaults, it is the \nSBA, not the CDC, that take the required liquidation and foreclosure \nactions. The failure of the SBA to take aggressive actions to recover \nthe value of collateral held following a default significantly \nincreases the costs to borrowers to obtain a loan under the 504 \nprogram.\n  In response to the continuing problem of low recoveries under the 504 \nprogram, the committee, in 1996, approved legislation establishing a \npilot program that allowed approximately 20 CDCs to liquidate loan that \nthey originate. Results from the pilot have been encouraging, and the \ncommittee concluded that it is in the best interest of the 504 program \nto allow additional CDC's to conduct their own liquidation and \nforeclosure activities. Section 7 of H.R. 2614, as reported by the \nCommittee on Small Business, makes the pilot liquidation program \npermanent and requires SBA to permit certain CDC's to foreclose and \nliquidate defaulted loans that they have originated under the 504 loan \nprogram.\n\n\n                   Premier Certified Lenders Program\n\n  In October 1994, the Congress first enacted the Premier Certified \nLenders Program (PCLP) on a pilot basis. The program was expanded by \nCongress in 1997, and the limitation on the number CDC's that could \nparticipate in the program was removed. The Committee has noted the \nsuccess of the PCLP and has agreed with the House of Representatives to \nmake it a permanent part of the 504 program. In doing so, the committee \nexpects the SBA to continue its efforts to work with the CDC's to take \nadvantage of the strengths of the most successful and well-run CDC's.\n\n\n                           504 Program Costs\n\n  In 1995, the SBA and the National Association of Development \nCompanies (NADCO) strongly urged the Congress to adopt legislation \nmandating that the 504 program be supported entirely by fees paid by \nthe private sector. Since the new fees took effect at the beginning of \n1996, the fees increased from 0.125 percent to 0.875 percent in FY \n1997. The fees rise or fall based primarily on two key factors: the \nrate of defaults and the recovery rates. Since FY 1997, the committee \nis pleased to note that estimates for defaults and recoveries has \nimproved dramatically, and the borrower fee for FY 2001 will be 0.472 \npercent, a significant drop in four years from its peak in FY 1997. \nH.R. 2614 authorizes SBA to collect these fees to offset the credit \nsubsidy rate through FY 2003.\n  The bill adds 504 loans to women-owned small businesses to the \ncurrent list of public policy goals specified under the Small Business \nInvestment Act of 1958. Currently, loans for public policy goals can be \nguaranteed up to $1,000,000. Other 504 loans can be guaranteed up to \n$750,000. As approved by the committee, H.R. 2614 will increase the \nguarantee ceiling for regular 504 loans to $1,000,000, and the ceiling \nfor public policy loans will become $1,300,000.\n  During the committee's consideration of H.R. 2614, the committee \nmembers voted unanimously to establish the authorization levels for the \n504 program. The levels approved are $4 billion in FY 2001, $5 billion \nin FY 2002, and $6 billion in FY 2003. These are the same levels that \nthe committee also approved in the Small Business Reauthorization Act \nof 2000.\n\n\n                              Asset Sales\n\n  During the past four years, the committee has urged SBA to undertake \nthe\n\n[[Page S5157]]\n\nsale of assets held by the Agency; however, the committee does not \nbelieve this step forward should necessarily harm its lending partners, \nsuch as the CDC's. SBA has announced it will undertake two sales during \ncalendar year 2000; consequently, the committee approved a provision \nthat requires the SBA to notify CDC's prior to including a 504 loan in \nan asset sale. The committee adopted this section in order to insure \nthere is an open dialogue and full cooperation between the SBA and the \nrelevant CDCs.\n\n\n                               Amendments\n\n  Mr. President, the Manager's Amendment includes three provisions. The \nfirst provision, which has the strong support of the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, and Senator Cochran, is designed to expedite SBA \nconsideration of several applications for multi-state operating \nauthority for CDC's that have been pending at the 504 program office at \nthe SBA headquarters for at least one year.\n  The second provision addresses the pending shortfall in the 7(a) \nguaranteed business loan program. SBA is now projecting that the 7(a) \nprogram will run out of money on or about September 1, 2000. In order \nto ensure that sufficient funds are available to fund this important \nsmall business credit program until September 30, 2000, when FY 2000 \nconcludes, the Amendment authorizes SBA to reprogram funds appropriated \nbut not spent in prior years for the DELTA loan program and the \nMicroloan guarantee loan program. The total amount that SBA would need \nto reprogram would not exceed $6.5 million.\n  The third provision addresses an unforeseen event under the HUBZone \nprogram, which was authorized by Congress in 1997. The HUBZone program \nprovides a valuable Federal contracting incentive for small businesses \nthat are located in economically distressed inner cities and poor rural \ncounties and that employ residents from these distressed areas. It is \nmy understanding that new unemployment data will be released soon by \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, which could result in the sudden \ndisqualification on many recently certified HUBZone small businesses. \nThe amendment will ensure that HUBZone areas remain qualified for a \nfixed period of at least 3 years by giving them a 3-year period to wrap \nup their HUBZone activities once an area has ceased to qualify on the \nbasis of income or unemployment data. This change in the law will \ncounter an unintended consequence and bring some needed stability to \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, the Certified Development Company Program Improvements \nAct of 2000 is an important credit program providing small businesses \nwith credit opportunities that would not otherwise be available. I urge \nmy colleagues to support that bill and the manager's amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate will shortly pass \nH.R. 2614, the Certified Development Company Program Improvements Act \nof 1999. This bill was passed by the House on August 2, 1999.\n  The Small Business Administration's 504 loan program provides 20- and \n10-year fixed-rate loans to small businesses through Certified \nDevelopment Companies to be used for the acquisition or renovation of \nplant and equipment. SBA's 504 program loans are funded through the \nsale of pooled debentures on the bond market which gives small \nbusinesses access to interest rates that are close to those offered to \nlarge corporations.\n  SBA's 504 loan program is a net plus to our economy because it \nrequires that small businesses receiving loans must create jobs or \nretain jobs that otherwise would be lost and/or meet certain national \npublic policy goals. The 504 loan program's job creation track record \nhas been excellent, with at least 3 jobs being created for every \n$35,000 in 504 lending provided.\n  This legislation is most urgently needed because the 504 program \nneeds to be reauthorized. Even though the program costs the Government \nnothing and no appropriations are made to fund it because the program \npays for itself through fees collected from borrowers, it cannot \ncontinue to operate without an authorization. We cannot allow this to \nhappen. The 504 loan program is too important to small businesses who \nwish to expand because it provides affordable financing for growth with \nlow down payments which is often difficult or impossible for small \nbusinesses to obtain from traditional lenders.\n  This bill improves on the 504 loan program and increases the maximum \namount of a regular SBA guaranteed debenture, long term bond, from \n$750,000 to $1 million. The maximum amount for loans with specific \npublic policy purposes, low-income, rural and minority-owned \nbusinesses, is increased to $1,300,000. There has not been an \nadjustment to the maximum loan level in 10 years and this change allows \nthe program to keep up with inflation that has occurred over that time \nperiod. It also adds women-owned businesses to the category of public \npolicy goals that the program aims to achieve, making women-owned \nbusinesses eligible for the higher levels of financing. This is an \nimportant addition due to the significant role women-owned businesses \nplay in contributing to job growth in our economy. The bill also \nreauthorizes the program for 3 more years and makes two pilot programs \npermanent.\n  The State of Michigan has many active CDCs which keep in close touch \nwith my office to report on their activities and the small businesses \nthey have helped. On their behalf and on behalf of all the small \nbusinesses assisted by the 504 loan program and those that will be \nassisted in the future, I commend my colleagues for passing this \nlegislation which improves on an already outstanding program.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the availability of capital and credit \nstill remains one of the most significant impediments to small business \ncreation and growth, and it is the Small Business Administration (SBA) \nthat continues to effectively serve as the principal ``gap'' lender to \nour nation's 24 million small businesses.\n  SBA's loan and investment programs are a bargain. For very little, \ntaxpayers leverage their money to fuel the economy and help thousands \nof small businesses every year. In the 7(a) program, taxpayers spend \n$1.24 for every $100 loaned to small business owners. Well-known \nsuccesses like Winnebago and Ben & Jerry's are examples of the \nprogram's effectiveness. In the 504 program, taxpayers don't spend a \npenny to lend or leverage investments because they are self-funded.\n  Today we will vote on H.R. 2614, the Certified Development Company \nProgram Improvements Act of 2000. This bill makes changes to the 504 \nCertified Development Company (CDC or 504 program) loan program that \nwill greatly increase the opportunity for small businesses to build a \nfacility, buy more equipment, or acquire a new building. These loans \ncreate a ripple effect that enables small business owners to expand \ntheir companies, hire more workers and ultimately improve the local \neconomy.\n  This bill also includes a manager's amendment with three provisions. \nOne, it addresses prompt approval of applications from certified \ndevelopment companies (CDCs) to operate in multiple states. Two, it \nrestores much of the shortfall in 7(a) funding for FY2000 by giving SBA \nthe authority to reprogram unused funds. Three, it maintains continuity \nin the HUBZone program by grandfathering in existing HUBZone companies \nas zones are redefined when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its \nnew data.\n  Before I get into the details of this bill, I would like to spend a \nminute describing the 504 Certified Development Company (CDC) loan \nprogram. This program is mission-driven, designed to provide capital to \ngrowing small businesses and create jobs. The professionals who work at \nCDCs do much more than make loans--they better communities. They \nusually have a mixture of expertise, part economic development \nspecialist and part lender. They know their communities, and they know \nhow to package loans and help prospective borrowers get financing. In \nfact, if you were to talk to them, you would learn that many are former \nlenders from commercial banks who wanted to get out from behind a desk \nand get involved in their communities. Instead of turning away \nmeritorious projects because they didn't fit the profile of a \ntraditional borrower, using the 504 program they could put together a \nloan that spreads the risk among commercial lenders, CDCs, the state or \nlocal governments, and the small business owners. These loans\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n\njumpstart or complement the economic development in CDCs' communities.\n  Specifically, the 504 program provides businesses with long-term, \nfixed-rated financing for major fixed assets, such as buildings and \nequipment. CDCs work with the SBA and private-sector lenders to provide \nfinancing to small businesses and ultimately contribute to the economic \ndevelopment of their communities or the regions they serve. There are \nabout 290 CDCs nationwide, and each CDC covers a specific area. Each \nCDC's portfolio must create or retain one job for every $35,000 \nprovided by the SBA.\n  As I mentioned earlier, but will expand on here, proceeds from 504 \nloans must be used for fixed-asset projects. Projects range from land \npurchases and improvements--including existing buildings, grading, \nstreet improvements, utilities, parking lots and landscaping--to the \nconstruction of new facilities, or modernization, renovation or \nconversion of existing facilities, to the purchase of long-term \nmachinery and equipment. The 504 Program cannot be used for working \ncapital or inventory, consolidating or repaying debt, or refinancing.\n\n  I strongly support SBA's 504 loan program. Since 1980, more than \n25,000 businesses have received more than $20 billion in fixed-asset \nfinancing through the 504 program. In Massachusetts, over the last \ndecade, small businesses got $318 million in 504 loans that created \nmore than 10,000 jobs. The stories behind those numbers say a lot about \nhow SBA's 504 loans help business owners and communities. In Fall \nRiver, owners Patricia Ladino and Russell Young developed a custom \npacking plans for scallops and shrimp that has grown from ten to 30 \nemployees in just two short years and is in the process of another \nexpansion that will add as many as 25 new jobs. In Danvers, there's the \ncar dealership that used a 504 loan to grow a company over 15 years \nfrom 25 to 395 employees. In Berkshire County, the 504 program has \nhelped support the growth of the plastics mold and tool industry. One \ngood example of success in this area is the development of Starbase \nTechnologies in Pittsfield which now employs 65 people.\n  H.R. 2614 would build on that success by implementing the following. \nFirst, it will increase the maximum debenture size for Section 504 \nloans from $750,000 to $1 million, and the size of debentures for loans \nthat meet special public policy goals from $1 million to $1,300,000. It \nhas been 10 years since the Committee acted to increase the maximum \nguarantee amount in the 504 program. To keep pace with inflation, the \nmaximum guarantee amount should be increased to approximately $1.25 \nmillion. However, consistent with my colleagues on the House Small \nBusiness Committee, I believe that a simple increase to $1 million is \nprobably sufficient.\n  H.R. 2614 also adds women-owned businesses to the current list of \nbusinesses eligible for the larger public policy loans with guarantees \nof up to $1.3 million. Currently, the higher guaranty is available for \nbusiness district revitalization; expansion of exports; expansion of \nminority business development; rural development; enhanced economic \ncompetition; and, added just last year, veteran-owned businesses, with \nan emphasis on service-disabled veterans.\n  This small legislative change was significant and long overdue. \nThroughout America's history, countless men and women have served our \ncountry and fought for its ideals as members of our armed services. \nHowever, when they return to civilian life, veterans have often \nencountered barriers to starting or expanding a business. Although \nthere are a number of programs at the SBA to provide assistance, many \nof these are not specifically targeted at veterans. Making them \neligible for the higher debenture should help to remedy some of the \ninequalities that our service men and women face upon their return to \ncivilian life and provide greater opportunity for the 5.5 million \nbusinesses owned or operated by veterans. That change also should help \nthe 104,000 service-disabled veterans within the business community.\n  I originally introduced the provision to add women-owned businesses \nto the list of public policy goals in the 105th Congress as part of S. \n2448, the Small Business Loan Enhancement Act. Though it eventually was \nincluded in and passed by the Senate as part of H.R. 3412, a \ncomprehensive small business bill, it was never enacted. Unfortunately, \nthe House received the bill too late to act before the 105th Congress \nadjourned. I am very pleased that the Committee continues to recognize \nthe important role women-owned businesses play in the economy and is \nmaking this change to facilitate the expansion of this sector of our \neconomy.\n  Women-owned businesses are increasing in number, range, diversity and \nearning power. They constitute one-third of the 24 million small \nbusinesses in the United States, generate $3.6 trillion annually in \nrevenues to the economy and range in industry from advertising agencies \nto manufacturing. Addressing the special needs of women-owned \nbusinesses serves not only these entrepreneurs, but also the economic \nstrength of this nation as a whole. Since 1992, SBA has managed to \nincrease access to capital for women and has worked in earnest to move \nwomen entrepreneurs away from expensive credit card financing to more \naffordable loans for financing their business ventures. While the \npercentage of 504 loans to women-owned businesses has increased \nnationwide from 4.2 percent in 1987 to 13 percent in 1999, and I \napplaud that, we need to increase lending opportunities to better \nreflect that 38 percent of all businesses are owned by women.\n  By expanding the public policy goals of the 504 loan program to \ninclude women-owned businesses, we are ensuring that loans to eligible \nwomen business owners aren't capped at $1 million but are now available \nfor as much as $1.3 million. According to Certified Development Company \nprofessionals, loan underwriters are conservative when it comes to \napproving loans for more than $750,000 and this directive would \nundoubtedly help eligible women business owners get the financing they \nneed to expand their facilities and buy equipment as their businesses \ngrow.\n  H.R. 2614 also reauthorizes the fees currently levied on the \nborrower, the Certified Development Company, and the participating \nbank. The fees in the 504 program cover all its costs, resulting in a \nprogram that operates at no cost to the taxpayer. Without this \nlegislation, the fees sunset on October 1, 2000. H.R. 2614 will \ncontinue them through October 1, 2003.\n  Additionally, H.R. 2614 will grant permanent status to the Preferred \nCertified Lender Program before it sunsets at the end of fiscal year \n2000. This program enables experienced CDCs to use streamlined \nprocedures for loan making and liquidation, resulting in improved \nservice to the small business borrower and reduced losses and \nliquidation costs.\n  H.R. 2614 also makes the Loan Liquidation Pilot Program a permanent \nprogram. This gives qualified and experienced CDCs the ability to \nhandle the liquidation of loans with only minimal involvement of the \nSBA. It is the goal of this liquidation program to increase the \nrecovery rates of the 504 loan program, and to bring about a \ncorresponding reduction in the fees charged to the borrowers and the \nlenders.\n  Importantly, this bill includes Senator Wellstone's provision to \nauthorize the program for three more years, making it a complete \npackage. I believe it is better to act now on a bill that already has \nthe House's blessing than to wait for the comprehensive reauthorization \nbill, H.R. 3843, to make its way to the President's desk. Taking this \naction now will enable the CDCs to plan for the year ahead, because \nthey know that the program levels for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 \nare $4 billion, $5 billion and $6 billion.\n  In addition to these changes, and as I mentioned earlier, this bill \nincludes a manager's amendment. The first provision deals with long-\npending applications from CDCs that are seeking to expand into multiple \nstates. To address the problem, this provision establishes a one-time \nautomatic approval of applications for multi-state operation that have \nbeen pending at SBA headquarters for 12 months or more. Unless SBA acts \nto approve or disapprove the applications, automatic approval would go \ninto effect 21 days after the bill is signed by the President.\n  While I urge the SBA to process applications in a timely manner, and \nwhile I understand the frustration of the applicants who have been \nwaiting,\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\nI believe, in general, that it is in the best interest of the taxpayers \nfor applicants and their proposals to be thoroughly screened, rather \nthan blindly approved. This program, above all else, was designed to \nhelp small businesses, and I believe we should carefully review policy \nchanges that are intended to expand a CDC's territory to make sure that \nthe real goal--increasing access to the program for small businesses--\nis achieved.\n\n  The second provision gives the SBA the authority to reprogram unused \nfunds to make up for the significant shortfall of appropriations for \nthe 7(a) loan program. In its budget request for FY 2000, and again \nrecently, the SBA estimated that the demand in this popular lending \nprogram would grow to a program level of $10.5 billion. Unfortunately, \nit was only appropriated enough to support a level of close to $9.8 \nbillion. The Administration's estimate has proven to be more accurate \nthan Congress anticipated, and the SBA needs additional funds to keep \nthe program running throughout this fiscal year. This bill restores \n$500 million of the $700 million shortfall. I strongly support this \nprovision and worked with Senator Bond to draft this legislation. I \nappreciate his cooperation and respectfully urge the appropriators in \nboth the Senate and House to work with us.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, this bill also includes a technical change to \nthe Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business contracting \nprogram (HUBZone program) administered by the SBA. The HUBZone program \nis designed to provide contracting opportunities in economically \ndistressed areas of this country. One of the criteria for this program \nis that a small business must be located in a qualified census tract or \nnonmetropolitan county based on unemployment statistics from the \nDepartment of Labor and the Department of the Census.\n  As new data becomes available, there is a possibility that HUBZone \nfirms would lose their eligibility, because the data could reflect that \nthe census tract the firm is located in is technically no longer \nconsidered an economically depressed area. As ranking member of the \nCommittee on Small Business and as a cosponsor of the original HUBZone \nlaw passed in 1997, I am concerned that when a particular area is no \nlonger deemed HUBZone-eligible, small business owners in that area will \nlose the ability to bid on contracting opportunities under the program \nwith little or no warning. This will be disruptive to the program and \ncould discourage participation by qualified small businesses.\n  Because it is better policy to provide both small firms and the SBA \nwith some sort of warning before a firm is deemed ineligible, this \namendment is intended to allow a HUBZone firm located in an \neconomically depressed area that has been redesignated by either Bureau \nof Labor Statistics (BLS) or Census data, to remain eligible under the \nprogram for three additional years. Thus the firm is put on notice that \ncontracting opportunities under the program may not be available in the \nfuture, and the business is given time to plan for this change.\n  While I understand only a handful of firms were affected by a change \nin designated areas when new BLS data was released last year, I support \nthe chairman's effort to ensure that no firm is taken by surprise this \nyear. I am pleased that Senator Byrd and his staff worked together with \nmy staff to come up with appropriate language for this amendment.\n  In closing, I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this bill. \nIf, as expected, it is enacted, they will have improved the business \nclimate and taken a few more steps to ensure that small businesses have \naccess to capital and expanded procurement opportunities.\n  Mr. ALLARD.

A similar resolution has been introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Representatives Rangel and McCollum.\n  In addition to designating June 19--the day after Father's Day--as \nNational Eat Dinner with Your Children Day, the resolution also \nrecognizes that eating dinner as a family is a critical step toward \nraising healthy, drug-free children and it encourages families to eat \ntogether as often as possible.\n  The idea for this resolution grew out of research by The National \nCenter on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, CASA, \non teen attitudes about drug use. For four years running, the CASA teen \nsurvey has highlighted the power that parents have over their \nchildren's decisions regarding drug use, showing that children and \nteens who routinely eat dinner with their families are far less likely \nto use illegal drugs, cigarettes or alcohol:\n  Teens who rarely eat dinner with their parents are 72 percent more \nlikely than the average teen to use drugs, cigarettes and alcohol.\n  Teens that almost always eat with their families are 31 percent less \nlikely to smoke, drink or do drugs than the average teen.\n  Of course, having dinner as a family is a proxy for spending time \nwith kids. It is not the meat, potatoes and vegetables that alter a \nchild's likelihood to use drugs, it is the everyday time spent with mom \nand dad--the two most important role models in most kids lives.\n  I do not believe that this resolution will be the silver bullet to \nsolving this nation's drug problem. But I do feel these statistics are \ntelling. CASA President Joe Califano talks about ``Parent Power.'' It \nis important that parents know the power they have over their \nchildren's decisions and the power that they have to deter kids from \ndrinking, smoking or using drugs. For example, nearly half of teens who \nhave never used marijuana say that it was lessons learned from their \nparents that helped them to say no.\n  Unfortunately, many parents are pessimistic about their ability to \nkeep their kids drug-free; 45 percent say that they believe their child \nwill use an illegal drug in the future.\n  This pessimism is often reinforced by news reports that indicate that \nwhile most parents say that they have talked to their kids about the \ndangers of drugs, only a minority of teens say that they have learned a \nlot from their family about the dangers of drugs. Rather than be \ndiscouraged by this apparent disconnect, I think it should teach us an \nimportant lesson: that talking to kids about drugs ought not just be a \none-time conversation. It should be an ongoing discussion that includes \nasking children where they are going, who they are going out with, \nwhether there will be adult supervision, etc. These lessons can also \ngrow out of spending time with a child, helping that child to learn how \nto work through problems or rise above peer pressure, and parents \nsetting a good example for kids.\n  Keeping up on children's lives--including knowing who their friends \nare and what they are doing after school--is critical. The experts tell \nus that some of the tell-tale signs that a child is drinking or using \nillicit drugs are behavior changes, change in social circle, lack of \ninterest in hobbies and isolation from family. These changes can be \nsubtle; picking up on them can require a watchful eye.\n  Eating dinner as a family will not guarantee that a child will remain \ndrug-free. But family dinners are an important way for parents to \ninstill their values in their children as well as remain connected with \nthe challenges that children face and help them learn how to cope with \nproblems without resorting to smoking, drinking or using drugs.\n  I sincerely hope that each one of my colleagues join me to support \nthis resolution to send a message to parents that they can play a \npowerful role in shaping the decisions their kids make regarding \ndrinking, smoking and drug use.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am submitting, along with Senators \nBiden, Thurmond, Bryan, Jeffords, Moynihan, Helms, Levin, DeWine, \nKennedy, Sessions, Murray, Schumer, and Inouye, a bi-partisan \nresolution designating Monday, June 19, 2000 as ``Eat Dinner with your \nChildren Day.'' We also join with our House colleagues Congressmen \nRangel and McCollum as they take the lead on this bipartisan issue in \nthe House of Representatives. This resolution recognizes the benefits \nof eating dinner as a family, especially as a way to keep children from \nusing illegal drugs, tobacco, and alcohol.\n  Last October I came to the floor seeking to increase awareness of the \nimportant roles parents play in their children's lives. A recent study \nby the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, or CASA \nreinforced our understanding of the importance of this role. CASA is a \nnational resource that monitors and reports on drug abuse trends, \nrisks, and solutions affecting all Americans. Last September they \nreleased their annual back to school survey on the attitudes of teens \nand parents regarding substance abuse. The survey stressed how \nessential it is for parents to get involved in their children's lives. \nThe survey indicates that kids actually do listen to their parents. In \nfact, 42 percent of the teenagers who have never used marijuana credit \ntheir parents with the decision. Unfortunately, too many parents--45 \npercent--believe their teenagers' use of drugs is inevitable. In \naddition, 25 percent of the parents said they have little influence \nover their teen's substance abuse.\n  But the kids have got it right. Parents are critical. So are \nfamilies. That is why the sponsors of this bill are happy to work with \nJoe Califano, the head of CASA, to help remind all of us of this simple \nfact.\n  The family unit is the backbone of this country. Solutions to our \ndrug problems involve all of us working together. Parents and \ncommunities must be engaged and I am committed to help making that \nhappen. Parents need to provide a strong moral context to help our \nyoung people know how to make the right choices. They need to know how \nto say ``no,'' that saying no is okay, that saying no to drugs is the \nright thing to do--not just the safe or healthier thing, but the right \nthing. I urge our colleagues to join us.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\nthe table, and any statements relating to the resolution be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 323) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 323\n\n       Whereas the use of illegal drugs and the abuse of \n     substances such as alcohol and nicotine constitute the single \n     greatest threat to the health and well-being of American \n     children;\n       Whereas surveys conducted by the National Center on \n     Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University have \n     found for each of the past 4 years that children and \n     teenagers who routinely eat dinner with their families are \n     far less likely to use illegal drugs, cigarettes, and \n     alcohol;\n       Whereas teenagers from families that seldom eat dinner \n     together are 72 percent more likely than the average teenager \n     to use illegal drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol;\n       Whereas teenagers from families that eat dinner together \n     are 31 percent less likely than the average teenager to use \n     illegal drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol;\n       Whereas the correlation between the frequency of family \n     dinners and the decrease in substance abuse risk is well \n     documented;\n       Whereas parental influence is known to be one of the most \n     crucial factors in determining the likelihood of teenage \n     substance abuse; and\n       Whereas family dinners have long constituted a substantial \n     pillar of American family life: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes that eating dinner as a family is a critical \n     step toward raising healthy, drug-free children; and\n       (2) designates Monday, June 19, 2000, as National Eat-\n     Dinner-With-Your-Children Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/06/14/senate-section/article/S5161-1", "month": "06", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 15, 2000\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.
