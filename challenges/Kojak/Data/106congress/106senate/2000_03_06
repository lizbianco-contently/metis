BYRD\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today we observe and celebrate a milestone \nin the life of one of our most respected colleagues. On Saturday, March \n4, Senator Robert C. Byrd became the third longest-serving Senator in \nthe history of this august body--surpassing the service of the \nvenerable and beloved John Stennis of my State, who served 41 years and \n2 months.\n  This November, Senator Byrd will surpass the service of Senator Carl \nHayden which will mean that we will be novices working alongside two of \nthe longest-serving Senators in history. Both of them are here with us \nnow--Strom Thurmond and Robert Byrd. Just think about that. They will \nbe the top two in history in tenure, and we will be serving with both \nof them.\n  It is more than about tenure, however, when you talk about Strom \nThurmond or Robert C. Byrd. In the case of Senator Byrd, in his 41-plus \nyears, colleagues have placed their trust in him to hold the highest \noffices in this institution. He was among those who were elected to the \nleadership positions but also at the committee level. He has been both \nthe majority leader and the minority leader; he has been President pro \ntempore; and he has chaired our Committee on Appropriations. Today he \nis the ranking Democrat on that very important committee.\n  What he has brought to those positions has been more than hard work \nand high skills. He has brought a passion for procedures, an insistence \nupon order. On occasion, he has reminded me\n\n[[Page S1160]]\n\nwhat the rules are or what order requires. It is always intended to be \nhelpful because he believes that the institution itself is more \nimportant than any one Senator.\n  On occasion, he has regaled the Senate with a discourse on antiquity \nand, more specifically, the history of Greece and Rome and, of course, \nthe Roman Senate. Yet when Senator Byrd speaks, Senators actually come \nout of the Cloakroom and our offices and listen, enthralled, to the \nhistory that he knows and the quotes that he gives from memory. He has \ninspired us many times both in the antiquity that he talks about and \nalso the very great personal stories that he tells and the quotations. \nI remember he had a quote when I had a grandson born a year and a half \nago about the beauty of being a grandparent, and it was just one of the \nmost beautiful things I have ever heard on the floor of the Senate, \nmaybe not so much as to who had said it, or how he was saying it, but \nwho he was saying it about. He did a beautiful job.\n  He speaks of great historic events and he quotes from the Bible. And \nyet he has spoken personally, humanly, about the wonders of life, and \neven to being the owner of a wonderful dog named Billy, in such a way \nthat has brought tears to our eyes. Having seen ``My Dog, Skip'' just \nthis past weekend, I know sometimes the beauty of an animal or dog in \nyour family will bring tears quicker than anything perhaps.\n  In today's world, where anything older than a decade is considered \nancient, his knowledge of the classical world is truly extraordinary, \nand his insistence that its somber lessons are relevant to our own \ntimes is truly sobering.\n  In seasons of turmoil, it is the Senate's role to give the Nation the \nreassurance of stability and endurance. That is what the framers of our \nConstitution intended when they devised an upper Chamber that would be \na steady anchor against the wild winds of public passion and hasty \naction.\n  Senator Byrd's magnificent addresses on the history of the Senate \nchronicle the work of Senators--whether renowned or obscure--who have \ntoiled in this body for causes larger than their own advancement, both \nhere in this room and in the old Chamber where the Senate did its work \nuntil 1859.\n  Senator Byrd's personal heroes, such as Richard Russell of Georgia, \nhave pursued duty rather than passing glory, and in the process won for \nthemselves a lasting remembrance in the annals of representative \ndemocracy.\n  Because of my own southern background and because of Senator Byrd's \ncomments over the years, things he has noted about Senator Russell, I \nhave gone back and read some of the history of this great Senator. It \nwas interesting to me to note that others indicated he surely could \nhave been the majority leader. Clearly, he could have assumed any role \nhe wanted in the Senate. But he chose not to do that. He chose instead \nto be chairman of the Armed Services Committee, chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, to be involved in everything that happened in \nthe Senate. He was truly a unique Senator in many ways.\n  Today, we celebrate and stand in respectful witness to the history \nthat Robert Byrd is making as the Senator from West Virginia who, for \n41 years and 2 months, has pursued duty rather than passing glory for \ncauses larger than his own advancement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/06/senate-section/article/S1160-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1160-S1161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves the floor, \nI would like to direct a couple of comments to him. I hope the majority \nleader saw what happened last week. After some work, we had a bill \nbefore the Senate that was almost open. The education savings bill \nallowed all amendments dealing with taxation, amendments dealing with \neducation, and we threw in a few other amendments as part of the \nunanimous consent agreement. I might add, I think what happened last \nweek was exemplary as how the Senate should operate.\n  There were no quorum calls, or if there were some, they were \nmomentary in nature. When an amendment was offered, it was debated; \nthere were no dilatory tactics. Even though the minority did not like \nthe bill that was before the Senate, I think we proceeded, showing our \ngood faith that we can work on legislation and move things along. In \nfact, regarding the one amendment we added, the Wellstone amendment we \nhad a time agreement on it, and I think that amendment was the one of \nseveral amendments that was agreed to. There may have been only one \nother.\n  The point I am making to the majority leader is I hope the majority \nwould allow more business to come before the Senate in the same manner \nbecause I think, while it wasn't necessary to show our good faith, the \nminority showed we can move legislation and move it quite rapidly. That \nbill had scores of amendments, more Democratic amendments than \nRepublican amendments, but I repeat: We moved that bill well, and I \nthink we showed how the Senate should really operate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I noted late \nThursday night that I was very much impressed and pleased with the way \nthat legislation went through the Senate and that we were able to get \nto conclusion. I made a particular note of the fine work the Senator \nfrom Nevada did, helping keep Members focused on the issue at hand, the \nissue before us, and also reducing the number of amendments and helping \nmake it possible for us to complete that bill on Thursday night.\n  I have to say the Senator, since he has been elected as the whip, \nassistant Democratic leader, has made a difference in our ability to \ncomplete important legislation. I think that was an example of how we \ncan proceed. That was a good bill that had bipartisan support. I know a \nlot in the minority did not like it but several in the minority did \nvote for it because it wound up getting 61 votes, which means even if \nit got every Republican--and I didn't check to see if every one voted \nfor it, but probably at least a half dozen Democrats also voted for it.\n  It is a good example of how we can proceed. Amendments were agreed to \nthat were related to education, related to tax policy on education, and \na couple of amendments such as the Wellstone amendment were not \ndirectly related, but Senators had something they wanted to offer. We \nwere given an opportunity to take a look at the Wellstone amendment and \nbasically said, sure, we can agree to that. But it did not become just \nflypaper to attach every amendment Senators could come up with. We did \nnot get off into a lot of extraneous debate. Most of the week was spent \nfocused on education and education tax policy, and that is the way we \nwould like it to proceed.\n  It seemed to me the week before last that we were not going to be \nable to proceed, and we were going to have to go to cloture, which I \nalways prefer not to do. I prefer to go forward without long debate and \ndelay by amendments. But if I am given the impression, or told, in \neffect, we are going to offer all kinds of extraneous amendments, I \nhave to look for some way to bring it to conclusion and get a final \nvote. That is why I filed cloture the end of the week, the previous \nweek.\n  Then, on Monday morning, Senator Daschle called and said he thought \nthat basically the parameters of the unanimous consent request we had \noffered were fair, but there were some Senators who still thought they \nhad other issues they would like addressed. But he thought maybe we \ncould work on it that morning--I believe it was Monday morning; it may \nhave been Tuesday morning--but we could work through it and get a fair \nagreement. As a matter of fact, by noon that day we had done so.\n  So I hope this will be the procedure we can use in the future. We may \nhave the opportunity to see if we can do that even this very week \nbecause I have been urging and pushing Senators to come to an agreement \non how to proceed on the Export Administration Act. This is something \nwe need to do. This is something people who are in the export business \nwant to get clarified. We have not had an export law on the books since \nthe one that was passed in 1979. My goodness, in this area of export of \ntechnology, for instance, it changes weekly, let alone annually. We \nclearly need to do this. I think the concept of this bill is something \nthe administration generally supports. It came out of committee \nunanimously.\n\n[[Page S1161]]\n\n  There are some legitimate concerns from members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, the Foreign Relations Committee, the Government Affairs \nCommittee, and the Intelligence Committee about how do we deal with \nnational security issues; how can we carve out national security \nissues; how can we make sure it is not a unilateral decision made by \nthe Commerce Department; and how are the State Department and Defense \nDepartment going to be involved.\n  But a lot of work is being done on that. I am hoping we can go \nforward on that bill Tuesday or Wednesday of this week and find a way \nto complete it. But we will not be able to do it unless we find \ncooperation on both sides of the aisle, and I hope maybe the education \nbill can be an example we can follow. It may even be easier in this \ncase because I think there is actually broader bipartisan support.\n  So I appreciate what Senator Reid had to say. I agree with it. I hope \nthat is the example we can use as we go forward this year. We have a \nlot of work. In spite of distractions, in spite of elections, we still \nhave work to do for the American people. It is important we find a way \nto do that for the best interests of our country.\n  I thank Senator Reid for his contribution in that effort.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the leader, I think we should be \ngiven even more leeway. I think we can get a lot more done. I don't \nthink, on legislation, there would be the disaster that the leader \nbelieves. But I think we have made some progress, and I look forward to \nseeing if we can make more progress. The export administration bill, as \nthe leader said, is a bill that has wide bipartisan support, and we \nshould move forward on this, even though we have some people concerned \nabout it. That is what the process is all about. They should come down \nand talk about their concerns, vote on it, and move it on. If there \nwere ever a high-tech issue this congressional session, it is this \nbill. So the high-tech industry can remain competitive and keep that \nbusiness we so value in the United States, we have to pass this bill or \nvery quickly the business will be going offshore.\n  I thank the leader very much, and I look forward to continued \nprogress on legislation to help the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/06/senate-section/article/S1161-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when I was a little boy, I lived in the town \nof Searchlight, NV. One of my brothers, who is 10 years older than I, \nworked for Standard Stations. He was assigned to a place called \nAshfork, AZ, which to me could have been as far away as New York City \nbecause I had never traveled anyplace.\n  When I was a young boy of 11 years, he allowed me to spend a week \nwith him in Ashfork, AZ. My brother had a girlfriend. The thing I \nremember most about my journey to Ashfork, AZ. The girlfriend had a \nbrother about my age, or a year or so older. We would play games. I \nnever won a single game, not because I should not have, but because he \nkept changing the rules in the middle of the game. It does not matter \nwhat the game was; as I started to win, he would change the rules. So I \nreturned from Ashfork never having won anything, even though I should \nhave won everything.\n  The reason I mention that today is that is kind of what campaign \nfinance is all about in America. The rules keep changing, not for the \nbetter, but for the worse. They are complicated. They are impossible to \nunderstand.\n  I was recently criticized because I did not disclose the names of \npeople who gave to my leadership fund. Why didn't I? The reason I did \nnot is that I did not legally have to. The most important reason, \nhowever, is that people who gave to my fund said: Do you have to \ndisclose my name? And I said no, which was true. That is the law; I did \nnot have to.\n  Over the last several weeks, there have been a number of people \nwriting about the fact I have not disclosed who gave me the money and \nhow much it was. I made a decision that even though it was unnecessary \nlegally for me to do that, I would disclose those names. I could not do \nthat, however, until I went back to the people whom I told I would not \nmake a disclosure and got their permission to do so. I am happy to \nreport I was able to do that. Everyone understood, and they said: Go \nahead, I would rather you did not do it, but you have told me why you \nhave to do it; go ahead and do that.\n  That goes right to the heart of what is wrong with the campaign \nfinance system in America today. There is no end to what is politically \ncorrect, but yet if a person follows the legal rules, it still may not \nbe politically correct. It is a Catch-22. No matter what one does in \nthe system, it is wrong; people of goodwill trying to do the right \nthing are criticized.\n  We have to do something. Everything I have done with my Searchlight \nfund, as it is called, is totally legal. I have not done anything \nwrong. It has been checked with lawyers and accountants. In fact, when \npeople came to me and said, do you have to disclose my name? I checked \nto make sure I was giving them the right information when I said no.\n  I thought it was important to follow the law, and I have done that. \nIt was important for me to keep my word. Where I grew up, there was not \na church and there was not a courthouse; everything was done based on \npeople's word. If you shook hands with someone or you told them you \nwere going to do something, that was the way it had to be, and that is \nthe way I felt about disclosing these names.\n  It was very hard for me and somewhat embarrassing to go back to these \npeople, and say: May I have your permission to disclose your name, even \nif you did not want it done? Even though they consented, it was not an \neasy thing to do.\n  I have disclosed these names and the money. The problem is the system \nis simply broken. There are traps set up all along the way for people \nwho are trying to comply with the law. If we comply with the law, \nsometimes we lose the confidence of the public, who come to believe we \nare all in the grip of wealthy special interests whose cash carves out \nordinary Americans from the system.\n  Under our current system, money is the largest single factor, some \nsay, in winning a Federal political election, and a lot of times that \nis true. The dilemma we face is: Too little money,\n\n[[Page S1162]]\n\nand you may very well lose your political position; too much money, and \nthe public thinks you are in someone's pocket, for lack of a better \ndescription.\n  I finished an election last year. The State of Nevada at the time of \nthat election had a population of fewer than 2 million people. My \nopponent and I spent the same amount in State party money and funds \nfrom our campaigns. We each spent over $10 million for a total of $20 \nmillion in a State of less than 2 million people. That does not count \nall the money spent in that election because there were independent \nexpenditures also. We do not know the amount because there is no legal \nreason they be disclosed, but I estimate another $3 million at least.\n  In the State of Nevada, a State of fewer than 2 million people, we \nhad spent $23 million. If that is not an example of why we need \ncampaign finance reform, there is not an example. We need to do \nsomething now.\n  I have talked about the State of Nevada, but there are other States \nin which more money is spent. It is not unusual or uncommon to hear \nabout races costing more money than the $20 million spent in the State \nof Nevada. Most of those States have more population, but that is still \nlot of money.\n  We know presently there is a controversy in the election that is \ngoing to be held in New York tomorrow. Why? In the Republican primary, \nthere has been an independent expenditure of $2.5 million berating John \nMcCain for his environmental record and for not being supportive of \nbreast cancer research.\n  Every candidate who is running for President of the United States is \nfor breast cancer research. I have already given one example of how \nmuch it costs in the State of Nevada and why we need to do something \nabout campaign finance reform. Certainly, in New York, because of \nindependent expenditures, we need to do something. They are gross; they \nare absurd; they are obscene--$2.5 million to distort the record of a \nfine person, John McCain, indicating that he is opposed to breast \ncancer research. I am not going to belabor the point and talk about his \nenvironmental record, but if one compares it to whom he is running \nagainst, it is not that bad. These independent expenditures are wrong, \nand we should do something about them.\n  I repeat, our current system is broken and it needs to be fixed.\n  I have spoken many times in this chamber, going back more than 12 \nyears, about the need to reform the system. I have sponsored and \ncosponsored many bills for reforming the system, including variations \nof the McCain-Feingold bill. These bills have never even had a decent \ndebate in this body, let alone passed. We have never been able to \ninvoke cloture.\n  Those of us who represent our States and want to accomplish good and \nmeaningful things, who want to make this country work better, have to \nwork within the system the way it is, not the way we wish it were.\n  As the example shows that I just gave, that is difficult. I follow \nthe law; someone comes to me and says: I want to give you some money. \nDo you have to disclose it? I say: No. The answer is accurate legally, \nbut I later have to go to that person and say: Well, is it OK if I \ndisclose this?\n  This is a bad system and it should be changed.\n  The criticism that has occurred as a result of campaign finance \ngenerally should cause us to do a better job. We at least should debate \nthe issues, and ultimately change the law. Should we have campaign \nceilings? Do you only spend so much money? Shouldn't we shorten the \nelection cycle somewhat? Can't we do better than what we have? Can't we \nmake it easier for people to register to vote?\n  I repeat, for the fourth time, the system is broken. It is up to us \nto save it before people are totally turned off by American politics.\n  I yield the floor and apologize to my friends for taking so much \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Before he leaves, I commend the distinguished minority \nwhip for speaking out on some of these excesses in campaign finance. He \nmentions his small State spending more than $20 million.\n  Mr. REID. If I can interrupt and ask the Senator to yield, in my \nState we only have two media markets, only two places to spend the \nmoney.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think the Senator makes an extremely important point. I \nrecall in the campaign with my friend and colleague, Senator Gordon \nSmith, to succeed former Senator Packwood--we are from a small State as \nwell, a little bigger than Nevada--Senator Smith and I, between us, \nwent through pretty close to $10 million in about 5 months.\n  Before the minority whip leaves the floor, I want to tell him I so \nappreciate him speaking out on this issue.\n  Certainly in Europe, for example, they are doing some of the things \nthe distinguished minority whip is talking about: shortening the \nelection cycle trying to generate interest in the elections because the \ncampaign is over a short period of time. I think we can do that in this \ncountry and require, for example, that the campaign funds be disclosed \nonline, which many of our colleagues have proposed on both sides of the \naisle.\n  I want the Senator to know, before he leaves the floor, I very much \nappreciate his leadership in speaking out on this campaign finance \nissue, because we saw in Oregon much of what the Senator saw in Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Oregon, I think one of the things \nthat is happening in Oregon is exemplary; that is, people can vote at \nhome. That was an experiment in the Senator's election. We were all \nworried it would not work out right, but it worked out fine. But that \nis something we need to do: Make it easier for people to vote.\n  We have a Presidential election that is heating up now. But you know, \npeople are talking about getting ready to run in the next election \nalready. This is not good for the system. As the Senator has said, we \nhave to do something to shorten the election cycle so people have more \ncondensed elections.\n  There are many different ways to communicate now. We have all this \ncable, and we have to look for a better way of doing it, and making it \nso money is not the predominant factor in the political race.\n  Mr. WYDEN. What the minority whip has essentially said is: We have \nwhat amounts to a permanent campaign. You have the election the first \nTuesday in November; people sleep in on Wednesday; and then the whole \nthing starts all over again on Thursday.\n  It is time, in effect, to turn off this treadmill and, heaven forbid, \ncome to the floor and talk about issues, such as prescription drugs, \nwhich I have tried to focus on for a number of months now. Many of our \ncolleagues, on both sides of the aisle, want to talk about that, and \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, and education. To the extent that \ncampaign finance dominates so much of the American political focus, it \ndetracts from those issues.\n  I commend the minority whip. I thank him for his excellent \npresentation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/06/senate-section/article/S1162-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING SENATOR BYRD\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, since the fall, I, and other Members of the \nSenate, have come to the floor of this body\n\n[[Page S1163]]\n\nto talk about the need for prescription drug coverage for older people \nunder Medicare.\n  As we look at this issue, I am especially pleased that Senator \nDaschle has been trying to reconcile the various legislative proposals \nthat have been introduced on this issue. I know colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have good ideas, as well.\n  I particularly commend my colleague, Senator Snowe of Maine. She and \nI have teamed up, on a bipartisan basis, for more than a year now. \nSenator Daschle is trying to bring these bills together and make it \npossible for us to go forward and address this vital issue for seniors \nin a bipartisan way.\n  What I am struck by, and what I want to touch on for a moment or two \nthis morning, is how significant the ramifications are with respect to \nthis prescription drug issue.\n  For example, one issue I have not talked about in connection with \nthis prescription drug matter is how it is directly and integrally tied \nto the matter of medical errors. Many of our colleagues were astounded \nat the end of last year when the Institute of Medicine produced a \nlandmark study--a truly landmark study--documenting the problem of \nmedical errors today in American health care.\n  These medical errors end up injuring many of our citizens, of course. \nThey cost vast amounts of money. What is striking is how many of them \nare tied to problems connected with prescriptions. For example, we know \nwhen a senior cannot afford to take their prescription or ends up only \ntaking two pills, when three of them are essentially recommended by \ntheir physician, that can constitute a breakdown in our health system \nor, in fact, what amounts to a medical error.\n  I think I have been coming to the floor of the Senate and talked on \nthe issue of prescription drugs something like 26 times in the last few \nmonths, for example, talking about instances where folks at home in \nOregon are actually breaking up their pills, their cholesterol-lowering \npills, because they cannot afford to take the entire pill. They believe \nif they break up the pill they can stretch it.\n  These are the kinds of medical tragedies we are seeing across this \ncountry. They are errors that we can correct if we go forward and \naddress this issue--prescription drug coverage--in a bipartisan way.\n  It seems unconscionable to think that, in a Nation as rich and good \nand powerful as ours, with all of these older people walking on an \neconomic tightrope, balancing their food costs against their fuel \ncosts, fuel costs against their medical bills, we can't go forward, as \nSenator Daschle has suggested, and reconcile these various bills that \nhave been introduced on this issue and enact a comprehensive program to \nhelp older people with their prescription drug bills, reduce the kinds \nof errors the Institute of Medicine found, and help a lot of families \nin our country.\n  I think there really are three principles we ought to zero in on in \nterms of trying to address this issue. First, I think there is general \nagreement now that this program be voluntary. I think many Members of \nCongress remember the ill-fated catastrophic care legislation, with a \nlot of older people believing at that time that they were being forced \nto pay for catastrophic benefits they were already receiving under \ntheir existing private health coverage.\n  Now I believe there already is a bipartisan consensus--Senator \nDaschle has touched on this a couple of times recently--that a \nprescription drug program ought to be voluntary for older people and \nvoluntary for the various providers, insurers, and pharmaceutical \nbenefit managers who might decide to participate in the program. I \nthink that minimizes the possibility that older people and families \nwill believe they are being coerced by Government to pay for something \nthey are already receiving. That voluntary aspect of such a program is \none area where there already is bipartisan agreement.\n  Second, I think there is a general belief that rather than inventing \nan entirely new structure for this program, it must be integrally tied \nto the existing Medicare program and, in particular, fit with an agenda \nfor Medicare reform.\n  What the legislation I have worked on--the Snowe-Wyden legislation--\ndoes is allow the administrative body--called the SPICE board, because \nour bill stands for Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity or \nSPICE--to contract with a variety of entities, insurance companies or \npharmaceutical benefit managers or nonprofit agencies--anybody who was \nauthorized under State law to administer a program. That way, we are \nnot creating a whole new structure for dealing with this program; we \nare building on Medicare as it exists today. At the same time, we are \ndoing something else which is critical; that is, adding more choice to \nthe Medicare program.\n  I personally think the effort to make this program voluntary, to \nbuild on existing Medicare coverage, which makes the benefits available \nto all seniors--universal coverage for those eligible for the program--\nand then, in addition to those principles, add new choices to the \nMedicare program. The reason that is so important is, providing choices \nis what is going to generate the competition that can help hold down \nthe prices of medicines for our older people.\n  We see so many seniors who can't afford their medicine. There is a \ngreat debate going on in the country now about whether it is the \nresearch costs of these drugs that have contributed to it. There are a \nvariety of reasons being offered for why older people cannot afford \ntheir prescription drugs. I am interested in debating those.\n  What I am most interested in is making sure older people have the \nkind of bargaining power necessary to drive down the costs of their \nmedicine. It seems to me they can get that bargaining power through an \napproach based on choice, such as we have, as Members of Congress, \nthrough the Federal Employees Health Benefits system. I am very hopeful \nthat that expanded array of choices will be a key invisible part of a \nbipartisan effort to go forward and address this issue in the Senate.\n  As we head to a period of town meetings and discussions with folks at \nhome, I know my colleagues are going to hear accounts from older people \nand families about horrible, tragic instances where older people cannot \nafford medicine and often end up getting sicker and needing much more \nexpensive care when they cannot get those essential prescriptions. I \nthink we have made a lot of progress in the last 2 or 3 months, with \nSenator Daschle having taken the lead, many colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle trying to bring the Senate together to find the \ncommon ground. I think we made a lot of progress.\n\n  I am hopeful that when the Senate reconvenes after this break to \nvisit with folks at home, when the Budget Committee goes forward--and \nSenator Snowe and I both sit on the Budget Committee--that with the \nbipartisan leadership of Senator Domenici and Senator Lautenberg, we \ncan get a generous earmark in the budget to cover prescription drugs \nand, in effect, continue the progress we have made towards getting a \nbipartisan prescription drug program enacted in this session of the \nSenate.\n  I have talked with Senator Lautenberg, ranking Democrat, Senator \nConrad, others who have been involved in this issue on our side, and \nwith Senator Domenici on the other side of the aisle. I think there is \na real openness to making sure there is a generous earmark in that \nbudget for a prescription drug program we would enact this year. After \nwe get over that hurdle, the challenge will be, as Senator Daschle has \noutlined, to reconcile the various approaches that have been offered. \nAs I mentioned, Senator Snowe and I have one we think makes sense, but \nwe do not believe we have the last word.\n  We think the last word ought to belong to the American people. The \nAmerican people are saying: We want you to deliver on this prescription \ndrug issue. We want it done this session. We do not want it to go \nthrough yet another campaign season as campaign fodder through the \nfall. We want you to get it done this year. Take the steps necessary to \nprovide older people the relief they need and deserve.\n  I look forward to being part of that effort in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Friday, the price of oil exceeded $30. \nIt was close to $31.26. That is high--not necessarily an all-time high, \nbut it is pretty close.\n  Back in 1973, when we had the Arab oil embargo, the prices were in \nthat neighborhood. A lot of people don't remember 1973, or the \nconsequences of the Arab oil embargo; but for those who do, it was a \nday of reckoning. It was at a time when you went to the gas station to \nfill up and you waited--not just a little while, but in some cases a \ncouple of hours. You stood in line because gasoline was short in this \ncountry.\n  There was an indignant response from the American public that never \nagain would we be so dependent on imported oil from other countries. As \na consequence, at that time, we formed the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. \nThe important thing to note is that in 1973 we were about 37 percent \ndependent on imported oil.\n  The idea of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was to have a supply of \noil on hand in case there was an interruption on our imports and we \ncould have that oil available for use to meet that emergency. That was \nin 1973.\n  Today, in the year 2000, we are approximately 56 percent dependent on \nimported oil. The Department of Energy has indicated by the year 2015 \nto 2020, we will probably be dependent to the tune of about 65 percent. \nNow, the question, of course, from the standpoint of our national \nenergy security interests, is: What are the implications of this? What \nare the ramifications of our increasing dependence on imported oil?\n  Clearly, the pricing structure is determined by the availability of \noil from the producing countries that have an excess capacity. That is \nprimarily in the Mideast. We have seen the efforts by both Iran and \nIraq to cut production. It is interesting that between those two \ncountries, they account for about 8 percent of the world's 75 million \nbarrels of daily oil production. But now we see Baghdad and Teheran in \na new position of power and influence to push their separate agendas in \nvarious ways.\n  We have OPEC. We know the significance of what that cartel controls. \nThey decided to have a meeting to address our emergency. The irony of \nthat is, that meeting is going to take place on March 27, which is \nhardly responding to our emergency.\n  As a matter of fact, our Secretary of Energy traveled extensively \nthrough the Mideast, meeting with the OPEC ministers, encouraging them \nto produce more oil so we will not see the price escalation that is \ncurrently occurring.\n  The results of that meeting were that we could expect some relief \nfrom Venezuela and Mexico. Both countries, of course, are outside of \nOPEC, but they wanted to remind us of something, and they communicated \na little message. This didn't come from the Secretary of Energy, but it \ncame from those who have had an opportunity to relate to both Mexico \nand Venezuela with regard to oil prices. On the manner in which we came \nand pled for more production, the Mexicans and the Venezuelans said: \nWhere were you when we were going broke selling our oil at $11 and $12? \nWere you giving us any assistance? Were you encouraging higher prices \nso we could maintain our economy? Certainly not. That was not the case \nat all.\n  Now when we see oil at $30, we go to Mexico and we go to Venezuela, \nand say: We need increased production. But they are reminding us that \nwe weren't at all concerned when the price was low, and when their \neconomy was in collapse, they couldn't count on the United States.\n  Those are the dangers of that kind of dependence.\n  Now we are seeing OPEC on March 27 perhaps responding to increased \noil production. But it is a little more complex than that because there \nare wheels within wheels in OPEC and relationships within \nrelationships.\n  Kuwait this weekend signaled its support for an agreement to boost \nproduction. Remember, it wasn't so long ago that we fought a war \nagainst Saddam Hussein. It was a war over oil to keep that country, \nKuwait, from being taken over by Saddam Hussein and Iraq.\n  We are now seeing within Iran and Iraq a group of price hawks, if you \nwill, within OPEC. They are going to do what is best for their \ncountry--not what is best for the United States. Teheran has said that \nthis is not the time to increase output because demand typically \ndeclines and higher production could lead to a quick collapse of \nprices. They are certainly looking out for their own best interests. \nIran, with 3.5 million barrels of daily production, is at about its \nmaximum, analysts say.\n  Since we are talking about bedfellows, let's talk about Algeria and \nLibya. They also have little reason in the short term to care about the \nworld's economy, or the United States economy specifically.\n  An interesting suggestion is in this report from the Wall Street \nJournal. If the United States wants to lower its price of gasoline, it \nshould reduce its taxes. That is their answer. They simply want to \nreduce our highway taxes and our other taxes and our State taxes that \nare associated with the price of oil. They say that if we really care \nabout higher prices, we should simply eliminate our taxes. That is an \ninteresting point of view.\n  Saudi Arabia, the world's largest producer of oil and an OPEC \nshareholder, has a special interest in keeping Iran happy now because \nrelations between those countries are at their best since the Iranian \nrevolution in 1979.\n\n  We see countries within OPEC working for their own best interests and \nnot necessarily what is good for the United States. The Saudis have \nbeen more responsive in the past, but not necessarily at this time \nbecause of their relationship with Iran.\n  OPEC producers want to continue the cartel's new-found unity because \nit funds the cash-flow. Wouldn't you rather produce more oil at a \nhigher price to meet your cash-flow than a lot of oil at lower prices? \nThat is just what they are doing.\n  We are seeing the role of OPEC and our neighbors in Mexico, \nVenezuela, and other countries evaluating the kind of response they are \ngoing to make to the United States at this time of emergency.\n  Over the last decade--most of it under the Clinton administration--\nproduction has decreased 17 percent and consumption has increased 14 \npercent. That is the reality of what has occurred in this country \nbecause we have not had an energy policy. We do not have an energy \npolicy on coal. We do not have an energy policy on natural gas.\n  We just saw the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission basically kill \nprospects for a gas line in the Northeast corridor by making it \neconomically unattractive for investors. We have an administration that \nsuggests hydro is nonrenewable. It wants to take dams down in the \nPacific Northwest. So we look at oil, we look at gas, we look at hydro, \nand we look at coal; there is no energy policy of any consequence.\n  Renewables are something we all support. But the reality is they \ncontribute less than 4 percent of the total energy consumed in this \ncountry, and the prospects, while encouraging, are not going to give us \nthe immediate relief we need.\n  As a consequence, we are experiencing a shock. The American public, \nwhen it drives down to the gas station to fill up the family Blazer or \nsports vehicle, may find itself subjected to a situation where it makes \na pretty good hole in a $100 bill if it takes a 40-gallon gas tank at \n$2 a gallon, or thereabouts.\n  We also have a couple of other considerations. We have the potential \nfor added inflation. Somebody made the interesting observation that if \nyou consider the cost and availability of labor, if you consider the \ncost of money--namely, interest rates that have been going up--and the \ncost of energy, you have the three factors for inflation. It has been \nestimated that for every $10 increase in the price of oil, inflation \nincreases one-half percent.\n\n[[Page S1165]]\n\n  It is a very real threat to our economy, a very real exposure to our \nconsumers out there, and I don't think we realize what is ahead. Not \ntoo many people know that every time they get in the airplane now, they \nare paying a $20 surcharge on that airline ticket, whether they go from \nhere to Seattle or from here to Baltimore. The Northeast corridor has \nfelt the impact of $2 a gallon for heating oil.\n  The question is, Is it going to get worse? The answer is, probably. \nWhen can we get relief? The question is whether we want to just depend \non the Mideast or whether we want to reduce our dependence on imported \noil.\n  There are many areas of this country over the overthrust belt of the \nRocky Mountains--Utah, Montana, North Dakota, New Mexico, Wyoming, and \nmy State of Alaska--where we have a tremendous abundance of oil and gas \nif given the opportunity to initiate exploration. This is not supported \nby President Clinton. I am glad to say it is supported by some of the \nRepublican candidates running for President.\n\n  The point is, what are we going to learn from history? Some say not \nmuch. If the Department of Energy predicts we will be 65-percent \ndependent in the years 2015 to 2020, should we not be doing something \nabout it now? We should be committed to a policy of reducing our \ndependence on imported energy sources by developing sources in the \nUnited States. My State of Alaska, in the ANWR area, has an estimated \n16 billion barrels. That would be an amount equal to what Saudi Arabia \nexports to America over an estimated 30-year timeframe.\n  We have areas in Louisiana, in Texas, and other coastal States that \nwant to have OCS activity, yet we have an administration that does not \nsupport that activity. That is, indeed, unfortunate.\n  The bottom line is, when are we going to wake up? When will we \nrelieve our dependency on imported oil? I might add, for those who \nthink imported oil is the answer from an environmental point of view, \nit is estimated that from the year 2015 to 2020, it will take more than \n30 tankers, 500,000 barrels each, docking every day in the United \nStates, to supply that increase; that would be 10,000 ships per year. \nIf that is not an environmental risk, I suggest anyone check the \nregistration of the ships because they will be foreign ships.\n  Finally, in 1990 we had 657 rigs working in this country; today we \nhave 153. In 1990, we had 405,000 jobs in the oil industry; today we \nhave 293,000, a 28-percent decline.\n  If one considers the makeup of our trade deficit, a trade deficit of \n$300 billion, $100 billion is the cost of imported oil.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize that it is time to move. It is \ntime to address opportunities to relieve our dependence on imported oil \nwith meaningful proposals on the basic premise that charity begins at \nhome.\n  I ask unanimous consent an article from the Wall Street Journal be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 6, 2000]\n\n            Oil Output May Be Hostage to Iran, Iraq Agendas\n\n                 (By Steve Liesman and Neil King, Jr.)\n\n       Iran and Iraq, the two major oil producers over which the \n     U.S. has the least sway, are playing a crucial role in \n     determining where oil prices are headed and are positioned to \n     affect the world economy.\n       Together, the two countries account for 8% of the world's \n     75 million barrels of daily oil production. But tight world \n     oil inventories, high prices and declining production \n     capacity in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     have given Baghdad and Tehran new power to push their \n     separate agendas, analysts say.\n       OPEC members will gather in three weeks to decide whether \n     to reverse the past year's production cutbacks, which reduced \n     world output by about five million barrels a day. Leading \n     producers support an increase as soon as April to cool prices \n     that recently topped $31 a barrel for the benchmark West \n     Texas Intermediate crude.\n       After initial reluctance, Kuwait during the weekend \n     signaled its support for an agreement by Saudi Arabia, \n     Venezuela and Mexico to boost production. Meanwhile, a strike \n     by oil workers in Venezuela withered quickly.\n       Iran still leads the group of price hawks within OPEC and \n     ``is one of the key stumbling blocks to coming out with a new \n     decision,'' said Raad Alkadiri, an analyst with the Petroleum \n     Finance Co., a Washington energy consultant.\n       Officially, Tehran says the second quarter is the wrong \n     time to increase output because demand typically declines and \n     higher production could lead to a quick collapse in prices. \n     But domestic economics are at least as much of a factor. \n     Unlike other major producers, which have extra capacity, \n     Iran's 3.5 million barrels of daily production is about its \n     maximum, analysts believe. Declining investments in its oil \n     fields, as well as continued U.S. sanctions on spare parts, \n     suggest production capacity may actually be declining. ``They \n     don't have more capacity to make up for the price drop,'' Mr. \n     Alkadiri said. Higher output world-wide--which could result \n     in lower prices--would do little for the Iranian treasury at \n     a time when payments on $11 billion of foreign debt begin to \n     peak.\n       Iran, which has the backing of Algeria and Libya, also has \n     little reason in the short term to care about the world \n     economy. Its oil minister recently said that oil-consuming \n     nations should lower energy taxes if they are concerned about \n     inflation from higher oil prices.\n       Saudi Arabia, the world's largest exporter and OPEC's clear \n     leader, has a special interest in keeping Iran happy. \n     Relations between the two countries are at their best since \n     the Iranian revolution of 1979. Their rapprochement last year \n     was the linchpin of OPEC's ability to cut back production. \n     ``The Saudis might have been more responsive more quickly [to \n     world oil markets] had it not been for this relationship with \n     Iran,'' said Amy Jaffe, senior energy analyst at the James A. \n     Baker III Institute for Public Policy in Houston.\n       OPEC producers want to continue the cartel's newfound \n     unity, fear a production free-for-all if OPEC cooperation \n     dissolves. Of course, oil-producing countries ultimately \n     could go ahead without Iran, as they have in the past. \n     Venezuela's oil minister is to visit Tehran in coming weeks \n     to lobby the government to accept higher production levels.\n       But the one million to two million barrels that OPEC is \n     considering putting back on the market could be quickly \n     removed if Iraq withheld its two million barrels a day of \n     exports. In November, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein pushed \n     oil prices up almost $1 a barrel in a single day when he \n     turned off his spigots to protest United Nations sanctions. \n     This time, ``with oil inventories very low, any interruption \n     in crude supply could cause prices to skyrocket,'' said Gary \n     Ross, president of PIRA Energy Group, a New York energy-\n     consulting company.\n       Whether Mr. Hussein would use the opportunity is a matter \n     of debate, but few dispute he has ample reason. Baghdad is \n     feuding with the U.S. about Iraq's need to import spare parts \n     for its oil industry. It could decide to use the tight oil \n     market, analysts say, to get Washington to ease up--or to \n     undermine U.N. sanctions altogether. ``We have seen him do \n     this before and we would not be surprised if he resorted to \n     the same tactics again,'' one U.S. official said.\n       Other OPEC producers' ability to make up for any Iraqi \n     cutbacks would be strained in the short term. Mr. Ross said \n     OPEC production capacity has fallen by about 500,000 barrels \n     a day during the past year. Venezuela in particular has let \n     its capacity dwindle as it diverted oil revenue to pay for \n     the extensive social agenda of President Hugo Chavez. In \n     time, however, OPEC countries should be able to make up any \n     shortfall with their four million to five million barrels a \n     day of excess capacity.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nour Energy Committee for the remarks. They are not new. He is not \nmaking a political statement. Chairman Murkowski is here because he has \nspoken out for years, virtually since this administration has been in \noffice, about discouraging--through so many rules, regulations, and \ntaxes--the domestic production of oil and gas.\n  He has warned we would be at this point. Here we are. The best way by \nfar to deal with this is to make sure we have more domestic production \nbecause it will help keep the prices down, and it will also help ease \nour balance of payments.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/06/senate-section/article/S1165-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1165-S1166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senators from the other side of the \naisle made comments about the Republican Presidential primary, taking \nsides in those primaries. I think it is somewhat odd they would want to \ndebate some of the issues here.\n  With regard to the concerns over contributions that are going to \nindependent groups--I believe New York was complained of--to run TV \nads, money was given by a small number of people who made large \ncontributions to run those ads. It was said that this is a \njustification for passing the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform \nlegislation.\n  My best understanding of what that bill is all about is that this \nwould not\n\n[[Page S1166]]\n\nbe covered. Fundamentally, the McCain-Feingold bill covered \ncontributions of larger sums of money to political parties but it did \nnot prevent people giving large contributions to an independent \nenvironmental group, an independent pro-choice group, or an independent \npro-life group so they could run ads during a campaign season and say: \nCandidate Jeff Sessions doesn't agree with our views, vote against him.\n  The problem I have had with campaign finance reform is it was not in \nthis McCain-Feingold bill. Why? Because this is America, these are \npolitical campaigns. Is the Senate going to pass a law that says \nindividual American citizens can't raise money and run an ad and \nexpress their view as to how the American public should or should not \nvote on an issue?\n  It is frustrating to have the moneys come in. I certainly believe \nthey ought to be disclosed. I was, I believe, a victim or target of one \nof these ads when I ran for the Senate 3 years ago. It came under the \nguise of an environmental group, but I know the money came mainly to \nbeat up on me.\n\n  How can anyone say that is wrong? How can we say a group cannot raise \nmoney and run ads during an election campaign season about issues? I am \ntroubled by that. I am frustrated not having a lot of money myself, \nfacing two candidates in my primary, both of whom spent over $1 million \nof their own money, most of it beating up on me. I was struggling with \n$1,000 maximum contributions per person to try to fight back. I was \nable to do so. Fortunately, the American people don't vote on who has \nthe most money. There are other issues. We have seen that time and time \nagain. They are pretty sophisticated in how to evaluate this.\n  I am troubled by this idea that we can, out of some sort of vision of \ngood government, blithely walk in and say candidates are not going to \nbe able to raise money; they are not going to be able to spend money to \nexpress their ideas during an election campaign.\n  When do we want to do it? They say just accept certain guidelines for \n6 months prior to the election. When do we want to speak out, if it \nisn't when people are getting ready to vote?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/06/senate-section/article/S1166-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1166-S1167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe all in government in \nWashington, DC, and in every State, need to ask ourselves: Do our \nlegislative acts, the public policies that we create, enhance or \nnurture our better instincts as a people? Are we conducting activities \nand passing laws that further benefit the better instincts of our \nNation as a people?\n  A payment to somebody or some institution is an incentive to them, \nfor whatever reason, that incentivizes and encourages that activity \nthat got them the payment.\n  A tax, likewise, is a penalty. It discourages, it penalizes, it \nhurts. It sanctions certain kinds of behavior. That is so basic as to \nbe without dispute. Frankly, our Founding Fathers knew this.\n  Professor Sindell, at Harvard, has written a book. I have not read \nthe book, but I read the article, I believe in the Atlantic Monthly, \nabout how in the first 150 years of our Nation's history, if you look \nat the debate that occurred in Congress, the Senate and the House, they \nwere constantly debating what to sign and what to veto and what bills \nto support; they were always debating this principle.\n  (Mr. KYL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, is this going to make people better? Is \nit going to encourage their best instincts or will it encourage poor \ninstincts? Will it encourage bad behavior? If they vote for or against \nbills on that basis, will it make us better people? That is an \nimportant issue. We ought to think about it.\n  We encourage a lot of activities in America through our tax policies. \nWe encourage people to give to charitable institutions, churches, and \nschools by making those contributions tax deductible.\n  We help families raise their children by providing a deduction or a \nchild tax credit, which we passed a few years ago.\n  We encourage savings by making the interest on individual retirement \naccounts tax free.\n  I have introduced a bill to make the interest that accrues on savings \nfor prepaid college tuition plans tax free because we ought to \nencourage saving for education and have families and children invest in \ntheir education.\n  In many States--Kentucky, for example--the average contribution to \nthose plans is $47 per month. They are middle-income people who care \nabout their children's education. They are saving for their children's \neducation, and we are taxing them on the interest that accrues on that \nsavings for college education.\n  In my view, that is bad public policy. We discourage and penalize \nother activities we feel we can do without but we do not want to \nprohibit entirely. We tax cigarettes at a very high rate. We know that \ntobacco is bad for our health. It is not a good thing to do, and we \nhave pretty high taxes, higher taxes every year it seems, and rightly \nso.\n  We tax gasoline. We can talk about the cost of gasoline. Last year in \nAlabama, gasoline was under $1 a gallon in a lot of places. Forty \npercent of the cost of that gallon of gasoline was State and Federal \ntax because we do not want people to use more than they need, we want \nto keep supplies strong. We do not want to import anymore than we have \nto, and we want to reduce pollution.\n  There are other taxes and penalties on people who pollute. That is \none of the policies.\n  We have higher taxes on alcohol than we do a lot of other products.\n  We do not tax, for example, prescription drugs--most States do not. \nThere is sales tax on all kinds of products that are sold in our \ngrocery stores, but we do not tax prescription drugs because we know \npeople need those drugs, and we do not want to penalize that.\n  Another thing we tax which I must add to that list is marriage. We \nare taxing and penalizing marriage to an extraordinary degree.\n  At church Sunday in Alabama--it was a pleasure to get back home--my \nminister told a story about an old man who had never been to town. His \ngrandchildren said: Grandpa, you need to go to town. He finally agreed. \nHe had never seen a zoo, so they wanted to take him to a zoo. They took \nhim to a zoo, and he came upon a giraffe. He stood there and just \nlooked at that giraffe. He walked around that giraffe, he studied that \ngiraffe, and he spent 2 hours looking at that giraffe. He finally said: \nI still don't believe it.\n  We are at that point with the marriage penalty. Some people do not \nbelieve it is happening, that we are taxing marriage. It is very real. \nTalk to young people all over America today and ask them about what is \ngoing to happen to their taxes when two of them, particularly if both \nare working, are married. It costs them a lot of money.\n  We have to end this. We need to end this tax penalty. The President \nsaid he was for it. The proposal he made in his State of the Union \nAddress and subsequently is insignificant in meeting that challenge, \nbut it is an admission that he believes there is a problem.\n\n  Let's look at it. Soon we are going to be seeing legislation in this \nbody to deal with it. I hope we will study it carefully and end this \ngovernmental policy of penalizing and discouraging marriage. That is \nwrong. We need to encourage marriage. We do not need to penalize \nsingleness, but they ought not have a financial incentive to remain \nsingle. We should not have public policy that favors singleness over \nmarriage. We should have a fair policy that does not favor one over the \nother.\n  I have a young staff member who married recently. He had been dating \nhis fiancee for over four years and they finally married. He tells me \nthey will pay over $1,000 a year more having married. They married in \nJuly of last year, and they have to pay the marriage tax for the whole \nyear. It is $1,000. That is roughly $100 a month out of their budget \nsimply because they quit being engaged and were married. That is not \nright. That is wrongheaded. We do not need to continue this.\n  A good friend of mine, a fine person, unfortunately went through a \ndivorce. She divorced in January a year ago. She told me that had they \ndivorced in December, it would have saved them $1,600 on their tax \nbill. That is approximately $130 a month. They gave up that much \nbecause they did not divorce\n\n[[Page S1167]]\n\nearlier. Can you imagine a governmental public policy that provides a \nsubsidy, an incentive, a bribe almost, to divorce? That is wrong. We do \nnot need to do this any longer. I believe in this strongly.\n  This is a disadvantage too often to women. Women are just now \nbreaking through the glass ceiling and making higher incomes. Many on \nthe other side of the aisle and the President say: We do not want to \ndeal with this problem of higher income people; we only want to have a \nmarriage penalty elimination for the lowest income people.\n  What is wrong with two people working and doing modestly well today? \nHere is an example. Heather's income is $33,000. Her husband Brad's \nincome is $37,000. Their total income is $70,000. It is the American \ndream, to do well and make those kinds of incomes. That is not rich. \nYou cannot buy a house, buy a car, and educate your children well if \nyou are not making in that range. It is harder and harder to do those \nthings if you make less than that. Everybody knows that. Those are \nsalaries one wants to see more and more Americans achieve.\n  Because they are married, they may take a standard deduction of \n$7,100, as well as two personal exemptions of $2,700. This leaves them \nwith a taxable income of $57,500. If they were cohabitating, living \noutside marriage, Heather and Brad could each take a standard deduction \nof $4,200. Heather's taxable income would be $26,000; Brad's would be \n$30,000. Their combined taxable income would be $56,000. Because they \nare married, Heather and Brad must pay $1,400 more than if they were \ncohabitating. To them, it means approximately a $40-a-month charge.\n  That is a policy we should end. I believe this Congress is committed \nto it.\n  We are going to continue to proceed to work through the fine details \nof all these tax regulations and the thousands and thousands of tax \npages to make sure we are doing it right and fair. But I do not think a \ncouple making $80,000 or $90,000 or $100,000 ought to be denied equity. \nWhy should they be taxed more than two single individuals making \n$100,000 collectively? They do not have to pay the extra taxes.\n  We are dealing with an issue whose time has come. The marriage \npenalty must end. We are not against singleness. I do not think there \nshould be any battle between people who are single, who think it is \nsome sort of tax advantage, and those who are married. We do not \nbelieve there should be any tax advantage. We are simply trying to \nlevel the playing field. This is a move toward equity and fairness at \nits basic level. It is a move to encourage good public policy, good \nactivities, such as marriage and raising a family, and not taxing them. \nIt sets a goal for us that we ought to pursue.\n  We ought to quit discouraging marriage, quit taxing and penalizing \nit, and allow people to make their choices in this country as they \nchoose without having the tax man sticking his nose in their financial \nand personal matters.\n  I thank the Chair for this time. I am glad to see the Senator from \nWyoming here. I appreciate his leadership. I know the Presiding Officer \nhas been a champion in eliminating a lot of inequities in the Tax Code. \nI thank him for his leadership in that regard.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the remarks of the \nSenator from Alabama. We have lots of choices when we talk about tax \nrelief, but this is one choice that is not only good for our country \neconomically but certainly as a fairness issue is one that each of us, \nI think, supports.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/06/senate-section/article/S1167-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1167-S1169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE REPUBLICAN AGENDA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, there are lots of things we can talk about \nand, indeed, should talk about. The Senator from Alaska talked about \nthe problem of fuel, the problem of petroleum costs. That is a very \nreal issue for us, of course, and one we need to deal with. We talk \nabout the marriage tax penalty. There are all kinds of things we must \ntalk about.\n  There are some basic issues--and I have talked about them before--\nthat I believe strongly in, issues that clearly are the responsibility \nof this body and the responsibility of the Federal Government to deal \nwith. Frankly, sometimes it is very difficult to do that.\n  Unfortunately, I suspect that Presidential election years make it \neven harder than usual to do some of the things that clearly need to be \ndone. One of the reasons, of course, is that there is a great tendency \nto talk about the things that can be used as campaign issues as opposed \nto seeking solutions. Unfortunately, that does happen.\n  The majority party, this side of the aisle, does have an agenda. I \nthink we have a strong agenda that reflects, at least in my State, the \nmajority of voters. I have been back home in my State every weekend \nthis year. We talk about those issues all the time.\n  I am hopeful we can focus on those issues. I know sometimes it is \ndifficult to get those issues on the floor. It is difficult to get them \nout and to find some sort of solution. I believe we have a \nresponsibility to do that. I think we have a responsibility to do that \nas the majority party.\n  There are times, of course, when, if we could pass something, the \nPresident would veto it. That is his choice. Let him veto it. I think \nit is our responsibility to bring those issues forward and to resolve \nthem in a way that best fits our philosophy of what we think is good \nfor this country.\n  Certainly, there are a number of things that are very high on the \nagenda, such as the budget, such as the spending level and for what, in \nfact, the taxes are spent. Social Security, I am sure, is an issue that \nalmost everyone is concerned about. Frankly, the younger you are, the \nmore concerned about it you ought to be.\n  Another issue is doing something about the debt that we still have, a \nsubstantial debt that we have incurred over the last number of years \nand now, apparently, are expecting somebody else to pay. Another issue \nis tax relief.\n  These are the things we really ought to focus on; and I wish we \nwould.\n  We talk about the budget. It seems to me, there is probably nothing \nmore important, in terms of gauging where we go with the Federal \nGovernment, than the budget, because the budget, after all, is sort of \nthe limitation as to where we go. The limitation is the thing that \ncauses us to have to establish spending priorities. Of course, if you \nhad an endless amount of money, you would not need to have priorities; \nyou would just spend money. I do not think many people would want to do \nthat; certainly, most taxpayers would not.\n  In the budget we have to find an amount. I think one of the things we \nare dedicated to, as Republicans, and, hopefully, all of us in the \nSenate this year, is to complete the budget and, subsequently, the \nappropriations, at the time set forth in the law and the time set forth \nin our operation here.\n  Last year, for example, we waited too long. We were here at the very \nend of the session trying to complete the budget. Of course, there is \nalways controversy at the end of the session. There are always \ndecisions to be made when you are at the end of the session.\n  It is even more difficult at the end of a session because the \nadministration--particularly with this President--has used the end of \nthe session as a very effective leveraging tool for the President to \nget what he wants; otherwise, he threatens to shut down the Government. \nEven though the President shut the Government down in the last \nexperience, the Congress got the blame for doing that.\n  We need to get this thing done. We need to get it done before the \nfirst of September, and certainly before the end of September which is \nthe end of the fiscal year.\n  We need to set the amounts so that they somewhat control growth. If \nyou believe, as many of us do, that there ought to be some limitation \nto the size of the Federal Government, it ought to be constitutionally \nlimited to those things that the Constitution provides. If you believe \nthat most of the governing ought to take place at the local level, \ncloser to the people, in the States and in the counties, then there \nought to be some limit in growth.\n  Last year, unfortunately--and I voted against the bill--we ended up \nwith something like 7\\1/2\\ or 8 percent growth in the budget--too much, \nI think. That is too much. Hopefully, we can hold it this year to no \nmore than the growth due to inflation.\n\n  Of course, there are new programs that have to be funded. But there \nalso ought to be a termination to some of\n\n[[Page S1168]]\n\nthe programs that are there. It is very difficult to do that.\n  Last year, we had sort of fancy footwork which allowed us to spend \nmore than it really seemed as if we were spending. But now, finally, of \ncourse, it comes out that we spent more.\n  In fairness, we also did some good things last year. For the second \ntime in about 25 years we balanced the budget in operational dollars. \nFor the second time in about 40 years, we did not spend Social Security \nmoney for the operations of Government. That is good. That is very \ngood. Those are two things we ought to continue to do.\n  One of the other things that ought to happen--there is a good \nopportunity this year--is to have a biennial budget so that, as is the \ncase with most States, we can deal with the budget every other year, \nwhich then gives us a year to have oversight. One of the most important \nthings that Congress ought to have is oversight of the agencies, \noversight of the regulations, so that we can ensure that what we have \ndone, what we have passed, what we have put into law, is, indeed, \nworking; in fact, as the money is being spent, the accountability is \nthere, and so on. We could do that. Hopefully we will be able to do \nthat.\n  It seems to me, the budget is key to managing the Government and is \nsomething we ought to be doing. Of course, the spending ought to be \nwithin the budget. We spend something like $1.7 trillion in our \nbudget--almost an incomprehensible amount of money. Last year I think \n$586 billion of that was in discretionary spending. The rest of it was \nalready set.\n  This year we are dealing with the question of, if it was $586 billion \nlast time, how much do we spend? Do we spend $600 billion? Do we spend \n$630 billion?\n  It is hard. I think it is more difficult when you have the idea of a \nsurplus than it is when you have the idea of a deficit. When you have a \nsurplus, everybody has ideas as to where we ought to spend all that \nextra money. But it isn't extra money. It belongs to the taxpayers. \nWhen we have done those things we think are essential for good \nGovernment, then the surplus money ought to be used in other ways.\n  It is my belief, and the belief of many, that we ought to limit the \nsize of Government, we ought to limit the number of things we fund, and \nwe need to have better Government. Certainly, we can do that. We can do \nthat in our appropriations.\n  Social Security. Almost everyone talks about Social Security. Almost \neveryone would agree that Social Security is one of the most important \nissues that we face. Social Security, of course, is not a retirement \nprogram. It is a supplement, but it is very important. When I talk, \nparticularly to young people, most of them say: I will never see any \nbenefits. They are probably right. Unless there are some changes, the \nprogram will not sustain itself.\n\n  We have seen so many demographic changes. It started out at a time \nwhen almost 20 people were working for every one who was drawing \nbenefits. Now it is about three. It will soon be two. Of course, it \nwill be almost impossible then to provide those kinds of benefits over \ntime. What do we do? We have to make some changes, pretty clearly.\n  There are several options. One is to increase taxes. Social Security \ntaxes are the highest taxes many people pay, about 12.5 percent of \ntheir earnings when we take into account what the employer pays--a very \nhigh percentage. So that is not a very popular option. We could reduce \nbenefits. Benefits are not especially high now. That is not really a \nvery attractive option either. So the third option is to increase the \nreturn on the money that is in the Social Security trust fund. There \nare billions of dollars there, of course. Under the law they can only \nbe invested in Government securities. So they bring a relatively small \nreturn. And up until now, they haven't even done that because they have \nbeen replacing debt for other purposes.\n  We have a plan that ought to be considered and put into place. The \nadministration keeps talking about saving Social Security but doesn't \nhave any plan to do so. I think there is a plan out there. There is a \nbill of which I am a cosponsor, along with others, that would, in fact, \nset up individual accounts and would take at least a portion, whatever \nportion we could decide upon, and that account would belong to you or \nto me. It would be there to be invested in your behalf. It could be \ninvested in equities; it could be invested in bonds. The return would \nbe substantially higher than it is now. Over a period of 40, 50 years, \nthat would bring a really good return and fund the program.\n  Furthermore, if one was unfortunate enough not to use the program, \npassed away before they had the chance to get the benefits, it would \nbelong to them. It would be part of their estate. I think that is a \nreasonable way to do it, one we ought to fully consider.\n  The other issue with which we need to deal, with regard to the budget \nand money, is the debt. We still have a substantial amount of debt. \nPart of it is privately held and part is held by Social Security \ndollars; part of it is publicly held. We talk all the time about \nreducing the debt. We did, indeed, last year put the Social Security \nmoney over there and replace publicly held debt. The fact is, when that \nis to be used for benefits, the taxpayers at that time will still have \nto bail out that money so it can be used in the trust funds.\n  What we would like to do is, assuming we have paid what is \nsubstantially needed for programs, set aside Social Security money. If \nthere is still some surplus there, I think we ought to dedicate a \nportion of that to paying off the debt and do it in a systematic way, \nnot just say, well, we will pay it off when we get some money, \nwhatever, but, in fact, say, we are going to set aside enough money \neach year, as you would on a mortgage on your home, and say, in 15 \nyears we will pay off this $3 trillion of debt or whatever it happens \nto be, publicly owned debt. Each year the payment on that will be in \nthe budget. It will be there. It will automatically be spent for that \npurpose. And over a period of time we would do away with that debt that \nis owned by the public and earns a substantial amount of interest. I \nthink a couple of years ago we paid about $380 billion a year on \ninterest out of this budget of ours to do that. I think that is one of \nthe things we clearly could do.\n\n  Finally, of course, assuming there is still some left, we could, as \nthe Senator from Alabama has said, do something about returning these \nexcesses to the taxpayers who paid them in in the first place and \ncertainly deserve to have them. Obviously, there are different ideas \nabout how that is done, whether it is marriage penalty, estate tax, \nwhether it is an across-the-board tax. The fact is, that money should \ngo back to the people who paid it in. It is really bad policy to keep \nextra money in Washington because it will be spent. Once we have met \nour obligations, hopefully that can be returned.\n  These are the things that are clearly before us. There are many other \nitems, of course, but these are the ones we have to do. These are the \nones the American people want us to do. These are the ones people in \nWyoming talk about when I am there.\n  I have to mention one other area they talk about that is a not in \nthis category, but it has to do with management of public lands. It has \nto do with the so-called land legacy this administration has been \nworking on for some time. Apparently the President, wanting to leave \nsome kind of a Teddy Roosevelt legacy, wants to change the legacy he \nhas before he leaves in several months, to have it be some sort of a \nsetting aside of public resources for singular uses. That doesn't mean \na lot to people who live in States where Federal lands are not a big \nissue. My State of Wyoming is 50 percent owned by the Federal \nGovernment; Nevada is 85 percent owned by the Federal Government, and \nit varies in between.\n  The things that happen in those States economically and other ways \nare affected greatly by the management of those lands. We have seen a \nnumber of designs to set aside lands for uses different than have been \nin the law. The law now provides there will be wilderness set aside, \nor, indeed, that they be set aside for multiple use, which means for \nrecreation, for hunting, for scenery, for grazing, for minerals, for \nall kinds of things under the multiple use concept.\n  When that is not available, then the economies of our States suffer \ngreatly, as do the long-term upkeep and availability and accessibility \nof those lands\n\n[[Page S1169]]\n\nfor Americans. I happen to be chair of the National Park Subcommittee. \nThe purpose of a park is to maintain resources and to provide an \nopportunity for its owners, the American people, to enjoy it. Now we \nfind ourselves faced with a number of things being proposed that would \nlimit access, limit the enjoyment of these lands: 40-million acres \nroadless in the national parks, for example, which has never been fully \nexplained as to what it means. The Antiquities Act is being used to set \naside lands only by action of the President. The Congress is not \ninvolved. BLM has set out a roadless plan without details; nobody knows \nexactly what that means. Does it mean you are not accessible to it, \nthat there are no roads to get to it? Forest regulation--instead of \nhaving multiple uses, one of the concepts of the plan goes totally to \necology. No one knows exactly what that means.\n  We have proposals from the administration to put billions of dollars, \nover a $1 billion each year, directly to purchase more Federal land. In \nthe West, we think there is a substantial amount now.\n\n  We have a lot of things to do. I am confident we will get to them. I \nhope we do. I think we should. There is a philosophy, of course, that \nis different among Members of the Senate as to the role of the Federal \nGovernment, as to the size of the Federal Government, as to whether or \nnot in an area of education, for example, there is flexibility to send \nthe money, if you are going to support education, to the States and let \nthem decide how it is used, or do you have the Federal Government \nbureaucracy in Washington tell people how it should be used. Frankly, \nwhether it is schools or whether it is health care, whether it is \nhighways, whatever, the needs in Wyoming are quite different than they \nare in New York and Pennsylvania. The school district in Meeteetse, WY \nhas different needs than Pittsburgh. We ought to be able to recognize \nthat and allow local people to be able to do that.\n  That is one of the big differences we have on this floor. The \nminority whip this morning talked about coming together to do things, a \nperfectly great idea. But as long as there is opposition to those \nconcepts of letting States and counties participate, then it is very \ndifficult to do that.\n  I am hopeful we will look forward. I am sure we will; that is the \nsystem. This is a great system. There are weaknesses and complaints, of \ncourse. But after all, this is the best system in the world.

Madam President, there are a number of misconceptions \nabout the upcoming vote in the Senate to grant China permanent normal \ntrading relations or, as we often call it, PNTR. I will refer to it as \nnormal trading relations.\n  Today, as chairman of the International Trade Subcommittee, and to \ninform my colleagues about the importance of this issue because I favor \nnormal trading relations with China, I want to address two \nmisunderstandings regarding China.\n  The first misconception is that a vote by the Senate on normal \ntrading relations is a vote to admit China to the World Trade \nOrganization. We do not have anything to do with China being in the \nWorld Trade Organization. It is a wrong misconception. Also, there is a \nbelief if we do not approve PNTR, China will not be able to join the \nWorld Trade Organization. As a member of the World Trade Organization, \nwe can say something about it through our representative there, but in \nthe Senate our vote on PNTR will not affect China's ability to join the \nWTO.\n  I want to tell my colleagues what will be consequence of not \napproving permanent normal trading relations with China. The only thing \nthat will happen if we vote against permanent normal trading relations \nwith China is that American farmers and all of our businesses will miss \nout on lower tariff rates and the other market-access concessions China \nwill grant to farmers and businesses in other countries.\n  Remember, China is not just a big chunk of land; China is 20 percent \nof the world's population. When we talk about doing business with \nChina, we are not talking about doing business in East Podunk; we are \ntalking about doing business with 20 percent of the people of this \nEarth.\n  Let me explain what the PNTR vote is really about. Congress has \nplaced conditions on our trade with China. These stipulations are not \nconsistent with the core World Trade Organization obligations for \nmember countries to grant each other unconditional, most-favored-nation \ntreatment. If we do not grant permanent normal trading relations with \nChina, thus removing the Jackson-Vanik restrictions, and if, at the \nsame time, China eventually becomes a World Trade Organization member--\nand this is going to happen sooner or later--then the World Trade \nOrganization rules will require the United States to opt out of the \ntariff and market access concessions we helped negotiate.\n  It does not hurt China, it does not hurt any of the other 137 members \nof the World Trade Organization, but it is going to help us because \nthese other countries will get market access. Other countries will gain \nand build market share in China while the United States is sitting on \nthe sidelines. This will be at the expense of the American soybean \nfarmers, at the expense of the American pork producers, at the expense \nof the American insurance companies, and other financial service \nproviders. You can list any segment of the American economy. I happen \nto list those that are very much related to the economy of my State. In \nthe process, China--this country with 20 percent of the world's \npopulation--will not be hurt one bit, either.\n\n  Let's make it clear. Let's say somehow the Congress decides we do not \nwant permanent normal trading relations with China, and China joins the \nWorld Trade Organization. China gets the benefit of that. All the other \ncountries get the benefit of that. Let's say we decide to not complete \nthe agreement with China. China is not going to be hurt one bit. In \nfact, hundreds of millions of Chinese consumers--20 percent of the \nworld's population--will reap the benefits of free trade. Our farmers \nand businesses will surely suffer. This is not fair.\n  Since I am a Republican, I would like to quote a Democrat. Within the \nlast week, before the Senate Agriculture Committee, Secretary of \nAgriculture Glickman said something very interesting. He said that for \na couple decades we have been letting almost anything from China they \nwant to export come into our country, with few restrictions. Yes, this \nopen access has certainly helped our consumers. When we talk about the \ndifficulty of getting our goods into China, we have to deal with state \ntrading organizations, and with a lot of nontariff trade barriers. So \nit is quite obvious this agreement with China would be a win-win \nsituation for the United States of America.\n  That is Secretary of Agriculture Glickman speaking not only about \nagriculture but speaking about all the\n\n[[Page S1170]]\n\nnonagricultural manufacturing products and services that we can send to \nthat country as a result of this agreement.\n  Remember, the first misconception I cited is that some believe if \nChina does not get permanent normal trading relations, that it is going \nto keep China from joining the World Trade Organization. But if China \ndoes get in the World Trade Organization, she will have a fairly free \ntrade relationship with 137 other countries. And then we will not have \nthat same agreement with China. It will be a lose-lose situation for \nAmerica.\n  The second misconception I want to address is that even if China does \nget into the World Trade Organization, it will not mean that much right \naway for American manufacturers and American agriculture.\n  That is something that could not be further from the truth because we \nare going to reap immediate benefits from China having normal trading \nrelations with us. As well, with China being a member of the World \nTrade Organization, we will benefit from that relationship with China. \nBecause we are also in the WTO, we will benefit from what happens with \nthe increased trade that results from that.\n  The fact is, China is not only a large economy, it also happens to be \na very dynamic economy. Because they have made economic reforms there, \nChina's leaders have sparked an economic renewal that has led to growth \nrates of 7 to 10 percent every year of the last decade, easily dwarfing \nthe rates of our own superheated economy in the United States.\n  China's economy has grown 7 to 10 percent. Quite frankly, I do not \nknow whether they want to admit this, but China's economy has to grow \nat least 5 percent for them to make room for all the young people \ncoming into the workforce.\n  Any way you look at it--the 5 percent they have to have to keep \npeople employed or the 7 to 10 percent they have had in recent years--\nthere is a lot of new prosperity in China. As a consequence of this, \nChina is buying a great deal of everything, especially agriculture \nproducts.\n  But because about one-third of China's economic activity is generated \nand controlled by state-owned enterprises, China often manipulates its \nmarkets in a way that harms its trading partners. This agreement we \nhave with China takes care of this problem. I would like to give you an \nexample. It is one that is well known to the soybean farmers of my own \nState of Iowa.\n\n  In 1992, China soybean oil consumption shot up from about 750,000 \nmetric tons to 1.7 million metric tons. Keeping pace with this \nincreased new demand, soybean oil imports also more than doubled.\n  In order to keep up with surging domestic demand, China imported more \nsoybeans and soybean meal, much of it from the United States, and, in \nfact, much of it from my State of Iowa--the leading producer of \nsoybeans of the 50 States.\n  When China's soybean imports hit their peak in 1997, soybean meal in \nthe United States was trading at an average base price of about $240 \nper ton. This meant for a while farmers were getting a lot better price \nthan they are now for soybeans, sometimes close to $7 per bushel. \nEveryone was better off. China's consumers got what they wanted. \nAmerican soybean growers prospered. Of course, this is the way trade is \nsupposed to work.\n  But suddenly, Chinese state-run trading companies arbitrarily shut \noff imports of soybeans. Soybean meal that was selling in 1997 for $240 \nper ton in the United States plummeted to $125 per ton by January 1999. \nSoybeans selling for over $7 per bushel in 1997, fell to just over $4 \nper bushel by last summer.\n  So you can imagine what happened on the farm with the loss of that \nincome. Combined with other factors, farmers were unable to pay their \nbills. Many farmers who were considered by their bankers to be well off \nare struggling to recover. In trade, what happens in China does make a \ndifference in the United States of America, at least with our economy.\n  This shows what occurs when protectionism, when trade barriers, when \ntariffs, and when government-run controls take the place of the free \nmarket. Trade is distorted. Consumers abroad have less choice. And \nAmerican family farmers suffer. It also demonstrates how important \nChina's entry into the World Trade Organization is for America's \nfarmers.\n  With a new bilateral market access agreement in place, and with \nmeaningful protocol agreements that should soon be in place, China will \nnot be able to use straight state trading enterprises to arbitrarily \nrestrict and manipulate agriculture trade, and trade in any product, \nfor that matter.\n  Once China has entered the World Trade Organization, they will have \nto do away with those organizations that violate the principles of a \nfree market economy because they will have to in order to get into the \nWorld Trade Organization. For the first time in history, China would be \nbound by enforceable international trade rules.\n\n  When we trade with other countries, we export more than farm \nequipment, soybeans, computer chips, insurance, banking, a lot of \nservices. We export part of our society and what our society stands \nfor, the American values and ideals that can be communicated sometimes \nin commerce, that can never be communicated by American political \nleaders and by American diplomats. I think the exporting of our values \nand our ideals is very good. This is surely good for the World Trade \nOrganization. It is good for China. It is good for the United States. I \nbelieve it is part of the process of keeping the peace.\n  We seldom get a real chance in Congress to make this a better and \nsafer world in a very large way without expending American blood and \ndeploying American military might around the world. This is one of \nthose rare opportunities, through commerce and through a very peaceful \napproach, to do something for peace around the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting permanent normal \ntrading relations with China.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise in support of the \namendment offered by Senator Boxer to S. 1134 that would help to \nprotect children from exposure to pesticides used in schools. In the \nwake of tragic incidents in schools across the nation, many people now \nthink of school safety in terms of enhanced protection from violent \ncrime. My colleague's amendment addresses a less visible aspect of \nschool safety: the need to reduce environmental health hazards from \npesticides.\n  Because of their smaller size, greater intake of food and air \nrelative to body weight, recreational environment, and developing \nsystems, children are at higher risk from pesticide exposure than \nadults. Numerous studies show\n\n[[Page S1171]]\n\nthat pesticides can pose health risks to children, such as impaired \ncognitive skills, fatigue, burns, elevated rates of childhood leukemia, \nsoft tissue sarcoma, and brain cancer. Pesticides can be absorbed from \nexposure through skin contact, inhalation, or ingestion. One recent \nstudy showed that after a single broadcast use of chlorpyrifos, a \npesticide commonly used in schools, the chemical remained on children's \ntoys and hard surfaces for two weeks, resulting in exposure 21-119 \ntimes above the current recommended safe dose.\n  Last year, I requested that the General Accounting Office review the \nfederal requirements that govern the use of pesticides in schools and \nthe existence of data on the use and incidences of illnesses related to \nexposure. In January when I released the GAO report, ``Use, Effects, \nand Alternatives to Pesticides in Schools,'' I noted that its results \nunderscore the lack of both comprehensive information about the amount \nof pesticides used in our nation's schools, and data on whether \npesticide exposure is adversely affecting our children's health.\n  In January, I called on Administrator Browner to task her agency to \ntake immediate steps to protect children from exposure to pesticides in \nschools, including providing guidance to applicators and school \ndistricts on the relative exposures of different application methods, \ntaking action to appropriately label pesticides that are being used in \nschool environments, and consider conducting a full-scale statistical \nsurvey on the use of pesticides in schools to determine whether risks \nare posed to children by pesticides through cumulative exposure.\n  Ultimately, these measures all would lead to better information about \nthe risks of pesticide exposure to children. However, we also need to \nact now to help parents protect their children in the interim. In 1999, \nConnecticut passed a bill requiring schools to create registries of \nparents who wish to be informed prior to school use of pesticides. \nSeveral other states have taken similar action. However, parents in \nmany states still do not have access to information about when and what \npesticides are being used in their children's schools. Senator Boxer's \namendment would remedy this problem by ensuring that all parents \nreceive advance notification before toxic pesticides are applied on \nschool or day care center grounds.\n  In addition to supporting Senator Boxer's notification amendment, I \nam a cosponsor of Senator Torricelli's School Environment Protection \nAct of 1999, or SEPA, which is currently before the Agriculture \nCommittee. In addition to recognizing the need for parental \nnotification before pesticides are used in schools, SEPA would create a \nnational requirement that when pesticides are used in schools, only the \nsafest methods are followed in order to protect children. I recently \nvisited a school system in Cheshire, Connecticut, that has very \nsuccessfully implemented these methods, known as Integrated Pest \nManagement, or IPM. The Cheshire school system works closely with local \ncontractors, who carry out monthly visual inspections of the schools, \nuse least toxic pesticides when required, and apply them after hours \nand after contacting the school nurse. SEPA would require that, like \nthe Cheshire schools, schools nationwide ensure that pesticides are \napplied safely and only when alternatives have failed.\n  I am pleased to be able to support Senator Boxer today in her effort \nto help parents protect their children by reducing their exposure to \npotentially harmful pesticides. And I hope that there will be further \nopportunities to discuss the important issue of decreasing children's \nexposure to pesticides in schools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/06/senate-section/article/S1171-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING MR.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \n``Conservation and Stewardship Act,'' which is cosponsored by Senators \nHollings, Baucus, Kerry, Boxer, Lieberman, Bryan, Akaka, Leahy, and \nSarbanes. This comprehensive bill will provide permanent and dedicated \nfunding from Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas revenues to be used \nfor the Land and Water Conservation Fund and many other important \nconservation programs, including coastal, wildlife habitat, endangered \nspecies, historic preservation, State and local park and open space \npreservation, forestry and farmland conservation, and youth \nconservation corps programs. While the bill will ensure much-needed \nfunding for many Federal conservation programs, most of the programs \nincluded in the bill will assist States, counties, or cities to \nimplement local conservation and recreation projects. In addition, this \nlegislation will, for the first time, fully fund the Payments In Lieu \nof Taxes (PILT) program, which provides payments to local governments \nfor the loss of tax revenues resulting from Federal lands in their \njurisdiction.\n  In developing this bill, I have tried to include a variety of \nprograms to ensure that the benefits from OCS revenues--which are a \nfederal resource belonging to all Americans--are equitably distributed \nthroughout the country. While some programs in the bill are of specific \ninterest to coastal States, others will have more application in \ninterior areas; some programs in the bill provide funding for large \ncities and urban areas, while others are designed to assist rural \ncommunities. If we are to succeed in passing a comprehensive \nconservation bill this year, the benefits must extend to all regions of \nthe country.\n  In addition, I think it's important to recognize that several very \nmeritorious legislative proposals have already been put forward. One of \nmy goals in developing this bill was to try and incorporate important \nprograms from the other bills, and I am pleased that many of the \nsponsors of those proposals are also supporting this bill. I also want \nto recognize the efforts that Senator Landrieu, Senator Murkowski, and \nothers have made in generating support for a comprehensive conservation \nbill with their legislative proposal. While there are differences in \nour bills and in some of our funding priorities, I believe our \nunderlying goals are the same. I am committed to working with them, and \nwith all other interested Senators, as we try to pass a bill this year.\n  I would like to add that my primary goal in introducing this bill is \nto try and move the legislative process forward in the Senate. I think \na consensus approach, such as we are proposing today, is our only \nchance of getting a bill enacted into law this year.\n  I know some have questioned why these programs--or any program--\nshould be provided with dedicated funding. When Congress amended the \nLWCF Act in 1968 to credit a portion of Outer Continental Shelf oil and \ngas lease revenues into the fund, the premise was that at least some of \nthe revenues from OCS oil and gas production, a non-renewable resource, \nshould be used to protect other resources throughout the country. I \nthink that was a wise concept then, and one we should continue to \nadhere to today. Along those lines, it is important that whatever \nprograms are included in a comprehensive bill contribute to enriching \nthe natural, cultural, or historical legacy of this country. In my \nopinion, such a bill is not only justifiable, but necessary if we are \ngoing to be responsible to future generations.\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly describe some of the major \nprograms that would receive dedicated funding in this bill.\n  Since its enactment over 35 years ago, the Land and Water \nConservation Fund Act has been not only one of the most popular \nconservation measures ever signed into law, but one of the most far-\nsighted as well. Revenues deposited into the fund are used to protect \nour national and cultural heritage in our national parks, forests, \nwildlife refuges, wilderness areas, trails, wild and scenic rivers, and \nother important areas. In addition, the LWCF State grant program \nassists States in the planning, acquisition, and development of open \nspace and outdoor recreation facilities.\n  However, over the past 35 years, appropriations from the LWCF have \nlagged far behind the amounts credited into the fund, even though \ndemand for LWCF funding continues to increase. In fact, on average, \nless than half of the amounts credited to the fund have actually been \nauthorized. Today, the fund's unappropriated balance exceeds $13 \nbillion. History has shown that if the LWCF remains subject to the \nannual appropriations process, the intent of the fund will never be \nfulfilled. For that reason, my bill uses OCS oil and gas receipts to \nprovide dedicated funding for the LWCF and all of the other \nconservation programs in the bill. The bill funds the LWCF and its \nfully authorized level of $900 million annually, divided equally \nbetween the Federal land acquisition and State grant programs.\n  In addition, I think it's important that the benefits we will get \nfrom fully\n\n[[Page S1174]]\n\nfunding the LWCF not be negated by placing new restrictions on the land \nacquisitions in our national parks, forests and wildlife refuges. I am \nconcerned about language in other bills on this issue which are pending \nin the House and Senate which would create new obstacles to protecting \nthreatened national resources. I think a much better approach is to \ntake the existing LWCF program, which has a proven track record, and \nensure that it is adequately funded. However, I have included language \nwhich gives the Congress the ability to override proposed Federal \nagency expenditures, while ensuring that all of the money is actually \nspent for the intended purpose.\n  Likewise, I believe it's important that new restrictions not be \nplaced on States for the use of the funds they receive under the State \ngrant program. Although some have proposed to restructure the State \nprogram, I think the flexibility given to States in the current law is \nappropriate, and States should continue to determine how to allocate \nLWCF funds for recreational and open space needs, consistent with the \nrequirements of the Act and with review by the Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  Title II of the Conservation and Stewardship Act provides funding to \nprotect and restore our fragile coastal resources. It establishes the \nOcean and Coast Conservation Fund, and dedicates $365 million annually, \nprimarily to States, to address a broad array of coastal and marine \nconservation needs. This fund is administered by the Secretary of \nCommerce. The bill also establishes the Outer Continental Shelf Impact \nAssistance Fund, administered by the Secretary of the Interior, to \nprovide $100 million annually to Coastal States suffering negative \nenvironmental impacts from oil and gas production on the OCS.\n  The Ocean and Coast Conservation Fund addresses four programs. The \nfirst account within the fund allocates $250 million to Coastal States \nfor a broad range of coastal and marine conservation activities which \nensure protection for coral reefs, wetlands, estuaries and marine \nspecies. The second account allocates $25 million to Coastal States to \nfund joint marine enforcement agreements between States and the \nSecretary of Commerce, thereby increasing enforcement capabilities for \nboth Federal and State marine resource protection laws. The third \naccount gives $75 million to Coastal States to fund fisheries research \nand management. The fourth account allocates $15 million to the \nSecretary of Commerce for the protection of coral reefs. A \ncomplementary program for protection of coral resources under the \njurisdiction of the Department of the Interior is contained in Title VI \nof my bill as described further below.\n\n  Although other bills have been introduced which also address coastal \nfunding, I believe the Ocean and Coast Conservation Fund contains \nseveral significant advantages. First, it requires that all money \nreceived under this fund be used only for the protection of the marine \nand coastal environment. Second, it ties the amount of money States \nwill receive to demonstrated conservation need rather than the amount \nof production occurring offshore the State, or a State's or county's \nproximity to that production. In this manner, my bill refrains from \nallowing money from this fund to be used as an incentive to begin or \nincrease production in the Federal OCS. My bill also excludes revenues \nfrom leases included within areas covered by a moratorium on leasing.\n  The Outer Continental Shelf Impact Assistance Fund allocates $100 \nmillion specifically to address the needs of those Coastal States which \nhave hosted Federal OCS oil and gas production off their shores, and \nwhich have suffered negative environmental impacts from that \nproduction. Funds are distributed based on shoreline miles and coastal \npopulation (25 percent each) and the amount of production occurring \noffshore the Coastal State (50 percent). States can use the money only \nto mitigate adverse environmental impacts directly attributable to the \ndevelopment of oil and gas resources of the OCS.\n  The bill also establishes a separate Coral Reef Resources Restoration \nFund. This fund provides $15 million annually to the Secretary of the \nInterior for the protection of coral reef resources under the \njurisdiction of the Secretary. The bill authorizes the Secretary to \nmake grants, not to exceed 75 percent of the total costs, for projects \nwhich promote the viability of coral reef systems under the \njurisdiction of the Department of the Interior. Grants would be \navailable to natural resource agencies of States or Territories, \neducational or non-governmental institutions, or organizations with \ndemonstrated expertise in the conservation of coral reefs.\n  Like many of the other comprehensive conservation proposals, my bill \nincludes significant new funding to assist States in protecting \nwildlife habitat. The Conservation and Stewardship Act includes a $350 \nmillion annual increase in deposits into the Pittman-Robertson fund, to \nhelp fund a broad variety of wildlife conservation programs, with an \nemphasis on protecting habitat for non-game species.\n  In addition, the bill establishes a new $50 million fund to protect \nthreatened and endangered species. Under the program, the Secretary of \nthe Interior would be authorized to enter into agreements with private \nlandowners to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species. \nThis incentive program would assist landowners who voluntarily agree to \ntake protective actions beyond what is required under existing law.\n  In addition to the funds provided for Federal and State programs \nthrough the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the Conservation and \nStewardship Act provides funding for several programs to assist States, \nlocal governments, and other organizations in the protection of open \nspace. The bill includes $50 million in funding for the Forest Legacy \nProgram, $50 million for the Farmland Protection Program, and $50 \nmillion for a new program to allow for the voluntary acquisition of \nconservation easements to prevent ranchlands from being converted to \nnon-agricultural uses.\n  The bill also includes $125 million for a new grant program to be \nadministered by the Secretary of the Interior to help States conserve, \non a matching basis, non-Federal lands or waters of clear regional or \nnational interest.\n  Presently, OCS revenues are credited to only two funds: the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund and the Historic Preservation Fund. Like the \nLWCF, appropriations from the HPF have lagged far behind the $150 \nmillion that is annually credited to the fund. The Conservation and \nStewardship Act will, for the first time, ensure that the fully \nauthorized amount is expended. In addition, the bill requires that at \nleast half of the fund, $75 million, be available to States, tribes, \nand local governments to allow them to better carry out their \nresponsibilities under the National Historic Preservation Act. The bill \nalso requires that at least 50 percent of the Federal funds spent under \nthe program be used for the restoration of historic properties.\n  The bill also funds the American Battlefield Protection Program at \n$15 million per year, fulfilling recommendations made by the Civil War \nSites Advisory Commission. Funding would be available for preservation \nassistance for all types of battlefields, although with respect to \nCivil War battlefields, the funding priority would be for ``Priority \n1'' battlefields identified in the Civil War Sites Advisory \nCommission's report.\n  Mr. President, it is well known that many of the natural and historic \nresources in the parks and historic sites of our National Park System \nare facing significant threats, especially given the limited funds \navailable to the Park Service to address this issue. In an attempt to \nimprove this problem, the Conservation and Stewardship Act creates a \nnew ``National Park System Resource Protection Fund'' and provides $150 \nmillion in annual funding. Moneys from the fund are available to the \nSecretary of the Interior to protect significant natural, cultural or \nhistorical resources in units of the National Park System that are \nthreatened by activities occurring inside or outside of the park \nboundaries. The Secretary is also authorized to enter into cooperative \nagreements with State and local governments and other organizations to \naddress these threats. In addition, the bill makes clear that the fund \ncannot be used to fund land acquisitions, permanent employee salaries, \nroad construction, or projects which already receive funding through \nthe Recreational Fee Demonstration Program.\n\n[[Page S1175]]\n\n  Like many of the other programs included in this bill, the Urban \nParks and Recreation Recovery Program is a program with overwhelming \ndemand and, in recent years, little or non-existent funding. In an \neffort to revitalize this program, the Conservation and Stewardship Act \nprovides $75 million in dedicated funding each year for UPARR programs, \na significant increase over recent appropriations.\n  I think it is important that a comprehensive conservation bill focus \nnot only on land acquisition and other resource conservation programs, \nbut also on improving the tie between these resources and local \ncommunities. I have included funding for four programs to assist the \nway communities, including young people, work with public and private \npartners to plan and take action for the long-term stewardship and \nmaintenance of lands and resources.\n  Dedicated funding for the Youth Conservation Corps and related \npartnerships will enable us to make significant investments in two of \nour country's most valuable treasures--our natural resources and our \nyoung people. The investments in our youth and our natural resources \ncan grow together and benefit one another.\n  The Youth Conservation Corps, and related partnerships with \nnonprofit, State, and local youth conservation corps (``YCC''), are \nadministered by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the \nInterior. It is clear that they are successful and popular programs. \nThe demand for summer conservation jobs for youth overwhelmingly \nexceeds the supply. Over the past twenty years, a lack of adequate \nfunding has been the biggest obstacle preventing YCC from realizing an \neven greater level of success.\n  Our parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and other public lands benefit \nbecause important conservation projects are completed at a lower cost. \nOur youth, on summer break from school, benefit by engaging in positive \nand meaningful activities. There are many types of projects that youth \ncomplete--construction, maintenance, reconstruction, restoration, \nrepair, or rehabilitation of natural, cultural, historic, \narchaeological, recreational, or scenic resources.\n  Senator Scoop Jackson was the sponsor of the original legislation \nthat created the YCC. He had the foresight and vision to create \nopportunities for young people to complete conservation and restoration \nprojects on our public lands. The bill I am introducing today will \nenable us to embrace Senator Jackson's legacy by fully funding YCC, \nthereby achieving the levels of participation that existed during his \ntenure in the Senate.\n  Last year, the National Parks, Historic Preservation, and Recreation \nSubcommittee held an oversight hearing on YCC and related partnerships. \nBoth National Park Service Director Stanton, on behalf of the \nDepartment of the Interior, and Forest Service Chief Dombeck expressed \nenthusiastic support for these programs. Similarly, over the past year \nI have learned that strong bipartisan Congressional support exists for \nYCC and related partnerships.\n  All of our country's public lands will benefit from these programs. \nThe existing authorizing law includes a State grant component as well \nas opportunities for projects to be completed on public lands other \nthan Federal lands.\n  I have a letter that I will submit for the record from the National \nAssociation of Service and Conservation Corps and the Student \nConservation Association supporting inclusion of the YCC provision in \nthis bill. Partnerships between members of these organizations and the \nFederal land management agencies seem to be the most cost effective and \nefficient way to maximize both the number of conservation projects and \nthe youth who complete them. Dedicated funding will ensure that \nexisting partnerships are maintained while also allowing for the \ncreation of new partnerships across the country.\n  The Forest Service's Economic Action Program (``EAP'') assists rural \nforest-dependent communities to foster stronger links between the \nhealth of forests and the well-being of communities. It is an important \ncomplement to land acquisition under the LWCF, helping rural \ncommunities to effectively participate in plans and actions that affect \nthe future management of public and private forest lands.\n  One of the most important aspects of EAP is the emphasis on helping \ncommunities organize and develop their own broad-based local action \nplans. This is the first step in enabling a community to build a \nsustainable future based on the integration of economic, social, and \nenvironmental objectives. Communities can then focus on organizing, \nplanning, and implementing natural resource based projects contained in \ntheir plans. Projects range from tourism and value-added manufacturing \nto historic preservation.\n  In addition to the planning component, EAP also helps communities to \nbuild rural business infrastructure to better use and market the \nbyproducts of ecosystem restoration; strengthen, diversify, and expand \ntheir local economies; improve transportation networks for forest-based \nproducts; and increase their access to technology through partnerships. \nProjects range from tourism and value-added manufacturing to historic \npreservation.\n  EAP's focus is to promote self-sufficiency by leveraging small grants \nfor capacity building. Many recipients of these grants are able to \nstart forest-based small businesses with the Forest Service's technical \nand financial assistance. The Forest Service is the best, often the \nonly, delivery mechanism because Forest Service personnel are already \nlocated and established in these communities.\n  As evidenced by a recent oversight hearing before the Subcommittee on \nForests and Public Land Management, the Economic Action programs are \nstrongly supported by rural communities across the country. Lack of \nadequate and consistent funding is the primary obstacle that has \nprohibited these programs from achieving even greater levels of \nsuccess.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to place a letter in the Record from American \nForests supporting inclusion of this program in the bill that I am \nintroducing today. The National Network of Forest Practitioners also \nhas expressed support for EAP in testimony before Congress for several \nyears.\n  Urban and Community Forestry is an important program that has been \noverlooked in other recent legislative proposals. Through this program, \nthe Forest Service works with national groups and networks, such as \nAmerican Forests and the Alliance for Community Trees, and with local \ngovernments, community groups, and private businesses in hundreds of \nrural communities and cities across the country to heighten awareness \nof the ecological benefits that trees and forests provide.\n  Urban and community forests provide tremendous value to communities \nin terms of ``ecological services,'' such as filtering air pollutants, \ncleaning drinking water, managing stormwater flows, and reducing energy \nconsumption. Recent losses in tree and forest cover in communities in \nthe United States translate into billions of dollars of lost value in \nterms of ecological services.\n  The Urban and Community Forestry Program is the key Federal program \nassessing and highlighting the significant environmental values \nassociated with urban forests and helping communities plan and take \naction to preserve, restore, and maintain their green infrastructure. \nIt is a capacity-building program, providing Federal technical and \nfinancial assistance to communities and empowering them to plan and \ntake action for themselves, while strongly leveraging the Federal \nassistance.\n  This program complements the LWCF and other programs currently \nincluded in other legislative proposals to provide increased funding \nfor conservation. This program could deliver increased levels of \nsuccess with an increased and predictable level of funding.\n  My bill also provides full funding for the Payment In Lieu of Taxes \nProgram. This program, like many of the others in this bill, is \ngenerally funded at far below its authorized level. The program \ncompensates units of local governments, primarily counties, for the \nloss of tax revenues due to the presence of Federal lands within their \njurisdiction, and recognizes the important partnership between the \nFederal government and local governments in any national conservation \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I have received letter from a broad coalition of \nenvironmental, conservation, and historic preservation groups in \nsupport of this\n\n[[Page S1176]]\n\nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that they be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    March 6, 2000.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: All of the environmental and \n     preservation organizations listed below are writing to thank \n     you for your leadership in introducing the Conservation and \n     Stewardship Act of 2000 and to express our strong support. \n     Your bill is an excellent piece of legislation that achieves \n     the objective of providing permanent mandatory funding for a \n     number of critical conservation needs including: the Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund (LWCF); the Historic Preservation \n     Fund (HPF); acquisition of non-federal lands of regional or \n     national interest; coastal restoration; state wildlife \n     conservation; endangered species protection; preservation of \n     our national parks; urban recreation and forestry; \n     conservation easements for farm, forest, and ranch land; and \n     important rural assistance programs.\n       We are especially grateful that the Conservation and \n     Stewardship Act of 2000 achieves these vital objectives while \n     addressing important concerns that the environmental \n     community has identified in other legislative efforts to \n     achieve these same ends. We look forward to working with you, \n     the President, and other leaders to ensure passage of sound \n     conservation funding legislation in this Congress. Again, we \n     deeply appreciate your leadership on this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Defenders of Wildlife; Environmental Defense; Friends of \n           the Earth; League of Conservation Voters; National \n           Parks Conservation Association; Natural Resources \n           Defense Council; National Trust for Historic \n           Preservation; Scenic America; Sierra Club; The \n           Wilderness Society; U.S. Public Interest Research \n           Group; World Wildlife Fund.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 National Wildlife Federation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2000.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the National Wildlife \n     Federation and our millions of members and supporters, I want \n     to thank you for introducing the Conservation and Stewardship \n     Act and express our strong support for this important \n     legislation. This bill would make an historic contribution to \n     conservation by providing substantial and reliable funding \n     for the protection and restoration of our nation's wildlife; \n     public lands; coastal and marine resources; historic and \n     cultural treasures; state, local and urban parks and \n     recreation programs; and open space.\n       As you know, the House Resources Committee has approved \n     similar legislation, H.R. 701 the Conservation and \n     Reinvestment Act, which was recently introduced by Chairman \n     Frank Murkowski and Senator Mary Landrieu as S. 2123. Like \n     your bill, H.R. 701/S. 2123 would provide permanent funding \n     to a variety of important conservation programs. The National \n     Wildlife Federation is supporting H.R. 701/S. 2123 while \n     seeking key changes to improve the bill. Many of the changes \n     we are seeking in H.R. 701/S. 2123 are already in your bill.\n       We are eager to see the sponsors of these related bills \n     work together to find a proposal that can be passed by the \n     Senate and enacted into law.\n       The National Wildlife Federation looks forward to working \n     with you, the President, and other leaders to ensure passage \n     of sound conservation funding legislation in this Congress. \n     Again, we deeply appreciate your leadership on this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Steven J. Shimberg,\n\n                                         Vice President, Office of\n     Federal and International Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    The Trust for Public Land,\n\n                                 San Francisco, CA, March 6, 2000.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of The Trust for Public \n     Land and our many land conservation partners across America, \n     I am writing to thank you for your promotion of legislation \n     that would bring important new substance and certainty to our \n     national investment in resource land protection.\n       We are gratified that the Conservation and Stewardship Act \n     you introduce today would institute structural revisions to \n     the Land & Water Conservation Fund to ensure full annual \n     funding of LWCF's currently authorized but only partly \n     realized potential to protect federal lands--including our \n     irreplaceable national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and \n     other public land treasures--and to provide urgently needed \n     grants for state and local parkland and recreation \n     partnerships. We also deeply appreciate the new federal tools \n     your legislation would provide for the protection of \n     threatened ranchlands and non-federal lands of regional and \n     national significance; the enhancements it would afford to \n     such other existing programs as the Forest Legacy Program, \n     the Farmland Protection Program, the Urban Park and \n     Recreation Recovery Act, and the Urban and Community Forestry \n     Program; and its additional provisions to protect natural, \n     cultural, recreational, and other crucial resources. And we \n     are encouraged that your direct approach to establishing this \n     lasting commitment to our nation's legacy of open spaces \n     avoids new procedural complexities.\n       I am therefore pleased to offer The Trust for Public Land's \n     support for the Conservation and Stewardship Act, and for \n     your outstanding efforts to protect America's most vital \n     resources. We look forward to working with you, as the \n     legislative process unfolds this year, to secure permanent, \n     stable funding for these vital programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Alan Front,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             American Forests,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2000.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: I am writing to express our support \n     for the bill you are introducing today, the Conservation and \n     Stewardship Act. There is a great need for stronger and more \n     consistent annual investment in programs that protect, \n     restore, and maintain lands and resources, and we believe \n     your bill is an excellent vehicle for working toward this \n     objective. We are especially pleased that the bill includes \n     three programs administered by the USDA Forest Service--the \n     Urban and Community Forestry Program, Forest Legacy Program, \n     and Economic Action Programs. These programs complement the \n     land acquisition elements of other Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund (LWCF) bills by providing for the ongoing \n     stewardship of lands and resources.\n       American Forests is the oldest national nonprofit \n     conservation organization in the U.S. Since 1875, we have \n     worked with scientists, resource managers, policymakers, and \n     citizens to promote policies and programs that help people \n     improve the environment with trees and forests. We partner \n     with public and private organizations in communities around \n     the country providing technical information and resources to \n     leverage local actions. Our Global ReLeaf campaign, which \n     raises private funds and provides grants to local \n     organizations for ecosystem restoration projects, has helped \n     people plant more than 12 million trees since 1990.\n       The three programs I cited above focus on helping \n     communities plan and take action for the long-term \n     maintenance, or stewardship, of lands and resources. The \n     Urban and Community Forestry Program provides technical and \n     financial assistance to local governments and community \n     groups around the country to develop plans and actions to \n     protect and maintain ``green infrastructure'' and deal with \n     sprawl and quality-of-life issues. Forest Legacy helps \n     communities work with willing private forest landowners to \n     confront development pressures through the use of \n     conservation easements which allow landowners to maintain \n     their forests in conservation uses. The Economic Action \n     Programs assist rural forest-dependent communities to \n     effectively participate in plans and actions affecting public \n     and private forests, and to foster stronger links between the \n     health of the forest and the well-being of communities.\n       We appreciate your leadership in calling attention to the \n     need to increase support for stewardship programs while \n     Congress is considering major new public investments in \n     conservation programs through the LWCF. If we can be of any \n     assistance with respect to your new bill, we stand ready to \n     help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Deborah Gangloff,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                               Service and Conservation Corps,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2000.\n\n\n                             Student Conservation Association,\n\n                                   Charlestown, NH, March 6, 2000.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The National Association of Service \n     and Conservation Corps and the Student Conservation \n     Association join in thanking you for your leadership in \n     finding a means of support for youth partnership programs on \n     the nation's public lands.\n       Together, we wish to announce our strong support for the \n     legislation you are introducing today that will establish a \n     $60 million Youth Conservation Corps Fund with Outer \n     Continental Shelf revenue, and which will take numerous other \n     steps in support of essential Federal, state, and local \n     conservation measures and programs.\n       State and local conservation and service corps in 31 states \n     and the District of Columbia, as well as participants in the \n     Student Conservation Association's programs nationwide, can \n     look forward to the opportunity to work hard while providing \n     conservation service that benefits the entire nation, thanks \n     to this legislation.\n       We applaud your efforts and look forward to working with \n     you to transform this vision into a reality that benefits the \n     nation's youth and natural resources.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Kathleen Selz,\n                                                 President, NASCC.\n     Dale Penny,\n                                                   President, SCA.\n\n[[Page S1177]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                 Alliance For Community Trees,\n\n                                      Dallas, TX, August 16, 1999.\n     Re support for the USDA Forest Service's Urban & Community \n         Forestry Program to be part of the land and water \n         conservation reauthorization bill.\n\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Budget Committee, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The Miller/Young Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund reauthorization bill includes funding for \n     the Department of Interiors' Urban Parks Recovery Program \n     (UPARR) but does not include any funding for the Forest \n     Service's Urban and Community Forestry Program (U).\n       While UPARR will address some of the basic physical \n     components of the bill, it will not begin to touch the urban \n     work needed to make the program a success in the community. \n     The U Program address's the community-based work and \n     issues such as urban sprawl and natural resources and \n     ecosystems.\n       We believe that the delivery system for the U program \n     has a wider audience, reaching Federal and State governments \n     in all 50 states, as well as partners in the grassroots \n     nonprofit community. The UPARR delivery system is strictly \n     through the Federal government and in only 400 specific \n     cities. The Alliance for Community Trees (ACT) members alone \n     represents over 75 million Americans in twenty-eight states. \n     ACT also partners with federal, state and local partners in \n     every facet of the communities in which they serve. In \n     addition, the Alliance for Community Trees groups, in \n     partnership with the government agencies, will help address \n     the human elements to the program through community outreach, \n     technical assistance and volunteer opportunities. Lastly, we \n     believe that the funding will be more productively spent \n     through a coordinated effort of both UPARR and the U \n     Program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Suzanne Probart,\n     Issues Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Tree New Mexico, Inc.,\n\n                                 Albuquerque, NM, August 16, 1999.\n     Re: Support for urban & community forestry programs in New \n         Mexico through the proposed land and water conservation \n         reauthorization bills.\n\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Budget Committee, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: Tree New Mexico (TNM) is New \n     Mexico's premier nonprofit grassroots tree planting and \n     education organization whose full-time programs offer \n     volunteer tree planting opportunities, education and training \n     to all NM citizens. Since 1990, Tree New Mexico has planted \n     over 575,000 trees in urban, riparian, rural areas statewide. \n     In addition, TNM's education program delivers environmental \n     education and specialty training to over 6,000 New Mexico's \n     children annually.\n       The various Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) \n     reauthorization bills (H.R. 701--Young/Dingell, H.R. 798-\n     Miller, S. 25--Landrieu/Murkowski, S. 446--Boxer, and S. \n     532--Feinstein) all included funding for conservation \n     programs, land acquisition and park infrastructure through \n     the Dept. of Interiors' Urban Parks Recovery Program (UPARR). \n     Tree New Mexico recommends that the USDA Forest Service's \n     Urban and Community Forestry Program (U) is included in \n     LWCF funding bill. While UPARR will address some of the basic \n     physical components of the bill, it will not begin to touch \n     the urban work needed to make the program a success in the \n     community. In addition, the UPARR delivery system is strictly \n     through the Federal government and in only 400 specific \n     cities.

SHORT TITLE\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Wildlife Conservation and \n     Restoration Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 302. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) a diverse array of species of fish and wildlife is of \n     significant value to the Nation for many reasons: aesthetic, \n     ecological, educational, cultural, recreational, economic, \n     and scientific;\n       (2) the United States should retain for present and future \n     generations the opportunity to observe, understand, and \n     appreciate a wide variety of wildlife;\n       (3) millions of citizens participate in outdoor recreation \n     through hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, all of \n     which have significant value to the citizens who engage in \n     these activities;\n       (4) providing sufficient and properly maintained wildlife \n     associated recreational opportunities is important to \n     enhancing public appreciation of a diversity of wildlife and \n     the habitats upon which they depend;\n       (5) lands and waters which contain species neither \n     classified as game nor identified as endangered or threatened \n     can provide opportunities for wildlife associated recreation \n     and education such as hunting and fishing permitted by \n     applicable State or Federal law;\n       (6) hunters and anglers have for more than 60 years \n     willingly paid user fees in the form of Federal excise taxes \n     on hunting and fishing equipment to support wildlife \n     diversity and abundance, through enactment of the Federal Aid \n     in Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 1669 et seq.; commonly \n     referred to as the Pittman-Robertson Act), and the Federal \n     Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 777 et seq.; \n     commonly referred to as the Dingell-Johnson Act);\n       (7) State programs, adequately funded to conserve a broader \n     array of wildlife in an individual State and conducted in \n     coordination with Federal, State, tribal, and private \n     landowners and interested organizations, would continue to \n     serve as a vital link in a nationwide effort to restore \n     game and nongame wildlife, and the essential elements of \n     such programs should include conservation measures which \n     manage for a diverse variety of populations of wildlife; \n     and\n       (8) cooperative conservation efforts aimed at preventing \n     species from becoming endangered will significantly benefit \n     private landowners and other citizens by responding to early \n     warning signs of decline in a flexible, incentive-based \n     manner that minimizes the social and economic costs often \n     associated with listing species as threatened or endangered; \n     and\n       (9) it is proper for Congress to bolster and extend this \n     highly successful program to aid game and nongame wildlife in \n     supporting the health and diversity of habitat, as well as \n     providing funds for conservation education.\n\n     SEC. 303. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to extend financial and technical assistance to the \n     States under the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act for \n     the benefit of a diverse array of wildlife and associated \n     habitats, including species that are not hunted or fished, to \n     fulfill unmet needs of wildlife within the States while \n     recognizing the mandate of the States to conserve all \n     wildlife;\n       (2) to assure sound conservation policies through the \n     development, revision and implementation of wildlife \n     associated recreation and wildlife associated education and \n     wildlife conservation law enforcement;\n       (3) to encourage State fish and wildlife agencies to create \n     partnerships between the Federal Government, other State \n     agencies, wildlife conservation organizations, and outdoor \n     recreation and conservation interests through cooperative \n     planning and implementation of this title; and\n       (4) to encourage State fish and wildlife agencies to \n     provide for public involvement in the process of development \n     and implementation of a wildlife conservation and restoration \n     program.\n\n     SEC. 304.

A bill to reduce, suspend, or terminate any assistance under \nthe Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the Arms Export Control Act to \neach country determined by the President to be engaged in oil price \nfixing to the detriment of the United States economy, and for other \npurposes; to the committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                    Oil Price Reduction Act of 2000\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I introduced a companion piece of \nlegislation to H.R. 3822, the Oil Price Reduction Act of 2000. This \nbill will help to address the problems our constituencies are \nexperiencing throughout the nation due to climbing fuel prices.\n  Last weekend I traveled back to my home and held a briefing near Des \nMoines to explain to my constituents that prices will likely rise \nsignificantly past current levels. I had the displeasure of looking \ntruckers and farmers in the eye and telling them there is no relief in \nsight. In my home state we are experiencing price levels not seen in \nalmost a decade, but all I could tell them was that it is going to get \nworse.\n  Many of my colleagues know the cold, hard truth of the matter. When \nthe Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) finally makes \na substantive, definitive decision to increase oil production, it will \nstill most likely take 60 days before adequate levels of fuel can be \ndistributed throughout the U.S. That means if the OPEC Cartel decided \nto remedy the harm they have imposed on the American consumer today, we \nare still at least six weeks away from witnessing the peak in the price \nincrease. We could very well see $2 per gallon gasoline by May and that \nis not acceptable.\n  Iowans and the rest of the nation should not have been subjected to \nthis price spike. The monopolistic production controls promulgated by \nOPEC in March of 1999 should have been challenged by our administration \nupon establishment, not when we finally felt the pinch.\n  In addition, the Administration's energy policy is an aberration. \nThis crisis only accentuates the problem with relying on foreign energy \ninstead of expanding domestic opportunities. Since 1992, U.S. oil \nproduction is down 17% while consumption has risen 14%. We now import \n56% of our oil and that number is growing rapidly. DOE predicts that by \n2020 we will import 65% of our oil. Guess which country has benefited \nthe most from the Administration's energy policy? As unbelievable as \nthis seems it's Iraq. Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Iraq is now our fastest \ngrowing source for oil. How can we be administering a policy that \nstrengthens this dictator's grip on our economy and the Middle East?\n  The bill I introduced today would require the President of the United \nStates to cut off foreign aid and arms sales to countries engaged in \noil price fixing.\n  Specifically, the legislation would require the President to send a \nreport to Congress, within 30 days of enactment, detailing the U.S. \nsecurity relationship with each OPEC member and any other major oil \nexporting country; assistance programs and government-supported arms \nsales provided to those countries; and his determination regarding the \nextent each country is engaged in oil price fixing and whether such \nprice fixing is detrimental to the U.S. economy.\n  The bill would then require the President to reduce, terminate or \nsuspend any assistance or arms sales to the country or countries \ndetermined to be fixing oil prices.\n  In addition, the legislation would require the President to submit a \nreport to Congress 90 days after enactment describing the diplomatic \nefforts by the U.S. to convince all major net oil exporting countries \nthat current price levels are unsustainable and will cause widespread \neconomic harm in oil consuming and developing nations.\n  Even if the production quotas put in place last year are lifted, low \nreserves\n\n[[Page S1185]]\n\nmay continue to plunder American consumers and farmers during the busy \nsummer vacation and planting seasons. The Clinton administration was \ncaught off-guard this year without much of an energy policy. Now, the \nPresident needs to exercise his authority to help solve the problem, \nwhich is going to get worse before it gets better.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Smith of \n        New Hampshire, Ms. Snowe, and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 2183. A bill to ensure the availability of spectrum to amateur \nradio operators; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n               THE AMATEUR RADIO SPECTRUM PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Amateur Radio \nSpectrum Protection Act of 2000. This bill would help preserve the \namount of radio spectrum allocated to the Amateur Radio Service during \nthis era of dramatic change in our telecommunications system. I am \npleased to introduce this bipartisan measure with my colleagues, \nSenator Collins, Senator Akaka, Senator Bob Smith, Senator Snowe, and \nSenator Lincoln.\n  Organized radio amateurs, more commonly known as ``ham'' operators, \nthrough formal agreements with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nthe National Weather Service, the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, and \nother government and private relief services, provide emergency \ncommunication when regular channels are disrupted by disaster. In \nIdaho, these trained volunteers have performed tasks as various as \nhelping to rescue stranded back-country hikers, organizing cleanup \nefforts after the Payette River flooded, and helping the Forest Service \ncommunicate during major forest fires. In other communities, they may \nbe found monitoring tornado touchdowns in the Midwest, helping \nauthorities reestablish communication after a hurricane in the Gulf or \nsending ``health and welfare'' messages following an earthquake on the \nWest Coast. Not only do they provide these services using their own \nequipment and without compensation, but they also give their personal \ntime to participate in regular organized training exercises.\n  In addition to emergency communication, amateur radio enthusiasts use \ntheir spectrum allocations to experiment with and develop new circuitry \nand techniques for increasing the effectiveness of the precious natural \nresource of radio spectrum for all Americans. Much of the electronic \ntechnology we now take for granted is rooted in amateur radio \nexperimentation. Moreover, amateur radio has long provided the first \ntechnical training for youngsters who grow up to be America's \nscientists and engineers.\n  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requires the Federal Communications \nCommission (FCC) to conduct spectrum auctions to raise revenues. Some \nof that revenue may come from the auction of current amateur radio \nspectrum. This bill simply requires the FCC to provide the Amateur \nRadio Service with equivalent replacement spectrum if it reallocates \nand auctions any of the Service's current spectrum.\n  The Amateur Radio Spectrum Protection Act of 2000 will protect these \nvital functions while also maintaining the flexibility of the FCC to \nmanage the nation's telecommunications infrastructure effectively. It \nwill not interfere with the ability of commercial telecommunications \nservices to seek the spectrum allocations they require. I ask my \ncolleagues to join the more than 670,000 U.S. licensed radio amateurs \nin supporting this measure and welcome their co-sponsorship.\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today, along with several \nof my fellow Great Lakes Senators, to introduce an amendment to Senate \nBill 1089, the Coast Guard Authorization Act. I want to thank Senators \nDeWine, Feingold, Grams, Kohl, Lugar, Santorum, Voinovich, and \nWellstone for their support and commitment to the continued presence of \na suitable and reliable heavy icebreaking capability on the Great \nLakes. The purpose of our amendment is to authorize adequate funding to \nreplace the current Great Lakes icebreaker, the Mackinaw, which is \nscheduled for decommissioning in 2006.\n  Mr. President, heavy icebreaking on the Great Lakes is vital to the \nregion's industry. Each year, almost 200 million tons of cargo travel \nacross the Great Lakes, including 70 percent of U.S. steel. \nTransportation of U.S. steel alone directly affects 108,000 jobs, and \nindirectly affects 400,000.\n  Shipping on the Great Lakes faces a unique challenge because the \nseason begins and ends in ice. Windrows, slabs of broken ice piled atop \neach other by the wind, can reach 15 feet in thickness. The Mackinaw, \nwith 12,000 horsepower packed into her 290-foot-long hull has kept \ncommerce moving even under the most trying conditions since 1944. The \npresence of the Mackinaw improves shipping efficiency, reliability, and \ncompetition. Further, shipping provides a more environmentally sound \nalternative to surface transportation, because maritime shipments use \nless fuel and produce fewer emissions than rail and truck alternatives.\n  Mr. President, after over 55 years of service, the Mackinaw's \nproductive life is nearing an end. The Coast Guard has committed to \nkeeping the cutter in service until 2006, when it hopes to have a \nreplacement vessel operating. To meet this important deadline, funds to \nconstruct a multi-purpose heavy icebreaker must be included in the \nfiscal year 2001 budget, which is why I have joined with the \naforementioned Great Lakes Senators in seeking authorization. In \naddition, I and several other Senators have sent various letters \nrequesting appropriations for the Mackinaw, as well as an assumption \nwithin the fiscal year 2001 budget resolution for this funding.\n  The construction of a multi-purpose vessel designed to perform \nicebreaking operations will bring the cutter's mission profile in line \nwith Coast Guard employment standards while improving the efficiency of \nthe Great Lakes fleet performance. Extensive studies and modeling \nvalidate the feasibility of a multi-purpose design. Additionally, the \nmulti-mission design is less than 4 percent more expensive than a \nsingle-purpose design, and provides a more robust Great Lakes fleet by \nincreasing the number of available operational days by 38 percent.\n  Without a heavy icebreaker, the Great Lakes shipping season could be \nshortened by as much as 10 weeks, causing a host of problems for which \nthere are few solutions and none of which are in the region's best \ninterests. We must appropriate these funds this year, and to do that we \nshould make sure that the authorization bill provides for this \nimportant one-time expense so that there will be no doubt as to the \nintent of Congress on this important project.\n\n[[Page S1187]]\n\n  And Mr. President, let me just inform my colleagues that this is not \nsimply a Great Lakes issue. The winter Great Lakes maritime commerce \ndependent upon the availability of a heavy icebreaker is the same \nmaritime commerce that delivers iron ore to steel mills along the \nEastern Seaboard and the South, the same maritime commerce that \ndelivers aggregates to the Mid-Atlantic, and the same maritime commerce \nthat delivers agricultural projects throughout the United States and \noverseas. With that in mind, I ask for the support of all of my \ncolleagues to assure the continued operation of Great Lakes icebreaking \nthrough the full funding of the Great Lakes ice breaker in fiscal year \n2001.\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join my good friend from \nMichigan, Senator Abraham, and the rest of the Great Lakes delegation \nin sponsoring this very important amendment to provide funds for the \nconstruction of a new ice-breaking vessel to replace the Mackinaw. \nStationed on the Great Lakes, the Mackinaw operates during the ice \nseason, which lasts from December 15th through April 15th. My \ncolleagues from the Great Lakes region know the importance of this \nvessel during those 4 months. Without this boat, regional commerce on \nthe water would be significantly impaired. Approximately 14 million \ntons of cargo are moved on the Great Lakes during the ice season. This \ncargo includes iron ore, coal, limestone, cement, and grain. These \nresources are necessary to our entire country and our economy.\n  In addition to the economic need for ice-breaking on the Great Lakes, \nthere are national defense implications. The Mackinaw was christened in \n1944 to meet our nation's wartime need for iron ore. Today, more than \n70 percent of our nation's steelmaking capacity is located in the Great \nLakes basin. Should our country ever become embroiled in a protracted \nmilitary crisis, our ability to transit the Lakes during periods of ice \ncover would be crucial.\n  Mr. President, the Mackinaw is showing signs of its age, and the time \nhas come to replace the vessel. After several years of studying a \nreplacement design, the Coast Guard has concluded that a multi-purpose \nice-breaking vessel is the preferred option. Not only will this \nreplacement ship perform ice-breaking services, but it also will \nmaintain floating aids-to-navigation. Compared with the construction of \na single-purpose icebreaker, the multi-mission design increases the \nnumber of available operational days by 38 percent.\n  Constructing a multi-purpose ice-breaking vessel is a common-sense \nsolution to address the needs of the Great Lakes. I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/06/senate-section/article/S1187-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n                    subcommittee on water and power\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Madam President, I rise to express my disappointment that \nthe Congress has been unable to move forward on a bipartisan basis on \nthe prescription drug benefit under Medicare. There is a lot of talk \nwith our surplus about potential tax breaks for businesses and families \nand individuals. In fact, it appears one of the proposals is going to \nbe virtually unanimous, and that is the suggestion we take the cap off \nincome for those who are under Social Security so people between the \nages of 65 and 70 can work without penalty. That is encouraging. We \nshould move on that and move quickly.\n  Another element of some debate but some agreement as well is the so-\ncalled marriage penalty. This is a feature of our Tax Code that was \nprobably not there by design, but it reads that if two individuals \nmaking a certain amount of money should get married and their combined \nincome puts them in a different and higher income tax category, they \nface a penalty.\n  Some have argued, with very little evidence, that many people do not \nget married because of this. I have my doubts about it. I do not know \nhow many people visit their accountant before they buy the engagement \nring, but I suppose it happens.\n  I do believe we can, on a bipartisan basis, come to an agreement that \nwe will remove the so-called marriage penalty and do it in a way that \nis not unreasonable so we benefit those who would otherwise be \ndisadvantaged.\n  There is an irony to this as well, of course, in that when many \npeople get married, their combined income puts them in a lower tax \nbracket. This is, I guess, a marriage bonus, if you want to use the \nterm. We certainly believe that should continue and that it should not \nbe changed. I hope we can move in that direction.\n  Unfortunately, the House of Representatives recently passed a package \non the marriage penalty that was really quite different than what I \nhave described. First of all, as with so many other tax bills that have \ncome from the other party over the years, the vast majority--two-thirds \nof the benefits of this so-called marriage penalty tax bill coming from \nthe House--goes to higher-income couples; that is, couples making over \n$75,000 a year. These higher-income couples get an average tax cut of \nclose to $1,000. Couples who earn less than $50,000 receive an average \nof $149. That is a very small percentage of the amount that goes to \nthose in higher-income categories.\n  The price tag for the Republican marriage penalty bill coming out of \nthe House--well, it's a whopping $182 million, and almost half the \nbenefits go to couples who do not face the marriage penalty in their \ntaxes. In this process, this huge expense, mostly going to high-income \nfamilies, crowds out a lot of very important priorities.\n  I hope we all can agree that if our goal is to eliminate the marriage \npenalty, it can be done for a fraction of what the House of \nRepresentatives did in their tax relief bill. There are other deserving \ntax benefit suggestions we should consider. At the top of these \npriorities is a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens.\n  On the Democratic side, our party believes we can address both the \nmarriage penalty and the prescription drug benefit. The prescription \ndrug coverage for our seniors is a lifeline. One of the leaders in the \nHouse of Representatives on the other side of the aisle said if we put \nthe prescription drug benefit in his bill, he will consider it a \n``legislative poison pill.''\n\n  For the seniors with whom I speak in Illinois and from across the \nNation, prescription drug coverage is a lifeline, not a poison pill. \nHouse Majority Leader Dick Armey and other House Republicans who called \nit a poison pill illustrate the flaws in their priorities.\n  I hope we can come together. I hope my friends on the Republican \nside, particularly in the House of Representatives, will learn, as I \nhave, about the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs.\n  Prescription drug prices have been rising at an almost double-digit \nrate for the last 20 years. A Families USA study shows these prices \nrising at four times the rate of inflation. Medicare beneficiaries' \nannual out-of-pocket drug costs tell the story: 38 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries are spending more than $1,000 a year on their \nprescription drugs. Many of them are on tight, fixed incomes. Eighteen \npercent of Medicare beneficiaries spend between $500 and $1,000, and 31 \npercent are paying out up to $500.\n  For some people stepping back and saying $1,000 a year should not \nmean much, I can tell them that for a person on a fixed income of $600 \nor $800 a month under Social Security, $100 a month can mean a real \nsacrifice, and many senior citizens have to face those sacrifices on a \nregular basis.\n  When we held a hearing in Chicago on the prescription drug situation, \nthere were seniors who told us that when they visited large \nsupermarkets in the Chicagoland area that had prescription drug \ncounters, first they would have to find out what their drugs would cost \nand then calculate what was left over for the groceries they needed to \nbuy to fill their refrigerators and feed themselves in the days ahead.\n  That is a tough sacrifice and choice for anyone to make, certainly \nfor one to decide between health and the basic necessities of life. One \nstudy showed fully 1 in 8 seniors faces this choice between food and \nmedicine. That is unacceptable.\n  Addressing this problem is certainly not a poison pill, in Mr. \nArmey's words. Time and again, in each of my town meetings around the \nState, I heard how much money seniors have to spend to remain healthy. \nIt was not unusual in any senior citizen setting to find someone \nspending $200, $300, $400 a month or even more.\n  In Illinois, my constituents tell me they are having a tough time \npaying for their own drugs. Many are worried about whether their \nparents can afford the drugs they need to stay healthy.\n  I had a town meeting in Chicago recently. Julie Garcia told me of her \nconcerns about her mother's health care needs. This was not an uncommon \nstory. Many children are concerned about a parent who has been ill. \nThey want to make certain their parents have access to prescription \ndrugs to stay healthy.\n  Julie Garcia's mother was diagnosed with cancer 11 years ago and must \nstill see her oncologist for routine visits every 2 or 3 months. \nBecause of her cancer, Julie Garcia's mother was unable to buy \nindividual insurance. When she was going through her cancer treatment, \nshe was on what is known as a spend-down program through Medicaid. This \npaid for a large portion of her hospital bill, but she still incurred \nthousands of dollars in bills for which she was held liable. A great \nmany of those thousands of dollars were for the cost of prescription \ndrugs she needed.\n  So many seniors who are concerned about their health are often faced \nwith\n\n[[Page S1189]]\n\nthese terrible choices. I have run into seniors who do not fill \nprescriptions given to them by doctors. Some fill the prescription and \ntake it every other day. Some will try to stretch the prescription out \nin other ways. Little do they know they may be losing all of the \nbeneficial impact of the prescription drug itself.\n  One lady in particular had a double lung transplant. She found it was \ngoing to cost $2,500 a month for her to deal with the antirejection \ndrugs and other things necessary to stay healthy after this transplant \nsurgery. She came to the conclusion she could not afford it. She \ndecided, on her own, to cut back on the prescription drugs she would \ntake. As a result of that decision--a monetary decision--she lost one-\nthird of her lung capacity permanently, irreparable harm which could \ndamage her for years to come--a money decision that resulted in a \nhealth disaster.\n  Those are the choices people are making every single day. It is not \njust the seniors, of course. Under Medicare, many who are disabled find \nthemselves in the same predicament: Cutting back, mainly on drugs, \nsometimes because of large price increases. Over the last couple of \nyears, it has gone from bad to worse. As I mentioned before, one study \nshows that one senior in eight is forced to choose between food and \nmedicine.\n  What kind of drug price increases are we talking about?\n  In 1992, the average cost of a prescription drug was $30. Six years \nlater, in 1998, it had more than doubled to an average of $78. Drug \nprices are increasing much more quickly than the pace of inflation.\n  A study by Families USA, a national health care consumer group, \nexamined the prices of 50 drugs most often used by seniors. They tested \nthe period between January 1, 1998, and January 1, 1999. Here is what \nthey found.\n  For the 50 most popular drugs used by seniors, 36 out of those 50 \ndrugs increased two or more times faster than the rate of inflation. \nMore than a third of these drugs--17 out of 50--increased four times \nthe rate of inflation.\n  Pharmacists in my State tell me that in the past they used to get a \nprice increase once or twice a year. Now many of them face price \nincreases on drugs on a weekly or monthly basis. The curiosity about \nthis is the relative expense of these drugs.\n  We understand the pharmaceutical companies are in business to make a \nprofit. If they did not, their shareholders would turn on the \nmanagement and oust them and find someone who could make a profit. That \nhappens all the time. That is the nature of capitalism, the nature of \nour free market, and the nature of business.\n\n  We also understand that pharmaceutical companies need to make enough \nmoney so they can invest in future research, to find the next cure, the \nnext drug on which they can make a profit. We want them to do that. Of \ncourse, success in doing that moves us closer to the day when we start \neradicating many of the worrisome diseases Americans face.\n  Having said that--that we are going to concede the profit motive, we \nare going to concede the amount of money needed for research--I think \nthere are still serious questions to be raised about the pharmaceutical \nindustry, particularly when you compare the cost of these drugs in the \nUnited States to the cost of these drugs in other places.\n  There are several people now who live in the border States in the \nnorthern part of our United States who take buses, on a regular basis, \ninto Canada. Senior citizens get on these buses for a daily excursion \nand make a trip across the border to buy prescription drugs.\n  Why would somebody want to leave the United States to go to Canada to \nbuy drugs? Frankly, because the drugs are cheaper. For every dollar \nAmericans spend on prescription drugs, that same drug costs 64 cents \nacross the border--64 percent of what it costs in the United States--in \nEngland, 65 percent; in Italy, 51 percent; in Germany, 71 percent.\n  You ask yourself, are they different drugs? The answer is no; they \nare exactly the same drugs. Exactly the same thing sold in the United \nStates--made by an American company, inspected by the Food and Drug \nAdministration, approved for sale here--when it crosses that invisible \nborder between the United States and Canada becomes a bargain.\n  A lot of these seniors from the northern States in our country have \ndecided to go to Canada to fill their prescriptions to save money.\n  Why in the world would these same drugs cost less in Canada? Frankly, \nbecause the Canadian Government has said to the drug companies that if \nthey want to sell the drugs in Canada, in the national health care \nsystem, they have to reduce the price. They take an average of the \nprice increases around the world and say to the drug companies: This is \nas far as you can go. The same thing happens in Mexico. The same thing \nhappens in virtually every other industrialized country in the world.\n  American drugs--developed in this country, sold to Americans--are \nsold at a fraction of the cost in other countries.\n  Let me say, that is not the only case where the American drug \ncompanies sell at a discount. They sell at a discount to the Federal \nGovernment for the Veterans' Administration, for example, and for the \nIndian Health Service. They bargain with them. The Veterans' \nAdministration, at our hospitals, says to drug companies: If you want \nto sell these drugs, we demand that you give a discount for the \nveterans and thereby save the Federal taxpayers a few dollars. The same \nthing is true with the Indian Health Service.\n  It is also true that insurance companies, HMOs, and managed care \ncompanies bargain, as well. They will go to a drug company and say: If \nyou want your drug to be on the formulary, the list of drugs that can \nbe prescribed by the doctors in our plan, then you have to sell at a \ndiscount to this insurance company and these doctors. Of course, the \ninsurance company makes out well in that decision, and the patient \nstill gets the drugs, and the discount is there.\n\n  There is only one group who cannot bargain. It is the largest group \nin America when it comes to buying drugs--the Medicare beneficiaries. \nFor what is supposed to be a free market system, the only place where \nit is a so-called ``free market'' is when it comes to seniors in \nAmerica.\n  Isn't it ironic that these American drug companies charge the highest \nprices, for the drugs that they sell, to the elderly and disabled in \nour own country? We are a country which, through the National \nInstitutes of Health, has generated research which has led to the \ndiscovery of these drugs. We are a country which, through its Federal \nagencies, such as the FDA, inspects and approves the manufacturing of \nthese drugs to make sure they are of the highest quality. And with all \nof the benefits given to pharmaceutical companies under our Tax Code to \nreduce their tax burden and to increase the profitability of these \ncompanies in America, the one group they target to charge the highest \nprices turns out to be our seniors and our disabled in America. I do \nnot think that is fair. I think it should change.\n  For example, Ciperal is a drug that is used to treat infections. The \nexact same bottle, the exact same pill, the same amount, made in the \nsame manufacturing plant, costs $171 in Canada but costs $399 in the \nUnited States--more than twice as much.\n  What about the drug called Claritin? It is the same company, \nSchering-Plough. The shape of the bottle in which the pills are sold is \ndifferent in Canada as compared to the United States, but it is still \nthe same pill, made in the same facility, subject to the same Federal \ninspection. For a bottle of this pill, Claritin, in Canada, they charge \n$61; in the United States, at your local pharmacy, $218--more than \nthree times the cost of the drug in Canada.\n  The bottom line is this. The rest of the world gets better deals, and \nAmericans pay far more. This is keeping Medicare beneficiaries from \nbeing able to afford prescription drugs. It is just plain unacceptable.\n  If we were to decide this year in Congress to pass a prescription \ndrug benefit under Medicare, I am sure we could devise a system that \nmight work to provide benefits and access to drugs for a lot of seniors \nand disabled people across our country. If we were to create this \nbenefit package and not address the underlying challenge of the \nincrease in prices each year, each month, sometimes each week, and the\n\n[[Page S1190]]\n\ndifferential in prices between the United States and Canada, any \nprescription drug benefit program we devise would be bankrupted in no \ntime flat.\n\n  The Medicare program, as we know, does not include a prescription \ndrug benefit. The reason for this is, of course, when it was enacted in \n1965, prescription drugs just didn't play that large a role in health \ncare. But the world has changed. There are so many drugs now that \nmaintain quality of life for people across America that we couldn't \nhave dreamed up 35 years ago. Isn't it ironic that we don't pay for \nprescription drugs but if a person doesn't take his medicine and gets \nsick and goes into a hospital, Medicare will pay for the \nhospitalization. Wouldn't we want to invest a few pennies in prevention \nrather than spend hundreds of dollars in a cure that might involve some \nhospitalization? It seems obvious to me.\n  Too many seniors find it virtually impossible to comply with their \ndoctor's orders. As we know, they have to make tough choices between \nwhat their doctor tells them is good for them and what they can afford, \na choice no one should have to make. According to a report prepared for \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, three out of four Medicare \nbeneficiaries do not have dependable private drug coverage. Some folks \non Capitol Hill, in the House and Senate, have suggested this isn't \nreally a problem; they believe that many people have prescription drug \ncoverage. They ought to get out of this Capitol Building into the real \nworld.\n  I think what they will find is this: About a third of the people in \nthe United States have exceptionally good drug coverage in their \nretirement. I found a lot of them in Illinois. Some of them are retired \nunion workers and their families. Others have benefited from a great \nplan that takes care of their prescription drugs. They are the \nexception rather than the rule.\n  A third of the people have prescription drug coverage which is anemic \nat best; it barely pays the most basic bills and, of course, with large \nexpenses, provides no relief to the seniors who turn to them.\n  Then a third are on their own. Those are the sorriest stories of all, \nwhere people are faced with actually paying out of pocket for every \nsingle thing they need when it comes to prescription drugs. That tells \nyou, if we rely on the current system without looking to a new benefit, \nwe will leave two-thirds of America behind. Those are the underinsured, \nwhen it comes to prescription drugs, and those who are basically \nuninsured.\n  Incidentally, those who have some sort of prescription drug benefit \nunder HMOs in Illinois tell me over and over again that the copays and \ndeductibles keep going up. Their coverage is virtually evaporating.\n  I met a woman in Chicago, Anita Milton of Morris, IL, who became \ndisabled in 1995 and, in 1996, had a bilateral lung transplant. Her \nprescription drug costs are $2,500 a month. Now on Medicaid, she has to \npay a certain amount each month out of pocket on drugs before she gets \nthe first dollar in coverage. She has an income of $960 a month. That \nis her only income. She pays up to $638 a month out of pocket for the \ndrugs she needs. Somehow she is supposed to survive on $251 a month.\n  For many elderly people in that circumstance, they have little or no \nrecourse but to move in with their children and try to survive. On a \nmonth when her drugs aren't covered, she doesn't meet her spending \nrequirement, so she loses coverage for a full month. In other words, \nshe only receives coverage every other month.\n\n  This story sounds bizarre, but it is not. It is virtually commonplace \nto see in America people who have lived a good life, raised their \nfamilies, contributed so much to this country, paid their taxes, obeyed \nthe laws, and now find themselves captives of a situation they cannot \ncontrol. A pharmacist in Illinois told me what they are faced with--\ntelling seniors the problems of prescription drug costs is really \ndifficult to deal with. A pharmacist, Linda Esposito, came to my \nmeeting in Chicago and said:\n\n       Virtually every day pharmacists are faced with older \n     Americans who have assumed that their medications, the \n     prescription that their physician has written for them, is \n     covered by their supplemental Medicare benefits or Medicare \n     itself. All too often they find the insurance isn't there \n     when they really need it to be there.\n\n  Men and women who want to stay healthy, who want to stay independent, \nand want to stay out of the hospital find they cannot afford the \nmedications to make that happen. That is why it is important we move \nforward with a comprehensive drug benefit to the Medicare program for \nall beneficiaries. America's seniors shouldn't have to pay more than \neveryone else for prescription drugs. As I have heard from Illinois \nsenior citizens, prescription drug coverage offers a lifeline to them \nand not a poison bill. Congress must work to offer our seniors this \nlifeline this year.\n  The record of this Congress over the last several years has been \nscant, to say the least. There is just very little we even take \nseriously around here and consider by way of addressing problems that \nAmerican families face.\n  It has been a frustration to me, as a Senator from the State of \nIllinois, to go home repeatedly and hear the people I represent raise \nissues they are concerned with, issues about education, what are we \ngoing to do in Washington to help improve schools in America. A bill we \npassed last week will have virtually no impact whatsoever on education \nin this country. We have not addressed the most basic requirements to \nmake sure our teachers are well trained and qualified to teach, held \naccountable for their own standards in their classroom; that kids are \nheld accountable to make certain when they graduate, they can be \npromoted to another grade and succeed rather than just be pushed along; \nto try to upgrade and modernize the schools our kids attend so they can \ndeal with modern technology. Has this Congress done anything to address \nthat over the last 3 years? Sadly, the answer is no.\n  The President has proposed these things. This Congress has ignored \nthem.\n  On the issue of health care, whether it is prescription drugs or a \nPatient's Bill of Rights, I am afraid the drug companies and the \ninsurance companies have really ruled the agenda. We are trying our \nbest to move this issue to the forefront, and those forces are trying \ntheir best to keep it out.\n  On the issue of peace and tranquility in our communities, we find \npeople asking whether this Congress can respond with sensible gun \ncontrol. The honest answer is, it is not likely. The President is \nholding a summit this week--I am glad he is--bringing in the leaders \nfrom Congress and challenging them to look anew at this issue of gun \ncontrol.\n\n  When we have reached the point in America where first graders are \nkilling other first graders with guns, we are dealing with a gun \ncrisis. For those who blithely say we have all the laws we need, there \nis not an idea we should consider, we have everything taken care of, \npick up any morning paper and tell me we have everything taken care of. \nI don't believe that is the case at all.\n  On issue after issue, whether it is education, health care, or \nsensible gun control, this Congress sits on its hands. The people \nacross America ask of us, the world's so-called greatest deliberative \nbody, when are you going to deliberate? What are you going to do? \nSadly, the answer for the last 3 years is little or nothing.\n  I think that is what elections are all about. This coming election in \nNovember, the people across America can really issue their own report \ncard on this do-nothing Congress. They can take a look back and see at \nthe end of our work this calendar year what we have achieved. If we \nleave town without addressing the needs of education, if we leave town \nwithout creating a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, if we \nleave town without increasing the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to \nsomething that is more humane and more livable, if we don't do anything \nto cope with the health care crisis that has been generated because of \nHMOs and managed care, if we don't do something about sensible gun \ncontrol, this Congress will rightly deserve a failing grade.\n  I think it is important we try to come together. For those who say \nthere is no intention on this side of the aisle, the Democratic side, \nto really find solutions, I think the challenge is on the table to come \nforward and try\n\n[[Page S1191]]\n\non a bipartisan basis. I will be there, and I think many on my side \nwill as well, to make certain this Congress adjourns this year with not \nonly a record of accomplishment but a record of response for American \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/06/senate-section/article/S1191-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
